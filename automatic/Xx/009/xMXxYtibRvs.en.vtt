00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.710 

we're<00:00:45.430> over<00:00:45.580> stand<00:00:45.880> up<00:00:46.000> on<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.360> back<00:00:46.450> plate

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
we're over stand up on the back plate

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.500 
we're over stand up on the back plate
itself<00:00:47.080> will<00:00:48.070> provide<00:00:48.370> pressure<00:00:48.700> on<00:00:49.240> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.340 

with<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.180> back<00:00:55.330> plate<00:00:55.480> in<00:00:55.660> place<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:56.050> can<00:00:56.200> see

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
with the back plate in place you can see

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.280 
with the back plate in place you can see
we've<00:00:56.470> got<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.740> four<00:00:56.920> bolts<00:00:57.160> coming<00:00:57.910> through

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
we've got the four bolts coming through

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.150 
we've got the four bolts coming through
the<00:00:59.290> motherboard<00:00:59.710> into<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.460> main<00:01:00.700> chamber

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the motherboard into the main chamber

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.420 
the motherboard into the main chamber
we're<00:01:03.160> then<00:01:03.340> gonna<00:01:03.400> put<00:01:03.670> four<00:01:05.430> rubber

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
we're then gonna put four rubber

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:27.700 
we're then gonna put four rubber
standoffs<00:01:11.370> onto<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.430> bolts

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.340 

and<00:01:28.710> onto<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.610> we're<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> put<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and onto there we're going to put the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
and onto there we're going to put the
rails<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:31.830> very<00:01:32.130> important<00:01:32.550> it<00:01:32.670> does<00:01:32.880> picture

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
rails now very important it does picture

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.360 
rails now very important it does picture
in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.260> manual<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:36.230> bolt<00:01:37.230> pattern<00:01:37.440> will<00:01:38.040> face

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
in the manual the bolt pattern will face

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.090 
in the manual the bolt pattern will face
it<00:01:39.060> pinched<00:01:39.510> in<00:01:39.690> towards<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> CPU

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it pinched in towards the CPU

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730 
it pinched in towards the CPU
there<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.520> also<00:01:41.700> arrows<00:01:42.300> which<00:01:43.290> will<00:01:43.500> point

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
there are also arrows which will point

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160 
there are also arrows which will point
in<00:01:43.979> towards<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.370> CPU<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.630> mentioned<00:01:46.080> in

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
in towards the CPU it's not mentioned in

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
in towards the CPU it's not mentioned in
the<00:01:46.260> instruction<00:01:46.740> manual<00:01:47.160> but<00:01:47.580> it<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the instruction manual but it is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
the instruction manual but it is
pictured<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:48.810> very<00:01:49.320> important<00:01:49.680> these

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
pictured this way very important these

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100 
pictured this way very important these
are<00:01:49.830> not<00:01:50.160> asymmetrical<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.120> they<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.750> need<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
are not asymmetrical so they do need to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
are not asymmetrical so they do need to
go<00:01:52.260> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.460> correct<00:01:53.760> orientation<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:58.040> put<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
go in the correct orientation and put it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.660 
go in the correct orientation and put it
into<00:01:59.310> place<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:01.009> two<00:02:02.009> thumb<00:02:02.220> screws<00:02:02.250> will

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
into place and two thumb screws will

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:14.060 
into place and two thumb screws will
hold<00:02:02.700> each<00:02:02.940> one<00:02:03.150> down<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.830> want<00:02:13.920> to

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
hold each one down and you want to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.530 
hold each one down and you want to
tighten<00:02:14.310> these<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:15.860> obviously<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:18.270> don't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
tighten these up obviously but you don't

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.790 
tighten these up obviously but you don't
want<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.750> over<00:02:18.989> tighten<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.410> our<00:02:19.530> thumb

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
want to over tighten the our thumb

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:29.080 
want to over tighten the our thumb
screws<00:02:20.100> no<00:02:20.880> tools<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:23.580> want<00:02:23.910> them<00:02:24.030> snug

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.190 

they<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.269> need<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.570> be<00:02:30.660> tightened<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
they don't need to be tightened to the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.180 
they don't need to be tightened to the
point<00:02:31.500> where<00:02:31.590> you're<00:02:31.680> gonna<00:02:31.769> crack<00:02:32.040> your

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
point where you're gonna crack your

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.479 
point where you're gonna crack your
motherboard<00:02:32.610> or<00:02:32.700> anything<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.090> nature

and<00:02:35.489> then<00:02:36.209> repeat<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.630> top<00:02:36.870> again<00:02:37.130> opposite

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and then repeat up top again opposite

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.830 
and then repeat up top again opposite

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:07.210 

and<00:02:59.030> again<00:02:59.330> I'm<00:02:59.510> with<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.750> thumb<00:02:59.930> screws<00:03:06.220> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
and again I'm with the thumb screws and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.140 
and again I'm with the thumb screws and
tighten<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.730> into<00:03:07.970> place<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.790> mounting

and<00:04:09.010> we'll<00:04:09.310> just<00:04:09.460> need<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.730> tighten<00:04:10.890> two

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
and we'll just need to tighten two

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:20.360 
and we'll just need to tighten two
screws<00:04:12.190> on<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.430> crossbar<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:16.630> hold<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:17.049> down
