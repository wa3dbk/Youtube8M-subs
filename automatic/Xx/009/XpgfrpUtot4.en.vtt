00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380
 Create Service Even if you still visit Gyeongbok Palace, 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.020
 U 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:14.440
 Right bra small garden on the side of Senator dug ponds so via a lioness 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:20.439
 The person who built the church and built Amisha 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:24.520
 So under the local breeder we also zygomatic these servants any political vehicle that 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 And that there is a quasi-political vehicle 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.710
 That's an interesting fact. 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.370
 U 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.949
 U 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:47.030
 There is sulfur coming from their ruined that no definitive figures can gogeol others are eocha 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:52.940
 The others so far and Wu Min's brother's home country are memes mojil this mission is muhyul 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:59.210
 There were brothers after all this there is no court consort kin ah spent Guiyang 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:03.850
 It is because in this strengthening of the kingship, 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:10.880
 I believe that the installation is almost impossible to tolerate. 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:15.860
 So , politically, we have done it, so in the end, 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.840
 Do you want to truly charismatic Tae Tae, because when this would be as follows 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:25.130
 These forces, who can make their feet, 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:32.440
 As a result, it is evident in the nomination of successors 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:37.159
 Tae is now beginning to have a joke at first, which is the successor to his sentencing 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:43.069
 1414 After the year, the name of the lie was when the large army was 11 years old . 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:46.190
 So, from the point of view, the country of the Joseon was originally the principle of Jangja Samsung 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:50.599
 It's true, but I have not kept it from before. 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:55.310
 From the time when King Taejo was the youngest starting with a King Taejo progress that the youngest heir to the I 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:02:02.209
 He became the second brother, but he is not the fifth , so in his time 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:06.920
 Many still judged to be the successor to another party jeokjang matgetda 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:13.790
 Fortunately , I had four sons with Jang- kyung Oh-gomin. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:19.160
 It is the first time in the world, 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:24.000
 The second son was just three sentences reveal any army 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:29.280
 400 As 1000 came as a result four 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.220
 In the year 10 18 184 , a certain Yangming great army named as successor in 1404 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:39.330
 That's what happens in 14 years when you're kicked out of a taxi's seat. 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.350
 The sudden willingness of Tae's hiding in the lift 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.580
 Is not suitable and the sentencing part of Daegu 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.820
 After all, even after naming him as a successor to Chongnyeong 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:56.910
 This looks very important, too. 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:03:01.470
 As a successor to three species in the life of his own life 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:06.690
 So the successor will be in position. So when King Taejong lived, 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.590
 This is a very rare occurrence in the Royal Survey. 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.110
 Did not you? 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.510
 Taejo is gonna which was the situation after situation pushed state their willingness and have dropped out regardless 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:21.330
 Jong has his will 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.800
 I will raise three kinds of King's Home Traction place while the situation 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.310
 Do not do this . 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:34.560
 I think that the idea is a bit of a stumbling block to all the elements 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:40.680
 I will I will defend the identity neoleo Write only the strength is stronger this message 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:46.799
 Sejong could be the best element of Korea 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:51.930
 From this perspective, the source would be a very wise choice Taiji this is the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:57.480
 The choice was not the best choice in the Joseon dynasty history 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:03.000
 He's just based on principles and he's been ordered to be a marginal and a successor. 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:09.930
 I really like it. Could the ark be settled so quickly? 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:16.079
 Daejong Doni, but the villain responsible for the tremendous power of the Godson then finally select the most 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:22.140
 Wise and by giving you the ability to inherit the throne to his son, Sim Korea 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:27.090
 The dynasty was solidly built, so I was really going to provide the foundation. 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:30.660
 Daejung was a king who was very inept . 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.380
 One last thing I would like to introduce to you this time is the interesting story. 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:40.170
 The last thing I said was a killer instinct. Give me a killer instinct. 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:43.740
 Galdo really good writing was well written hwaldo shoot well hunting again like that yeah 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:49.110
 Taejong goes out for hunting one day and talks down. 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:53.160
 When we look at it, we can see that the Joseon Dynasty is very important. 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:57.570
 Now World Record Heritage is a World Record Heritage Many 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.950
 King's record is that just about every every move by saying that the decline 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.560
 I fall. 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:09.720
 The two officers to the Military Academy as the people who write the annals 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:14.880
 We went to go to the 2 specs because we got married. 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:18.360
 I have a character that I have. 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:24.120
 I wrote that you did not write. 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:29.190
 So, the public has recorded this case in Daesong-ro during the second time . 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.440
 It'll contain very Saturday that its Tae This is another with a strong charisma 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:37.230
 One day, though cautiously 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.250
 By showing a very naengcheolham in the selection of a successor who led the heyday of shipbuilding 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.780
 then 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.390
 If the point was stepped stone with this in mind, we understand daejong 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:51.180
 I think it's very good. 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:57.600
 And next time, Sejong, who was appointed as successor to Lee Tae- jong, 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:59.880
 Going to a compaction multilateral success as a shipbuilding location of the maximum and mean 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.700
 I also meet my father's expectations. 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:11.400
 If we look at it more broadly than in the history of Korean history, 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:12.610
 I will be comforted by Sejong Sire, who gave me such a great honor. 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.610
 Yes 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.610
 U 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:33.289
 I will 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:33.289
 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.380
 U 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.370
 U 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.370
 U 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.800
 Ah
