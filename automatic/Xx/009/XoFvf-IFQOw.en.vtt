probably I'll be honest the most boring
part<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> build<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.660> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
part of the build which is just this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.540 
part of the build which is just this
little<00:00:33.989> storage<00:00:34.320> said<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.430> it

but<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> inside<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.940> nothing

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
but the inside of this it's just nothing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.030 
but the inside of this it's just nothing
too<00:00:39.390> fancy<00:00:39.600> nothing<00:00:39.960> too<00:00:40.140> special<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> did

just a little bit so that's looking a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
just a little bit so that's looking a
lot<00:00:56.219> better<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.629> other<00:00:57.750> things<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.170> did

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.050 
them some space to do his work and then
a<00:01:25.619> chest<00:01:25.950> where<00:01:26.130> he's<00:01:26.250> gonna<00:01:26.369> store<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a chest where he's gonna store some of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
a chest where he's gonna store some of
his<00:01:27.240> most<00:01:27.420> recent<00:01:27.570> creations<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
his most recent creations and then of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.580 
his most recent creations and then of
course<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.000> anvil<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.110> which

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
course the little anvil right here which

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.560 
course the little anvil right here which
kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.040> fits<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> whole<00:01:32.759> mood<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.509> we

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
kind of just fits the whole mood now we

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440 
kind of just fits the whole mood now we
will<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.079> ahead<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.290> fly<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.710> inside<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> when

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
will go ahead and fly on inside so when

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
will go ahead and fly on inside so when
you<00:01:36.540> first<00:01:36.780> enter<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.470> sort<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> two

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you first enter you have sort of two

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.550 
you first enter you have sort of two
options<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.210> go<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> take<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
options one is to actually go and take a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
options one is to actually go and take a
look<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> shop<00:01:41.400> area<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.970> second<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.360> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
look at the shop area the second one is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
look at the shop area the second one is
to<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.720> upstairs<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.530> gonna<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.740> saved

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
to go upstairs but that's gonna be saved

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
to go upstairs but that's gonna be saved
for<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.729> bit<00:01:44.850> later<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.090> over<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.659> what

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
for a little bit later so over here what

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.899 
for a little bit later so over here what
we<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.829> little<00:01:47.100> front<00:01:47.250> desk<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
we have is this little front desk and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.330 
we have is this little front desk and
this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.329> made<00:01:48.720> out<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.590> stone<00:01:50.009> bricks

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
this is made out of the stone bricks

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
this is made out of the stone bricks
with<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.420> bit<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.810> different

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
with just a little bit of a different

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.359 
with just a little bit of a different
look<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.070> these<00:01:53.220> are

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
look to it so as you can see these are

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
look to it so as you can see these are
the<00:01:53.430> normal<00:01:53.579> ones<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.810> find

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the normal ones but this one I just find

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
the normal ones but this one I just find
it's<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.680> little<00:01:55.920> bit<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.280> cleaner<00:01:56.549> look

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it's got a little bit of a cleaner look

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.819 
it's got a little bit of a cleaner look
and<00:01:56.880> has<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> nicer<00:01:57.479> top<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.799> of

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and has a nicer top to it and it kind of

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.649 
and has a nicer top to it and it kind of
lets<00:01:59.009> us<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.340> what's<00:01:59.520> actually<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.450> bit

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
lets us see what's actually on it a bit

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
lets us see what's actually on it a bit
better<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.469> I'd<00:02:01.649> imagine<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
better so right here I'd imagine that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130 
better so right here I'd imagine that
this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.969> little<00:02:03.600> cup<00:02:03.810> full<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this is gonna be a little cup full of

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.959 
this is gonna be a little cup full of
ink<00:02:04.350> which<00:02:04.530> he<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> stick<00:02:04.979> his<00:02:05.100> Quillen<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
ink which he can stick his Quillen to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.940 
ink which he can stick his Quillen to
right<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.360> his<00:02:06.509> log<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.110> sails<00:02:07.380> which<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.829> what

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
right in his log of sails which is what

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.469 
right in his log of sails which is what
this<00:02:08.069> thing<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.399> right<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.270> think

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
this thing is right here and I think

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
this thing is right here and I think
this<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.289> different<00:02:10.649> texture<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
this one is a different texture for the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.760 
this one is a different texture for the
pressure<00:02:11.700> plate<00:02:12.000> which<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
pressure plate which is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.320 
pressure plate which is
cool<00:02:13.040> cousin<00:02:13.310> default<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.850> still<00:02:14.060> looks<00:02:14.270> like

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
cool cousin default it still looks like

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.780 
cool cousin default it still looks like
something<00:02:14.690> useful<00:02:15.050> now<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.070> make<00:02:16.430> things<00:02:16.640> a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
something useful now to make things a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.550 
something useful now to make things a
bit<00:02:16.820> more<00:02:17.000> realistic<00:02:17.480> behind<00:02:18.020> here<00:02:18.260> we<00:02:18.350> do

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
bit more realistic behind here we do

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.440 
bit more realistic behind here we do
have<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.890> logs<00:02:19.190> they're<00:02:19.820> gonna<00:02:19.910> be<00:02:20.120> powering

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
have the logs they're gonna be powering

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.990 
have the logs they're gonna be powering
the<00:02:20.630> fire<00:02:21.160> unfortunately<00:02:22.160> these<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.700> just

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
the fire unfortunately these are just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.400 
the fire unfortunately these are just
the<00:02:23.150> oak<00:02:23.420> wood<00:02:23.570> planks<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.080> default

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
the oak wood planks in the default

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.020 
the oak wood planks in the default
texture<00:02:24.680> back<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.040> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.340> wish<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.670> maker

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
texture back I kind of wish the maker

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.240 
texture back I kind of wish the maker
would<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:26.840> maybe<00:02:26.990> made<00:02:27.260> them<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.710> oak<00:02:28.100> wood

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
would have maybe made them the oak wood

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.160 
would have maybe made them the oak wood
logs<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.880> way<00:02:29.030> as<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:29.900> no<00:02:30.020> matter

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
logs that way as you can see no matter

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.990 
logs that way as you can see no matter
which<00:02:30.380> way<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> face<00:02:31.070> these<00:02:31.310> are<00:02:31.370> still<00:02:31.880> gonna

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
which way I face these are still gonna

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.520 
which way I face these are still gonna
point<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> same<00:02:32.510> way<00:02:32.690> whereas<00:02:32.990> if<00:02:33.260> they<00:02:33.470> were

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
point the same way whereas if they were

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.350 
point the same way whereas if they were
logged<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:34.160> could<00:02:34.730> kind<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.060> get<00:02:35.240> them<00:02:35.330> going

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
logged you could kind of get them going

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.670 
logged you could kind of get them going
in<00:02:35.660> different<00:02:35.780> directions<00:02:36.170> like<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.560> which

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
in different directions like that which

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.750 
in different directions like that which
would<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:36.920> been<00:02:36.980> cool<00:02:37.220> but<00:02:37.460> these<00:02:37.520> are<00:02:37.670> still

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
would have been cool but these are still

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.640 
would have been cool but these are still
awesome<00:02:38.300> as<00:02:38.450> they<00:02:38.630> are<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.050> over<00:02:39.230> here<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
awesome as they are so over here on the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.710 
awesome as they are so over here on the
main<00:02:39.920> wall<00:02:40.580> we<00:02:40.820> do<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:41.300> big<00:02:41.510> giant

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
main wall we do have this big giant

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.210 
main wall we do have this big giant
fireplace<00:02:42.260> which<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:42.680> probably<00:02:42.860> use<00:02:43.100> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
fireplace which you can probably use to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.950 
fireplace which you can probably use to
craft<00:02:43.460> some<00:02:43.610> stuff<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.570> desires

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
craft some stuff if it really desires

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.930 
craft some stuff if it really desires
and<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.980> kind<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.160> make<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.400> floor<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> lot

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and just to kind of make the floor a lot

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.580 
and just to kind of make the floor a lot
more<00:02:47.120> detailed<00:02:47.540> one<00:02:47.810> awesome<00:02:48.260> thing<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.500> can

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
more detailed one awesome thing you can

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.050 
more detailed one awesome thing you can
always<00:02:48.710> do<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.070> throw<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:49.370> some<00:02:49.490> carpets<00:02:49.880> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
always do is throw in some carpets and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.090 
always do is throw in some carpets and
as<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.660> can<00:02:50.750> see<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.930> do<00:02:51.050> have<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> lot<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.890> those

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
as you can see I do have a lot of those

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.710 
as you can see I do have a lot of those
now<00:02:52.370> back<00:02:52.640> here<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.150> really<00:02:53.480> quick<00:02:53.600> before

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
now back here and really quick before

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.510 
now back here and really quick before
you<00:02:53.930> can<00:02:54.050> get<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.590> did<00:02:55.130> try<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.310> do

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
you can get to this I did try to do

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.190 
you can get to this I did try to do
something<00:02:55.790> which<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.210> kind<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.900> kind<00:02:57.140> of

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
something which I kind of like I kind of

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.020 
something which I kind of like I kind of
don't<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.620> just<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:58.010> don't<00:02:58.400> know<00:02:58.670> if<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.880> fits

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
don't it just I don't know if it fits

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.220 
don't it just I don't know if it fits
well<00:02:59.240> or<00:02:59.360> not<00:02:59.510> where<00:02:59.630> we<00:02:59.720> have<00:02:59.870> some<00:03:00.020> notes

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
well or not where we have some notes

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.600 
well or not where we have some notes
that<00:03:00.410> maybe<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.650> could<00:03:00.770> just<00:03:00.890> leave<00:03:01.340> there<00:03:01.580> I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
that maybe you could just leave there I

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.090 
that maybe you could just leave there I
think<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.900> book<00:03:03.110> might<00:03:03.320> be<00:03:03.350> enough<00:03:03.710> so

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
think the the book might be enough so

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.530 
think the the book might be enough so
this<00:03:04.280> isn't<00:03:04.460> really<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.760> necessary<00:03:04.940> thing<00:03:05.420> but

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
this isn't really a necessary thing but

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.390 
this isn't really a necessary thing but
it<00:03:05.630> does<00:03:05.810> add<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.080> little<00:03:06.230> bit<00:03:06.440> more<00:03:06.470> detail<00:03:06.950> if

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
it does add a little bit more detail if

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.970 
it does add a little bit more detail if
you<00:03:07.460> are<00:03:07.730> lacking<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.500> cover<00:03:09.830> up

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
you are lacking on that now to cover up

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.680 
you are lacking on that now to cover up
this<00:03:10.100> wall<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.430> did<00:03:10.640> add<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> flag<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.600> then

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
this wall we did add a flag and then

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.240 
this wall we did add a flag and then
over<00:03:11.900> here<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.200> back<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.560> just<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.920> lot<00:03:13.130> of

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
over here on the back is just a lot of

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.220 
over here on the back is just a lot of
storage<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.240> lot<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.420> cool<00:03:14.630> stuff<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.140> right

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
storage and a lot of cool stuff so right

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.270 
storage and a lot of cool stuff so right
here<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.650> course<00:03:15.860> if<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.070> are<00:03:16.190> in

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
here of course if you are in

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.770 
here of course if you are in
one-point-eight<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:17.000> would<00:03:17.240> definitely

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
one-point-eight I would definitely

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.110 
one-point-eight I would definitely
recommend<00:03:17.959> just<00:03:18.890> using<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.430> what<00:03:19.940> does<00:03:20.000> it

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
recommend just using the what does it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.070 
recommend just using the what does it
call<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:20.330> armor<00:03:20.660> stand

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
call the armor stand

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.740 
call the armor stand
unfortunately<00:03:21.709> I'm<00:03:21.860> kind<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.130> stuck<00:03:22.370> in

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
unfortunately I'm kind of stuck in

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.090 
unfortunately I'm kind of stuck in
one-point-seven<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.500> one<00:03:24.620> good<00:03:24.770> thing<00:03:24.800> about

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
one-point-seven but one good thing about

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.890 
one-point-seven but one good thing about
it<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.550> does<00:03:25.700> allow<00:03:25.970> me<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.390> get<00:03:26.510> these<00:03:26.630> cool

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
it is it does allow me to get these cool

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.690 
it is it does allow me to get these cool
other<00:03:27.170> textures<00:03:27.620> where<00:03:27.800> as<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.010> can<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.280> if

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
other textures where as you can see if

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.160 
other textures where as you can see if
you<00:03:28.970> didn't<00:03:29.180> have<00:03:29.270> this<00:03:29.420> they<00:03:29.600> are<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.990> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
you didn't have this they are just the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.080 
you didn't have this they are just the
iron<00:03:30.350> bars<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:31.010> over<00:03:31.220> here<00:03:31.459> we<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.700> some

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
iron bars so over here we have some

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.420 
iron bars so over here we have some
weapons<00:03:32.270> in<00:03:32.690> some<00:03:33.380> crates<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.800> whatnot

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
weapons in some crates and whatnot

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.740 
weapons in some crates and whatnot
same<00:03:34.850> thing<00:03:35.000> with<00:03:35.090> over<00:03:35.270> here<00:03:35.420> in<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.570> left

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
same thing with over here in this left

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.210 
same thing with over here in this left
corner<00:03:36.020> I<00:03:36.050> think<00:03:36.260> these<00:03:36.440> what<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.890> hell<00:03:37.040> is

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
corner I think these what the hell is

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.600 
corner I think these what the hell is
that

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
that

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.190 
that
that<00:03:38.030> must<00:03:38.209> be<00:03:38.270> some<00:03:38.510> sort<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.720> sword<00:03:39.020> or

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that must be some sort of sword or

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.980 
that must be some sort of sword or
something<00:03:39.410> but<00:03:39.650> these<00:03:39.770> as<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:40.520> can<00:03:40.640> tell<00:03:40.790> our

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
something but these as you can tell our

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.850 
something but these as you can tell our
swords<00:03:41.990> I'm<00:03:42.080> not<00:03:42.170> even<00:03:42.410> sure<00:03:42.560> what<00:03:42.709> these<00:03:42.800> are

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
swords I'm not even sure what these are

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.380 
swords I'm not even sure what these are
maybe<00:03:43.490> there's<00:03:43.730> some<00:03:43.820> sort<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.030> axe

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
maybe there's some sort of axe

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.060 
maybe there's some sort of axe
I<00:03:44.570> don't<00:03:45.200> know<00:03:45.260> but<00:03:45.410> over<00:03:45.560> here<00:03:45.709> just<00:03:45.860> to<00:03:45.980> get

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
I don't know but over here just to get

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.310 
I don't know but over here just to get
to<00:03:46.190> take<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.430> place<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.200> what's<00:03:48.200> it

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
to take the place of the what's it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.750 
to take the place of the what's it
called<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.620> armor<00:03:49.310> stand<00:03:49.520> they<00:03:49.610> keep

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
called the armor stand they keep

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.880 
called the armor stand they keep
forgetting<00:03:50.150> we<00:03:51.020> do<00:03:51.200> have<00:03:51.350> this<00:03:51.500> thing<00:03:51.709> which

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
forgetting we do have this thing which

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.890 
forgetting we do have this thing which
if<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:52.250> can't<00:03:52.490> get<00:03:52.640> 1.8<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.330> is<00:03:53.480> about<00:03:53.720> as

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
if you can't get 1.8 this is about as

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.850 
if you can't get 1.8 this is about as
good<00:03:53.930> as<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.590> gets

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
good as it gets

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.710 
good as it gets
still<00:03:55.310> looks<00:03:55.490> decent<00:03:55.730> but<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.330> know<00:03:56.450> not<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
still looks decent but you know not the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.770 
still looks decent but you know not the
best<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.320> then<00:03:58.070> I<00:03:58.100> think<00:03:58.550> this<00:03:58.820> is<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.300> for<00:03:59.600> the

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
best and then I think this is it for the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.390 
best and then I think this is it for the
first<00:04:00.080> floor<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:00.380> we'll<00:04:00.709> go<00:04:00.830> ahead<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:01.070> make

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
first floor so we'll go ahead and make

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.790 
first floor so we'll go ahead and make
our<00:04:01.430> way<00:04:01.730> up<00:04:01.910> now<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.690> blacksmith<00:04:03.350> probably

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
our way up now a blacksmith probably

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.930 
our way up now a blacksmith probably
would<00:04:03.890> have<00:04:03.950> been<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.250> highly<00:04:04.490> desired

profession<00:04:05.540> back<00:04:05.720> then<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.470> probably<00:04:06.709> would

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
profession back then and probably would

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.800 
profession back then and probably would
have<00:04:07.100> given<00:04:07.280> him<00:04:07.490> enough<00:04:07.760> money<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:08.209> afford<00:04:08.420> a

or<00:04:25.650> sort<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.690> storage<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:28.080> we<00:04:28.110> have<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.530> chest

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
or sort of storage so we have this chest

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.860 
or sort of storage so we have this chest
on<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.160> edge<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.820> bed<00:04:30.120> some<00:04:30.510> crafting

of<00:04:32.910> Spears<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.020> swords<00:04:34.080> actually<00:04:34.919> now<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.220> I

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
of Spears and swords actually now that I

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.840 
of Spears and swords actually now that I
think<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.550> it

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
think of it

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.520 
think of it
these<00:04:36.419> aren't<00:04:36.570> Spears<00:04:36.930> are<00:04:37.110> they<00:04:37.260> they<00:04:37.410> almost

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
these aren't Spears are they they almost

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.320 
these aren't Spears are they they almost
look<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.010> back<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:38.430> an<00:04:38.520> arrow<00:04:38.760> where<00:04:39.270> all

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
look like the back of an arrow where all

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.750 
look like the back of an arrow where all
the<00:04:39.450> feathers<00:04:39.720> are<00:04:39.900> see<00:04:40.860> how<00:04:40.919> we<00:04:40.980> have<00:04:41.220> that<00:04:41.490> I

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
the feathers are see how we have that I

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.030 
the feathers are see how we have that I
did<00:04:42.240> clean<00:04:42.510> up<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.750> roof<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.200> lot<00:04:43.410> more<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:43.919> it

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
did clean up the roof a lot more so it

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.120 
did clean up the roof a lot more so it
definitely<00:04:44.490> has<00:04:44.669> a<00:04:44.700> cooler<00:04:45.150> look<00:04:45.800> nothing<00:04:46.800> too

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
definitely has a cooler look nothing too

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.070 
definitely has a cooler look nothing too
crazy<00:04:47.430> but<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.030> still<00:04:48.300> gives<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.840> lot<00:04:49.020> more

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
crazy but it still gives it a lot more

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.860 
crazy but it still gives it a lot more
detail<00:04:49.650> as<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.310> can<00:04:50.460> see<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:50.880> then<00:04:51.510> we<00:04:51.720> also

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
detail as you can see and then we also

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.659 
detail as you can see and then we also
have<00:04:52.169> this<00:04:52.380> just<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.800> kind<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:52.980> make<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.460> no

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
have this just to kind of make it so no

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.490 
have this just to kind of make it so no
one<00:04:53.790> falls<00:04:54.000> off<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.330> edge<00:04:54.450> there<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:55.350> also

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
one falls off the edge there and we also

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.760 
one falls off the edge there and we also
did<00:04:55.860> add<00:04:56.070> some<00:04:56.100> decorations<00:04:57.030> on<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:58.740> I

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
did add some decorations on that so I

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.620 
did add some decorations on that so I
think<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.310> all<00:04:59.520> for<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.970> interior<00:05:00.600> of

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
think this is all for the interior of

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.750 
think this is all for the interior of
the<00:05:00.990> blacksmith<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:02.220> we'll<00:05:02.340> go<00:05:02.460> ahead<00:05:02.610> and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
the blacksmith so we'll go ahead and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.010 
the blacksmith so we'll go ahead and
check<00:05:02.880> out<00:05:03.060> some<00:05:03.180> other<00:05:03.270> stuff<00:05:03.389> we've<00:05:03.780> been

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
check out some other stuff we've been

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.409 
check out some other stuff we've been
working<00:05:04.440> on<00:05:04.530> so<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.130> guys<00:05:05.430> may<00:05:05.940> or<00:05:06.210> may<00:05:06.389> not

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
working on so you guys may or may not

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.150 
working on so you guys may or may not
have<00:05:06.810> seen<00:05:07.020> some<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.440> this<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.889> past

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
have seen some of this in the past

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.950 
have seen some of this in the past
tutorials<00:05:08.760> or<00:05:08.910> maybe<00:05:09.060> cut<00:05:09.270> some<00:05:09.450> glimpses<00:05:09.930> of

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
tutorials or maybe cut some glimpses of

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.230 
tutorials or maybe cut some glimpses of
it<00:05:10.169> but<00:05:10.889> right<00:05:11.010> here<00:05:11.040> we<00:05:11.310> do<00:05:11.550> have<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.820> really

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
it but right here we do have a really

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.120 
it but right here we do have a really
defensive<00:05:12.660> functional<00:05:13.500> piece<00:05:13.710> right<00:05:13.889> here

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
defensive functional piece right here

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.560 
defensive functional piece right here
because<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.610> can<00:05:14.820> see<00:05:14.850> if<00:05:15.090> there's<00:05:15.240> a<00:05:15.300> large

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
because you can see if there's a large

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.360 
because you can see if there's a large
army<00:05:16.020> attacking<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.560> would<00:05:16.650> only<00:05:16.770> take<00:05:16.889> a<00:05:17.100> few

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
army attacking it would only take a few

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.800 
army attacking it would only take a few
guys<00:05:17.580> on<00:05:17.790> this<00:05:17.910> side<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.240> hold<00:05:18.389> them<00:05:18.540> off

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
guys on this side to hold them off

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.690 
guys on this side to hold them off
just<00:05:19.290> because<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:19.680> sort<00:05:19.889> of<00:05:19.979> bridge<00:05:20.250> creates

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
just because this sort of bridge creates

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.640 
just because this sort of bridge creates
a<00:05:20.850> nice<00:05:21.060> fatal<00:05:21.510> funnel<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:22.050> makes<00:05:22.260> it<00:05:22.440> so

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
a nice fatal funnel and makes it so

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.500 
a nice fatal funnel and makes it so
whoever's<00:05:22.979> defending<00:05:23.460> here<00:05:23.669> would<00:05:24.120> only<00:05:24.150> have

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
whoever's defending here would only have

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.450 
whoever's defending here would only have
to<00:05:24.630> fight<00:05:25.110> off<00:05:25.290> a<00:05:25.320> few<00:05:25.620> guys<00:05:25.770> at<00:05:25.950> once<00:05:26.100> plus<00:05:26.340> you

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
to fight off a few guys at once plus you

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.680 
to fight off a few guys at once plus you
could<00:05:26.580> have<00:05:26.700> a<00:05:26.729> lot<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:26.940> people<00:05:27.090> in<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.450> tower

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
could have a lot of people in the tower

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.290 
could have a lot of people in the tower
or<00:05:28.050> in<00:05:28.560> some<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.830> these<00:05:28.919> little<00:05:29.250> defensive<00:05:30.060> I

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
or in some of these little defensive I

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.550 
or in some of these little defensive I
don't<00:05:30.570> know<00:05:30.630> what<00:05:30.780> you'd<00:05:30.900> call<00:05:30.930> these<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.410> guess

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
don't know what you'd call these I guess

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.250 
don't know what you'd call these I guess
these<00:05:31.650> are<00:05:31.830> towers<00:05:32.100> as<00:05:32.220> well<00:05:32.400> but<00:05:33.090> my<00:05:33.870> theory

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
these are towers as well but my theory

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.570 
these are towers as well but my theory
behind<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:34.800> room<00:05:35.010> I<00:05:35.100> guess<00:05:35.250> kind<00:05:35.460> of<00:05:35.520> the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
behind this room I guess kind of the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.279 
behind this room I guess kind of the
Lord<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.150> have<00:05:36.330> right<00:05:36.510> now<00:05:36.539> is<00:05:36.870> this<00:05:37.140> is

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
Lord that I have right now is this is

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.370 
Lord that I have right now is this is
either<00:05:37.470> gonna<00:05:37.680> be<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:38.160> whole<00:05:38.970> city<00:05:39.240> in<00:05:39.539> either<00:05:40.200> a

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
either gonna be a whole city in either a

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.040 
either gonna be a whole city in either a
time<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.890> war<00:05:41.100> or<00:05:41.310> maybe<00:05:41.460> just<00:05:41.760> after<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.840> war

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
time of war or maybe just after the war

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.600 
time of war or maybe just after the war
because<00:05:43.200> as<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.560> can<00:05:43.680> see<00:05:43.860> this<00:05:44.070> tower<00:05:44.310> here

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
because as you can see this tower here

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.490 
because as you can see this tower here
is<00:05:44.669> a<00:05:44.700> little<00:05:45.000> bit<00:05:45.090> broken<00:05:45.270> down<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:46.229> lot<00:05:46.440> of

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
is a little bit broken down and a lot of

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.430 
is a little bit broken down and a lot of
the<00:05:46.800> bricks<00:05:47.130> have<00:05:47.660> sort<00:05:48.660> of<00:05:48.690> hastily<00:05:49.110> been

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
the bricks have sort of hastily been

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.770 
the bricks have sort of hastily been
patched<00:05:49.919> up<00:05:50.160> with<00:05:50.340> some<00:05:50.669> wood<00:05:50.910> and<00:05:51.180> whatnot

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
patched up with some wood and whatnot

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.719 
patched up with some wood and whatnot
which<00:05:52.050> i<00:05:52.169> think<00:05:52.229> is<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.500> really<00:05:52.770> cool<00:05:52.860> effect<00:05:53.160> if

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
which i think is a really cool effect if

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:54.890 
which i think is a really cool effect if
you're<00:05:53.910> going<00:05:54.060> for<00:05:54.330> something<00:05:54.510> where<00:05:54.780> it's

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
you're going for something where it's

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.629 
you're going for something where it's
kind<00:05:55.169> of<00:05:55.229> a<00:05:55.320> battleground<00:05:55.650> this<00:05:56.490> is

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
kind of a battleground this is

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.950 
kind of a battleground this is
definitely<00:05:56.970> something<00:05:57.389> that<00:05:57.419> you<00:05:57.570> might<00:05:57.810> want

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
definitely something that you might want

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.830 
definitely something that you might want
to<00:05:58.020> try<00:05:58.229> just<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.620> give<00:05:58.770> it<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:59.150> more<00:06:00.150> run<00:06:00.539> down

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
to try just to give it a more run down

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.560 
to try just to give it a more run down
and<00:06:01.229> just<00:06:01.800> tattered<00:06:02.250> look<00:06:02.550> now<00:06:03.030> over<00:06:03.389> here

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
and just tattered look now over here

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.150 
and just tattered look now over here
left<00:06:03.780> of<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:03.990> tower<00:06:04.200> we<00:06:04.410> do<00:06:04.590> have<00:06:04.770> this<00:06:04.889> wall

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
left of the tower we do have this wall

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.890 
left of the tower we do have this wall
that<00:06:05.190> sort<00:06:05.490> of<00:06:05.520> extends<00:06:06.120> down<00:06:06.389> all<00:06:06.660> the<00:06:06.780> way<00:06:06.870> to

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
that sort of extends down all the way to

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.090 
that sort of extends down all the way to
the<00:06:07.110> river<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.440> this<00:06:07.530> would<00:06:07.680> just<00:06:07.830> prevent

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
the river and this would just prevent

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.070 
the river and this would just prevent
any<00:06:08.340> attackers<00:06:08.880> on<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.150> shore<00:06:09.419> from

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
any attackers on the shore from

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.830 
any attackers on the shore from
breaching<00:06:10.410> the<00:06:10.680> main<00:06:10.860> city<00:06:11.190> from<00:06:12.090> down<00:06:12.450> here

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
breaching the main city from down here

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.290 
breaching the main city from down here
now<00:06:13.139> what<00:06:14.010> else<00:06:14.100> is<00:06:14.310> there<00:06:14.550> I<00:06:14.669> was<00:06:14.910> thinking

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
now what else is there I was thinking

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.820 
now what else is there I was thinking
about<00:06:15.389> maybe<00:06:15.600> extending<00:06:16.169> this<00:06:16.289> wall<00:06:16.500> all<00:06:16.800> the

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
about maybe extending this wall all the

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.260 
about maybe extending this wall all the
way<00:06:17.010> up<00:06:17.130> until<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.490> hits<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.700> nice<00:06:17.850> point<00:06:18.060> in<00:06:18.210> the

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
way up until it hits a nice point in the

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.879 
way up until it hits a nice point in the
mountain<00:06:18.570> where<00:06:19.110> no<00:06:19.289> one<00:06:19.440> would<00:06:19.530> really<00:06:19.740> be

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
mountain where no one would really be

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.350 
mountain where no one would really be
able<00:06:20.039> to<00:06:20.130> successfully<00:06:20.460> get<00:06:20.789> up<00:06:20.940> there<00:06:21.150> and

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
able to successfully get up there and

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.180 
able to successfully get up there and
then<00:06:21.479> I'm<00:06:21.570> thinking<00:06:22.050> about<00:06:22.169> if<00:06:22.470> this<00:06:22.650> does<00:06:22.919> end

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
then I'm thinking about if this does end

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.430 
then I'm thinking about if this does end
up<00:06:23.310> being<00:06:23.639> a<00:06:23.910> city<00:06:24.510> that's<00:06:24.690> kind<00:06:24.900> of<00:06:24.930> after<00:06:25.320> the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
up being a city that's kind of after the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.750 
up being a city that's kind of after the
war<00:06:25.620> instead<00:06:25.770> of<00:06:26.039> during<00:06:26.250> it<00:06:26.460> I'm<00:06:26.580> probably

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
war instead of during it I'm probably

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.580 
war instead of during it I'm probably
gonna<00:06:26.940> add<00:06:27.120> some<00:06:27.389> market<00:06:27.750> stalls<00:06:28.020> all<00:06:28.260> along

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
gonna add some market stalls all along

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.230 
gonna add some market stalls all along
this<00:06:28.770> bridge<00:06:29.039> just<00:06:29.669> to<00:06:29.760> make<00:06:29.910> it<00:06:30.000> a<00:06:30.120> nice

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
this bridge just to make it a nice

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.750 
this bridge just to make it a nice
little<00:06:30.389> Trade<00:06:30.720> Center<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:31.520> next<00:06:32.520> if<00:06:32.639> you're

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
little Trade Center and next if you're

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.040 
little Trade Center and next if you're
wondering<00:06:33.090> what<00:06:33.240> kind<00:06:33.450> of<00:06:33.510> buildings<00:06:33.900> are

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
wondering what kind of buildings are

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.630 
wondering what kind of buildings are
gonna<00:06:34.169> be<00:06:34.349> filling<00:06:34.770> up<00:06:34.860> this<00:06:35.039> whole<00:06:35.280> section

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
gonna be filling up this whole section

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.070 
gonna be filling up this whole section
it's<00:06:35.789> going<00:06:35.909> to<00:06:35.970> be<00:06:36.120> these<00:06:36.390> now<00:06:36.720> it<00:06:36.840> may<00:06:37.050> look

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
it's going to be these now it may look

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.360 
it's going to be these now it may look
rather<00:06:37.590> big

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
rather big

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.580 
rather big
from<00:06:38.490> the<00:06:38.610> exterior<00:06:38.970> but<00:06:39.479> really<00:06:39.900> these<00:06:40.410> are

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
from the exterior but really these are

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.080 
from the exterior but really these are
actually<00:06:41.010> a<00:06:41.040> bunch<00:06:41.190> of<00:06:41.310> little<00:06:41.520> small<00:06:41.729> houses

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
actually a bunch of little small houses

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.670 
actually a bunch of little small houses
connected<00:06:42.750> so<00:06:42.870> it's<00:06:42.990> gonna<00:06:43.110> be<00:06:43.290> kind<00:06:43.500> of<00:06:43.560> a

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
connected so it's gonna be kind of a

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.450 
connected so it's gonna be kind of a
shantytown

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
shantytown

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.400 
shantytown
all<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:45.120> way<00:06:45.210> down<00:06:45.419> till<00:06:45.810> we<00:06:45.870> get<00:06:46.080> to<00:06:46.260> the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
all the way down till we get to the

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.570 
all the way down till we get to the
water<00:06:46.620> and<00:06:46.919> then<00:06:47.040> that's<00:06:47.220> going<00:06:47.340> to<00:06:47.430> give<00:06:47.520> us

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
water and then that's going to give us

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.730 
water and then that's going to give us
some<00:06:47.820> rooms<00:06:48.060> to<00:06:48.660> place<00:06:48.870> in<00:06:49.020> some<00:06:49.199> docks<00:06:49.440> since

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
some rooms to place in some docks since

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.710 
some rooms to place in some docks since
this<00:06:49.830> is<00:06:50.100> gonna<00:06:50.310> be<00:06:50.460> primarily<00:06:50.970> a<00:06:51.120> fishing

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
this is gonna be primarily a fishing
