00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.930
 review and how to call it 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:28.549
 capsule storage for maxim here here 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:32.859
 below there is a compartment for storing cards 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:37.310
 there is almost a stock of frets 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:42.019
 close here themselves big here in 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.729
 mrs capsule and fox exactly 12 here 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.159
 there is a retractable handle 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.590
 sometimes i tried to launch this capsule 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.290
 she does not have to drive her psy and run 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.769
 I'm afraid to break it too painfully 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.220
 fragile 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:00.579
 Okay, we postpone it and the last for today 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.709
 it down i would call it or run tapes 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.489
 unfortunately he is a navigator though to me 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.919
 only one storm ovsky 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:14.509
 I certainly can show you how 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:17.489
 looks like a well run yet if 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:45.139
 do you want that lambie 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:45.139
 and that's how you like and there is such 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:56.930
 the time I really like me 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.259
 it doesn't work out like that 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.159
 Okay, here we take as usual without a figure 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.159
 because i don't like 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.720
 see here cutters Well, how would go here 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:21.690
 the gap must be inserted with these 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.320
 the ends exactly there I advise here with this 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.210
 where there is no record where there is no lock that you 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:34.860

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.259
 until 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.259
 and now we run 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.880

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.520
 pussy with you was igor channel 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.259

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:04.229
