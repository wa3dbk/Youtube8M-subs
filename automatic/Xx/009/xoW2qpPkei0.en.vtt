00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and this is obviously intended to let

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.540 
and this is obviously intended to let
the<00:00:33.149> bus<00:00:33.510> driver<00:00:33.780> know<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.829> bus<00:00:35.070> stops

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
here however if you look at it backwards

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.790 
here however if you look at it backwards
it<00:00:37.980> says<00:00:38.190> stop<00:00:38.579> bus<00:00:39.059> however<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.559> look

it says stop bus however if you look
with<00:00:41.129> closer<00:00:41.489> observation<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.270> guys<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.600> see

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
with closer observation you guys can see

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
with closer observation you guys can see
that<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.170> blood<00:00:43.590> covering<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.640> bottom

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that there's blood covering the bottom

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.080 
that there's blood covering the bottom
portion<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.410> connects<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.579> be

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
portion of the be that connects the be

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.049 
portion of the be that connects the be
together<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.320> looks<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.890> R<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.789> if

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
together and it looks like an R so if

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
together and it looks like an R so if
you<00:00:51.180> read<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.350> says<00:00:52.680> stop

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you read it from the back it says stop

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.770 
you read it from the back it says stop
rus-rus<00:00:54.110> being<00:00:55.110> russman<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.570> know

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
rus-rus being russman so as we all know

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.799 
rus-rus being russman so as we all know
russman<00:00:58.289> begins<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.100> lose<00:00:59.370> his<00:00:59.670> memory<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
russman begins to lose his memory in the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
russman begins to lose his memory in the
opening<00:01:01.289> cutscene<00:01:01.559> trailer<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> map

opening cutscene trailer for the map

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.859 
opening cutscene trailer for the map
buried<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> shows<00:01:05.159> how<00:01:06.000> much

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
buried and this kind of shows how much

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
buried and this kind of shows how much
we<00:01:06.930> don't<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.770> russman<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:08.700> russman

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
we don't really know russman now russman

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
we don't really know russman now russman
could<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:10.409> holding<00:01:10.680> secrets<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.670> don't

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
could be holding secrets that we don't

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
could be holding secrets that we don't
even<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:12.540> he<00:01:12.960> can't<00:01:13.229> even<00:01:13.380> remember

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
even know because he can't even remember

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.789 
even know because he can't even remember
them<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.000> odd<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.110> stop

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
them and it's a bit odd because the stop

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.240 
them and it's a bit odd because the stop
russ<00:01:17.250> sign<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> transit<00:01:18.960> floor<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
russ sign on the transit floor and it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.609 
russ sign on the transit floor and it
makes<00:01:20.460> us<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.880> wonder<00:01:21.299> who<00:01:21.840> russman<00:01:22.290> actually

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
makes us all wonder who russman actually

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.380 
makes us all wonder who russman actually
is<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> only<00:01:23.580> gave<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.150> bit<00:01:24.299> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
is because it only gave a little bit of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
is because it only gave a little bit of
backstory<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.960> who<00:01:25.290> he<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.500> how<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
backstory to who he is how he is a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.819 
backstory to who he is how he is a
former<00:01:26.939> operative<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.840> broken<00:01:28.259> arrow<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
former operative for broken arrow and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
former operative for broken arrow and
after<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> zombie<00:01:29.850> outbreak<00:01:30.210> he's<00:01:30.630> kind<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
after the zombie outbreak he's kind of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
after the zombie outbreak he's kind of
just<00:01:31.229> been<00:01:31.380> roaming<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> streets<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
just been roaming the streets as a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.359 
just been roaming the streets as a
homeless<00:01:33.390> man<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.619> having<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.070> purpose

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
homeless man not really having a purpose

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.850 
homeless man not really having a purpose
in<00:01:35.700> life<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.110> guys<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.409> see<00:01:37.470> he's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
in life but as you guys can see he's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560 
in life but as you guys can see he's
trying<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.250> remember<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
trying to remember what is going on and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.020 
trying to remember what is going on and
he's<00:01:40.470> trying<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.579> happened

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
he's trying to think what happened

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.710 
he's trying to think what happened
before<00:01:42.710> Broken<00:01:43.710> Arrow<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:44.909> extremely

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
before Broken Arrow so this is extremely

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.580 
before Broken Arrow so this is extremely
odd<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.579> russman<00:01:47.579> could<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.200> person

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
odd because russman could be the person

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.030 
odd because russman could be the person
who<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> stop<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.470> intended

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
who we have to stop which is intended

the easter egg on the map buried and how

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.050 
the easter egg on the map buried and how
this<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.340> throw<00:02:11.640> off<00:02:11.849> the

storyline if stop rust was
in<00:02:14.080> fact<00:02:14.350> true<00:02:14.680> however<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.430> still<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:16.120> that
