00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
um a solo 62 second lab with the ACR on

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.800 
um a solo 62 second lab with the ACR on
the<00:00:29.500> map<00:00:29.650> resistance<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.430> this<00:00:31.300> gameplay<00:00:31.510> is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
the map resistance and this gameplay is

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.500 
the map resistance and this gameplay is
pretty<00:00:32.050> impressive<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:33.100> simply<00:00:34.000> because<00:00:34.150> it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
pretty impressive to simply because it

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.630 
pretty impressive to simply because it
was<00:00:34.629> actually<00:00:34.900> solo<00:00:35.379> and<00:00:35.680> like<00:00:36.280> usually<00:00:36.610> when

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
was actually solo and like usually when

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.160 
was actually solo and like usually when
you<00:00:36.790> see<00:00:36.910> him<00:00:37.030> at<00:00:37.180> I'm<00:00:37.390> I'll<00:00:37.600> have<00:00:37.690> this<00:00:37.870> fast

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
you see him at I'm I'll have this fast

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.439 
you see him at I'm I'll have this fast
um<00:00:38.559> it's<00:00:39.220> gonna<00:00:39.340> be<00:00:39.489> like<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.699> pool<00:00:39.940> party<00:00:40.180> on

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
um it's gonna be like a pool party on

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.420 
um it's gonna be like a pool party on
like<00:00:40.750> terminal<00:00:41.199> or<00:00:41.320> something<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:42.010> like<00:00:42.100> this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
like terminal or something and like this

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.160 
like terminal or something and like this
was<00:00:42.610> on<00:00:42.730> this<00:00:43.059> was<00:00:43.269> so<00:00:43.480> low<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:43.900> it<00:00:43.960> was<00:00:43.989> on

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
was on this was so low and it was on

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.469 
was on this was so low and it was on
resistance<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.370> personally<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.299> never

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
resistance to and personally I never

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.360 
resistance to and personally I never
even<00:00:46.839> seen<00:00:47.110> him<00:00:47.229> I'll<00:00:47.379> have<00:00:47.500> this<00:00:47.710> fast<00:00:48.070> on

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
even seen him I'll have this fast on

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.100 
even seen him I'll have this fast on
resistance<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.269> might<00:00:49.420> even<00:00:49.570> be<00:00:49.809> like<00:00:49.989> the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
resistance this might even be like the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.750 
resistance this might even be like the
fastest<00:00:50.440> move<00:00:50.620> on<00:00:50.830> resistance<00:00:51.370> but<00:00:51.549> I'm<00:00:51.640> not

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
fastest move on resistance but I'm not

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.549 
fastest move on resistance but I'm not
like<00:00:51.879> cleaning<00:00:52.239> our<00:00:52.330> records<00:00:52.659> cuz<00:00:52.930> that'd<00:00:53.440> be

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
like cleaning our records cuz that'd be

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.680 
like cleaning our records cuz that'd be
kind<00:00:54.040> of<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.159> stupid<00:00:54.339> record<00:00:54.790> did<00:00:54.940> like<00:00:55.269> claim

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690

kind of a stupid record did like claim
just<00:00:56.080> like<00:00:56.229> world's<00:00:56.799> fastest<00:00:57.280> mile<00:00:57.460> on<00:00:57.760> this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
just like world's fastest mile on this

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.810 
just like world's fastest mile on this
map<00:00:58.180> it's<00:00:59.049> pretty<00:00:59.199> stupid<00:00:59.710> but<00:00:59.739> like<00:00:59.949> I'm<00:01:00.190> just

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
map it's pretty stupid but like I'm just

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.340 
map it's pretty stupid but like I'm just
want<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.030> say<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.449> like<00:01:01.629> it's<00:01:02.019> one<00:01:02.199> of<00:01:02.290> the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
fastest mouse I seen on this map so it's

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.359 
fastest mouse I seen on this map so it's
pretty<00:01:05.110> impressive<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.680> get<00:01:05.830> him<00:01:05.920> up<00:01:06.010> this

day and I'm also going for a full of
triple<00:01:20.290> Moab<00:01:20.410> so<00:01:20.800> hopefully<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.340> can<00:01:21.490> get<00:01:21.610> that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
triple Moab so hopefully I can get that

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.120 
triple Moab so hopefully I can get that
soon<00:01:22.120> enough<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:23.140> clothes<00:01:23.350> has<00:01:23.500> ever<00:01:23.680> been<00:01:23.950> to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
soon enough the clothes has ever been to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.310 
soon enough the clothes has ever been to
it<00:01:24.250> was<00:01:24.370> like<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.910> walk<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.300> believe<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.080> died

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
it was like to walk I believe and I died

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.620 
it was like to walk I believe and I died
from<00:01:26.710> like<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.920> support<00:01:27.460> juggernaut<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.120> it

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
from like a support juggernaut and it

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.900 
from like a support juggernaut and it
was<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.810> Arkaden<00:01:29.230> too<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.860> I<00:01:30.640> was<00:01:30.730> pretty

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
was on Arkaden too and I was pretty

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.210 
was on Arkaden too and I was pretty
pissed<00:01:31.120> off<00:01:31.360> about<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.900> but<00:01:32.110> hopefully<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:33.130> can

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
pissed off about it but hopefully I can

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.220 
pissed off about it but hopefully I can
get<00:01:33.430> solar<00:01:33.700> triple<00:01:33.910> lab<00:01:34.300> soon<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:35.050> don't

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
get solar triple lab soon and I don't

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.500 
get solar triple lab soon and I don't
think<00:01:35.380> it'd<00:01:35.560> be<00:01:35.590> like<00:01:35.950> too<00:01:36.520> hard<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:37.180> don't<00:01:37.420> know

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
think it'd be like too hard I don't know

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.600 
think it'd be like too hard I don't know
it<00:01:37.840> might<00:01:38.110> be<00:01:38.320> but<00:01:38.740> hopefully<00:01:39.010> I<00:01:39.220> can<00:01:39.340> get<00:01:39.460> it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
it might be but hopefully I can get it

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.720 
it might be but hopefully I can get it
soon<00:01:39.820> either<00:01:40.090> way<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.830> also<00:01:41.830> um<00:01:42.040> I'm<00:01:42.310> gonna<00:01:42.550> be

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
soon either way and also um I'm gonna be

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.330 
soon either way and also um I'm gonna be
hitting<00:01:43.060> six<00:01:43.360> case<00:01:43.630> super<00:01:44.260> soon<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.040> so<00:01:45.159> on
