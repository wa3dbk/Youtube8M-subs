the human expectation as to what people
would<00:02:35.299> think<00:02:35.570> an<00:02:35.690> alien<00:02:35.810> should<00:02:36.320> look<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.760> if

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
would think an alien should look like if

already had done before and as soon as
we<00:03:19.730> saw<00:03:19.940> even<00:03:20.450> just<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.720> first<00:03:20.959> test<00:03:21.320> of<00:03:21.650> what

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
we saw even just a first test of what

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.590 
we saw even just a first test of what
that<00:03:22.220> alien<00:03:22.610> looked<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:23.060> we<00:03:23.269> were<00:03:23.420> pretty

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
that alien looked like we were pretty

that alien looked like we were pretty
much<00:03:23.840> sold<00:03:24.200> because<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.890> looked<00:03:25.130> so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
much sold because it just looked so

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:41.220 
much sold because it just looked so
incredibly<00:03:26.480> detailed

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
and I would be like can we combine this

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.790 
and I would be like can we combine this
scene<00:03:49.490> in<00:03:49.640> this<00:03:49.790> scene<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.360> make<00:03:50.750> our<00:03:50.960> day<00:03:51.200> one
