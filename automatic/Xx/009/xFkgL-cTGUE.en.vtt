 lord 400 1 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.349
 for grinding the floor in hard to reach 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.730
 places specialists Odessa plant 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.740
 building finishing machines 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.910
 was developed parquet grinding 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.349
 lord machine 401 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.479
 The machine ex-pilot 401 is designed to 

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:25.119
 processing edge parquet and

 hard-to-reach places called 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.200
 dead shame 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.480
 surface grinding takes place using 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.390
 disk with a diameter of 150 millimeters 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.270
 material used for fastening 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.500
 grinding disk after all the blood 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.220
 or more simply velcro

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.020
 surface steps or edge plots 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.870
 enough to work with 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.760
 using a short sheriff 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.310
 oval head 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.150
 and knowing the nozzle is designed to 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.480
 grinding in the most difficult available 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.140
 places 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.600
 after setting the disc is necessary 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.030
 center the wheels so that the worker 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.620
 disk surface was strictly 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.890
 parallel to the floor 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.270
 tilt angle change 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.909
 grinding wheel square processed 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.390
 surface is achieved 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.680

 by design 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:30.839
 for also low quality 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.939
 ongoing work is necessary 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.679
 use a sketch of different grains 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.919
 starting disc processing 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.089
 coarse-grained style and ending 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:40.599
 fine grinding

 a disk 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.659
 disk replacement is simple and 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.339
