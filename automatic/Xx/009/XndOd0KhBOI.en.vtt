00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.240 
the launch control and an Olaf ship
very<00:00:16.430> helpful<00:00:16.760> for<00:00:16.910> a<00:00:17.000> gt35r<00:00:17.810> car<00:00:18.260> nice

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
very helpful for a gt35r car nice

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.740 
very helpful for a gt35r car nice
because<00:00:19.460> once<00:00:19.670> you<00:00:19.790> load<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.090> map<00:00:20.270> in<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.480> car

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
because once you load the map in the car

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.380 
because once you load the map in the car
all<00:00:21.680> your<00:00:21.830> changes<00:00:22.130> are<00:00:22.310> live<00:00:22.670> in<00:00:22.700> real<00:00:23.060> time

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
all your changes are live in real time

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
so here we have the intake calibration

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.019 
so here we have the intake calibration
table<00:00:25.580> I<00:00:26.439> got<00:00:27.439> my<00:00:27.590> dashboard<00:00:27.860> up<00:00:28.430> here<00:00:28.670> running

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
table I got my dashboard up here running

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.150 
table I got my dashboard up here running
I<00:00:29.240> could<00:00:29.840> just<00:00:29.990> make<00:00:30.140> changes<00:00:30.410> right<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.099> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
I could just make changes right on the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.500 
I could just make changes right on the
fly<00:00:31.430> and<00:00:31.820> save<00:00:32.150> them<00:00:32.329> that<00:00:32.509> easy

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
fly and save them that easy

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.430 
fly and save them that easy
I<00:00:33.989> did<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.679> basic<00:00:34.920> tune<00:00:35.879> on<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.059> street<00:00:36.440> nothing

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I did a basic tune on the street nothing

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
I did a basic tune on the street nothing
too<00:00:37.680> aggressive<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.430> we're<00:00:39.269> just<00:00:39.359> gonna<00:00:39.539> do<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
too aggressive and we're just gonna do a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.709 
too aggressive and we're just gonna do a
pull<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.109> dyno<00:00:40.699> here<00:00:41.699> and<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.539> where

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
pull on the dyno here and see where

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.180 
pull on the dyno here and see where
we're<00:00:42.899> at

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
we're at

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.439 
we're at
and<00:00:44.309> then<00:00:44.489> we'll<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.789> some<00:00:44.940> adjustments

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
and then we'll make some adjustments

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.729 
and then we'll make some adjustments
from<00:00:45.510> there<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.289> kind<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> power

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
from there and see what kind of power

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.880 
from there and see what kind of power
this<00:00:47.210> monster<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> make<00:00:48.629> today

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this monster is going to make today

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
this monster is going to make today
let's<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.220> our<00:00:50.489> data<00:00:50.820> logging<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> lock

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
let's do our data logging with a lock

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.940 
let's do our data logging with a lock
the<00:00:51.809> data

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.630 

never<00:00:56.310> happened

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.149 

the<00:01:04.150> air-fuel<00:01:04.659> was<00:01:04.839> nice<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.110> little<00:01:05.830> bit<00:01:06.040> on

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
the air-fuel was nice a little bit on

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.440 
the air-fuel was nice a little bit on
the<00:01:06.250> rich<00:01:06.430> side<00:01:06.460> right<00:01:06.940> where<00:01:07.090> its<00:01:07.210> spooling

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
the rich side right where its spooling

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.200 
the rich side right where its spooling
up<00:01:07.690> okay<00:01:08.229> we<00:01:08.409> made<00:01:08.620> some<00:01:08.800> minor<00:01:09.210> corrections

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
up okay we made some minor corrections

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.200 
up okay we made some minor corrections
to<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:10.420> air-fuel<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:12.369> picked<00:01:12.700> up<00:01:12.790> some<00:01:13.000> power

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
to the air-fuel are picked up some power

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.950 
to the air-fuel are picked up some power
or<00:01:13.540> just<00:01:13.690> over<00:01:13.930> 450

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
