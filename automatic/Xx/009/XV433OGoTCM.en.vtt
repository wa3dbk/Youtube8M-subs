00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.930
 What's wrong, I'm here, I'm here again 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.939
 we are in a tutorial on fumes 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.010
 of the taxis that have gone to 9 points 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.110
 it takes longer to download it and 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.380
 do it because of connection problems to 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.140
 internet and good as it is already 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.119
 the custom to have the package 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.040
 of my mods, here you have it 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.110
 fully functional for version 9 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.910
 points I put the post in the forum with 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.010
 all the description you have and look at the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.279
 xvm in two digits one wing 8 the average 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.689
 with times the base for the tanks the 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.489
 for damage with indicator both the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.980
 damage to the address and others like 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.320
 always the minimap of the x v comes with me 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.960
 the circle and with the detection range and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.790
 with the maximum rendering square at 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.309
 which one can see the tanks on 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.080
 carousel that comes to be modifiable 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.510
 within the same as the options of 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.060
 own game the clock with the date of the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.470
 central part of the service sheet 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.670
 as always and in the bottom 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.020
 right next to the results of the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.530
 battle come as you already know about the 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.790
 statistics that were of the spend then 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.610
 well the summarized version that they have taken 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.350
 for 9 points for the sound mode not 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.150
 I have raised it with my father we have because 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.640
 it was going to occupy a lot I left 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.070
 the post other than non- fader if you have it 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.770
 here 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.600
 here is perfectly explained how 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.400
 is installed and everything so that is the link 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.900
 you install it to download the links 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.520
 mediafire is download the file and when 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.229
 you do you must have this folder 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.750
 with the pack many new point of 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.090
 save and to be able to only put 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.670
 you take these two files 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.149
 we would give in this case to copy us 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.359
 we would come to the part of what we would be 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.649
 in this case nine points and xvm and one 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.500
 Once you bring them somewhere, what 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.060
 we copy on game world of tanks in 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.649
 three bar we go down since the two 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.600
 portfolios that come only nine points and 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.039
 the X is up then you are at the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.959
 part folder what copy and if what 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.569
 you have here or what straits directly 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.950
 here as you see you already know that to be able 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.550
 activate statistics in large the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.470
 xvm page so point xvm 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.050
 puntocom and I always recommend that 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 each new patch that never has always 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.260
 you put on the page to change the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.280
 statistics to re-activate them another 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.080
 because there is always a small 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.790
 lag and others and do not worry about 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.030
 first two games do not leave 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.260
 statistics because then already the third 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.970
 more or less I should leave them all 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 so none of this has been all here 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.480
 with this quick tutorial I hope 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.370
 enjoy the mods tomorrow and step are 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 already prepared the videos so be 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.570
 attentive to what is coming and nothing then to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 enjoy only the offers that 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.830
 there is the guardini anniversary or anything 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.420
 good luck to everyone and as you know what 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.280
 I always tell you I see you in the field of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.280
 battle until then
