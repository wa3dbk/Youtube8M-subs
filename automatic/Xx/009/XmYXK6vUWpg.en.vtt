00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
pretty hard to do so we involve a lot of

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.140 
pretty hard to do so we involve a lot of
sports<00:01:36.710> science<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.190> it<00:01:37.280> doing<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.000> lot<00:01:38.120> more

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
sports science in it doing a lot more

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.300 
sports science in it doing a lot more
low-impact<00:01:38.840> stuff<00:01:39.140> still<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.979> know<00:01:40.100> high

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
low-impact stuff still you know high

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.670 
low-impact stuff still you know high
reps<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:41.240> know<00:01:41.330> intense<00:01:41.630> work<00:01:41.900> but<00:01:42.500> just

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
reps and you know intense work but just

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.200 
reps and you know intense work but just
low<00:01:42.830> impact<00:01:43.160> because<00:01:43.370> my<00:01:43.550> body<00:01:43.729> takes<00:01:43.970> enough

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
low impact because my body takes enough

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.910 
low impact because my body takes enough
impact<00:01:44.570> when<00:01:44.690> we're<00:01:44.780> training<00:01:45.020> I've<00:01:45.710> just

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
impact when we're training I've just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.440 
impact when we're training I've just
learned<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.280> modify<00:01:46.640> my<00:01:46.670> training<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:47.240> how

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
learned to modify my training and how

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.640 
learned to modify my training and how
much<00:01:47.690> I<00:01:47.840> do<00:01:47.900> because<00:01:48.200> I've<00:01:48.290> always<00:01:48.410> had<00:01:48.590> a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
much I do because I've always had a

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.230 
much I do because I've always had a
problem<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:49.010> overtraining<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.580> training<00:01:50.030> too

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
problem of overtraining and training too

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.270 
problem of overtraining and training too
hard<00:01:50.479> because<00:01:51.290> I'm<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:51.650> kinda<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.250> know

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
obviously being Taurus and that's

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.320 
obviously being Taurus and that's
sometimes<00:01:54.290> worked<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:55.550> my<00:01:55.670> detriment<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.210> now

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330
