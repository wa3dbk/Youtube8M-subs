00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
of like a back story kind of thing so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.520 
of like a back story kind of thing so
they<00:01:51.360> wanted<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.020> happened

before<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:54.420> map<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.810> were<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
before the the map that were on at the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
before the the map that were on at the
minute<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> delving

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
minute so in I think the kind of delving

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
minute so in I think the kind of delving
into<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.810> story<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.590> things<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.250> getting

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
into the story side of things so getting

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
into the story side of things so getting
a<00:01:59.610> really<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.540> story<00:02:00.780> line<00:02:00.899> going

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
a really a really good story line going

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.920 
a really a really good story line going
like<00:02:01.409> zombies<00:02:01.860> hard<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.219> course<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.750> guess

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
like zombies hard of course and I guess

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.060 
like zombies hard of course and I guess
they're<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> try<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.500> kick<00:02:04.740> start<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.889 
they're going to try and kick start it
off<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.369> zombies<00:02:05.729> again<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> finally<00:02:06.630> just
