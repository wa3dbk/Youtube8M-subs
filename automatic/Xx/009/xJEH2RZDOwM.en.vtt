into the stomach a lot of things are at

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.410 
into the stomach a lot of things are at
interplay<00:02:04.259> here<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
interplay here so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.539 
interplay here so
this<00:02:05.689> is<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.900> meal<00:02:06.200> consider<00:02:06.890> these<00:02:07.070> gray<00:02:07.310> dots

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
this is a meal consider these gray dots

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.089 
this is a meal consider these gray dots
to<00:02:07.729> be<00:02:07.850> simple<00:02:08.330> sugars<00:02:08.750> yellow<00:02:09.380> dots<00:02:09.590> are<00:02:09.830> fat

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
to be simple sugars yellow dots are fat

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.670 
to be simple sugars yellow dots are fat
the<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.270> red<00:02:11.540> dots<00:02:11.780> are<00:02:12.080> proteins<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the the red dots are proteins and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.620 
the the red dots are proteins and
immediately<00:02:13.160> those<00:02:13.310> purple<00:02:13.819> enzymes<00:02:14.360> are

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
immediately those purple enzymes are

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.180 
immediately those purple enzymes are
starting<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.989> break<00:02:15.200> down<00:02:15.230> proteins<00:02:16.010> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
starting to break down proteins and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.430 
starting to break down proteins and
amino<00:02:16.340> acids<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.300> also<00:02:17.930> see<00:02:18.080> these<00:02:18.200> white

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
amino acids and you also see these white

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.229 
amino acids and you also see these white
dots<00:02:18.620> which<00:02:18.950> are<00:02:19.099> complex<00:02:19.550> carbohydrates

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
dots which are complex carbohydrates

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.880 
dots which are complex carbohydrates
being<00:02:20.750> broken<00:02:21.170> down<00:02:21.290> as<00:02:21.470> well

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
being broken down as well

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.040 
being broken down as well
this<00:02:22.340> Malou<00:02:22.790> all<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.360> happening<00:02:23.870> actually

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
this Malou all this happening actually

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.740 
this Malou all this happening actually
will<00:02:24.650> prevent<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.760> immediate<00:02:26.209> absorption<00:02:26.690> of

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
will prevent the immediate absorption of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.210 
will prevent the immediate absorption of
all<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.350> sugar<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.890> don't<00:02:28.069> get<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
all that sugar so you don't get a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.360 
all that sugar so you don't get a
massive<00:02:28.910> blood<00:02:29.450> sugar<00:02:29.840> spike<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.950> happens

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
massive blood sugar spike what happens

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.100 
massive blood sugar spike what happens
in<00:02:31.459> your<00:02:31.580> small<00:02:31.850> intestine<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.480> things<00:02:32.900> get

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
in your small intestine is things get

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.190 
in your small intestine is things get
broken<00:02:33.380> down<00:02:33.650> further<00:02:34.010> fat's<00:02:34.910> get<00:02:35.750> surrounded

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
broken down further fat's get surrounded

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.320 
broken down further fat's get surrounded
by<00:02:36.349> bile<00:02:36.739> which<00:02:37.010> are<00:02:37.190> those<00:02:37.340> green<00:02:37.640> dots<00:02:37.670> so

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
by bile which are those green dots so

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.150 
by bile which are those green dots so
fats<00:02:38.690> are<00:02:38.900> broken<00:02:39.050> now<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.650> they<00:02:39.830> can<00:02:40.040> be

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
fats are broken now so they can be

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.979 
fats are broken now so they can be
absorbed<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> small<00:02:40.819> intestine<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.840> are

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
absorbed in the small intestine you are

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.050 
absorbed in the small intestine you are
further<00:02:42.290> breaking<00:02:42.709> down<00:02:42.950> protein<00:02:43.459> into<00:02:43.700> amino

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
further breaking down protein into amino

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.789 
further breaking down protein into amino
acids<00:02:44.510> which<00:02:44.660> get<00:02:44.840> which<00:02:45.080> get<00:02:45.290> absorbed<00:02:45.530> an

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
acids which get which get absorbed an

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.590 
acids which get which get absorbed an
interesting<00:02:46.610> thing<00:02:46.760> also<00:02:46.910> happens<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
interesting thing also happens in the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.740 
interesting thing also happens in the
small<00:02:47.810> intestine<00:02:48.200> fats<00:02:49.190> having<00:02:50.090> fat<00:02:50.330> helps

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
small intestine fats having fat helps

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.890 
small intestine fats having fat helps
you<00:02:50.959> absorb<00:02:51.280> vitamins<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.519> vitamin<00:02:53.090> D<00:02:53.299> e<00:02:53.330> in

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
you absorb vitamins a vitamin D e in

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.170 
you absorb vitamins a vitamin D e in
case<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.380> having<00:02:54.769> fat<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.190> key<00:02:55.400> but<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
case so having fat is key but the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.000 
case so having fat is key but the
veggies<00:02:56.660> we<00:02:56.810> just<00:02:56.989> talked<00:02:57.140> about<00:02:57.170> loaded<00:02:57.860> with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
veggies we just talked about loaded with

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.190 
veggies we just talked about loaded with
fiber<00:02:58.250> why<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.640> fiber<00:02:59.030> important<00:02:59.750> it<00:03:00.019> adds

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
fiber why is fiber important it adds

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.130
