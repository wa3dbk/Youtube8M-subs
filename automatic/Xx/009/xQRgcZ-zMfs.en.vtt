yeah<00:01:43.070> these<00:01:44.070> boulders<00:01:44.700> map<00:01:44.940> offices<00:01:45.630> yeah

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
yeah these boulders map offices yeah

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.440 
yeah these boulders map offices yeah
did

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.220 

oi

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
oi

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.600 
oi
so<00:01:56.600> we<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.690> multiple<00:01:58.110> spawn<00:01:58.440> are<00:01:59.130> multiple

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so we have multiple spawn are multiple

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.980 
so we have multiple spawn are multiple
we<00:01:59.760> charging<00:02:00.120> points<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.510> so<00:02:00.660> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.870> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
we charging points to so this is the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.680 
we charging points to so this is the
back<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.620> base<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.360> spin<00:02:03.600> your

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
back of the base like you can spin your

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.160 
back of the base like you can spin your
point<00:02:03.900> so<00:02:04.080> like<00:02:04.260> it's<00:02:04.440> going<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.510> W<00:02:06.870> skill

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
point so like it's going on the W skill

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.190
