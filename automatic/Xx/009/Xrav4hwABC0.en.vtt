00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.710 
it up just like a little ruffle kind of
thing<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.860> on<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.360> pin<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.690> have

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
thing going on so when you pin you have

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.850 
thing going on so when you pin you have
to<00:01:19.899> make<00:01:20.020> sure<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.259> you're<00:01:20.440> getting<00:01:20.590> all

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
to make sure that you're getting all

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:34.600 
to make sure that you're getting all
them<00:01:21.820> together<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.659> pin<00:01:25.659> it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.460 

so<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:35.210> just<00:01:35.570> pinned<00:01:35.810> one<00:01:35.990> here<00:01:36.200> I'm<00:01:36.320> going<00:01:36.410> to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
so I just pinned one here I'm going to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.660 
so I just pinned one here I'm going to
take<00:01:36.620> another<00:01:36.800> pin<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:42.250> pin<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.400> from<00:01:43.550> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.930 
side as well and if you're smarter than
me<00:01:48.860> then<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.100> would<00:01:49.250> not<00:01:49.340> be<00:01:49.520> using<00:01:49.550> black

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940
