the shoe the next people talk about the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.729 
the shoe the next people talk about the
stability<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.260> improved<00:00:44.590> stability

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
stability so the improved stability

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.529 
stability so the improved stability
system<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.300> PD<00:00:47.050> RB<00:00:47.800> support<00:00:48.250> wedge<00:00:48.460> has<00:00:49.300> been

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
system the PD RB support wedge has been

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.479 
system the PD RB support wedge has been
raised<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:50.019> provide<00:00:50.350> more<00:00:50.769> support<00:00:51.190> for<00:00:51.399> the

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
raised to provide more support for the

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.240 
raised to provide more support for the
arch<00:00:51.719> also<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:53.320> whole<00:00:53.500> midsole<00:00:53.890> has<00:00:54.070> been

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
arch also the whole midsole has been

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.459 
arch also the whole midsole has been
domed<00:00:54.579> outwards<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.420> reduce<00:00:55.780> over<00:00:56.289> pronation

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
domed outwards to reduce over pronation

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.790 
domed outwards to reduce over pronation
and<00:00:58.199> will<00:00:59.199> also<00:00:59.320> move<00:00:59.620> on<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.010> sole<00:01:00.250> now

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and will also move on to the sole now

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.320 
and will also move on to the sole now
the<00:01:02.800> under<00:01:03.039> foot<00:01:03.219> flexibility<00:01:03.879> has<00:01:04.089> been

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
the under foot flexibility has been

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330 
the under foot flexibility has been
improved<00:01:04.750> by<00:01:05.320> adding<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.710> Omega<00:01:06.100> flex

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
improved by adding the Omega flex

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.550 
improved by adding the Omega flex
grooves<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.970> continuing<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:07.990> omni<00:01:08.290> grooves

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
grooves and continuing the omni grooves

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.100 
grooves and continuing the omni grooves
into<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> forefoot<00:01:09.760> which<00:01:10.000> allows<00:01:10.900> the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
into the forefoot which allows the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.290 
into the forefoot which allows the
outsole<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.650> bend<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.160> shake<00:01:12.610> more<00:01:12.790> naturally

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
outsole to bend and shake more naturally

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.780 
outsole to bend and shake more naturally
with<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.480> foot<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:17.650> also<00:01:17.830> move<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.400> there<00:01:18.610> to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
with the foot we also move on there to

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.970 
with the foot we also move on there to
the<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.300> shoe<00:01:19.480> behind<00:01:19.630> which<00:01:20.320> is<00:01:20.350> exactly<00:01:20.830> the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
the the shoe behind which is exactly the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.880 
the the shoe behind which is exactly the
same<00:01:21.160> shoe<00:01:21.510> but<00:01:22.510> it's<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.840> all<00:01:23.020> it's<00:01:23.380> just<00:01:23.740> in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
same shoe but it's just all it's just in

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.220 
same shoe but it's just all it's just in
the<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> width<00:01:24.820> fitting<00:01:25.180> which<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.540> slightly

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
the to a width fitting which is slightly

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.080 
the to a width fitting which is slightly
broader<00:01:26.410> on<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:26.830> forefoot<00:01:27.280> for<00:01:27.640> people<00:01:27.940> with

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
broader on that forefoot for people with

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.040 
broader on that forefoot for people with
that<00:01:28.300> wider<00:01:28.960> foot<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.900> weighs<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.830> at<00:01:34.050> 312

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
that wider foot so weighs in at 312

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.980 
that wider foot so weighs in at 312
grams<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.340> it's<00:01:36.370> a<00:01:36.640> great<00:01:36.850> stability<00:01:37.240> shoe<00:01:37.750> and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
grams so it's a great stability shoe and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.830 
grams so it's a great stability shoe and
which<00:01:38.830> combines<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.580> cushioning<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
which combines the cushioning and the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.940 
which combines the cushioning and the
support<00:01:41.200> without<00:01:41.470> being<00:01:41.740> too<00:01:41.920> heavy<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.920> I

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
support without being too heavy that I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.080 
support without being too heavy that I
think<00:01:45.220> that's<00:01:45.340> pretty<00:01:45.460> much<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.730> we've

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
think that's pretty much it we've

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.050 
think that's pretty much it we've
covered<00:01:46.270> most<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.870> new<00:01:47.050> additions<00:01:47.650> there

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
