 nissan has launched the second in Spain 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.580
 generation of I noticed his new bet 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.580
 for car segment 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.580
 polyvalent 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
 this new model comes to join together 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.500

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.500
 Japanese brand in this segment 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.150
 The note is a vehicle developed in

 Europe and for European customers 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.180
 with 410 meters in length and a height 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.530
 of 153 meters this second generation will 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.240
 moves away from the sub segment of 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.610
 urban minivans in which 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.199
 it included its predecessor lowering the height and 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.199
 sharpening the exterior design 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 a long wheelbase of 260 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.700
 meters is complemented with some cantilevers 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.390
 shorts to provide an agile look 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.390
 and dynamic 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.090
 the front combines surfaces 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.630
 sculpted with a grill and headlights 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.549
 interconnected 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.500
 in the lateral image they emphasize 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.850
 marked wheel arches and a line of 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 waist in gentle rise 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 the set of systems that the brand 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.660
 called protection shield 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.610
 smart is integrated by the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.260
 warning of dead angle the warning of 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.520
 involuntary lane change and the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.520
 motion detector 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.590
 all three systems work by analyzing 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.540
 the data collected by a camera 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.610
 located in the back of the vehicle 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.920
 besides he does not inherit you from his brother 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.650
 he cascais the vision camera 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.280
 360 degrees a team that facilitates a 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.990
 Aerial image of the vehicle and its surroundings 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 this information is very useful in the 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.590
 maneuvers at low speed since we 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.590
 allows to see the possible obstacles 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.409
 the range of engines and transmissions 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.440
 includes four combinations with 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.690
 Co2 emissions of only 92 grams per 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.940
 kilometer 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.860
 the stop and start stop system and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.980
 automatic start in arrests 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.480
 the stability control esp 6 airbag and 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.820
 control of cruise speed 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.240
 with limiter come standard in all 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.240
 the versions 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.670
 the two gasoline engines have a 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.920
 cubic capacity of 1,198 cubic centimeters 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.370
 of two three- cylinder units and twelve 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.370
 valves 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.680
 the 1.2 access engine offers a 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.020
 power of 80 horses and a consumption 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.020
 combined from 47 liters to 100 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.170
 it is followed in the range by 1.2 that 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.510
 that yields 98 horses and has homologated a 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.510
 consumption of 4 3 liters at 100 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.290
 the latter can assemble a box of 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.040
 automatic changes of continuous variation 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.040
 cwt 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.319
 completing the range of engines 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.390
 we found the remodeled engine 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.390
 turbodiesel 1.5 dci 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.080
 this propeller of the alliance renault 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.760
 nissan provides 90 horses is 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.190
 mated to a manual transmission 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.800
 5 speeds and has approved a consumption 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.800
 average of 36 liters to 100 kilometers 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.250
 the new one is not for sale from 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.400
