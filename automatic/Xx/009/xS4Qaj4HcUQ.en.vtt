00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.300
It is David by Michelangelo, I studied it at school

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.300
The skaters love marble. They always search this material,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.300
the benches, stairs, walls made of marble because their skateboard’s slide better.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.300
The idea is going where marble is mined, taken out from the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
mountains and build marble obstacles where no policemen or people would 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.200
care if the skaters were grinding.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.200
We are in Cave Michelangelo, where Michelangelo used to go

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.000
in his period to find the marble for his sculptures.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.190
We build obstacles following ideas of street obstacles, all that you

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.190
can’t find normally on the road. That has linear shape with clean cut, 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.190
this obstacle works well near the block cut out from mountain with 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.190
diamond cable.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
The quarry and the landscape

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.270
are amazing

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.050
there isn’t anything similar in Spain.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.250
I liked it a lot

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.090
sharing it with the 5 Italian guys and Mack.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.130
We had good time

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.050
sliding on all the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.300
obstacles

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300
in the best way.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.460
operation Michelangelo, finished.
