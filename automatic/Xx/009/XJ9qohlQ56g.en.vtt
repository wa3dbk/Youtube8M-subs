00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
transition is a little bit different um

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
transition is a little bit different um
your<00:01:26.280> app<00:01:26.909> drawer<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.409> just

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
your app drawer is the same it's just

your app drawer is the same it's just
pretty<00:01:28.950> much<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> same<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.640> overall<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
pretty much the same so overall it is

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
pretty much the same so overall it is
all<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.049> similar<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> want<00:01:32.490> more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

just you don't have it on one page

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.890 
just you don't have it on one page
without<00:03:01.490> scrolling<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.360> much<00:03:02.720> more

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
without scrolling which is much more

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.470 
without scrolling which is much more
efficient<00:03:03.350> in<00:03:03.470> my<00:03:03.740> case<00:03:03.980> I'm<00:03:04.550> breaking<00:03:05.180> naval

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480

auto<00:03:13.520> rotate<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.120> gone<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.920> can<00:03:16.040> do<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> lot

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
auto rotate is gone so you can do a lot

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.160 
auto rotate is gone so you can do a lot
of<00:03:16.460> things<00:03:16.640> with<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.000> very<00:03:17.390> very<00:03:17.510> easily<00:03:17.810> due

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
of things with that very very easily due

to any of the options to that we're not

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.330 
to any of the options to that we're not

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
gonna go really in depth for just

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.370 
gonna go really in depth for just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
just keep don't really overclock it or

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.420 
just keep don't really overclock it or

into problems go and google it if you
feel<00:04:39.860> uncomfortable<00:04:39.979> or<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.819> just<00:04:41.180> leave<00:04:41.599> it

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:41.719 
feel uncomfortable or I just leave it

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.059 
feel uncomfortable or I just leave it
alone<00:04:41.780> if<00:04:42.110> you<00:04:42.139> just<00:04:42.590> don't<00:04:42.800> want<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:42.979> mess

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
alone if you just don't want to mess

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.950 
alone if you just don't want to mess
with<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.490> know<00:04:43.520> that's<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.539> best<00:04:44.750> case

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
with it you know that's the best case

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.779 
with it you know that's the best case
