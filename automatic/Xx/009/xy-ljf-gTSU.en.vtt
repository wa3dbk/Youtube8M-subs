00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
in ship real quick from crazy crap but

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.539 
in ship real quick from crazy crap but
one<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.610> had<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.979> well<00:01:46.979> both<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.460> them

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
one of them had a well both of them

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.230 
one of them had a well both of them
rather<00:01:47.759> had<00:01:48.299> mismatched<00:01:49.430> scales<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
rather had mismatched scales here you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
rather had mismatched scales here you
could<00:01:51.360> probably<00:01:51.540> make<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.960> fit<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.040> had

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
could probably make them fit if you had

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.639 
could probably make them fit if you had
the<00:01:53.340> right<00:01:53.750> stain<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.020> sort<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> thing<00:01:55.439> I

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the right stain that sort of thing I

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.709 
the right stain that sort of thing I
think<00:01:56.159> these<00:01:56.219> come<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.579> maple<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.090> oak<00:01:57.299> it's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
think these come in maple and oak it's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.039 
think these come in maple and oak it's

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
manufactured back to back and I locked

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.069 
manufactured back to back and I locked
out<00:02:04.880> when<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> ordered<00:02:06.360> both<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.689> these<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
natural stone here on the top if you can

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.860 
natural stone here on the top if you can
see<00:02:16.920> both<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.099> those<00:02:17.340> when<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> actually<00:02:18.480> sat

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
see both of those when I actually sat

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.390 
see both of those when I actually sat
down<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.170> look<00:02:19.290> at<00:02:19.439> these<00:02:19.560> two<00:02:19.769> sets<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.129> scales

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
down to look at these two sets of scales

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.190 
down to look at these two sets of scales
I<00:02:20.640> really<00:02:21.450> lucked<00:02:21.629> out<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.879> standard<00:02:23.879> style

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
I really lucked out this standard style

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.399 
I really lucked out this standard style
color<00:02:25.640> wood<00:02:26.640> grips<00:02:26.939> actually<00:02:27.780> maxed<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
color wood grips actually maxed you

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.949 
color wood grips actually maxed you
could<00:02:28.560> put<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.769> two<00:02:28.799> these<00:02:29.099> side<00:02:29.370> by<00:02:29.579> side<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
could put the two these side by side the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.209 
could put the two these side by side the
two<00:02:30.989> scale<00:02:31.349> if<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.620> can't<00:02:31.829> do<00:02:31.920> now<00:02:32.069> because

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
two scale if you can't do now because

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.789 
two scale if you can't do now because
they're<00:02:32.430> epoxy<00:02:32.819> but<00:02:33.030> trust<00:02:33.870> me<00:02:33.930> when<00:02:34.409> I<00:02:34.439> picked

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
they're epoxy but trust me when I picked

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.110 
they're epoxy but trust me when I picked
each<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.159> these<00:02:35.250> scales<00:02:35.519> together<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.000> laid

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
each of these scales together and laid

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.720 
each of these scales together and laid
them<00:02:36.299> out<00:02:36.389> they<00:02:37.139> match<00:02:37.549> identically<00:02:38.549> so

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
them out they match identically so

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.209 
them out they match identically so
obviously<00:02:39.209> these<00:02:39.480> scales<00:02:40.439> had<00:02:40.739> come<00:02:40.980> off<00:02:41.099> the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
obviously these scales had come off the

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.729 
obviously these scales had come off the
same<00:02:41.370> production<00:02:41.700> line<00:02:41.879> and<00:02:42.840> they're<00:02:43.139> almost

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
same production line and they're almost

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.679 
same production line and they're almost
as<00:02:44.310> close<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.969> the<00:02:45.150> other<00:02:45.269> set

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
as close on the other set

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.020 
as close on the other set
so<00:02:45.870> don't<00:02:46.560> know<00:02:46.709> how<00:02:46.919> the<00:02:46.980> heck<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.340> lucked<00:02:47.879> out

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so don't know how the heck I lucked out

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.069 
so don't know how the heck I lucked out
on<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:49.700> but<00:02:50.700> I'll<00:02:50.819> take<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:51.060> as<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.180> win<00:02:51.389> this

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
on that but I'll take it as a win this

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.720 
on that but I'll take it as a win this
is<00:02:52.230> good<00:02:52.709> omen<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.189> you<00:02:53.310> will

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
is good omen if you will

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.789 
is good omen if you will
can't<00:02:54.720> wait<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.989> see<00:02:55.109> how<00:02:55.230> these<00:02:55.379> things<00:02:55.560> work

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
can't wait to see how these things work

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.629 
can't wait to see how these things work
out<00:02:56.120> overall<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.799> again<00:02:58.799> two<00:02:59.159> different<00:02:59.280> size

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
out overall but again two different size

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.050 
out overall but again two different size
when<00:03:00.269> sized<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:01.049> colored<00:03:01.769> scales<00:03:02.099> was<00:03:03.030> a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
when sized and colored scales was a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.179 
when sized and colored scales was a
little<00:03:03.359> disconcerting<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.139> could<00:03:04.319> grind

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
little disconcerting you could grind

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.830 
little disconcerting you could grind
those<00:03:05.430> down<00:03:05.609> they<00:03:05.790> look<00:03:05.969> fine<00:03:06.209> once<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.629> stain

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
those down they look fine once you stain

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.750 
those down they look fine once you stain
them<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.439> tend<00:03:07.889> to<00:03:07.980> prefer<00:03:08.099> natural<00:03:08.340> woods

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
them but I tend to prefer natural woods

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.459 
them but I tend to prefer natural woods
so<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:08.909> would<00:03:09.090> hate<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.299> have<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.629> red<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.349> wood

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
so I would hate to have a red and wood

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.949 
so I would hate to have a red and wood
on<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.769> side<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.400> more<00:03:12.060> natural<00:03:12.239> color<00:03:12.719> on

on one side in a more natural color on

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.050 
on one side in a more natural color on
the<00:03:13.049> other<00:03:13.079> but<00:03:13.829> just<00:03:14.129> got<00:03:14.430> lucky<00:03:14.819> on<00:03:14.849> these
