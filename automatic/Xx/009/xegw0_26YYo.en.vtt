 life of his friend tomás mackendrick giving slashes and hammer blows 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.960
 Then he sucked the wounds and ate part of his brain 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.380
 declared that the main character of the film the queen of the 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.320

 the source of life as an excuse for crime 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.120
 neither the crucifixes nor the heads of garlic can protect us from attack 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 of the murderous vampires 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.050
 our partner paco pérez caballero since this chronicle evan pines oaks 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.160
 real vampires 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.670
 a string of deranged dr 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.470
 a communist kinesiologist model flies a lot back to psychiatric cases one 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.450
 behind another 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.340
 the question is that what kind of body diagnoses is almost us 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.290
 indifferent if you want a psychosis grau personality disorder of marriage 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.110
 in practical cases and if no one's sane today or 200 years ago could do 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.470
 this 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.430
 between the madness and the does not cure it and a limit that does not put but by the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.320
 leather by the psychiatrist but in other times the inquisition 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.350
 flower if I was crazy I give you blood as an excuse 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.820
 the sanction of its excuse the headquarters is a pretext and the salt is the essence of the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.320
 lifetime 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.960
 and the supreme thing that there is human desire esquiú the own god of his blood 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.210
 to revive the chosen people 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.050
 it is a case of possession with the other to absorb the soul of the other 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.199
 pacts that we have seen 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.420
 drink the blood kill members of your blood 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.059
 because you move 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.649
 this moves from the most unconscious our client our brain theater 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.699
 primitive decide santín the one that is the life and therefore to eat the life of the 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.829
 another I owe his blood I do not like a finger 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.959
 he took me his serves to the essence of life in the field here the spirit 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.260
 federal said the blood goes the same 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.000
 the doctor one in principle the right to think 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.780
 in the blood as rush solution for an anemia problem for example is 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.410
 absurd because he believes the blood will go next door the knocker and gentleman to 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.900
 stomach where hydrochloric acid is produced that is going to produce all 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.030
 breaking of all of the whole system on the other hand we about why the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.489
 hemoglobin 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.019
 ap in the group started that brings you the oxygen tic's is responsible for the 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.760
 red color that has the blood that we have to do our liver the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.499
 porphyrias of the disease these porphyrins 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.629
 It has to do what our organism is, it does not admit that it comes from outside 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.889
 because you see that there is something else we know a transfusion of 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.729
 blood there are four groups years ela el ave el beti efe 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.359
 when you get off the blood transfusion as we make a mistake 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.049
 we charge the patient love your voice 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.340
 it would be absurd to think he felt that he is going to owe his blood that blood could 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.219
 serve him as an element I mean as medicine you fall apart from the subject 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.950
 spiritual 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.690
 does not have any the only reading that could be extemporaneous ferropenic 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.519
 has a little bit of iron through the area because they have given the ok 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.260
 absolviera but very little clear support blood of life already of loss 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.880
 and a sexual component we all see in these images 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.129
 that a component semillero tico and the next episode 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.239
 situation of the other that system let's see the blood is life the director was 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.639
 the monopolizing the other to a certain extent exposing his body and therefore 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.010
 exposure of their obligations as the male the more females have 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.979
 has more power 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.029
 and this is old 10 and this is from now because the blood also has a 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:08.999
 erotic vitality component of the erotic diesel in quotes is 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.299
 he decides if he mixes but there is a life and his music for it I think also 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.010
 you have to see a complic a deviation component 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.570
 if I say yes to the supposed aggressor that moved him, murderers 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.310
 they needed 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.890
 I do not know who told me that there is not a tribute and powerful cali with a 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:23.819
 assassin 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.020
 finally and the only way to have a choice 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.870
 let's go was was watching while the highest sea and shanghai airlines and so 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.150
 bushes is that some of these were perverse sexual ie subjects that 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.840
 they could not have an erection 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.410
 if it was not in such tragic conditions but little else when someone 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.640
 and if it has any origin because where more weight than disturbances the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.460
 psychic disturbance that we do not know its cause is inside the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.190
 brain subjects just like the fetish fedor manure that throws peace of 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.710
 women end perversions of these residence are less yes clear 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.360
 but this is clarified if really like some cases of good subject that 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.440
 strangled 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.390
 to the person who makes that was violating that generated the level of 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.240
 morazán the efe stimulus are now two vampires that had a great 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.460
 a big hole a demolition at the level of the romantic novel 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.210
 has the second life has risen crazy better said on the internet network where 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.069
 you no longer know what is true and what is the lie or the country the vampires things 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.009
 this can be a danger really love was I think I'm about to say to 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:18.680
 President 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.229
 p - the pp will be in agreement with me 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.829
 we have since now we have changed well we would not have 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.080
 little older 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.660
 classic as it has been said classic and faithful at the beginning I know what we have done 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.139
 so obviously costs us evidently with with we send them to 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.210
 We use the internet or the machine to work in my specific case but it must 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.680
 make our kids and you know they tell me the same thing is happening 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.039
 sedentary lifestyle the problem with this what we have in our boy that in 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.339
 Spain do not have to go abroad 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.009
 because they spend a lot of time in and what is also seen in the folder for the 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.309
 president in the computer then this makes them are closing socially 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:58.409
 they want me to believe that we are denouncing that modern beggar upyd 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.309
 rich or so the other was percent the closed out of the 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.059
 society because in fact the return of the human being the living being s is a man 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.939
 usually man is sociable by nature 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.550
 of competition from others to evolve 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.599
 if you are going away from sega solvent with the little flag 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.650
 a brain that he was taking is not yet a town because I think it is 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:22.059
 perfect breeding ground there is no voting with 107 there is a saying that all 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:25.199
 we know that when I go out the door he went to the devil and the red one 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:25.870
 clear window 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.850
 efe the man fills the absence of leaders of feelings in day of 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.860
 god of fetera 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.780
 with stories and the network is the ideal food for frustration and for 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.039
 normality despite knowing normal xix 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.900
 press that is terribly normal 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.029
 they are fed 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.210
 we work explanation of the network of doctor cabrera 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.180
 an important key in the moments of a certain pope before 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.470
 normal and now you can because before you had also coasts like as 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.860
 specialist in the best unique show wagon 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.270
 in the morgue in the brothel to the new king that maybe if he had no 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.999
 stimulus that broke glass was passed the expensive line 

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:00.290
 Now I'm like you have by law 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.270
 and this is putting training risk situation how can this be 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.990
 Obviously I am encouraging that total perversion has been lamented 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.620
