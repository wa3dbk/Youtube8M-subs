00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.180 

now<00:00:02.690> we're<00:00:02.870> going<00:00:03.020> to<00:00:03.080> look<00:00:03.260> at<00:00:03.350> the<00:00:03.470> loin<00:00:03.680> this

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
now we're going to look at the loin this

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.039 
now we're going to look at the loin this
is<00:00:04.399> traditionally<00:00:05.060> the<00:00:05.240> part<00:00:05.660> of<00:00:05.779> the<00:00:05.839> pig

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
is traditionally the part of the pig

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.019 
is traditionally the part of the pig
where<00:00:06.259> we<00:00:06.350> get<00:00:06.529> all<00:00:06.799> of<00:00:06.920> the<00:00:07.009> chops<00:00:07.310> from<00:00:07.580> but

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
where we get all of the chops from but

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.400 
where we get all of the chops from but
nowadays<00:00:08.299> there<00:00:08.750> are<00:00:08.870> other<00:00:08.960> things<00:00:09.200> that<00:00:09.320> we

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
nowadays there are other things that we

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.709 
nowadays there are other things that we
can<00:00:09.650> do<00:00:09.799> with<00:00:09.950> it<00:00:10.100> my<00:00:10.610> preference<00:00:11.090> is<00:00:11.209> reduce<00:00:11.690> a

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
can do with it my preference is reduce a

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.230 
can do with it my preference is reduce a
nice<00:00:11.959> rib<00:00:12.500> chop<00:00:12.830> with<00:00:13.190> the<00:00:13.280> rib<00:00:13.459> bone<00:00:13.670> in<00:00:13.940> so

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
nice rib chop with the rib bone in so

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.650 
nice rib chop with the rib bone in so
cut<00:00:14.660> between<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.020> rib<00:00:15.199> bones<00:00:15.410> clean-cut<00:00:16.660> so

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
cut between the rib bones clean-cut so

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.810 
cut between the rib bones clean-cut so
that's<00:00:17.869> our<00:00:18.140> rib<00:00:18.410> chop<00:00:18.769> it's<00:00:19.160> not<00:00:19.310> beautiful

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
that's our rib chop it's not beautiful

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.310 
that's our rib chop it's not beautiful
this<00:00:20.210> is<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:20.509> end<00:00:20.660> where<00:00:20.869> we've<00:00:21.050> got<00:00:21.230> our

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
this is the end where we've got our

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.259 
this is the end where we've got our
lumber<00:00:21.679> vertebra<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.460> we<00:00:22.609> can<00:00:22.789> produce<00:00:22.939> a

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
lumber vertebra and we can produce a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.419 
lumber vertebra and we can produce a
t-bone<00:00:23.720> steak<00:00:23.749> from<00:00:24.439> this<00:00:24.589> end<00:00:24.830> we'll<00:00:25.189> cut

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
t-bone steak from this end we'll cut

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.239 
t-bone steak from this end we'll cut
like<00:00:25.880> I<00:00:26.119> am<00:00:26.240> through<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:26.960> cartilage<00:00:27.589> discs<00:00:27.980> of

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
like I am through the cartilage discs of

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.880 
like I am through the cartilage discs of
the<00:00:28.310> vertebra<00:00:29.089> gently<00:00:29.599> saw<00:00:29.869> just<00:00:30.349> through<00:00:30.679> the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
the vertebra gently saw just through the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.100 
the vertebra gently saw just through the
bone<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:31.550> gives<00:00:31.880> us<00:00:31.999> our<00:00:32.180> beautiful

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
bone and that gives us our beautiful

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.439 
bone and that gives us our beautiful
t-bone<00:00:33.500> shot<00:00:34.039> then<00:00:34.850> we<00:00:34.940> go<00:00:35.059> on<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.329> the

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
t-bone shot then we go on to the

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.180 
t-bone shot then we go on to the
alternatives<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.379> first<00:00:36.649> of<00:00:36.770> all<00:00:36.829> I'm<00:00:37.010> going

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
alternatives and first of all I'm going

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.760 
alternatives and first of all I'm going
to<00:00:37.309> remove<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.149> Phillip<00:00:38.600> joint<00:00:38.899> I'm<00:00:39.289> using<00:00:39.620> a

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
to remove the Phillip joint I'm using a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.439 
to remove the Phillip joint I'm using a
point<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:40.190> knife<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:40.850> cutting<00:00:41.120> very

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
point of the knife and cutting very

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.420 
point of the knife and cutting very
close<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.020> backbone<00:00:42.469> strip<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.160> fill<00:00:43.340> it

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
close to the backbone strip the fill it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.660 
close to the backbone strip the fill it
away<00:00:43.960> really<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.079> superb<00:00:45.710> piece<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.460> meat

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
away really is a superb piece of meat

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.090 
away really is a superb piece of meat
very<00:00:47.059> versatile<00:00:47.690> not<00:00:48.260> everybody<00:00:48.620> wants<00:00:48.890> the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
very versatile not everybody wants the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.740 
very versatile not everybody wants the
level<00:00:49.579> of<00:00:49.670> fat<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:50.090> we've<00:00:50.210> got<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.510> these

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
level of fat that we've got on these

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.229 
level of fat that we've got on these
chops<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:51.710> I'm<00:00:51.859> going<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.160> just<00:00:52.640> reduce<00:00:52.820> that

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
chops so I'm going to just reduce that

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.240 
chops so I'm going to just reduce that
slightly<00:00:53.600> by<00:00:53.989> cutting<00:00:54.590> between<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:55.039> natural

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
slightly by cutting between the natural

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.580 
slightly by cutting between the natural
seam<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.090> back<00:00:56.239> fat<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.809> don't<00:00:57.170> want<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.410> cut

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
seam of the back fat I don't want to cut

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.529 
seam of the back fat I don't want to cut
into<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.980> lean<00:00:58.190> cutting<00:00:58.850> very<00:00:59.059> carefully

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
into the lean cutting very carefully

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.569 
into the lean cutting very carefully
down<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.989> seam<00:01:00.559> between<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.980> two<00:01:01.219> layers<00:01:01.399> of

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
down the seam between the two layers of

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.770 
down the seam between the two layers of
fat<00:01:02.000> yeah

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
fat yeah

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.900 
fat yeah
I'm<00:01:03.140> now<00:01:03.410> going<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.649> take<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.040> bones<00:01:04.280> out<00:01:04.489> and

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
I'm now going to take the bones out and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.090 
I'm now going to take the bones out and
I'm<00:01:05.000> using<00:01:05.270> a<00:01:05.630> sheet<00:01:05.990> butchery<00:01:06.560> technique

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
I'm using a sheet butchery technique

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.130 
I'm using a sheet butchery technique
which<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.880> cut<00:01:08.120> fairly<00:01:08.570> close<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
which is to cut fairly close to the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.810 
which is to cut fairly close to the
bones<00:01:09.410> but<00:01:09.710> I'm<00:01:09.800> not<00:01:09.950> worried<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:10.550> I<00:01:10.640> leave<00:01:10.790> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
bones but I'm not worried if I leave a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.250 
bones but I'm not worried if I leave a
little<00:01:11.000> piece<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.300> meat<00:01:11.870> on<00:01:12.050> those<00:01:12.200> bones

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
little piece of meat on those bones

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.650 
little piece of meat on those bones
because<00:01:13.070> they<00:01:13.220> will<00:01:13.430> actually<00:01:13.610> be<00:01:13.850> baby<00:01:14.330> back

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
because they will actually be baby back

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.320 
because they will actually be baby back
ribs<00:01:14.990> or<00:01:15.290> smaller<00:01:15.650> spareribs<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:16.850> really<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.300> a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
ribs or smaller spareribs it really is a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.210 
ribs or smaller spareribs it really is a
matter<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.750> just<00:01:17.990> staying<00:01:18.200> very<00:01:18.440> close<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:19.130> the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
matter of just staying very close to the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.040 
matter of just staying very close to the
bones<00:01:19.400> at<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.700> stage<00:01:19.940> what<00:01:20.390> we<00:01:20.540> do<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.750> later

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
bones at this stage what we do a later

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.950 
bones at this stage what we do a later
stage<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.620> make<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.160> cut<00:01:22.520> down<00:01:22.970> long<00:01:23.600> through

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
stage is make a cut down long through

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.960 
stage is make a cut down long through
the<00:01:24.050> joints<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.470> those<00:01:24.620> bones<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.250> then<00:01:25.700> that

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
the joints of those bones and then that

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.300 
the joints of those bones and then that
section<00:01:26.600> there<00:01:26.900> would<00:01:27.530> be<00:01:27.560> our<00:01:27.770> baby<00:01:28.010> back

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
section there would be our baby back

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.580 
section there would be our baby back
ribs<00:01:28.580> so<00:01:28.820> we'll<00:01:28.970> put<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.450> one<00:01:29.600> side<00:01:29.660> now

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
ribs so we'll put that to one side now

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.320 
ribs so we'll put that to one side now
we've<00:01:31.100> got<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.250> piece<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.610> meat<00:01:31.820> which<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.210> going

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
we've got a piece of meat which is going

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.630 
we've got a piece of meat which is going
to<00:01:32.420> make<00:01:32.570> some<00:01:32.750> superb<00:01:33.200> steaks<00:01:33.650> first<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:34.550> all
