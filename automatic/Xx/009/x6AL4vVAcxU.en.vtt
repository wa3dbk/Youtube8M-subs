web on both of these power supplies so
in<00:00:23.810> this<00:00:23.960> video<00:00:24.289> we're<00:00:24.500> going<00:00:24.680> to<00:00:24.740> focus

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
in this video we're going to focus

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.400 
in this video we're going to focus
primarily<00:00:25.220> on<00:00:25.730> what<00:00:26.029> you<00:00:26.150> get<00:00:26.300> inside<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.380> box

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
primarily on what you get inside the box

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.460 
primarily on what you get inside the box
and<00:00:27.949> some<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.550> unique<00:00:28.880> features<00:00:29.470> the

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
and some of the unique features the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.689 
and some of the unique features the
biggest<00:00:30.769> difference<00:00:31.070> between<00:00:31.130> these<00:00:31.490> two

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
biggest difference between these two

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.550 
biggest difference between these two
units<00:00:32.060> is<00:00:32.240> the<00:00:32.450> wattage<00:00:32.900> so<00:00:33.140> today<00:00:33.410> we're

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
units is the wattage so today we're

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.470 
units is the wattage so today we're
going<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.860> be<00:00:33.980> unboxing<00:00:34.310> the<00:00:34.670> 850<00:00:35.330> watt

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
going to be unboxing the 850 watt

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.380 
going to be unboxing the 850 watt
version<00:00:36.280> so<00:00:37.280> let's<00:00:37.490> go<00:00:37.580> ahead<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:37.850> get<00:00:38.300> this

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
version so let's go ahead and get this

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.940 
version so let's go ahead and get this
box<00:00:38.570> open<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.410> first<00:00:39.590> thing<00:00:39.740> you'll<00:00:39.830> see

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
box open so the first thing you'll see

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.040 
box open so the first thing you'll see
right<00:00:40.100> on<00:00:40.250> top<00:00:40.460> here<00:00:40.490> is<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.850> small<00:00:41.630> little<00:00:41.930> bag

power<00:01:37.520> connectors<00:01:37.970> chances<00:01:38.390> are<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:38.720> will

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
power connectors chances are you will

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.370 
power connectors chances are you will
need<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> couple<00:01:39.409> of<00:01:39.620> these<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:42.350> have

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
need a couple of these and we have

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.090 
need a couple of these and we have
another<00:01:42.770> CPU<00:01:43.100> power<00:01:43.490> connector<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.920> looks

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
another CPU power connector and it looks

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.090 
another CPU power connector and it looks
like<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.430> have<00:01:46.580> another<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.680> VGA<00:01:48.680> power

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
like we have another to VGA power

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.820 
like we have another to VGA power
connectors<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.000> lastly<00:01:50.870> another<00:01:50.990> SATA<00:01:51.500> power

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
connectors and lastly another SATA power

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.190 
connectors and lastly another SATA power
connector<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.270> certainly<00:01:53.659> should<00:01:53.840> be<00:01:53.960> enough

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
connector so certainly should be enough
