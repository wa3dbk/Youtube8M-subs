00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.720
 to make this wonder so many people 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 think it is difficult to judge a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.439
 very simple thing ten minutes into the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.050
 your kitchen without rain 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.940
 it looks that facility that is then the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.739
 clicks on the scene that I'm going to do as 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.899
 always put here in the description of the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.360
 video comes to us in time for the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.280
 video and will already put the first step 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 of the recipe that is nothing more than the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.690
 people prepared our pasta, let's go 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.120
 so let's start our recipe already 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.610
 I put two cups of water in the pan 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.699
 when I leave the fire on medium heat 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.289
 leaves average is what we do we 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.960
 will get our tablespoon of butter the salt 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:15.270
 Put it there Put it in the pan 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 Now salt can also spoon 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 sugar and people are stirring until it gives 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 of retina to understand even the butter 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 melt begins to melt 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.799
 So let's keep stirring until it gives a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.500
 of retina 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.350
 good so now that our water our 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.710
 the sugar and salt has already begun to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:46.170
 boil mix our blended flour 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.549
 little by little, even more so 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.790
 playing everything at once understood to play 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.360
 and jorge ben jawad the mix already stirs 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.479
 We will begin to form our dough and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.479
 already been stirring like that for five minutes 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.880
 the screen on the cooking leg 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.340
 5 to 10 minutes 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.650
 to tell you how much that merchant Joseph 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.349
 whole of the favela also in my case was 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.370
 It was quite fast and 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:26.170
 not even a piece of flour 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:33.730
 wheat understood my whole kitchen 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.709
 but it's good, so I moved by 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.019
 about three minutes I think 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.690
 She is already in a good position and not 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.849
 for approximately three minutes was the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.280
 neither the 5th nor the 10 could speak 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.290
 three minutes mine was already a good point 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.049
 that this point here, which no longer fights 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.489
 for anything in the pot also no longer 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.370
 have more pieces of wheat flour 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.799
 in her then now we go to the last 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.640
