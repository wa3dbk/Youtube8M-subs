00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
going to take it apart to actually

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.820 
going to take it apart to actually
figure<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> works<00:00:20.520> well<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.689> think<00:00:22.590> I

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830

know how it works is probably going to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.450

of<00:02:34.720> compresses<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.989> wonder<00:02:37.989> if<00:02:38.020> that's<00:02:38.200> not

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
of compresses so I wonder if that's not

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.199 
of compresses so I wonder if that's not
those<00:02:40.030> maybe<00:02:40.570> those<00:02:40.840> two<00:02:40.870> metal<00:02:41.530> rings

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
those maybe those two metal rings

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.970 
those maybe those two metal rings
touching<00:02:43.209> together<00:02:43.300> or<00:02:43.690> what<00:02:43.930> creates<00:02:44.830> the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
touching together or what creates the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.210 
touching together or what creates the
sound<00:02:45.190> I'm<00:02:45.519> not<00:02:45.820> sure<00:02:46.060> I'm<00:02:46.420> thinking<00:02:47.220> there's

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
sound I'm not sure I'm thinking there's

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.100 
sound I'm not sure I'm thinking there's
a<00:02:48.310> smaller<00:02:49.030> sensor<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.630> you're<00:02:49.750> I've<00:02:49.870> seen

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
a smaller sensor and you're I've seen

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.949 
a smaller sensor and you're I've seen
the<00:02:50.230> other<00:02:50.260> pads<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.890> how<00:02:50.980> they're<00:02:51.160> made

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
the other pads and how they're made

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.400 
the other pads and how they're made
like<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:54.300> cymbal<00:02:55.300> pads<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> snare<00:02:56.170> pads

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
like the cymbal pads and the snare pads

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.040 
like the cymbal pads and the snare pads
with<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.000> DTX<00:02:58.000> press<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.510> which<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.840> what<00:02:58.989> I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
with the DTX press to which is what I

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.220 
with the DTX press to which is what I
got<00:02:59.350> and<00:03:00.180> they<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.330> much<00:03:01.510> smaller<00:03:01.660> sensor

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
got and they have a much smaller sensor

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.020 
got and they have a much smaller sensor
in<00:03:02.319> there<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.680> I'm<00:03:03.190> taking<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.670> I'm<00:03:03.819> going<00:03:04.000> to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
in there so I'm taking it I'm going to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.330 
in there so I'm taking it I'm going to
take<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.300> apart<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.810> hope<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.410> that's

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
take this apart and hope that I that's

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.900 
take this apart and hope that I that's
what<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.519> find<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.850> here<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.709> prepared<00:03:08.709> this

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
what I find in here so I prepared this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.790 
what I find in here so I prepared this
razor<00:03:09.910> blade<00:03:10.269> so<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.080> can<00:03:11.260> cut<00:03:11.440> through<00:03:11.590> this

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
razor blade so I can cut through this

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.280 
razor blade so I can cut through this
thing<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.370> here<00:03:12.790> we<00:03:12.880> go<00:03:15.810> try<00:03:16.810> not<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:16.989> cut

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
thing so here we go try not to cut

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.759 
thing so here we go try not to cut
myself<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.980> process<00:03:19.350> fastings<00:03:20.350> not<00:03:20.590> that

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
myself in the process fastings not that

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:28.130 
myself in the process fastings not that
sharp

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:41.649 

alright<00:03:29.909> should<00:03:30.909> cut<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.239> enough<00:03:31.569> there

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659

new one actually I'm looking online
right<00:04:34.540> now<00:04:34.720> they're<00:04:34.900> not<00:04:34.930> too<00:04:35.830> expensive

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
right now they're not too expensive

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.510 
right now they're not too expensive
they're<00:04:36.729> about<00:04:38.430> $60<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.580> think<00:04:39.790> so<00:04:41.340> I'm<00:04:42.340> just

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
they're about $60 I think so I'm just

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.909 
they're about $60 I think so I'm just
going<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.900> pull<00:04:43.900> I'm<00:04:43.960> taking<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.470> apart<00:04:44.800> to

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
going to pull I'm taking this apart to

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.790 
going to pull I'm taking this apart to
see<00:04:45.040> if<00:04:45.430> it's<00:04:45.610> really<00:04:45.820> worth<00:04:46.000> it

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.219 

all<00:04:50.800> right<00:04:50.979> just<00:04:51.430> rip<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.910> last<00:04:52.200> piece<00:04:53.200> of

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
all right just rip the last piece of

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.540 
all right just rip the last piece of
foam<00:04:53.680> off<00:04:53.919> of<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.460> also<00:04:55.389> managed<00:04:55.960> to

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
foam off of it and also managed to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.480 
foam off of it and also managed to
unplug<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.790> looks<00:04:58.240> like<00:04:58.360> we<00:04:58.479> have<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.630> little

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
unplug it looks like we have a little

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.490 
unplug it looks like we have a little
little<00:05:00.490> connector<00:05:00.910> here<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:04.229> don't<00:05:05.229> know<00:05:05.440> how

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
little connector here I don't know how

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.960 
little connector here I don't know how
to<00:05:05.590> get<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.830> thing<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:06.130> focus<00:05:06.310> um<00:05:07.800> let's<00:05:08.800> see

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.360 

hmm<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.450> don't<00:05:13.930> know<00:05:15.090> well<00:05:16.090> anyway<00:05:17.100> here<00:05:18.100> we<00:05:18.160> go

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
hmm I don't know well anyway here we go

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.890 
hmm I don't know well anyway here we go
we<00:05:18.550> got<00:05:18.729> the<00:05:20.550> like<00:05:21.550> this<00:05:21.729> is<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.120> sensor<00:05:22.750> right

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
we got the like this is the sensor right

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.310 
we got the like this is the sensor right
here<00:05:25.110> yeah<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.850> think<00:05:27.850> that's<00:05:28.210> what<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.750> think

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
here yeah I think that's what I think

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.969 
here yeah I think that's what I think
that's<00:05:29.500> what<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:29.800> is

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
that's what it is

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.440 
that's what it is
so<00:05:32.280> hmm<00:05:34.110> okay

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
so hmm okay

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.510 
so hmm okay
this<00:05:37.450> thing<00:05:37.720> right<00:05:38.350> here<00:05:38.410> just<00:05:39.220> a<00:05:39.660> hollow<00:05:40.660> hole

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
this thing right here just a hollow hole

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.660 
this thing right here just a hollow hole
so<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:42.610> can<00:05:42.760> see<00:05:43.030> there<00:05:43.270> it's<00:05:43.840> about<00:05:44.670> well

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
so you can see there it's about well

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.520 
so you can see there it's about well
goes<00:05:45.940> from<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.930> see<00:05:47.110> my<00:05:47.260> finger<00:05:47.710> going<00:05:48.640> in<00:05:48.850> it

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
goes from and see my finger going in it

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.870 
goes from and see my finger going in it
it's<00:05:50.530> probably<00:05:50.860> about<00:05:51.040> I<00:05:51.960> don't<00:05:52.960> know<00:05:53.880> one

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
it's probably about I don't know one

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.580 
it's probably about I don't know one
inch<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.270> half<00:05:55.330> deep<00:05:56.820> but<00:05:58.020> this<00:05:59.020> part<00:05:59.410> right

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
inch and a half deep but this part right

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.750 
inch and a half deep but this part right
here<00:06:01.020> connects<00:06:02.020> into<00:06:02.350> that<00:06:02.500> somehow<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:03.220> didn't

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
here connects into that somehow I didn't

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.340 
here connects into that somehow I didn't
see<00:06:03.940> it<00:06:04.060> I<00:06:04.210> didn't<00:06:04.480> see<00:06:04.510> where<00:06:04.750> it<00:06:04.870> came<00:06:05.050> from

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
see it I didn't see where it came from

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:12.270 
see it I didn't see where it came from
exactly<00:06:05.590> let<00:06:06.220> me<00:06:06.310> look<00:06:06.550> oh<00:06:10.470> you<00:06:11.470> know<00:06:11.680> what<00:06:11.860> I

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
exactly let me look oh you know what I

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.220 
exactly let me look oh you know what I
see<00:06:12.730> it<00:06:12.850> there's<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.270> there's<00:06:13.720> a<00:06:13.780> connector<00:06:14.140> on

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
see it there's a there's a connector on

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.000 
see it there's a there's a connector on
the<00:06:14.260> bottom<00:06:14.910> looking<00:06:15.910> at<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.120> back<00:06:16.300> it's<00:06:16.570> uh

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
the bottom looking at the back it's uh

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.080 
the bottom looking at the back it's uh
it's<00:06:18.010> the<00:06:18.130> same<00:06:18.370> bottom<00:06:18.730> where<00:06:18.850> all<00:06:18.880> these

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
it's the same bottom where all these

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.850 
it's the same bottom where all these
controls<00:06:20.020> are<00:06:20.230> so<00:06:20.970> yeah<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.150> makes<00:06:22.330> sense

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
controls are so yeah that makes sense

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.140 
controls are so yeah that makes sense
well<00:06:23.860> I<00:06:24.160> don't<00:06:24.430> think<00:06:24.640> I'm<00:06:24.700> going<00:06:24.820> to<00:06:24.880> take<00:06:25.030> it

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
well I don't think I'm going to take it

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.640 
well I don't think I'm going to take it
apart<00:06:25.240> any<00:06:25.660> further<00:06:25.930> than<00:06:26.170> this<00:06:26.260> I<00:06:26.470> don't

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
apart any further than this I don't

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.750 
apart any further than this I don't
there's<00:06:26.890> really<00:06:27.010> nothing<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:27.490> can<00:06:27.550> do<00:06:27.850> here<00:06:28.150> on

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
there's really nothing I can do here on

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.090 
there's really nothing I can do here on
the<00:06:30.760> side<00:06:31.000> well<00:06:31.390> actually<00:06:31.540> if<00:06:31.930> I<00:06:32.080> managed<00:06:33.070> to

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
the side well actually if I managed to

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:39.030 
the side well actually if I managed to
pry<00:06:33.430> this<00:06:33.490> uh<00:06:33.730> oh<00:06:35.190> I<00:06:36.190> just<00:06:36.490> like<00:06:37.950> okay<00:06:38.950> I<00:06:38.980> don't

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
pry this uh oh I just like okay I don't

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.480 
pry this uh oh I just like okay I don't
know<00:06:39.280> that<00:06:39.430> that<00:06:39.880> came<00:06:40.090> off<00:06:40.270> well<00:06:41.190> okay<00:06:42.190> let's

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
know that that came off well okay let's

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.720 
know that that came off well okay let's
take<00:06:42.670> a<00:06:42.700> better<00:06:42.910> look<00:06:42.970> at<00:06:43.210> this<00:06:43.420> ah<00:06:44.730> yeah

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
take a better look at this ah yeah

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.970 
take a better look at this ah yeah
there's<00:06:45.970> the<00:06:46.120> connector<00:06:46.510> right<00:06:46.630> there<00:06:46.690> and

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.710 

let's<00:06:50.980> see<00:06:51.280> it<00:06:51.370> says<00:06:51.400> Yamaha<00:06:54.000> number<00:06:55.000> one<00:06:55.270> zero

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
let's see it says Yamaha number one zero

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.820 
let's see it says Yamaha number one zero
two<00:06:55.780> two<00:06:56.020> and<00:06:56.860> some<00:06:57.250> other<00:06:57.400> stuff<00:06:58.830> little

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
two two and some other stuff little

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.760 
two two and some other stuff little
volume<00:07:00.040> knob<00:07:00.340> here<00:07:00.730> and<00:07:01.350> yeah<00:07:02.350> that's<00:07:02.590> pretty

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
volume knob here and yeah that's pretty

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.510 
volume knob here and yeah that's pretty
much<00:07:02.890> it<00:07:03.220> so<00:07:04.290> well<00:07:05.290> it's<00:07:05.770> broken<00:07:06.070> now

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
much it so well it's broken now

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.850 
much it so well it's broken now
guess<00:07:06.760> I'll<00:07:06.940> beating<00:07:07.240> me<00:07:07.450> a<00:07:07.480> new<00:07:07.720> one<00:07:07.900> I<00:07:08.140> needed

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
guess I'll beating me a new one I needed

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.000 
guess I'll beating me a new one I needed
a<00:07:08.920> new<00:07:09.070> one<00:07:09.220> anyway<00:07:09.400> because<00:07:09.850> it<00:07:10.240> was<00:07:10.270> uh<00:07:11.010> well

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010 
a new one anyway because it was uh well

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.300 
a new one anyway because it was uh well
see<00:07:12.310> what<00:07:12.430> had<00:07:12.550> happened<00:07:12.580> was<00:07:13.770> it<00:07:14.770> managed<00:07:15.190> to

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
see what had happened was it managed to

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.390 
see what had happened was it managed to
lose<00:07:15.490> some<00:07:16.290> responsiveness<00:07:17.290> I<00:07:17.740> don't<00:07:17.950> know<00:07:18.070> if

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
lose some responsiveness I don't know if

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.830 
lose some responsiveness I don't know if
you<00:07:18.670> guys<00:07:18.790> have<00:07:19.060> had<00:07:19.150> the<00:07:19.300> same<00:07:19.450> problem<00:07:19.810> that

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
you guys have had the same problem that

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.320 
you guys have had the same problem that
I<00:07:19.930> have<00:07:20.200> with<00:07:20.340> this<00:07:21.340> thing<00:07:21.550> just<00:07:21.760> taking<00:07:22.120> such

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
I have with this thing just taking such

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.200 
I have with this thing just taking such
a<00:07:22.360> beating<00:07:22.780> that<00:07:22.930> it<00:07:23.680> hasn't<00:07:24.640> been<00:07:24.910> as

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
a beating that it hasn't been as

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.390 
a beating that it hasn't been as
responsive<00:07:25.390> as<00:07:25.900> it<00:07:26.050> was<00:07:26.230> when<00:07:26.440> I<00:07:26.680> first<00:07:27.100> bought

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
responsive as it was when I first bought

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.470 
responsive as it was when I first bought
it<00:07:27.460> so<00:07:28.440> that's<00:07:29.440> why<00:07:29.620> I'm<00:07:29.740> needing<00:07:30.010> a<00:07:30.070> new<00:07:30.220> one

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:30.480 
it so that's why I'm needing a new one

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.750 
it so that's why I'm needing a new one
I'm<00:07:31.480> actually<00:07:31.750> getting<00:07:31.990> a<00:07:32.170> new<00:07:32.410> a<00:07:32.620> new<00:07:33.520> pedal

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.100 
too I could just get a new matt mallet

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.610 
too I could just get a new matt mallet
for<00:07:36.370> my<00:07:36.520> pedal<00:07:36.790> but<00:07:37.030> I<00:07:37.330> really<00:07:38.080> don't<00:07:38.200> like<00:07:38.410> the

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620 
for my pedal but I really don't like the

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.690 
for my pedal but I really don't like the
pedal<00:07:38.950> it's<00:07:39.250> um<00:07:40.320> I've<00:07:41.320> played<00:07:42.010> better<00:07:42.310> pedals

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700 
pedal it's um I've played better pedals
