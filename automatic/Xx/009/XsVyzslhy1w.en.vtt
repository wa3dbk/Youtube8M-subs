00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
really well executed and refined and so

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.900 
really well executed and refined and so
there's<00:03:08.680> very<00:03:08.980> very<00:03:09.040> little<00:03:09.250> talked<00:03:09.700> about

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
and how it performs on the motorcycle

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.900 
and how it performs on the motorcycle
because<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.920> doesn't<00:03:12.130> do<00:03:12.190> anything<00:03:12.370> wrong<00:03:13.860> but

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
because it doesn't do anything wrong but

injuries<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.240> we're<00:03:40.330> gonna<00:03:40.420> hit<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.660> in

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
injuries and we're gonna hit that in

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.950 
injuries and we're gonna hit that in
another<00:03:41.050> video<00:03:41.580> but<00:03:42.580> just<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.970> general<00:03:43.000> you

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
another video but just in general you

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.830 
another video but just in general you
know<00:03:44.440> they<00:03:44.710> really<00:03:45.070> really<00:03:45.520> nailed<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:46.000> in<00:03:46.510> in

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
know they really really nailed it in in

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.140 
know they really really nailed it in in
this<00:03:47.230> particular<00:03:47.800> category<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:48.820> now<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
this particular category this is now the
