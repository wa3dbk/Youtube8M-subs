00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
here you can get the regular sniper

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.670 
here you can get the regular sniper
rifle<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.840> heavy<00:00:25.140> sniper

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
rifle or the heavy sniper

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.890 
rifle or the heavy sniper
I<00:00:25.710> recommend<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> heavy<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> heavy

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
I recommend this the heavy but the heavy

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.830 
I recommend this the heavy but the heavy
you<00:00:28.140> unlock<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.619> level<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.189> think<00:00:29.699> 90<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
you unlock at level I think 90 and the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.990 
you unlock at level I think 90 and the
regular<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.320> unlock<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:31.859> early<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.399> if

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
regular you unlock it really early so if

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.580 
regular you unlock it really early so if
you're<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.360> level<00:00:33.540> 90<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you're not level 90 I just get the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.979 
you're not level 90 I just get the
regular<00:00:34.739> sniper<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> heavy<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.719> can

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
regular sniper but the heavy if you can

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.180 
regular sniper but the heavy if you can
unlock<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.680> unlocked<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
unlock if you have it unlocked I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.500 
unlock if you have it unlocked I
recommend<00:00:38.670> getting<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.090> way<00:00:39.210> stronger

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
recommend getting that it's way stronger

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.229 
recommend getting that it's way stronger
usually<00:00:39.960> one-shot<00:00:40.290> kill<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> once<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> have

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
usually one-shot kill so once you have

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
usually one-shot kill so once you have
