I<00:00:02.699> got<00:00:03.419> high<00:00:04.259> look<00:00:04.979> I<00:00:05.069> just<00:00:05.250> watched<00:00:05.430> Jim

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
I got high look I just watched Jim

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.830 
I got high look I just watched Jim
humbles<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.870> method<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.559> making<00:00:07.769> scene<00:00:08.250> yes<00:00:08.840> are

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
humbles a method of making scene yes are

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.799 
humbles a method of making scene yes are
using<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.290> Bailey<00:00:10.500> Hockman<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:13.099> two<00:00:14.099> hoses

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
using a Bailey Hockman to two hoses

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.510 
using a Bailey Hockman to two hoses
after<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> wrong<00:00:16.190> it's<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> bit

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
after the wrong it's all a bit

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.270 
after the wrong it's all a bit
complicated<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.420> came<00:00:18.660> up<00:00:18.780> with<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.990> idea

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
complicated so I came up with this idea

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.300 
complicated so I came up with this idea
what<00:00:20.280> I've<00:00:20.400> done<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.450> 24<00:00:21.930> drops<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.410> MMS

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
what I've done is up for 24 drops of MMS

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.160 
what I've done is up for 24 drops of MMS
with<00:00:24.300> 24<00:00:24.690> drops<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.140> citric<00:00:25.530> in<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:27.890> serene

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
with 24 drops of citric in this serene

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.619 
with 24 drops of citric in this serene
face<00:00:31.170> tip<00:00:31.410> down<00:00:31.530> that<00:00:31.770> way<00:00:32.210> made<00:00:33.210> sure<00:00:33.480> that

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
face tip down that way made sure that

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.550 
face tip down that way made sure that
the<00:00:33.780> outlets<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.379> the<00:00:34.500> top<00:00:34.850> put<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.290> MMS<00:00:37.290> in

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
the outlets to the top put the MMS in

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.670 
the outlets to the top put the MMS in
and<00:00:37.800> let<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:37.980> react<00:00:38.510> immediately<00:00:39.650> put<00:00:40.650> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and let it react immediately put the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.400 
and let it react immediately put the
plunger<00:00:41.100> back<00:00:41.130> in<00:00:41.489> tipped<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.360> stuck<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
plunger back in tipped it up stuck the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.900 
plunger back in tipped it up stuck the
needle<00:00:43.560> on<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.290> then<00:00:46.290> put<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> cap<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
needle on and then put the cap on and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.889 
needle on and then put the cap on and
basically<00:00:48.840> left<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.290> about<00:00:50.149> that<00:00:51.149> much

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
basically left it about that much

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.889 
basically left it about that much
capacity<00:00:52.610> then<00:00:53.610> when<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> could<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
capacity then when I could see that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.340 
capacity then when I could see that
there<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.260> gas<00:00:55.680> definitely<00:00:56.220> building<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.700> and

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.570 

it<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.800> obviously<00:01:02.250> there's<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
it look like obviously there's a bit of

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.490 
it look like obviously there's a bit of
pressure<00:01:02.790> going<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.240> I<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:03.720> plunge<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
pressure going up I then plunge the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.000 
pressure going up I then plunge the
needle<00:01:05.360> into<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.720> water<00:01:06.990> bowl<00:01:07.290> through<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
needle into the water bowl through the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.470 
needle into the water bowl through the
cap<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.150> go

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
cap so there we go

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.770 
cap so there we go
so<00:01:09.810> clenched<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> syringe<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.480> water

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
so clenched the syringe into the water

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.760 
so clenched the syringe into the water
bottle<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:14.070> tipped<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.610> upside<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.770> like

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
bottle then tipped it upside down like

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.250 
bottle then tipped it upside down like
that<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> weight<00:01:19.230> of

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
that and then just with the weight of

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.890 
that and then just with the weight of
the<00:01:19.410> water<00:01:19.620> bottle<00:01:20.010> if<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.760> can<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.390> air

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the water bottle if you can see the air

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.460 
the water bottle if you can see the air
bubbles<00:01:23.180> push<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.510> gas<00:01:25.250> into<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.520> water<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
bubbles push the gas into the water and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.890 
bubbles push the gas into the water and
there's<00:01:28.470> zero<00:01:28.620> loss<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.150> noticed

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
there's zero loss this way I noticed

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.330 
there's zero loss this way I noticed
with<00:01:31.020> Jim's<00:01:31.290> video<00:01:31.620> that<00:01:31.860> there<00:01:32.010> was<00:01:32.100> gas

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
with Jim's video that there was gas

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
with Jim's video that there was gas
coming<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.479> top<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> bottle<00:01:34.200> me

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
coming out the top of the bottle me

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.680 
coming out the top of the bottle me
because<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> cap<00:01:35.100> wasn't<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.660> I

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
because the cap wasn't on and so I

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.120 
because the cap wasn't on and so I
reck'n'd<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.110> wasting<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.650> gas<00:01:37.920> with

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
reck'n'd was wasting a lot of gas with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.310 
reck'n'd was wasting a lot of gas with
big<00:01:38.310> bubbles<00:01:38.670> these<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.390> tiny<00:01:39.630> bubbles<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
big bubbles these are tiny bubbles and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.300 
big bubbles these are tiny bubbles and
the<00:01:41.310> gas<00:01:41.550> has<00:01:41.850> nowhere<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:43.220> except<00:01:44.220> into

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the gas has nowhere to go except into

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
the gas has nowhere to go except into
the<00:01:44.610> enclosed<00:01:44.970> space<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> sealed<00:01:45.780> bottle

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the enclosed space of the sealed bottle

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.390 
the enclosed space of the sealed bottle
so<00:01:46.740> there's<00:01:46.920> no<00:01:47.070> there's<00:01:47.430> no<00:01:47.580> gas<00:01:48.170> escaping

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
so there's no there's no gas escaping

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.040 
so there's no there's no gas escaping
into<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.610> outside<00:01:51.000> air<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.570> noticed<00:01:51.900> with

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
into the outside air like I noticed with

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.800 
into the outside air like I noticed with
Jim's<00:01:52.320> method<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.940> it's<00:01:54.210> Bobby

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
Jim's method and it's Bobby

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
Jim's method and it's Bobby
you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.229> Jeff's<00:01:55.530> methods<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.070> bit<00:01:56.250> cumbersome

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you know Jeff's methods a bit cumbersome

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
you know Jeff's methods a bit cumbersome
this<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.510> absolutely<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> hundred<00:01:58.440> percent

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
this is absolutely a hundred percent

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.780 
this is absolutely a hundred percent
efficient

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
efficient

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.380 
efficient
you<00:02:00.630> are<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.930> losing<00:02:01.170> any<00:02:01.680> gas<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.400> way<00:02:02.640> it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you are not losing any gas this way it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
you are not losing any gas this way it's
coming<00:02:03.720> out<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.260> syringe<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:05.370> you<00:02:05.580> can<00:02:05.700> see

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
coming out of syringe as you can see

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.180 
coming out of syringe as you can see
it's<00:02:06.030> bubbling<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.900> bottle<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
it's bubbling into the bottle and when I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.700 
it's bubbling into the bottle and when I
get<00:02:08.310> close<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> top<00:02:09.240> I<00:02:09.510> stopped<00:02:10.140> short<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
get close to the top I stopped short of

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.470 
get close to the top I stopped short of
allowing<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> liquid<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.820> go<00:02:11.970> up<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.330> there

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
allowing the liquid to go up in there

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.510 
allowing the liquid to go up in there
and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.260> tip<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.530> up<00:02:13.620> there's<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> bit<00:02:14.460> of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
and then just tip it up there's a bit of

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.640 
and then just tip it up there's a bit of
back<00:02:14.640> pressure<00:02:14.850> there<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:16.020> look<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
back pressure there but look at that and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.780 
back pressure there but look at that and
see<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.890> color<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.280> water<00:02:17.550> that's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
see the color of that water that's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.230 
see the color of that water that's
definitely<00:02:18.420> charged<00:02:18.980> that's<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.970> caught

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
definitely charged that's now we caught

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.980 
definitely charged that's now we caught
CES<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.700> we've<00:02:23.700> used<00:02:23.880> 24<00:02:24.330> drops<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.960> a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
CES and we've used 24 drops but I have a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.860 
CES and we've used 24 drops but I have a
suspicion<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.940> using<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.300> probably

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
suspicion that using this way probably

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.320 
suspicion that using this way probably
get<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.440> say<00:02:28.620> 15<00:02:29.010> drops<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.520> still<00:02:30.210> get

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
get down to say 15 drops and still get

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970 
get down to say 15 drops and still get
the<00:02:30.360> same<00:02:30.450> effect<00:02:30.960> what<00:02:31.320> about<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.680> water's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the same effect what about that water's

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.520 
the same effect what about that water's
totally<00:02:32.400> change<00:02:33.090> color<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> fresh

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
totally change color but the fresh

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.050 
totally change color but the fresh
bottled<00:02:34.860> water<00:02:35.010> from<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> shop<00:02:35.520> was<00:02:35.760> cleared

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
bottled water from the shop was cleared

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.920 
bottled water from the shop was cleared
now<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.110> yellow<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.240> it's<00:02:39.240> all<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.780> been

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
now it's yellow and it's all just been

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.890 
now it's yellow and it's all just been
done<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.350> syringe<00:02:40.710> that's<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.820> no<00:02:42.690> more

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
done with a syringe that's it no more

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.010 
done with a syringe that's it no more
baby<00:02:43.110> bulbs<00:02:43.530> no<00:02:44.250> more<00:02:44.490> two<00:02:44.730> hoses<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.810> we'll

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
baby bulbs no more two hoses now we'll

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.720 
baby bulbs no more two hoses now we'll
have<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.320> blow<00:02:46.560> through<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.130> baby<00:02:47.280> bottle

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
have to blow through the baby bottle

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.780 
have to blow through the baby bottle
into<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.150> bowl<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.630> do<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.640> a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
into the bowl just do this this is a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.320 
into the bowl just do this this is a

because<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.970> bowls<00:03:00.180> upside<00:03:00.600> down<00:03:00.840> gets

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
because the bowls upside down gets
