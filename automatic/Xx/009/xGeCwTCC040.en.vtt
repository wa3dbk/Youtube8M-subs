 [Music] 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 the case is we are going to present today is the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 case of a dog of one though 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.580
 developed a picture of vomiting in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.670
 beginning 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.400
 vomiting uncommon and that were 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.920
 evolving in time to moments 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.810
 much more frequent and they responded 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.160
 less to the medications that we were going 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.570
 giving 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.210
 [Music] 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.600
 I did not have diarrhea 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.329
 and it was a little material vomit 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.820
 digested not immediate 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.090
 well we are populations to enter 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.570
 in diagnostic protocol 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.390
 [Music] 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.980
 an old gastric problem 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.960
 we discard any type of d 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.120
 of possibility of including the neoplasia 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.410
 a transit of several was made 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 that there was a very slow 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.739
 important in leaving the neighborhood 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.420
 even a narrowing in this exit 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.760
 I just went to the neighborhood that was pretty 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.350
 liquid that gave us an idea that 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.980
 there could be an alteration in the area 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.690
 pylori here 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.159
 we did an ultrasound on ultrasound 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.890
 he confirmed that there was 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:23.700
 a certain inflammation antro pylori co 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.620
 but it did not have a neoclassical image asia 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.600
 initially 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.980
 finally we went to find a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.250
 accurate diagnosis for which 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.460
 We indicate a flexible endoscopy for 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.170
 perform an inspection of the stomach of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.180
 the shooting area and a sampling 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.850
 the sampling confirmed us the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.140
 Initial suspicion a hyperplasia of the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.240
 mucosa of lorica at the base of the pylorus 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.310
 certainly it was surprising how closed 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.210
 that the pilot was at this point in 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.259
 the case was between 4 and 6 months 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.259
 since he started 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.210
 well we decided once we had the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.039
 result of the pathology of the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.220
 samples and crops that we 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.800
 confirmed 'helicobacter pylori' 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.090
 We decided to address the case with a stack 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.740
 non-plastic we had several options 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.140
 we had the option of making a minor or 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.350
 plasty or we would have the option of doing 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.560
 a gastrostomy 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.790
 the option of gastronomy in 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.849
 veterinary really 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.680
 the results are very good and it seems 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.390
 be that the studios say it does not stop 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.180
 sequels but the truth is that the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.640
 biography in humans 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.260
 speaks of a series of cases in which 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.260
 duodenal ulcers occur 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.130
 there are comparative studies that say that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.680
 in dogs it does not happen but the truth is 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.150
 that we are bridging with this surgery 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.410
 because we have the pancreas and it's from 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.500
 pancreas is still working follow 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.820
 forming acids in a digestive tube in 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.750
 the one that there is absolutely no 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.260
 content 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.269
 by logic a bit 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.250
 and assessing the case we thought it would be 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.010
 a better choice but spend as 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.560
 we had discarded processes 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.540
 neoplastic and we had the agent cause 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.439
 we have identified the causal agent of 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.500
 this person gets stung and we're going to try 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.470
 right away 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.320
 the first part that we chose 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.140
 we have several options we had the ue 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.700
 we did not have the fitness cake but 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.410
 We chose the first part we found 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.050
 easier in the first instance than 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.320
 would be base to the first plasty of 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.320
 Heineken 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320
 sorry 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.069
 it's worse than it is at the beginning 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.430
 consists of making a cut along 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.750
 Longitudinal axis of the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.110
 pylorus and transform it into a structure 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.820
 perpendicular to this axis 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.680
 in the first instance it seems a technique 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.540
 very simple indeed but as far as 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.310
 you start doing the one you find 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.880
 you belonged to it prioritizes it 's very big 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.150
 as in this case 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.550
 has its difficulty what logic has its 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.590
 surgical difficulty because the tissue 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.380
 It is very fibrous with fibrous nostrils 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.770
 great and good can cost a 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.390
 little bit but at the beginning we're going to 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.100
 try to do this technique and always 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.100
 we can choose to change 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.270
 let's do a but plastic 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.919
 hayley miccoli 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.300
 first we make the incision 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.300
 classic by the middle line 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.510
 we will locate the chlorine 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.920
 we will make a longitudinal section to what 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.210
 length of the longitudinal axis of the pylorus 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.970
 to transform it into a structure 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.650
 transverse with it we will get a 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.480
 correction of pylori stenosis here 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.160
 that as I explained earlier in 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.770
 this case is a stenosis 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.740
 pylori here because of mucosal hypertrophy 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.510
 of the high pylon and with due to the action 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.150
 of a bacteria from a bacterium called 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.590
 'helicobacter pylori' little diagnosed 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.590
 in veterinary by the way 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.529
 [Music] 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.870
 [Music] 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.409
 this animal of this bitch had already been 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.249
 previously by an ovary of a 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.800
 vasectomy 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:39.480
 it is too important but 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.960
 here as you see the remains of structures 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.960
 toward 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.789
 45 years is operated 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.830
 we have worked with a surgical field 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:01.670
 that is comfortable for us to have a good 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.670
 get a good surgical technique 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.309
 [Music] 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.500
 [Music] 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.940
 as you see here 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.840
 we have the stomach 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.760
 do not be comfortable 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.760
 very important to work comfortable and 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.040
 the support of a unit 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.100
 electromedicine always gives us 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.870
 Electrosurgery always allows us 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.860
 work with a much cleaner field and 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.860
 It is much more comfortable 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.980
 [Music] 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.980
 breathe here to the fullest 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.310
 good 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.220
 you see here we have the divisions we have 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.500
 butt bladder very full the 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.900
 Stomach curvature of the stomach 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.260
 curvature less the angle of the 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:25.440
 curvature minor travel 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.110
 anthropological will come here pylorus 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.220
 descending duodenum with your pancreas here 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.140
 we would have several surgical options 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.910
 we have put swan cake and 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.910
 we could do one but plasty
