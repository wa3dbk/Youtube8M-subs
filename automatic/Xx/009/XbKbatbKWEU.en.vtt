00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
just release me in the at same point so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.599 
just release me in the at same point so
it<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.799> form<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.789> dot<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:19.340> structure<00:01:22.609> see

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
it will form a dot like structure see

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.349 
it will form a dot like structure see
how<00:01:23.880> beautiful<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:26.549> second<00:01:27.119> way

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
how beautiful is this in the second way

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:33.080 
how beautiful is this in the second way
I<00:01:27.689> will<00:01:28.380> fill<00:01:28.859> this<00:01:29.429> maze<00:01:29.929> with<00:01:31.340> by<00:01:32.340> filling

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I will fill this maze with by filling

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.580 
I will fill this maze with by filling
mainly<00:01:33.569> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.079> squares<00:01:34.549> alternatively

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
mainly in the squares alternatively

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
mainly in the squares alternatively
alternately<00:01:37.590> sorry<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.099> will<00:01:41.429> release<00:01:41.939> some

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
mainly from the cone now since I have

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.959 
mainly from the cone now since I have
filled<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.969> circle<00:01:48.569> this<00:01:48.869> square<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.530> will

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
filled this circle this square I will

00:01:49.969 --> 00:02:00.830 
filled this circle this square I will
fill<00:01:50.969> this<00:01:52.069> alternate<00:01:53.689> square<00:01:59.000> now<00:02:00.000> since<00:02:00.629> I

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
fill this alternate square now since I

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
fill this alternate square now since I
have<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.349> these<00:02:01.739> two<00:02:02.099> I<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.549> now<00:02:02.759> fill<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
have with these two I will now fill this

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:12.309 
have with these two I will now fill this
one<00:02:07.910> again<00:02:08.910> alternate<00:02:09.509> square<00:02:10.049> for<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.619> is

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
one again alternate square for this is

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:36.870 
one again alternate square for this is
this<00:02:13.319> square<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.670> will<00:02:15.239> fill<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.690> one

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.200 

by<00:02:37.420> filling<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.200> these<00:02:38.830> squares<00:02:39.520> like<00:02:39.940> this

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
by filling this these squares like this

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.330 
by filling this these squares like this
you<00:02:40.450> will<00:02:40.630> get<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.110> structure<00:02:41.500> like<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:41.950> chess

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
you will get a structure like a chess

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.720 
you will get a structure like a chess
board<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.110> can<00:02:44.200> call<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:44.950> main<00:02:45.280> details

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
board so you can call it main details

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.220 
board so you can call it main details
board<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.910> third<00:02:52.210> way<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.720> I'm<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:53.140> to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
board in the third way that I'm going to

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.930 
board in the third way that I'm going to
show<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.620> we<00:02:54.430> will<00:02:54.600> fill<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:56.020> maze<00:02:56.680> by<00:02:57.250> doing

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
show you we will fill this maze by doing

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:07.890 
show you we will fill this maze by doing
a<00:02:58.380> big<00:02:59.380> dot<00:02:59.890> on<00:03:00.810> each<00:03:02.250> intersecting<00:03:03.250> line<00:03:06.900> once

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
a big dot on each intersecting line once

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.720 
a big dot on each intersecting line once
these<00:03:08.200> tutorials<00:03:08.920> are<00:03:09.100> complete<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:09.580> will

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
these tutorials are complete you will

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.840 
these tutorials are complete you will
see<00:03:10.210> how<00:03:10.930> we<00:03:10.990> can<00:03:11.440> use<00:03:11.710> these<00:03:12.100> different<00:03:12.370> types

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
see how we can use these different types

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.700 
see how we can use these different types
of<00:03:13.090> shapes<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.690> actual<00:03:14.200> main<00:03:14.440> D<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:16.710> keep

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
of shapes in actual main D so keep

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:35.890 
of shapes in actual main D so keep
practicing

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.880 

see<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.770> first<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.340> with<00:03:38.580> simple<00:03:39.360> dots

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
see the first one with simple dots

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.330 
see the first one with simple dots
second<00:03:40.890> Mays<00:03:41.819> like<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.330> chessboard<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.380> simple

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
second Mays like a chessboard and simple

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.240 
second Mays like a chessboard and simple
third<00:03:45.330> one<00:03:45.569> also<00:03:45.750> simple<00:03:46.410> with<00:03:46.650> dots<00:03:46.980> on

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
third one also simple with dots on

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.990 
third one also simple with dots on
intersecting<00:03:47.970> lines<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.890> would<00:03:50.700> recommend

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
intersecting lines so I would recommend

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.080
