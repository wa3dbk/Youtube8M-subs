00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.900
 hello and now comes to a new one 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.920
 video on the third installment of rank review 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.260
 to be exact 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 why should go? why is this? 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.740
 this time it's about the filmstädter 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 Just start looking at it 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.530
 the purchase from the front 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.450
 that's how it looks from your side 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.930
 I'll use it like that 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.470
 bad, let's just catch it 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.470
 With 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.950
 this time it's basically not at all 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.770
 around each other but when you look at it completely 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.379
 it is exactly the time was 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.500
 this was written by dark 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.930
 ion in a South Korean maneuver 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.790
 draftsman some in this country 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.490
 maybe know by china monji 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.220
 said long as well as the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.750
 window wants and many more 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.750
 in vienna in cooperation with 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.340
 jörg winger created which malt the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.890
 was responsible for the designations 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.950
 after quite successful in one shot 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.649
 akuma benq kavala, so to speak 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.170
 prototype yes a pilot manga of the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.450
 darker is if you will 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.860
 and by the way, like many other works 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.360
 not yet in germany 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.090
 has appeared 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.340
 thanks, the two did not open well 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.580
 to revisit that concept and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.720
 to make a right series out of it 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.800
 then practically the result was 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.020
 sinister the dam airbus 2009 insurance 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.280
 trade has appeared and that two years 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.550
 later finally to Germany 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.580
 made 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.050
 The festival is clear among other things 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.530
 that it appeared in the challenge hall 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.190
 is 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.960
 The schools John Hughes place in the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.650
 At first, however, you could change others 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.320
 also consumed in the mystical 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.180
 reasons for this I call later how 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.210
 the title already suggests later 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.330
 lack in a demonic world at first 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.760
 Inaccurate as an event like one should 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.460
 between bed between hell and the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.030
 sites in which deceased sinners 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.410
 come and wait for your final verdict 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.410
 this is from kuka excavator den 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.350
 protagonists of the majors in his 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.120
 position as a candidate like hell 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.030
 riots has therefore had with his 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.300
 buddy like school from the environmental organization 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.700
 must be in the eventhouse from now on 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.620
 Break through the two are pretty 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 Weakened captures that lies with them 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.170
 with the reference her entire dat mat 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.480
 So your entire demonic energy 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.390
 was withdrawn 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.909
 dark matter is found in this world 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.989
 great concentrated men at senses 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:11.500
 and that's why kuka decided 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.450
 the windows will be around the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.069
 accused alleged senses too 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.310
 defend and your innocence too 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.799
 prove their tag matters welcome 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.870
 this requires the signature is to 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.030
 to conclude a contract by placing in 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.040
 the world of humans arrives and there 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.709
 with his search for an innocence 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.299
 evidence can begin 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.730
 that is also the point you have in the 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.510
 camp definitely in the ought to be back 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.220
 this could be successful 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.120
 and protection proof only 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.250
 Submit 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.500
 and if it is conclusive, the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.569
 accused acquitted in kavala 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.819
 gets its tag meter 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.020
 the acquitted will then too 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.240
 practically 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.100
 revived and the time on the 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.230
 time before his death turned back 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.240
 as if nothing ever happened 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.620
 would have happened 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.750
 during this procedure kuka 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.390
 but always from the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.100
 different employees huddled there 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.620
 These, of course, are the sender of your envelope 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.970
 today they want to go with them 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.740
 all prevent the 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.780
 defense wins and try 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.310
 the latter with violence out of the way too 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.080
 clear 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.989
 but that is by no means an unequal one 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.539
 she could usually think 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.910
 since avaya and classmates with some peep 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.800
 dark matter your powers for some time 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.860
 can restore it to the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.750
 death knight to be no 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.599
 that's the initial principle 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.030
 from the windows which agree with some 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.740
 Variations by many dramatic and 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.319
 very exciting staged events 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.169
 entangled and the story progresses 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.150
 Which is later, of course, very much 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.099
 dramatized but I want here yes 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.680
 nothing at all 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.130
 only so much of the manger is not the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.449
 entire game from case to case 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.000
 the character style is in my eyes 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.680
 really awesome but you have 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.930
 describe always incredible 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.340
 Hard us in switches so determined 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.590
 I say to them as simple 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.740
 that's the character style of the 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.080
 window , so I'll tell you again 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.909
 just so a few save a 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.139
 small insight can make like that 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.139
 whole looks exactly now 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.020
 but only a small look the 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.240
 darkness the ten volumes completed 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.520
 which help in this country of gases for 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.520
 the respective price of five euro 95 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.200
 The Manga is completely relocated 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.740
 black and white meter sized 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.410
 forward 17 centimeters a bit 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.660
 smaller than most one yet 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.180
 Unfortunately, there are no extra balls 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.640
 not from the window but this 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.010
 it must necessarily mean something 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.050
 nothing was announced but the 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.830
 final tenth band came only in 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.400
 march 2013 out maybe there will come 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.689
 something else in the form of a book or 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.019
 something similar 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:21.599
 the host cell is a great moment too 

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:22.469
 my favorite place there just a lot 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.360
 do it right 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.879
 from the exciting events to the 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.939
 exciting story to the small ones 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:31.439
 sign style does not really exist now 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:34.110
 anything that I noticed negatively 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:36.719
 So I could be hangar 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.519
 In any case very special fans the 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.860
 already in schondra should be liked 

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:42.929
 empathize and fans semih 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.969
 Detective conan also not very much 

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:46.709
 have action, we are also very 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:48.149
 be satisfied that the windows are still 

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:50.069
 practically a mixture of 

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:52.319
 a little bit industry and 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.050
 in particular action so in the end 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:57.749
 You can actually talk to almost anyone 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.039
 heart set denis against action mangas has 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:01.699
 and for the fashion and stuff 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.699
 Interested 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.670
 that was it again in 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.590
 this video 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.240
 I hope it caught you and that 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.080
 It's a little bit over the top five 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:17.140
 tell cities this is this 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.460
 video arrived at its end there is 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.950
 not to be seen anymore 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.780
 except I hope you liked it and 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.780
 until the next video and nice
