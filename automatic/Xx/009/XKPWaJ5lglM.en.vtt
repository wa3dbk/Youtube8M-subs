00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
you know I have multiple devices most of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.940 
you know I have multiple devices most of
the<00:00:47.340> account<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:48.030> either<00:00:48.270> mine<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.950> somebody

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the account are either mine or somebody

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.610 
the account are either mine or somebody
I<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.940> doesn't<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.050> play<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> lot

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

it's just that these random accounts we

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
it's just that these random accounts we
just<00:00:58.410> put<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.129> fill<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> space

you<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.590> rates<00:04:04.950> we're<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:05.579> guessing<00:04:05.849> and

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
you the rates we're just guessing and

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.530 
you the rates we're just guessing and
actually<00:04:07.950> let's<00:04:08.489> keep<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:08.910> rates<00:04:09.120> low<00:04:09.389> I'm

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540

actually let's keep the rates low I'm
guessing<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.049> rates<00:04:10.290> are<00:04:10.470> gonna<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.739> low

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
guessing the rates are gonna be low

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.610

the<00:05:17.759> two<00:05:18.659> stars<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.259> surprisingly<00:05:20.250> we<00:05:20.370> gun

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
the two stars and surprisingly we gun

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.760 
the two stars and surprisingly we gun
the<00:05:20.880> three<00:05:21.180> star<00:05:21.389> on<00:05:21.509> this<00:05:21.659> account<00:05:22.020> while<00:05:22.590> we

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
the three star on this account while we

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.080 
the three star on this account while we

keep getting two star on the other
account<00:05:24.449> I'm<00:05:24.630> guessing<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.229> I'll<00:05:25.409> still<00:05:25.740> get

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.740 
account I'm guessing that I'll still get
continued<00:05:26.819> get<00:05:26.970> two<00:05:27.150> star<00:05:27.419> on<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.630> other

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
continued get two star on the other

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.360 
continued get two star on the other
account<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.289> I<00:05:28.319> might<00:05:28.530> as<00:05:28.650> well<00:05:28.680> not<00:05:29.009> do<00:05:29.220> that

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
account so I might as well not do that

last time we got a two star I don't want
to<00:05:45.479> place<00:05:45.659> too<00:05:45.930> much<00:05:46.110> bet<00:05:46.440> on<00:05:46.650> it<00:05:46.860> because<00:05:47.550> it's

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
to place too much bet on it because it's

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.490 
to place too much bet on it because it's
a<00:05:48.030> relatively<00:05:48.539> expensive<00:05:49.009> crystal<00:05:50.599> 200<00:05:51.599> units

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
a relatively expensive crystal 200 units

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.580 
a relatively expensive crystal 200 units
that's<00:05:52.949> about<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.900> don't<00:05:54.900> know<00:05:55.080> that's<00:05:55.380> about

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
that's about I don't know that's about

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.740 
that's about I don't know that's about
like<00:05:55.800> ten<00:05:56.400> dollars<00:05:56.610> I'm<00:05:56.969> just<00:05:57.150> gonna<00:05:57.270> say<00:05:57.509> ten

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
like ten dollars I'm just gonna say ten

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.700 
like ten dollars I'm just gonna say ten
dollars<00:05:58.139> because<00:05:59.030> you<00:06:00.030> know<00:06:00.750> it's<00:06:01.229> not<00:06:01.409> that

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
dollars because you know it's not that

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.320 
dollars because you know it's not that
much<00:06:01.889> of<00:06:01.919> a<00:06:02.069> difference<00:06:02.580> thirty<00:06:02.849> something

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
much of a difference thirty something

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.990 
much of a difference thirty something
units<00:06:03.810> more<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.440> then<00:06:05.340> it<00:06:05.490> would<00:06:05.639> be<00:06:05.789> ten

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
units more and then it would be ten

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.839 
units more and then it would be ten
dollars<00:06:06.449> but<00:06:07.259> you<00:06:07.770> definitely<00:06:08.280> can't<00:06:08.550> spend

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
dollars but you definitely can't spend

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.670 
dollars but you definitely can't spend
five<00:06:09.120> dollars<00:06:09.509> and<00:06:09.750> get<00:06:09.960> it<00:06:10.110> because<00:06:10.289> five

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
five dollars and get it because five

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.040 
five dollars and get it because five
dollars<00:06:11.009> won't<00:06:11.190> actually<00:06:12.120> get<00:06:12.449> you<00:06:12.599> there<00:06:12.840> I

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
dollars won't actually get you there I

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.339 
dollars won't actually get you there I
don't<00:06:14.039> even<00:06:14.130> think<00:06:14.280> yeah<00:06:15.030> you<00:06:15.690> know<00:06:15.810> that<00:06:16.139> is

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
don't even think yeah you know that is

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:17.570 
don't even think yeah you know that is
pretty<00:06:16.650> much<00:06:16.830> yeah<00:06:17.039> we<00:06:17.190> didn't<00:06:17.340> even<00:06:17.430> get

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
pretty much yeah we didn't even get

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.420 
pretty much yeah we didn't even get
vision<00:06:18.030> I<00:06:18.289> was<00:06:19.289> hoping<00:06:19.590> for<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:19.860> Hulkbuster

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
vision I was hoping for the Hulkbuster

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.459 
vision I was hoping for the Hulkbuster
or<00:06:20.550> something<00:06:20.909> it<00:06:21.750> looks<00:06:21.930> like<00:06:22.080> we<00:06:22.199> didn't<00:06:22.380> get

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
or something it looks like we didn't get

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.990 
or something it looks like we didn't get
anything<00:06:22.710> good<00:06:22.979> that<00:06:24.500> that<00:06:25.500> is<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:26.219> vision

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
anything good that that is the vision

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.290 
anything good that that is the vision
prime<00:06:27.719> I<00:06:28.020> mean<00:06:28.169> not<00:06:28.289> the<00:06:28.409> front<00:06:29.060> vision<00:06:30.060> prime

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
prime I mean not the front vision prime

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.670 
prime I mean not the front vision prime
the<00:06:30.870> Ultron<00:06:31.880> crystal<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.090> prime<00:06:33.900> crystal<00:06:34.560> as

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
the Ultron crystal the prime crystal as

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.250 
the Ultron crystal the prime crystal as
they<00:06:34.860> call<00:06:35.099> it<00:06:35.250> which<00:06:35.430> has<00:06:35.789> Ultron<00:06:36.570> in<00:06:36.839> there

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
they call it which has Ultron in there

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.520 
they call it which has Ultron in there
and<00:06:37.699> that's<00:06:38.699> two<00:06:39.120> thousand<00:06:39.779> units

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
and that's two thousand units

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.850 
and that's two thousand units
for<00:06:40.830> ten<00:06:41.040> crystals<00:06:42.170> you<00:06:43.170> should<00:06:43.290> probably<00:06:43.530> buy

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
for ten crystals you should probably buy

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.670 
for ten crystals you should probably buy
thus<00:06:44.130> assuring<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.900> crystal<00:06:45.900> opening<00:06:46.320> event

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
thus assuring the crystal opening event

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.300 
thus assuring the crystal opening event
that<00:06:46.920> would<00:06:47.010> be<00:06:47.070> a<00:06:47.220> that<00:06:47.850> would<00:06:47.970> be<00:06:48.090> good
