This Joshua Peterson with Peterson Electric,
I am here today in Highlands Ranch for a customer.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.080
I have had a lot this year about lights flickering.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.150
It is kind of odd.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.300
Sometimes it happens because of lightning
strikes, just odd various things.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.790
I found out something newer today.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.730
What the compliant was the last 4 to 5 months
as I have gone to Jon's house here was we

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.330
guided him through breakers to reset.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.020
It seemed like it solved the problem.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.600
On the phone I knew there was nothing shorting,
faulting or tripping out, but a got a call

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.019
just about 2 weeks ago and got him scheduled
in to come out here.

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.170
When I got here, I heard some sizzling in
the panel.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.170
It was kind of odd.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.960
It was echoing a little bit.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.480
It definitely sounded like it was going through
this nipple chase to the meter.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.489
We popped the meter off.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.999
Popped the tag, pulled the meter, called Xcel
and got permission.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.809
We found one of the lugs right here on the
back side of this meter feeding the panel,

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.050
it was loose and it was starting to blacken.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.780
Problem we had that night getting repaired
is that I didn't have any of those older lugs

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.150
from a 25 year old meter on my van.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.650
We needed Xcel to come out and see if they
had a lug and put a new tag.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.880
This customer, Jon, real lucked out.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.880
Normally, we can't.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.860
If you loose that lug, you have to change
this meter.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.230
Then once you change the meter, as you can
see on this house the fence post, the siding

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.740
right here, even the plastic that guards the
conduit here, all of this would have had to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.740
change.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.540
The cost would have been really expensive
right off the bat.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.560
We thought we solved the problem and then
about a week later, he said yeah Josh I still

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.470
have some lights flickering in the basement.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.210
We went down there and came back and found
that we had a loose neutral wire, but we also

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.280
found a couple of loose connections in the
basement as well.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.000
When we went down there, we kept the power
on, we wouldn't have heard that current coming

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
back on the neutral.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.799
If I moved the wires, I heard it crackling.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.719
If the lights are off and nothing is being
used, it is not going to do anything.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.400
We were able to trace that better by leaving
the power on downstairs.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.060
Even if we would have check an ohm meter,
it still would have read some continuity.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.129
The best way to check it was running it hot.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.640
Thanks for joining us!

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.559
See you next week!
