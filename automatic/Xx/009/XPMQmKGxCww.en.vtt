00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
middle of the city but once you're there

at<00:01:40.950> first<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> probably<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
at first you probably will think it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120 
at first you probably will think it
didn't<00:01:42.570> even<00:01:42.689> work<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> keep<00:01:43.860> flying

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
