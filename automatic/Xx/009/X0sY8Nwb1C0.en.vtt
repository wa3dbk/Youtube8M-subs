00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
land on this barrier now the thing that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
land on this barrier now the thing that
makes<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.930> spot<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> because

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
makes this spot really good is because

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
makes this spot really good is because
of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> location<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> you've<00:00:51.570> got<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
of the location of it you've got a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360 
of the location of it you've got a
merry-go-round<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.680> front<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> which

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
merry-go-round in front of you which

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.189 
merry-go-round in front of you which
distracts<00:00:53.879> enemies<00:00:54.210> obviously<00:00:54.570> people<00:00:54.989> are

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
distracts enemies obviously people are

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.240 
distracts enemies obviously people are
going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> watch<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
going to watch that and think of the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.470 
going to watch that and think of the
merry-go-round<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.120> can't<00:00:57.329> actually

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
merry-go-round and they can't actually

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
merry-go-round and they can't actually
see<00:00:57.840> beyond<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.460> people<00:00:59.730> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
see beyond that so you know people will

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.040 
see beyond that so you know people will
be<00:00:59.910> looking<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> merry-go-round<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
be looking at the merry-go-round and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.270 
be looking at the merry-go-round and
then<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> people<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.829> come<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.070> other

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
then the people that come from other

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
then the people that come from other
directions<00:01:02.760> can't<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.930> where<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
directions can't actually see where you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.690 
directions can't actually see where you
are<00:01:04.290> until<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.799> pretty<00:01:05.010> much<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.489> on

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
are until they pretty much a right on

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.100 
are until they pretty much a right on
you<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:06.960> looking

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you and then because you are looking

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
you and then because you are looking
down<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.830> them<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.430> should<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.700> able<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.939> kill

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
down on them you should be able to kill

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
down on them you should be able to kill
them<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.439> useful<00:01:10.619> spot

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
them so it's a really really useful spot

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.440 
them so it's a really really useful spot
and<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.939> will<00:01:12.030> benefit<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and I do think this one will benefit you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
and I do think this one will benefit you
guys<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.869> would<00:01:13.140> only<00:01:13.229> recommend<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
guys I would only recommend using this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980 
guys I would only recommend using this
in<00:01:14.220> private<00:01:14.430> matches<00:01:14.790> down<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> FATA<00:01:15.810> if

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
in private matches down to the FATA if

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.149 
in private matches down to the FATA if
you<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.830> online<00:01:16.979> game

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you do put it off in an online game

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.969 
you do put it off in an online game
people<00:01:17.939> probably<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.710> annoyed

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
people probably would get a bit annoyed

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.320 
people probably would get a bit annoyed
and<00:01:20.189> there's<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.490> chance<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:20.970> report

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and there's a chance they will report
