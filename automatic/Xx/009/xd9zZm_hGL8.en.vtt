house<00:05:00.670> we'll<00:05:00.940> leave<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.240> there<00:05:01.270> for<00:05:01.420> now<00:05:04.350> put

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
house we'll leave it there for now put

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.200 
house we'll leave it there for now put
that<00:05:05.440> down<00:05:05.620> there<00:05:05.890> leave<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.910> plugged<00:05:07.030> in

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
that down there leave it plugged in

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.450 
that down there leave it plugged in
unfortunate<00:05:07.840> then<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:08.950> we<00:05:09.040> look<00:05:09.160> at<00:05:09.250> it<00:05:09.340> next

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
unfortunate then so we look at it next

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.150 
unfortunate then so we look at it next
to<00:05:09.670> a<00:05:09.730> 3dsxl<00:05:10.330> also<00:05:11.080> in<00:05:11.140> blue<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.590> black<00:05:12.100> I

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
to a 3dsxl also in blue and black I

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.910 
to a 3dsxl also in blue and black I
guess<00:05:12.570> so<00:05:16.260> it's<00:05:17.260> about<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.530> same<00:05:17.650> thickness

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
guess so it's about the same thickness

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.970 
guess so it's about the same thickness
I'd<00:05:18.280> say<00:05:18.540> at<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:19.750> top<00:05:19.960> but<00:05:20.260> obviously<00:05:20.650> not<00:05:20.830> at

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
I'd say at the top but obviously not at

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:32.510 
I'd say at the top but obviously not at
the<00:05:21.100> wedge<00:05:21.330> shape<00:05:22.330> bottom<00:05:27.030> looks<00:05:29.310> every<00:05:30.310> night

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.940 

it<00:05:33.520> was<00:05:33.700> really<00:05:33.940> quite<00:05:34.090> small<00:05:34.630> like<00:05:35.080> when<00:05:35.920> you

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
it was really quite small like when you

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.530 
it was really quite small like when you
have<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.220> look<00:05:36.460> at<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.640> tds<00:05:37.030> by<00:05:37.240> itself

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
have a look at the tds by itself

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.940 
have a look at the tds by itself
anything<00:05:37.930> out<00:05:38.080> okay<00:05:38.350> that's<00:05:38.590> pretty<00:05:38.710> big<00:05:40.950> but

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
anything out okay that's pretty big but

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.300 
anything out okay that's pretty big but
it's<00:05:42.130> not<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:44.050> let's<00:05:44.200> get<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.440> original<00:05:44.890> three

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
it's not so let's get the original three

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.770 
it's not so let's get the original three
years<00:05:45.550> out<00:05:46.800> again<00:05:47.970> matte<00:05:48.970> finish<00:05:49.360> compared<00:05:49.720> to

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
years out again matte finish compared to

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.460 
years out again matte finish compared to
glossary<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:50.290> know<00:05:50.530> that<00:05:51.780> this<00:05:52.780> is<00:05:52.840> completely

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
glossary I know that this is completely

dead<00:05:54.220> so<00:05:54.430> i<00:05:54.490> can<00:05:54.670> turn<00:05:54.850> it<00:05:55.000> on<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.240> test<00:05:55.450> the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
dead so i can turn it on to test the

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:02.610 
dead so i can turn it on to test the
screens<00:05:55.870> but<00:05:56.170> same<00:05:57.040> sized<00:05:57.280> screens<00:06:00.420> so<00:06:01.620> let's

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
screens but same sized screens so let's

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.530 
screens but same sized screens so let's
have<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.770> look<00:06:02.830> at<00:06:03.010> the<00:06:03.070> case<00:06:03.280> as<00:06:04.060> well<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.450> it

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
have a look at the case as well that it

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:12.330 
have a look at the case as well that it
comes<00:06:04.690> with<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:10.110> blue<00:06:11.110> one<00:06:11.320> it's<00:06:12.100> a<00:06:12.160> match

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340
