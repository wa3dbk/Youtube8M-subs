00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.020
 the earlier prognoses 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.020
 on 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.310

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.239
 welcome to a new broadcast and 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.850
 This time, everything revolves around 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.710
 healthy food and we have for you 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.539
 two tasty and healthy recipes 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.019
 Just pick her 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.989
 I can do it 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.909
 my food is healthy 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.820
 we get home cook according to the game 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.979
 sims cool and first 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.600
 We make brushing a delicious avocado 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.040
 burger and such a big hunger 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 We make four portions directly 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.940
 and for that you need four 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.539
 wholemeal roll four turkey schnitzel 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 a whole armada half a lemon 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:24.420
 two tomatoes of watercress one 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.520
 tablespoons olive oil pepper and salt 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.890
 Now I would say wash hands and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.110
 put on the key 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.130
 I'm too far that's the only one 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.770
 light so it's okay but this one 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.330
 we do not need to go let's go 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.009
 the first thing she needs is the avocado and 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.390
 you halve it and then there is one 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.869
 trick the core out faster 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.259
 get 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.240
 and that you hacking careful with 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.920
 knife on the core then slowly back and forth 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.869
 move around and thereby totally dissolve 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.759
 Just then you take the meat on 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.740
 servo kadow spooned the house into one 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.229
 bowl crushed with a fork 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.789
 Add two teaspoons of lemon juice 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.700
 we then taste with salt and pepper 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.439
 what the turkey with something 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.509
 water and finally rages 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.150
 dry and then you can with her 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530
 Some pepper and salt is heated 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.690
 flag and prepare the meat 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.560

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.700
 both sides 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.519
 meanwhile , it does not cut marks 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.980
 and halved the buns now spreads 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.019
 the lower half with the avocados and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.040
 as soon as the turkey chops are ready 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.880
 put on it with tomato slices and the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.880
 Press 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.340
 finished is our avocado good as 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.080
 delicious healthy drink for 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.470
 in between we have one more 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.769
 strawberry papayas moby and for 4 servings 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:57.260

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.260
 kiwis and mint for garnish 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.910
 Next was the strawberries and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.140
 grossed down and that's not so 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:30.120
 took a long time I have ever 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:32.579
 Prepared the right little chip 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.890
 to remove the green stems take 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.410
 just take a straw and stick it 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.889
 on the one side through and out the top 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:46.620
 and then you take the rest 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:48.980
 Strawberries and pureed the whole thing well 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.980
 by 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.610
 so you have the strawberries finished mashed 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.540
 then you distribute the puree enlightener 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.850
 and next you pose and share 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.370
 the kiwis stood by her and give her 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.480
 with a spoon on the puree 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.710
 we halve the papaya peel 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.690
 and coring know 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.580
 A little tip will keep the core 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.610

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.900
