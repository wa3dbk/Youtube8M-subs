 granola people can call a mix 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.960
 of ground in cereals né granola then 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.540
 this granola we always have to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.730
 being aware of her composition is not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.590
 that she is always healthy will give pt 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 have brands that use very 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 Sugar has brands that already has a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.640
 concern about not using sugar 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.850
 use 11 honey for example organic 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.680
 each will have a great in different 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.870
 the nutritionist warns about the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.289
 importance of choosing products of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.719
 quality and I always aim to read the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.359
 ingredients is not more important than 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.670
 that looks at calorie nutritional value is 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.710
 read the ingredients you know 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 identify each component that is there 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.270
 on that vote for example first 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.640
 I believe it comes in a granola one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.350
 package of being an agent the sin is going 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.180
 suppose wheat flour is there 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.900
 refined iron-enriched 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.159
 folic 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.290
 we know it's a flour that 's 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.630
 whole process has undergone a process that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.100
 took what she has best in the grain 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.350
 fibers are a good part of the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.060
 vitamins and minerals 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.829
 first place of the crosses for example 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 oat flakes 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.340
 since once it was not so processed 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.110
 that we know that there are more fibers there 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.700
 with more protein then know 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.860
 identify each component 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.439
 looks at corporate citizens before 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.869
 chemical dyes add 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.229
 the artificial fat that often 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.930
 hydrogenated fats are used or 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.880
 has coconut oil, for example, there it is 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.610
 a healthier eye better for the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.130
 our body the novelty of the market and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.619
 that already arrived in the store of color and Christmas is the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.590
 granola of the living the nutrients of this 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.649
 granola are full of fiber controls the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.190
 glycemia decreases the absorption of fat 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.670
 prevent the risk of diseases such as cancer 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.880
 diabetes 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.110
 beyond cardiovascular diseases 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.390
 also help maintain weight 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.730
 balancing aid in the regularization of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.160
 intestines your vitamins and minerals 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.220
 antioxidants fight radicals 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.190
 extremely harmful to the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.920
 body but the main differential of this 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 product are the sprouted grains that 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.459
 makes granola the living food as 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.680
 germinated seeds it already has a point 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.700
 I'm very big, I'm going to be there. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.860
 elements that are in their most form is 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.069
 perfect to develop is as if the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.410
 he had received a rainfall 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.870
 water for it is sprouting and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.150
 he then developed in him all the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.610
 vitality for him to develop 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.739
 and there studies show that seeds 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.549
 germinated the grains they present 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.610
 present 300 friends 20% more than 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.920
 nutrients in comparison to a grain that 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.989
 it was not determined then you germinate 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.540
 besides, you also improve the 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.940
 enzymatic potential of that food 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.829
 it gets enzymes that help 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.959
 digestion these enzymes an aid of 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.670
 ing the food itself 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.950
 this is reflected in a better management 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 better use will achieve 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.120
 better take all these together 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.340
 then it will reflect on the skin and the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.400
 hair health in the body as a 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.400
