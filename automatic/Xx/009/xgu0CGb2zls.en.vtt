reason<00:03:04.200> why<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.350> did<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.980> pinging<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.489> was

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
reason why I did the pinging it was

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.010 
reason why I did the pinging it was
because<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.480> didn't<00:03:06.900> have<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.920> pressure<00:03:08.610> foot

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
because I didn't have the pressure foot

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.500 
because I didn't have the pressure foot
pressure<00:03:10.020> set<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.830> okay<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:12.180> other<00:03:12.209> thing

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
pressure set right okay the other thing

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
pressure set right okay the other thing
is<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.800> want<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.090> yourself<00:03:16.310> some

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
wax okay this is just a piece of wax

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.000 
wax okay this is just a piece of wax
that<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.190> had<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.870> put<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.260> needle<00:03:22.410> all

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
that I had and put it on the needle all

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.100 
that I had and put it on the needle all
right<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.430> give<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.970> test<00:03:24.180> run<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.780> you'll

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
right and give it a test run and you'll

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.900 
right and give it a test run and you'll
see<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.620> goes<00:03:25.739> through<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.220> material<00:03:26.700> a

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
see that it goes through the material a

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.310 
see that it goes through the material a
lot<00:03:27.330> easier<00:03:27.900> all<00:03:28.830> right<00:03:29.750> I'll<00:03:30.750> show<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.050> I'm

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320

now you don't hear the ping okay there's
still<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.769> 16<00:03:48.769> layers<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.760> went<00:03:49.940> straight

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
still the 16 layers and it went straight

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.170 
still the 16 layers and it went straight
through<00:03:50.709> all<00:03:51.709> right<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:52.700> get<00:03:52.849> better

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
through all right you get better

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.449 
through all right you get better
stitching<00:03:53.840> if<00:03:54.049> you<00:03:54.230> go<00:03:54.440> slower<00:03:54.890> if<00:03:55.159> you<00:03:55.280> go

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
stitching if you go slower if you go

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.020 
stitching if you go slower if you go
faster<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.360> you<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.349> move<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.799> material

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
faster and you and you move the material

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.600 
faster and you and you move the material
back<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.299> forth<00:03:59.510> like<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.400> then<00:04:01.400> yeah

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
back and forth like this then yeah

back and forth like this then yeah
you're<00:04:01.790> gonna<00:04:01.940> your<00:04:02.360> straight<00:04:02.959> stitch<00:04:02.989> is

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
you're gonna your straight stitch is

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.920 
you're gonna your straight stitch is
going<00:04:03.409> to<00:04:03.620> basically<00:04:03.769> become<00:04:04.340> like<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.549> zig<00:04:04.819> zag

into the material this way it'll give a

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:25.550 
into the material this way it'll give a
360<00:05:09.500> degree<00:05:09.770> stroke<00:05:10.130> okay

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560

okay<00:05:26.700> we<00:05:27.700> get<00:05:27.850> it<00:05:27.910> city<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.150> I<00:05:28.510> moved<00:05:28.990> mine<00:05:29.290> a

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
okay we get it city I I moved mine a

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.160 
okay we get it city I I moved mine a
little<00:05:29.680> bit<00:05:30.960> alright<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:33.690> moved<00:05:34.690> it<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.990> little

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
little bit alright I moved it a little

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.290 
little bit alright I moved it a little
material<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:35.920> little<00:05:36.070> bit<00:05:36.310> while<00:05:36.790> I<00:05:36.850> was<00:05:37.060> sewing

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
material a little bit while I was sewing

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.110 
material a little bit while I was sewing
so<00:05:37.690> it's<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.960> little<00:05:38.140> bit<00:05:38.320> crooked<00:05:39.120> that's

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
so it's a little bit crooked that's

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.520 
so it's a little bit crooked that's
because<00:05:40.450> of<00:05:40.570> maybe<00:05:40.750> not<00:05:40.840> because<00:05:41.170> of<00:05:41.350> the

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
because of maybe not because of the

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.890 
foot controller and one hand just to
hold<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.720> material<00:05:48.000> but<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.180> went<00:05:49.360> straight

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900

through all of that it went straight
through<00:05:54.100> it<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:54.640> I<00:05:54.670> don't<00:05:54.910> know<00:05:55.000> how<00:05:55.090> many

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.940 
through it so I don't know how many
layers<00:05:55.480> he's<00:05:55.810> going<00:05:56.140> through<00:05:56.350> but<00:05:56.650> it'll<00:05:56.830> go

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950

layers he's going through but it'll go
through<00:05:57.220> all<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.730> so<00:05:58.600> that<00:05:59.110> was<00:05:59.200> just<00:05:59.440> to

were sewing the bobbin is partially
round<00:06:14.050> already<00:06:15.690> so<00:06:16.690> if<00:06:17.530> you<00:06:17.770> keep<00:06:17.950> it<00:06:18.070> on<00:06:18.160> there

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
round already so if you keep it on there

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.300 
round already so if you keep it on there
what<00:06:18.640> will<00:06:18.730> happen<00:06:19.120> is<00:06:19.590> if<00:06:20.590> it's<00:06:20.830> set<00:06:21.040> right

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
what will happen is if it's set right

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.220 
what will happen is if it's set right
when<00:06:21.910> the<00:06:22.090> bobbin<00:06:22.240> gets<00:06:22.570> full<00:06:22.780> this<00:06:22.960> little

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
when the bobbin gets full this little

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.890 
when the bobbin gets full this little
button<00:06:23.440> will<00:06:23.680> pop<00:06:23.710> off<00:06:24.190> and<00:06:24.610> then<00:06:25.480> the<00:06:25.600> sewing

on the vote on the amp meter the amps

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.830 
on the vote on the amp meter the amps
usually<00:06:46.420> go<00:06:46.540> up<00:06:46.570> to<00:06:46.900> about<00:06:47.820> 1.2<00:06:48.820> something<00:06:49.600> and

then they'll drop they'll drop down to
two<00:06:52.300> point<00:06:52.990> ninety<00:06:53.230> eight<00:06:53.560> or<00:06:53.800> or<00:06:54.670> so<00:06:55.140> and<00:06:56.140> it

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
two point ninety eight or or so and it

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.800
