com so the question I get a lot is how

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.009 
com so the question I get a lot is how
can<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.440> improve<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.740> visualization<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:09.240> am

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
can I improve my visualization and I am

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.140 
can I improve my visualization and I am
realizing<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.219> lot<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.460> people<00:00:11.849> don't

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
realizing that a lot of people don't

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.440 
realizing that a lot of people don't
understand<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.670> visualizing<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.790> actually

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
understand that visualizing is actually

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.970 
understand that visualizing is actually
not<00:00:16.100> necessarily<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.220> visual<00:00:17.940> act

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
not necessarily a visual act

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.700 
not necessarily a visual act
visualization<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.210> word<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:22.170> use<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
visualization is a word that we use that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.009 
visualization is a word that we use that
means<00:00:23.010> i<00:00:23.279> want<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> bring<00:00:24.180> myself<00:00:24.449> into

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
means i want to bring myself into

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.560 
means i want to bring myself into
alignment<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.650> concept<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.670> goal<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
alignment with a concept or a goal or a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.390 
alignment with a concept or a goal or a
thing<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.199> I'm<00:00:28.289> creating<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:28.949> life<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
thing that I'm creating in my life and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.939 
thing that I'm creating in my life and
and<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> imagine<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.830> it's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
and I'm going to imagine that it's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.510 
and I'm going to imagine that it's
already<00:00:32.399> happened<00:00:32.940> which<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.079> triggers

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
already happened which then triggers

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.470 
already happened which then triggers
through<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> mechanics<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> universe

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
through the mechanics of the universe

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
through the mechanics of the universe
triggers<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> law<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> attraction<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.120> that

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
triggers the law of attraction and that

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.420 
triggers the law of attraction and that
begins<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.570> bring<00:00:39.780> reinforcing<00:00:40.530> experiences

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
begins to bring reinforcing experiences

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.069 
begins to bring reinforcing experiences
that<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.270> eventually<00:00:42.480> bring<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.020> thing

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that will eventually bring this thing

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
that will eventually bring this thing
into<00:00:43.230> physical<00:00:43.739> manifestation<00:00:44.430> whatever<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
into physical manifestation whatever it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.750 
into physical manifestation whatever it
may<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.390> idea<00:00:45.780> concept<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.550> specific<00:00:47.550> object

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
may be an idea concept a specific object

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.119 
may be an idea concept a specific object
a<00:00:48.180> type<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.690> relationship<00:00:49.379> whatever<00:00:49.620> whatever

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
a type of relationship whatever whatever

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.119 
a type of relationship whatever whatever
it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> you're<00:00:50.700> focusing<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.920> know

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it is that you're focusing on so we know

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.510 
it is that you're focusing on so we know
that<00:00:53.989> when<00:00:54.989> we're<00:00:55.199> focusing<00:00:55.710> our<00:00:55.890> pure

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that when we're focusing our pure

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.240 
that when we're focusing our pure
positive<00:00:56.670> thought<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.980> something<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> we're

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
positive thought on something that we're

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.880 
positive thought on something that we're
wanting<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> create<00:01:00.079> there's<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.260> aspects<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
wanting to create there's two aspects to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640 
wanting to create there's two aspects to
it<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.850> thing<00:01:03.090> itself<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it one is the thing itself and the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
it one is the thing itself and the
second<00:01:04.979> part<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> feeling<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.000> having<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
second part is the feeling of having it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
second part is the feeling of having it
so<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:08.010> some<00:01:08.189> people<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.610> feeling<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.939> having

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
so for some people the feeling of having

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.760 
so for some people the feeling of having
it<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.869> relief<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.530> for

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it is going to be relief like for

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.570 
it is going to be relief like for
example<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.310> you're<00:01:11.670> visualizing<00:01:12.299> having

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
example if you're visualizing having

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.859 
example if you're visualizing having
more<00:01:14.580> than<00:01:14.610> enough<00:01:14.850> money<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> see

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
more than enough money and so you see

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.990 
more than enough money and so you see
yourself<00:01:16.409> pay<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:17.369> rent<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.850> your

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
yourself pay your rent or your

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.399 
yourself pay your rent or your
mortgaging<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.570> car<00:01:18.869> payment<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.259> your

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
mortgaging your car payment and your

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.660 
mortgaging your car payment and your
insurance<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.280> money<00:01:20.490> left

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
insurance and then you have money left

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.999 
insurance and then you have money left
over<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:22.020> great<00:01:22.259> feeling<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
over a really great feeling for that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
over a really great feeling for that
might<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.520> relief<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
might be relief because you have the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
might be relief because you have the
feeling<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> relief<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.340> I've<00:01:26.549> gone<00:01:26.850> from

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
feeling of relief of like I've gone from

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.429 
feeling of relief of like I've gone from
the<00:01:27.270> place<00:01:27.450> where<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> didn't<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.229> in

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439

the place where I didn't want to be in
to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> place<00:01:28.860> where<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.939> a

to the place where I want to be it's a
very<00:01:30.299> clear<00:01:30.570> signal<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> universe<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
very clear signal to the universe of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.320 
very clear signal to the universe of
what<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.579> wanting

and<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:49.140> love<00:01:49.410> how<00:01:49.770> its<00:01:50.310> unfolding<00:01:50.760> through<00:01:51.210> me

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
and I love how its unfolding through me

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.650 
and I love how its unfolding through me
so<00:01:54.440> if<00:01:55.440> you've<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.160> that's<00:01:56.790> great<00:01:57.150> now

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
so if you've got that that's great now

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.100 
so if you've got that that's great now
what<00:01:58.620> about<00:01:58.650> seeing<00:01:59.580> yourself<00:01:59.820> or<00:02:00.450> imaging

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
what about seeing yourself or imaging

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.010 
what about seeing yourself or imaging
the<00:02:02.030> thing<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.660> you're<00:02:03.780> wanting

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the thing that it is that you're wanting

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.810 
the thing that it is that you're wanting
so<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.650> can<00:02:04.800> have<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.950> very<00:02:05.190> clear<00:02:05.430> focus

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
so that you can have a very clear focus

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.700 
so that you can have a very clear focus
on<00:02:07.160> well<00:02:08.510> visualizing<00:02:09.510> like<00:02:09.630> i<00:02:09.780> said<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.229> just

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
on well visualizing like i said is just

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.710 
on well visualizing like i said is just
a<00:02:10.950> word<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.490> use<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.330> actually

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
a word that we use to that actually

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.410 
a word that we use to that actually
covers<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.440> whole<00:02:13.650> bunch<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.040> things<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
covers a whole bunch of things and the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.680 
covers a whole bunch of things and the
act<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.620> bringing<00:02:17.520> yourself<00:02:17.790> into<00:02:18.180> alignment

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
act of bringing yourself into alignment

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.770 
act of bringing yourself into alignment
with<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.380> object<00:02:19.830> may<00:02:20.550> take<00:02:20.850> one<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.510> three

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
with this object may take one of three

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.990 
with this object may take one of three
different<00:02:21.959> approaches<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:23.220> could<00:02:23.490> be<00:02:23.610> visual

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
different approaches it could be visual

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.910 
different approaches it could be visual
and<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.990> based<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.350> your<00:02:25.560> learning

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
and this is based on your learning

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.710 
and this is based on your learning
methods<00:02:26.280> how<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.450> actually

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
methods how it is that you actually

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080 
methods how it is that you actually
learn<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:29.580> whether<00:02:29.850> you're<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
learn and if you know whether you're a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.550 
learn and if you know whether you're a
visual<00:02:30.330> learner<00:02:30.510> you're<00:02:30.990> an<00:02:31.080> auditory

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
visual learner you're an auditory

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.199 
visual learner you're an auditory
learning<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:32.040> cadet<00:02:32.370> kinesthetic<00:02:33.030> learner

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
learning your cadet kinesthetic learner

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.500 
learning your cadet kinesthetic learner
then<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.380> will<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.800> kind<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.060> best<00:02:36.300> way

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
then you will know kind of the best way

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.470 
then you will know kind of the best way
to<00:02:36.990> meditate<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.850> i<00:02:38.910> want<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.120> go<00:02:39.239> over<00:02:39.269> those

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
to meditate so i want to go over those

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.540 
to meditate so i want to go over those
really<00:02:39.870> quickly<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:41.040> share<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.430> with

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
let's talk briefly about the three

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.470 
let's talk briefly about the three
methods<00:02:52.050> learning<00:02:52.590> visual<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.910> means<00:02:54.120> you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
methods learning visual that means you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.660 
methods learning visual that means you
want<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.780> see<00:02:54.989> something<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:56.100> want<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> read<00:02:56.640> a

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
or when you're watching television

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.290 
or when you're watching television
you're<00:03:27.340> actually<00:03:27.459> not<00:03:27.670> watching<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.180> you're

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
you're actually not watching it you're

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.640 
you're actually not watching it you're
listening<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:28.989> background<00:03:29.470> and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
listening to it in the background and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.780 
listening to it in the background and
you're<00:03:29.769> moving<00:03:29.890> around<00:03:30.250> doing<00:03:30.550> other<00:03:30.700> stuff

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
you're moving around doing other stuff

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.030 
you're moving around doing other stuff
that's<00:03:31.780> actually<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.230> really<00:03:32.260> big<00:03:32.620> key<00:03:32.860> that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
that's actually a really big key that

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.520 
that's actually a really big key that
you're<00:03:33.160> an<00:03:33.250> auditorium<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.989> third<00:03:35.260> type<00:03:35.500> of

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you're an auditorium the third type of

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.880 
you're an auditorium the third type of
learning<00:03:35.980> is<00:03:36.420> kinesthetic<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:38.620> means

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
learning is kinesthetic and that means

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.680 
learning is kinesthetic and that means
for<00:03:39.280> most<00:03:39.459> people<00:03:39.760> it's<00:03:39.970> hands-on<00:03:40.420> learning

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
for most people it's hands-on learning

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.350 
for most people it's hands-on learning
the<00:03:41.519> kinesthetic<00:03:42.519> learners<00:03:42.849> are<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.120> kind<00:03:43.299> of

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
the kinesthetic learners are the kind of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.640 
the kinesthetic learners are the kind of
people<00:03:43.510> who<00:03:43.690> are<00:03:43.810> like<00:03:43.900> get<00:03:44.170> out<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.290> my<00:03:44.410> way<00:03:44.620> I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
people who are like get out of my way I

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.039 
people who are like get out of my way I
just<00:03:45.040> want<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.250> sit<00:03:45.400> down<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.670> do<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.760> myself

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
just want to sit down and do it myself

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.900 
just want to sit down and do it myself
so<00:03:47.049> if<00:03:47.380> you're<00:03:47.769> learning<00:03:48.130> software<00:03:48.340> if<00:03:48.730> you're

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
so if you're learning software if you're

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.720 
so if you're learning software if you're
learning<00:03:49.410> how<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.470> operate<00:03:51.099> something<00:03:51.519> how<00:03:51.670> to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
learning how to operate something how to

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.839 
learning how to operate something how to
use<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.660> device<00:03:53.079> then<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.310> kinesthetic

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
use like a device then a kinesthetic

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.490 
use like a device then a kinesthetic
learner<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.420> going<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.599> be<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.840> one<00:03:55.959> who<00:03:56.140> turns

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
learner is going to be the one who turns

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.949 
learner is going to be the one who turns
on<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.340> machine<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.060> starts<00:03:58.720> pressing

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
on the machine and starts pressing

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.800 
on the machine and starts pressing
buttons<00:03:59.500> without<00:04:00.400> reading<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.000> manual<00:04:01.390> now

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
buttons without reading the manual now

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.059 
buttons without reading the manual now
whether<00:04:02.079> that's<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.380> right<00:04:02.470> way<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.739> do<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:02.980> or

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
whether that's the right way to do it or

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.460 
whether that's the right way to do it or
not<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.430> another<00:04:03.670> question<00:04:04.120> completely<00:04:04.720> but

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
not is another question completely but

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.259 
not is another question completely but
that's<00:04:06.220> an<00:04:06.400> indication<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.940> kinesthetic

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
that's an indication of kinesthetic

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.870 
that's an indication of kinesthetic
learning<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.709> when<00:04:09.400> you're<00:04:09.579> doing<00:04:09.610> your

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
learning so when you're doing your

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.759 
learning so when you're doing your
imagery<00:04:10.450> when<00:04:10.690> you're<00:04:10.870> doing<00:04:11.200> your<00:04:11.230> 68

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
imagery when you're doing your 68

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.199 
imagery when you're doing your 68
seconds<00:04:13.110> you're<00:04:14.110> going<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.380> probably<00:04:15.000> do<00:04:16.000> one

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
seconds you're going to probably do one

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.759 
seconds you're going to probably do one
of<00:04:16.269> those<00:04:16.479> three<00:04:16.690> things<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.109> if<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.500> are<00:04:17.620> an

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
of those three things and if you are an

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.529 
of those three things and if you are an
auditory<00:04:18.370> learner<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.940> you've<00:04:19.120> been<00:04:19.269> trying

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
auditory learner and you've been trying

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.479 
auditory learner and you've been trying
to<00:04:19.630> visualize<00:04:19.780> because<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.560> word<00:04:20.739> visual<00:04:21.310> is

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
to visualize because the word visual is

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.240 
to visualize because the word visual is
in<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.970> word<00:04:22.120> visualization<00:04:23.020> then<00:04:23.950> it's

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
in the word visualization then it's

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.310 
in the word visualization then it's
probably<00:04:24.460> not<00:04:24.669> been<00:04:24.789> working<00:04:25.060> for<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.360> but<00:04:26.169> as

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
probably not been working for you but as

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.710 
probably not been working for you but as
an<00:04:26.350> auditory<00:04:27.100> learner<00:04:27.340> one<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.539> things

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
an auditory learner one of the things

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.129 
an auditory learner one of the things
you<00:04:28.780> could<00:04:29.020> do<00:04:29.169> in<00:04:29.440> your<00:04:29.560> imagery<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.190> to

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
you could do in your imagery is to

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.000 
you could do in your imagery is to
actually<00:04:32.850> hear<00:04:33.990> like<00:04:34.990> imagine<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.800> someone

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
actually hear like imagine that someone

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.730 
actually hear like imagine that someone
is<00:04:36.190> telling<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.389> story<00:04:37.690> of<00:04:38.020> what<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.590> is

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
is telling you the story of what it is

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.460 
is telling you the story of what it is
that's<00:04:39.070> happening<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:40.090> what<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:41.169> is<00:04:41.320> that

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
that's happening of what it is that

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.990 
that's happening of what it is that
you're<00:04:41.590> creating<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.310> process<00:04:42.789> that's

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
you're creating of the process that's

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.420 
you're creating of the process that's
unfolding<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.350> thing<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:45.010> is<00:04:45.220> happening

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
unfolding of the thing that is happening

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.129 
unfolding of the thing that is happening
that<00:04:45.910> you're<00:04:46.090> wanting<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.450> bring<00:04:46.690> forth<00:04:46.960> into

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
that you're wanting to bring forth into

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.290 
that you're wanting to bring forth into
manifestation<00:04:47.550> if<00:04:48.550> you're<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.850> kinesthetic

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
manifestation if you're a kinesthetic

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.900 
manifestation if you're a kinesthetic
learner<00:04:49.840> then<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.740> might<00:04:50.919> want<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.220> imagine

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
learner then you might want to imagine

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.900 
learner then you might want to imagine
that<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:52.780> are<00:04:53.340> for<00:04:54.340> example<00:04:54.669> if<00:04:54.789> you're

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
that you are for example if you're

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.120 
that you are for example if you're
bringing<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.510> car<00:04:56.110> into<00:04:56.289> manifestation<00:04:56.560> and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
bringing a car into manifestation and

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.770 
bringing a car into manifestation and
that's<00:04:57.280> what<00:04:57.460> you're<00:04:57.580> creating<00:04:57.760> you<00:04:58.539> wouldn't

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
that's what you're creating you wouldn't

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.390 
that's what you're creating you wouldn't
want<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.990> see<00:04:59.320> yourself<00:04:59.740> behind<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.190> wheel

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
want to see yourself behind the wheel

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.060 
want to see yourself behind the wheel
and<00:05:00.669> feel<00:05:00.970> what<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.300> feels<00:05:01.330> like<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:02.139> drive<00:05:03.010> a

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
and feel what it feels like to drive a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.830 
and feel what it feels like to drive a
car<00:05:03.190> if<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.669> saw<00:05:03.849> the<00:05:03.910> secret<00:05:04.360> they<00:05:04.479> actually

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
car if you saw the secret they actually

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.810 
car if you saw the secret they actually
did<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.020> really<00:05:05.260> great<00:05:05.470> little<00:05:05.860> thing<00:05:06.610> about

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
did a really great little thing about

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.300 
did a really great little thing about
that<00:05:07.229> where<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.320> guys<00:05:08.470> sitting<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:08.919> his<00:05:09.010> chair

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
that where the guys sitting in his chair

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.440 
that where the guys sitting in his chair
and<00:05:09.370> he's<00:05:09.490> pretending<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:09.970> he's<00:05:10.120> shifting

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
and he's pretending that he's shifting

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.480 
and he's pretending that he's shifting
gears<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.349> suddenly<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.830> chair<00:05:12.070> takes<00:05:12.310> off

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
gears and suddenly the chair takes off

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.800 
gears and suddenly the chair takes off
and<00:05:12.760> he's<00:05:12.880> driving<00:05:13.210> down<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.389> road<00:05:13.450> in<00:05:13.660> his

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
and he's driving down the road in his

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.810 
and he's driving down the road in his
chair<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:14.289> it's<00:05:14.830> like

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
chair and it's like

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.980 
chair and it's like
really<00:05:16.030> cool<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.390> then<00:05:16.480> he<00:05:16.540> gets<00:05:16.690> out<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
really cool and then he gets out of the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.120 
really cool and then he gets out of the
chair<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:17.230> he<00:05:17.350> clicks<00:05:17.620> his<00:05:17.740> little<00:05:17.920> button

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
chair and he clicks his little button

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.890 
chair and he clicks his little button
and<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.310> makes<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.550> sound<00:05:18.760> as<00:05:19.360> if<00:05:19.570> he<00:05:19.810> was

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
and it makes a sound as if he was

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.920 
and it makes a sound as if he was
locking<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.350> doors<00:05:20.670> so<00:05:21.670> that's<00:05:22.240> kinesthetic

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
locking the doors so that's kinesthetic

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.990 
locking the doors so that's kinesthetic
learning<00:05:23.140> that's<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.920> kinesthetic<00:05:24.370> approach

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
learning that's a kinesthetic approach

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.740 
learning that's a kinesthetic approach
to<00:05:25.750> this<00:05:26.530> type<00:05:26.980> of<00:05:27.010> conceptualizing<00:05:27.760> lining

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
to this type of conceptualizing lining

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.670 
to this type of conceptualizing lining
up<00:05:28.840> with<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:29.020> thing<00:05:29.230> you're<00:05:29.350> wanting<00:05:29.620> to

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
up with the thing you're wanting to

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.780 
up with the thing you're wanting to
create

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
create

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.550 
create
you<00:05:32.790> also<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.870> think<00:05:34.110> this<00:05:34.200> is<00:05:34.260> probably

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
you also and I think this is probably

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.760 
you also and I think this is probably
true<00:05:34.740> for<00:05:34.890> most<00:05:35.190> people<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.840> also<00:05:37.110> may

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
true for most people you also may

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.990 
true for most people you also may
benefit<00:05:38.670> from<00:05:38.940> combining<00:05:40.370> any<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:41.790> those

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
benefit from combining any of those

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.330 
benefit from combining any of those
together<00:05:42.510> in<00:05:42.990> some<00:05:43.350> way<00:05:43.500> that<00:05:43.680> makes<00:05:43.890> sense

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
together in some way that makes sense

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.070 
together in some way that makes sense
for<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:44.810> because<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.960> bottom<00:05:46.140> line<00:05:46.320> here<00:05:46.770> is

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
for you because the bottom line here is

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.870 
for you because the bottom line here is
whether<00:05:49.080> you<00:05:49.350> use<00:05:49.380> this<00:05:49.860> tool<00:05:50.190> or<00:05:50.490> you<00:05:50.670> use

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
whether you use this tool or you use

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.390 
whether you use this tool or you use
another<00:05:51.180> tool<00:05:51.390> it<00:05:51.600> doesn't<00:05:51.900> really<00:05:52.020> matter

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
another tool it doesn't really matter

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.430 
another tool it doesn't really matter
the<00:05:53.400> truth<00:05:53.700> is<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:54.120> will<00:05:54.330> create<00:05:54.660> if<00:05:55.140> you

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
the truth is you will create if you

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.990 
the truth is you will create if you
start<00:05:55.740> paying<00:05:55.890> attention<00:05:56.010> and<00:05:56.520> you<00:05:56.640> do<00:05:56.820> what

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
start paying attention and you do what

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.580 
start paying attention and you do what
feels<00:05:57.180> good<00:05:57.420> and<00:05:57.570> you<00:05:57.780> pay<00:05:57.960> attention<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.500> your

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
feels good and you pay attention to your

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.860 
feels good and you pay attention to your
inner<00:05:58.770> guidance<00:05:59.090> the<00:06:00.090> little<00:06:00.360> nudges<00:06:00.720> that

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
inner guidance the little nudges that

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.810 
inner guidance the little nudges that
you're<00:06:00.990> going<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.170> get<00:06:01.230> along<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.590> way<00:06:01.820> you

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
you're going to get along the way you

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.180 
you're going to get along the way you
will<00:06:02.850> find<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.540> way<00:06:03.660> that<00:06:03.840> works<00:06:03.990> for<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.320> so

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
will find the way that works for you so

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.690 
will find the way that works for you so
for<00:06:05.490> me<00:06:05.640> I<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.690> mix<00:06:07.110> a<00:06:07.290> visual<00:06:07.830> and<00:06:08.160> kinesthetic

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
for me I a mix a visual and kinesthetic

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.940 
for me I a mix a visual and kinesthetic
but<00:06:09.150> i<00:06:09.210> also<00:06:09.360> like<00:06:09.480> a<00:06:09.630> little<00:06:09.960> auditory<00:06:10.440> on<00:06:10.770> the

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
but i also like a little auditory on the

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.900 
but i also like a little auditory on the
side<00:06:11.160> so<00:06:12.030> for<00:06:12.660> me<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:13.020> best<00:06:13.230> kind<00:06:13.680> of

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
side so for me the best kind of

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.110 
side so for me the best kind of
conceptualizing<00:06:14.910> is<00:06:15.540> to<00:06:15.780> see<00:06:15.990> myself<00:06:16.470> in<00:06:17.310> the

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
conceptualizing is to see myself in the

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.820 
conceptualizing is to see myself in the
process<00:06:18.300> so<00:06:18.750> if<00:06:18.810> it<00:06:18.900> was<00:06:18.990> a<00:06:19.020> car<00:06:19.290> I<00:06:19.320> would<00:06:19.560> want

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
process so if it was a car I would want

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.740 
process so if it was a car I would want
to<00:06:19.919> see<00:06:20.070> myself<00:06:20.250> in<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.760> car<00:06:21.000> but<00:06:21.540> it<00:06:21.630> has<00:06:21.720> to

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
to see myself in the car but it has to

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.640 
to see myself in the car but it has to
be<00:06:21.960> me<00:06:21.990> in<00:06:22.530> my<00:06:23.220> body<00:06:23.490> in<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:24.150> car<00:06:24.410> driving<00:06:25.410> down
