00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.270
 today we are going to talk about the winter we 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.370
 accompanies gustavo wilches chaux gustavo 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.349
 you who are an expert in these matters 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.389
 the country is literally flooded not 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.579
 only for the winter but flooded 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.199
 of news related to this topic and 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.270
 with the way the national government 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.010
 has been facing disaster 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.930
 winter the tragedy as it has 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.340
 called what we should have in 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.920
 counts both journalists and 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.480
 viewers when analyzing these 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.640
 phenomena to understand what 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.320
 it's really happening to us if I do not believe 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.180
 the way that the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.700
 flood of news does not contribute to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.320
 aggravate the disaster is that people 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.630
 that we receive those 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.790
 news we have enzymes that we 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.410
 allow to digest them to be able to understand 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.630
 what is happening to look at them 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.070
 depending on processes for example I 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.840
 I insist a lot and sometimes I think it is 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.880
 a lost battle that can not be 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.739
 say that the girl is a natural disaster 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.680
 the girl is a phenomenon of nature 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.059
 is a quasi-periodic phenomenon that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.790
 presents times stronger than 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.590
 sometimes presents with effects - - - 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.570
 strong as it happens with the child 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.950
 but what generates the disaster is not the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.600
 girl in is the child what generates the 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.000
 disaster the inability of the territory 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.590
 to absorb their 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.090
 and that disability must be 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.650
 mainly how we 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.360
 understanding how we have been carrying 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.580
 the development thinking that the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.290
 nature is an inert being that the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.840
 territory is a pity is a scenario 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.870
 passive when it really is a living being 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.150
 that reacts against the say the 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.070
 human activities and in that loss of 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.770
 territory of its ability to absorb 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 the natural phenomenon undoubtedly there 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.180
 a responsibility of human beings 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.570
 in handling in the same relationship with 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.770
 that territory of course because as 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.330
 I said a moment ago we have 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.790
 thought that nature is just a 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.170
 object when nature is a subject 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.690
 is a living being and as such has a 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.030
 immune system and just like a child 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.550
 he gets a fever when he is attacked by a virus and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.680
 then he puts his organism to work 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.690
 to expel the virus the nature to 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.700
 planetary level has put your system 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.619
 immune to work and is trying 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.030
 to get rid of the plague what is serious is 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.369
 that in that case the plague is the beings 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.680
 humans our ethical responsibility is 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.270
 with humans but so that 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.759
 we can continue on this planet we have 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.080
 to give up that pest condition 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.450
 because if not the planet ends us 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.400
 pulling out frequently is said 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.020
 of communication they repeat that we have 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.239
 that save the planet when the planet 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.680
 it saves itself without any problem what 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.629
 we have to save is the possibility of 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.310
 humans to continue forming 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.440
 part of the earth but as we have 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.989
 searched to not keep repeating that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.209
 this is a punishment from god we dropped the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.440
 tragedy as if we did not have anything that 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.819
 see with it 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.800
 Of course, you see that in the 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.390
 standards that the government has issued for 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.250
 declare an emergency that there are all 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.170
 the reasons of course to declare it 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.180
 but they start by saying that the girl is 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.720
 a phenomenon is a forgiveness is a disaster 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.730
 inevitable and unpredictable natural when 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.920
 it turns out that if one looks year after year 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.810
 this has been repeated with less 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.489
 intensity that now but it has come 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.590
 repeating one way or another from 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.220
 many years ago and you look to quote 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.780
 recent years 2008-2009 of 2010 is already 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.989
 difficult to know if a news item that has not 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.299
 recorded is from the year 2010 or from the year 2011 or 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.400
 if from the year 2000 2004 or if it is from 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.019
 year 2008 because it is repeating what 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.130
 which is what is unpublished in some 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.470
 way is that the country is in emergency 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.710
 from the guajira to nariño and from the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.050
 choco 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.000
 the llanero piedmont but the other has 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.920
 come happening always and I think 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.450
 that as far as we go 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.550
 understanding as I said a moment ago 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.290
 depending on processes what is 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.030
 happening to that extent not only 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.520
 we understand the news better but 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.440
 we are training ourselves to interact 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.360
 better with this planet which we form 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.310
 part in that same sense you have 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.260
 called attention to the effect that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.780
 has on the territory the exploitation 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.730
 mining and hydrocarbon exploration 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.500
 and what can happen if we continue 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.420
 perpetuating this development model 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.100
 good for the sake of justice let's say that 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.440
 there are many people worried about that same 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.670
 theme and there are many movements like the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.410
 that is taking place in Santander to 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.170
 around the mine in the páramo of 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.599
 santurbán for example 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.770
 it's not about demonizing mining 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.959
 it's about saying that 's an activity 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.140
 that you have to see it absolutely because 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.459
 that would be would be let's say unreal but if 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.410
 It is know that there are places 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.690
 where there definitely can not be 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.760
 mining as for example in the páramos 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.140
 and a very serious thing that is happening 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.329
 in colombia is that after the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.150
 issuance of the mining code that prohibits 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.130
 exhaustively grant mining titles in 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.900
 the páramos were granted mining titles 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.700
 in stoppages because there should not be 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.250
 mining in a páramo gustavo like 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.650
 we explain that to the ordinary citizen in 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.229
 the wasteland in the first place is a 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.720
 almost exclusive patrimony of colombia 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.190
 there are páramos in Colombia there are some 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.889
 páramos in venezuela in the equator 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.600
 some in Peru but the largest moor 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.540
 of the world 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.600
 the greatest wasteland in the galaxy is 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.220
 here in bogotá is the páramo of sumapaz and 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.370
 the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.020
 the water supply for many 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.580
 territories and consequently the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.180
 life possibilities for a lot 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.250
 people depend on that water that is 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.130
 regulating the páramo that is capturing the 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.830
 páramo and that is regulating the ipo and by 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.440
 course without water it is impossible for a 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.780
 territory exist the wastelands are like 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.980
 an essential part of the system 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.750
 immune of the territories 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.120
 Colombians and they will be fundamental 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.940
 for the country's adaptation to change 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.810
 climatic or that the páramos 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.700
 they should be like cultures were 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.110
 sacred pre-Columbian and as 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.360
 tried a lot of people in the 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.130
 Colombian legislation that are sacred 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.380
 that's why there are places where 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.240
 You definitely can not talk about 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.520
 mining and there are other places where with 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.900
 with appropriate technologies with some 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.360
 social responsibility policies 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.670
 appropriate if it will be possible or is 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.010
 possible to do mining and why should not 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.750
 have oil exploration in the area 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.930
 of san andrés and good providence there 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.970
 we must highlight the work of the 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.950
 director of coralina and me in my 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.260
 articles emphasized the genre a lot 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.880
 because they are directors of corporations 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.040
 autonomous regions have had 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.930
 the value of assuming very positions 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.030
 verticals even in front of the government 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.790
 national and say there are places where no 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.890
 we admit that a license of 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.170
 mining in around San Andrés de 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.300
 province and province one of the places 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.040
 where is it that they were auctioned 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.510
 public for exploration of 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.760
 hydrocarbons is a reserve of the 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.460
 biosphere recognized worldwide as a 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.650
 site of special ecological importance 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.880
 then those are that are the kind of 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.980
 places 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.890
 let's say irrecoverable in case 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.810
 lose and if we look for example the 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.160
 development and we measure it based on 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.900
 children's rights but not 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.300
 only that of the generations that 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.460
 currently exist but of those of 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.860
 who will be boys and girls within 20 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.360
 / 25 years if you ask one that they are going to 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.570
 need that is more important to 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.250
 them that the country really has a few 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.590
 territories capable of adapting to 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.690
 changes or what or what in the century to 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.850
 early 21st century have 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.220
 extracted large quantities of gold or of 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.870
 coal or coltan oil for 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.700
 generate to increase the product 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.490
 GDP of the country but at the expense of 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.050
 a tremendous ecological impoverishment 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.000
 I finally like a recommendation 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.250
 for journalists who have to 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.720
 permanently cover these events and 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.660
 Sometimes they do not have the tools 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.250
 necessary to make good news 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.610
 and a good information all these 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.620
 Daily news are parts of 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.330
 processes and I think that when one 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.160
 begins to watch the news in function 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.510
 of processes happens what I said does 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.250
 a moment we look at the news today 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.830
 but we see that it was repeated in the 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.870
 2010 in 2009 in 2008 from there to 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.580
 back the same journalist 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.290
 a kind of déjà vú to say this I what 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.510
 I covered many years ago then 

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.840
 start looking at that process of digging 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:44.420
 the under the leaves understand why it 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.100
 comes to produce that news and make 

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.410
 what is the person who is understanding 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.330
 practice journalism and share that 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.010
 understanding with the people who 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.810
 they are users of their work 

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.810
 thanks for state the city and judith
