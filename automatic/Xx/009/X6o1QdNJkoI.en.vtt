00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.410
 hello guys in this new video vi 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.110
 I will show the tutorial of this nail art 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.080
 in collaboration with the inter make up 83 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.850
 dedicates a very sweet girl to herself 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.330
 his channel makes makeup tutorials 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.030
 review tags and many other videos as a theme 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.820
 of the collaboration we have chosen the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.580
 blue the blue colors I remember in the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.620
 sea ​​and with a little silver I will realize 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.870
 lara gut while she is there among the make up 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.430
 with the bulls of these colors if you are 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.739
 interested rings of all 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.590
 we will read organized over everything long 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.770
 a bitch helping me with salvos 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.750
 greece or code is just to make it happen 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.370
 I used a mother of pearl vi 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.680
 worry if the semicircle above 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.260
 below is not perfect because now 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.430
 let's go get a nail polish on the side 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.840
 of man of letters with silver colors 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.340
 we sell give the semicircle the shape 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.470
 because we prefer to go now 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.869
 make another semicircle with a few strokes 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.610
 on how done in the other nails always 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.610
 with this glittery enamel 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.340
 now with the blue enamel I will leave the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:34.310
 color within the semicircle flow 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:38.870
 in this way I do the same with the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.340
 mother then speaks with a nib from the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.340
 fine tip mixed colors 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.619
 now instead of the semicircle 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.030
 we will go on admit beyond the blue and 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.030
 mother-of-pearl also blue 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.129
 my brush depends and I go to 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.280
 mixing colors I make movements 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.280
 circular 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.459
 in this way we will have different gradations 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.459
 of color 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.660
 the thing I really like about this one 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.430
 nail art is the fact that we can 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.010
 achieve both on long nails but 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.990
 also on short nails because this 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.400
 type of france allows us one 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.130
 once the color is realized 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.230
 want to make everything dry 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.370
 pass over shows because it will not be 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.080
 concluded I hope you enjoy it 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.940

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.340
