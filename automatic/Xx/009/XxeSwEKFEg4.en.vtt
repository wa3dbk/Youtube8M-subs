00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.700
 I like it 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.480
 natural science test question 92 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.160
 says one researcher submits two groups 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.800
 of mice to the conditions shown 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.750
 the table group 1 in exercise during a 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.399
 month before the experiment groups without 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.590
 exercise for a month before the 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.149
 experiment he wants to evaluate the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.369
 capacity that has these two groups of 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.829
 mice remember a place guided by 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.960
 objects located in space for this 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.270
 put the mice of each group in a 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.190
 tank with water for one minute and for 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.809
 seven consecutive days so that 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.850
 find a transparent container that 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.670
 floats in the tank and that is marked 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.379
 with a triangle on the wall the last 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.089
 day records the trajectory that runs 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.399
 each mouse as shown in the figure 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.239
 then we see that in faith says the 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.429
 Group 1 mouse Figure 1 shows the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.710
 transparent object and the trajectory of 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.050
 the mice in the next image we see 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.230
 the group of mice 2 where we see 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.030
 a rather turbid path and 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.850
 a label appears where it says that the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.100
 triangle is the object on the wall the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.310
 dotted line and the trajectory of 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.790
 mouse and confirm that the dotted object 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 It is the vessel that floats 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.800
 for this love the response options 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.080
 said according to the experiment 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.810
 because the mice in group 1 located 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 so easily the recipient because the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.130
 triangle he saw them until the recipient sees 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.350
 because they swam faster than 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.240
 mice of group 2 c because 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.640
 they stayed longer in the tank 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.080
 that the mice of group 2 d because the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 exercise improved his ability to 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.030
 memorize then if we are guided by the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 question here tells us here because the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.510
 group mice located so 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.850
 easily the container with that we can 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.770
 discard the time because here it tells me that 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 they swam faster he wants to know by 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 which more easily located the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.160
 recipient if we review the because the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.660
 triangle he saw them to the container if 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.030
 we look at the label and if we look at the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.650
 enunciated the triangle is an object if 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.979
 a whole wall is no longer an object that is 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.119
 is moving if visual and then in 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.619
 conclusion we can say that the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.470
 answer is because of the exercise 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.239
 he improved his ability to memorize because 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.750
 he does not do it because they stayed more 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.980
 weather 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.410
 remember that he denounced said 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.030
 all two groups of mice are 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.330
 they kept for a minute and for seven 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.940
 days so this conclusion is false 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.830
 the answer for question 98 in the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.120
 why exercise improved 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.120
 ability to memorize
