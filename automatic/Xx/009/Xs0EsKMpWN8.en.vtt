trailer well I think we've solved that

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.429 
trailer well I think we've solved that
problem<00:00:22.340> this<00:00:22.849> is<00:00:23.000> a<00:00:23.029> two<00:00:23.300> horse<00:00:23.509> unit<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:24.290> we

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
problem this is a two horse unit that we

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.190 
problem this is a two horse unit that we
built<00:00:24.680> free-climb<00:00:25.160> overcoat<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:26.540> has<00:00:26.720> a

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
built free-climb overcoat and it has a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.700 
built free-climb overcoat and it has a
pod<00:00:27.849> storage<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.119> actually<00:00:29.720> retracts<00:00:30.110> into

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
pod storage that actually retracts into

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.370 
pod storage that actually retracts into
the<00:00:30.980> roof<00:00:31.189> so<00:00:32.000> we<00:00:32.119> bring<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.450> tray<00:00:32.720> down<00:00:32.960> and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
the roof so we bring the tray down and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.080 
the roof so we bring the tray down and
this<00:00:33.710> tray<00:00:34.010> will<00:00:34.250> go<00:00:34.399> all<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.670> way<00:00:34.700> to<00:00:34.850> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
this tray will go all the way to the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.330 
this tray will go all the way to the
floor<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.110> you<00:00:36.170> don't<00:00:36.410> have<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:36.710> lift<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:37.130> hay

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
floor so you don't have to lift that hay

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.970 
floor so you don't have to lift that hay
very<00:00:37.640> high<00:00:37.880> and<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:38.690> pop<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.110> in<00:00:39.230> there<00:00:39.469> and

very high and you pop it in there and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.650 
very high and you pop it in there and
once<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:40.309> get<00:00:40.489> it<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:40.760> there<00:00:40.940> then<00:00:41.510> we're

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
once you get it in there then we're

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.419 
once you get it in there then we're

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
it'll nest in the ceiling so it stays

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.090 
it'll nest in the ceiling so it stays
dry<00:00:46.129> it's<00:00:46.670> easy<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.239> access<00:00:47.750> it's<00:00:48.410> easy<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.890> put
