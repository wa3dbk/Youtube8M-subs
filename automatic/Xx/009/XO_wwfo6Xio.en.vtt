opportunities we actually end up drawing
this<00:00:58.500> match<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.100> nil<00:00:59.640> nil<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.120> relatively

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
this match and nil nil is a relatively

this match and nil nil is a relatively
boring<00:01:00.870> game<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.460> neither<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> sides

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
boring game with neither the sides

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
boring game with neither the sides
getting<00:01:03.329> many<00:01:03.570> opportunities<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.559> didn't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
getting many opportunities we didn't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.469 
getting many opportunities we didn't
create<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.519> again<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.880> didn't<00:01:06.119> concede

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
create much but again we didn't concede

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
movement and it was fifty percent

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
movement and it was fifty percent
possession<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.150> both<00:01:24.390> sides<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.810> move<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
possession on both sides we move in to

a<00:01:30.150> relatively<00:01:30.570> strong<00:01:30.990> side<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.009> wasn't

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
a relatively strong side and I wasn't

this much because I knew that this club

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
this much because I knew that this club
had<00:01:36.420> been<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.869> pretty<00:01:37.350> good<00:01:37.590> club<00:01:37.829> last<00:01:38.579> season

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
we seem to do pretty well and that's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.289 
we seem to do pretty well and that's
actually<00:02:52.949> how<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.189> ended<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.639> 90th<00:02:54.180> minute

that's how it ended two goals to nil
against<00:03:01.260> seen<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.769> didn't<00:03:02.010> expect<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.340> so

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
against seen the didn't expect to be so

against seen the didn't expect to be so
possibly<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:04.079> fixed<00:03:04.769> our<00:03:04.889> match<00:03:06.260> creation

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
possibly a fixed our match creation

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.939 
possibly a fixed our match creation
problems<00:03:07.650> our<00:03:07.799> goal<00:03:07.980> creation<00:03:08.370> problems<00:03:08.730> and

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
quick and I was a little bit worried

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.210 
quick and I was a little bit worried
about<00:05:07.229> playing<00:05:07.530> because<00:05:07.710> we<00:05:07.830> might<00:05:07.950> be<00:05:08.010> left

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
about playing because we might be left

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.950 
about playing because we might be left
short<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.520> back<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.940> only<00:05:09.060> got<00:05:09.180> 45<00:05:09.630> pace

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
short the back is the only got 45 pace

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.710 
short the back is the only got 45 pace
but<00:05:10.350> he<00:05:10.440> finished<00:05:10.710> up<00:05:10.830> free<00:05:11.040> kick<00:05:11.220> in<00:05:11.370> style

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
but he finished up free kick in style

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.520 
but he finished up free kick in style
unfortunately<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.810> goalkeeper<00:05:13.200> did<00:05:13.350> make<00:05:13.500> a

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
unfortunately the goalkeeper did make a

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.050 
unfortunately the goalkeeper did make a
horrendous<00:05:14.250> mistake<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.729> probably<00:05:14.940> should

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
horrendous mistake and probably should

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.969 
horrendous mistake and probably should
have<00:05:15.120> kept<00:05:15.330> that<00:05:15.360> one<00:05:15.570> out<00:05:15.750> but<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.410> goal<00:05:16.590> is<00:05:16.830> a

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
have kept that one out but a goal is a

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.100 
have kept that one out but a goal is a
goal<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.479> you<00:05:18.479> can't<00:05:18.690> take<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:18.870> away<00:05:18.960> from

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
goal and you can't take that away from

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.719 
goal and you can't take that away from
him<00:05:19.320> it<00:05:19.710> was<00:05:19.860> a<00:05:19.889> gives<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.340> good<00:05:20.490> free-kick

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
initially and that's how it ended but

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.780 
initially and that's how it ended but
unfortunately<00:05:23.220> I've<00:05:23.310> got<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.520> put<00:05:23.610> in<00:05:23.729> the
