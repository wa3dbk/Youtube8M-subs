yourself on the score sheet that's your

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.769 
yourself on the score sheet that's your
first<00:00:20.880> goal<00:00:21.150> since<00:00:21.180> Benfica<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> believe

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
first goal since Benfica I believe

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.660 
first goal since Benfica I believe
probably<00:00:24.779> yeah<00:00:25.080> how<00:00:26.039> did<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.250> feel<00:00:26.430> when<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
probably yeah how did you feel when the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.560 
probably yeah how did you feel when the
ball<00:00:26.880> hit<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> back<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> net<00:00:32.239> as<00:00:33.239> any

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
ball hit the back of the net as any

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.180 
ball hit the back of the net as any
other<00:00:33.780> player<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:34.649> say<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> most

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
other player would say the most

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.220 
other player would say the most
important<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> win<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.399> got<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.230> but

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
important is the win and we got that but

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.310 
important is the win and we got that but
but<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:41.040> score<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.399> always<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> nice<00:00:41.910> feeling

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
but to score is always a nice feeling

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.600 
but to score is always a nice feeling
certainly<00:00:43.320> looked<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> hard-fought<00:00:44.280> game

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
certainly looked like a hard-fought game

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
certainly looked like a hard-fought game
out<00:00:44.760> there<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> think<00:00:45.239> Liverpool<00:00:45.750> deserve

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
out there do you think Liverpool deserve

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.360 
out there do you think Liverpool deserve
to<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:47.180> we<00:00:48.180> defended<00:00:48.660> well<00:00:49.039> they<00:00:50.039> didn't

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
to what we defended well they didn't

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.360 
to what we defended well they didn't
really<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.360> many<00:00:51.600> chances<00:00:52.219> that<00:00:53.219> are

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
really have that many chances that are

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090 
really have that many chances that are
off<00:00:53.489> possession<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.809> many<00:00:55.020> chances<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.890> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
off possession but not many chances so I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.569 
off possession but not many chances so I
think<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.899> well<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
think we with that well but you know it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
think we with that well but you know it
is<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.329> tough<00:01:00.600> team<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> play<00:01:01.020> against<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
is a tough team to play against and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.649 
is a tough team to play against and
we're<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.670> footballers<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:05.659> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we're good footballers so I think you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.770 
we're good footballers so I think you
can't<00:01:06.930> talk<00:01:07.140> about<00:01:08.000> who<00:01:09.000> deserves<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.659> know

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
can't talk about who deserves we know

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.840 
can't talk about who deserves we know
not<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.470> football<00:01:10.700> everything<00:01:11.700> can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
not because it's football everything can

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
not because it's football everything can
happen<00:01:11.970> has<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.020> being<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> perfect<00:01:13.890> week

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
