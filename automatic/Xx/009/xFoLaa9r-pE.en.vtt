00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
kind of altering attack mode if you've

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.349 
kind of altering attack mode if you've
seen<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.840> show<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.730> guess<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.940> attack<00:03:08.180> mode

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
seen the show I guess this attack mode

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.849 
seen the show I guess this attack mode
comes<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.630> handy<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.260> fact<00:03:09.470> that<00:03:09.560> he<00:03:09.709> can

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
comes in handy to the fact that he can

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.800

and<00:03:57.190> then<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.340> next<00:03:58.490> pieces<00:03:58.760> would<00:03:58.970> probably

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
and then the next pieces would probably

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.470 
and then the next pieces would probably
be<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.420> door<00:03:59.600> guns<00:03:59.810> here<00:04:00.050> so<00:04:01.210> it's<00:04:02.210> a<00:04:02.270> very

time<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.680> only<00:04:12.920> gripe<00:04:13.160> with<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:13.550> guy<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:14.060> but

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
time the only gripe with this guy it but

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.270 
time the only gripe with this guy it but
this<00:04:14.600> is<00:04:14.780> just<00:04:15.020> because<00:04:15.290> it's<00:04:15.470> it's<00:04:15.830> an<00:04:16.040> older

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
this is just because it's it's an older

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.830 
this is just because it's it's an older
toy<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.510> springs<00:04:18.290> in<00:04:18.650> here<00:04:19.100> that

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
toy is that the springs in here that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.200 
toy is that the springs in here that
hold<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.049> wheels<00:04:21.709> up<00:04:22.010> can<00:04:22.430> sometimes<00:04:22.880> get

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
hold the wheels up can sometimes get

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.560 
hold the wheels up can sometimes get
loose<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:25.150> sometimes<00:04:26.150> when<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.330> have<00:04:26.420> in<00:04:26.510> a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
loose so sometimes when you have in a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.770 
loose so sometimes when you have in a
vehicle<00:04:26.750> mode<00:04:26.990> these<00:04:27.170> won't<00:04:27.380> stay<00:04:27.710> connected

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
vehicle mode these won't stay connected

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.260 
vehicle mode these won't stay connected
but<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:30.050> mean<00:04:30.490> that's<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.760> because<00:04:32.120> of

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
but I mean that's just because of

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.170 
but I mean that's just because of
overtime<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:33.050> guess<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.190> don't<00:04:34.880> know<00:04:35.000> how<00:04:35.090> to

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
overtime I guess I don't know how to

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.050 
overtime I guess I don't know how to
really<00:04:35.360> fix<00:04:35.540> that<00:04:35.600> but<00:04:36.670> so<00:04:37.670> this<00:04:37.850> has<00:04:37.970> just

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
really fix that but so this has just

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.930
