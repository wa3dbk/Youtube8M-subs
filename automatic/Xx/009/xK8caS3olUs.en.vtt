00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
defense is there just like that and then

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.300 
defense is there just like that and then
refer<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.230> roof<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.829> we're<00:04:09.069> going<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.250> go

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
so it's like I said it's gonna be a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.869 
so it's like I said it's gonna be a
small<00:04:14.079> chimney<00:04:14.530> here<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:15.340> just<00:04:15.489> have<00:04:15.579> a<00:04:15.669> small

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
small chimney here you just have a small

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.270 
small chimney here you just have a small
little<00:04:16.180> roof<00:04:16.510> nothing<00:04:17.470> too<00:04:17.650> fancy<00:04:18.010> or

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
little roof nothing too fancy or

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.009 
little roof nothing too fancy or
extremely<00:04:18.729> detailed<00:04:19.299> but<00:04:19.599> if<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.840> had<00:04:19.989> a

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
extremely detailed but if you had a

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.260 
extremely detailed but if you had a
couple<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.500> fences<00:04:20.680> on<00:04:21.070> here<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.579> mean<00:04:22.150> these

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
couple of fences on here I mean these

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210 
couple of fences on here I mean these
fences<00:04:22.539> have<00:04:22.840> no<00:04:22.990> particular<00:04:23.169> use<00:04:23.919> or

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
fences have no particular use or

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.440 
fences have no particular use or
reasoning<00:04:25.090> behind

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
reasoning behind

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.630 
reasoning behind
but<00:04:26.200> this<00:04:26.500> adds<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.920> little<00:04:27.040> something<00:04:27.370> a

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
but this adds a little something a

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.190 
but this adds a little something a
little<00:04:27.670> detail<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.450> your<00:04:28.540> bills<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:28.990> that's

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
little detail to your bills and that's

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.710 
little detail to your bills and that's
why<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.380> like<00:04:29.500> using<00:04:29.830> those<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:31.210> then<00:04:31.390> for<00:04:31.630> the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
why I like using those and then for the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.390 
why I like using those and then for the
inside<00:04:32.110> here<00:04:32.410> just<00:04:32.620> go<00:04:32.770> ahead<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.010> clear<00:04:33.280> all

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
inside here just go ahead and clear all

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.340 
inside here just go ahead and clear all
this<00:04:33.520> out<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.330> we're<00:04:34.570> just<00:04:34.750> going<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.900> use<00:04:35.080> Col

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
this out and we're just going to use Col

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.860 
this out and we're just going to use Col
for<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.830> floor<00:04:36.070> why<00:04:36.280> not<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.780> thought<00:04:37.780> about

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
for the floor why not I thought about

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.720 
for the floor why not I thought about
using<00:04:38.140> someone<00:04:38.710> or<00:04:38.830> something<00:04:39.190> but<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.370> figure

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
using someone or something but I figure

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.460 
using someone or something but I figure
a<00:04:39.760> couple<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.330> little<00:04:40.660> bit<00:04:40.780> more<00:04:40.900> rugged<00:04:41.140> and

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
a couple is a little bit more rugged and

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.200 
a couple is a little bit more rugged and
stuff<00:04:41.710> after<00:04:42.340> all<00:04:42.520> this<00:04:42.670> is<00:04:42.730> supposed<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.150> be

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
stuff after all this is supposed to be

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.360 
stuff after all this is supposed to be
like<00:04:43.480> an<00:04:43.600> aurochs<00:04:43.870> house<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.530> orchestra

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
like an aurochs house and orchestra

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.280 
like an aurochs house and orchestra
usually<00:04:45.700> like<00:04:45.850> dirty<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.450> slimy<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.080> he'll

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
usually like dirty and slimy and he'll

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.920 
usually like dirty and slimy and he'll
you<00:04:47.590> know<00:04:47.710> whatever<00:04:47.980> so<00:04:48.880> at<00:04:49.150> least<00:04:49.270> from<00:04:49.510> from

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
you know whatever so at least from from

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.140 
you know whatever so at least from from
my<00:04:50.140> experience<00:04:50.890> all<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.190> work<00:04:51.340> scene<00:04:51.670> go<00:04:51.850> to

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
my experience all the work scene go to

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.530 
my experience all the work scene go to
see<00:04:52.330> they'd<00:04:52.720> be<00:04:52.900> like<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.300> I'm<00:04:55.420> not

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
see they'd be like that and I'm not

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.060 
see they'd be like that and I'm not
going<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.720> get<00:04:55.840> into<00:04:55.960> too<00:04:56.170> much<00:04:56.320> detail<00:04:56.740> as<00:04:56.770> far

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
going to get into too much detail as far

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.280 
going to get into too much detail as far
as<00:04:57.190> inside<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.210> build<00:04:58.450> like

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
as inside of the the build like

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.840 
as inside of the the build like
decorating<00:04:59.770> and<00:04:59.920> stuff<00:04:59.950> like<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.520> mean

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
decorating and stuff like that I mean

for Pocket Edition as far as building
goes<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:06.580> would<00:05:06.730> make<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.060> look<00:05:07.240> more<00:05:07.570> orcish

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
goes that would make it look more orcish

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
stairs instead this place stone brick

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.940 
stairs instead this place stone brick
stairs<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.960> maybe<00:05:29.140> this<00:05:29.320> will<00:05:29.560> look<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.800> little

stairs and maybe this will look a little
bit<00:05:30.160> better<00:05:30.310> I'm<00:05:31.270> thinking<00:05:31.570> so<00:05:32.880> yep<00:05:33.880> that

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
bit better I'm thinking so yep that

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480 
bit better I'm thinking so yep that
looks<00:05:34.510> a<00:05:34.720> lot<00:05:34.840> better<00:05:35.040> kind<00:05:36.040> of<00:05:36.100> it's<00:05:36.280> kind<00:05:36.400> of

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
looks a lot better kind of it's kind of

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.670 
looks a lot better kind of it's kind of
nice<00:05:36.640> to<00:05:36.700> just<00:05:37.120> kind<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.390> mess<00:05:37.870> around<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.410> and
