00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.780 
estimated that reducing troops to about
half<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> 75,000<00:01:36.570> by<00:01:36.630> 2013<00:01:37.470> could<00:01:38.130> increase

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
half to 75,000 by 2013 could increase

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.140 
half to 75,000 by 2013 could increase
the<00:01:38.850> deficit<00:01:39.479> by<00:01:39.990> 214<00:01:40.920> billion<00:01:41.579> dollars<00:01:41.880> over

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the deficit by 214 billion dollars over

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.690 
the deficit by 214 billion dollars over
ten<00:01:42.180> years<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.710> early<00:01:44.100> morning<00:01:44.399> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
ten years so I know it's early morning I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.039 
ten years so I know it's early morning I
just<00:01:44.729> tossed<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.149> lot<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.360> numbers<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.869> but

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
just tossed a lot of numbers at you but

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
just tossed a lot of numbers at you but
the<00:01:46.140> basic<00:01:46.500> idea<00:01:46.829> here<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:48.060> there's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the basic idea here is this when there's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
the basic idea here is this when there's
a<00:01:48.329> drawdown<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.020> incredibly<00:01:49.380> expensive<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
a drawdown it's incredibly expensive and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.620 
a drawdown it's incredibly expensive and
guys<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.520> whole<00:01:50.729> cost<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> war<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
guys the whole cost of the war in the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
guys the whole cost of the war in the
first<00:01:51.840> place<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.259> being<00:01:52.799> added<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.670> debt

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
first place is being added to the debt

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.819 
first place is being added to the debt
that's<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.659> general<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that's there in general so it's not the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.469 
that's there in general so it's not the
same<00:01:56.189> thing<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.490> real<00:01:56.790> money<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.329> could<00:01:57.420> be

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
same thing as real money that could be

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.780 
same thing as real money that could be
used<00:01:57.689> immediately<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.680> pay<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:58.979> programs<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
used immediately to pay for programs to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.700 
used immediately to pay for programs to
balance<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.240> budget<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.780> example<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> even

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
balance a budget for example or to even

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.170 
balance a budget for example or to even
get<00:02:01.890> rid<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> deficit<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.790> there<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.060> go

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
get rid of the deficit so there you go

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670 
get rid of the deficit so there you go
