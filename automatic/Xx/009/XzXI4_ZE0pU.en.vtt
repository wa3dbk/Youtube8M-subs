00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.399
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:23.829
 swimberghe if they did not know already 

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:28.919
 it's art not so it's tears 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:32.980
 flexible plastic which there that 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:36.040
 the end ends with a part 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.710
 which is at 90 degrees then these are 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.190
 lakes are available in different 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.010
 formats 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.879
 here you have for more which is rather 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:50.759
 medium and you can also have some 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.759
 small formats and very large format 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.930
 so what differentiates these 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.530
 lures there others the plastic art 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.360
 under the beach most special thing if 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.430
 you want it's the shape of the tail 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.240
 so what that it has 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.990
 particular done when you recover 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.259
 their tears 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.829
 the tail a shameful one side and long 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.119
 and that in the water creates a trail 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.370
 hydrodynamic 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.979
 a bit like an engine 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.520
 the boat leaves a wake in 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.070
 water that initiates vibrations and 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.010
 predators associate this trail 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.620
 hydrodynamic to the presence of prey 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.870
 so they feel about the vibrations 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.240
 they follow these releases their 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.549
 until art and at the last minute 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.330
 they use these vibrations for 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.580
 attack lola so very important this 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.490
 movement back and forth in addition to 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.790
 have it a hydrodynamic drag the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.040
 swing band when salvaged 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.159
 have a motion in hesse a movement 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.110
 ripple is what looks like 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.390
 to be mistaken for that of the real 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.450
 prey then this is what makes the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.310
 swing band are so effective 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.830
 all these are these are the advantages 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.790
 but there are people care are also 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.549
 disadvantages 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.189
 so these are lakes are difficult to 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.700
 ride most of the time for the 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.599
 mounting 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.989
 we use hooks of this kind with 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.120
 a little twist at the 20 so how 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.930
 are we eating bacon we place the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.969
 real life 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.280
 not without pain we turn for rabeni 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:40.000
 very tendril in bacon in 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.719
 the bacon accord and then we insert 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.719
 the hook in the ventral cleft and one 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.480
 bring her back to the top like this then 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:52.180
 at that moment the dollar is at the test 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.170
 airs to the test of the branches be 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.200
 recovered in places to combrit of 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.069
 all kinds of brush workshops 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.750
 if you want here I used a 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.060
 hook with a ballast 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.669
 so where it's a choice you can 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.069
 see if you want your father and 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.260
 your swing is in us a little bit more 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.359
 deep you can also choose from 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.180
 hooks that have no east but which 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:22.780
 are also equipped with the little spin that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.849
 allows to fix the bacon on the hook 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.269
 the most important thing is really that 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.180
 the art is centered on the hook if you 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.760
 place the blade are to the right or left 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.949
 the bacon in the skin the same trajectory 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.859
 and at that moment not the hand move 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:42.699
 s and will be less effective 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:45.370
 this is very important to well centered 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.650
 your lure the ideal is maybe 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.629
 also of how we are doing so 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.359
 to do some montages at home 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.250
 will leave so you can 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.989
 practice if you never do this 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.209
 mounting type when you ensure 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.009
 that your on time and help each other 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.530
 time on the water with the waves and then 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:05.319
 the movement became more difficult then 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.989
 it's a type of editing for their 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.970
 a little bit smaller you can everything 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.560
 simply use a size of 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:19.259
 dentine is regular and at that moment 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.060
 insert one more time in the middle and 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.919
 pushed the chord on the head in a 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.930
 help them to be right 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.360
 again the most important is 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.360
 that vodka be right your hook either 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.889
 well in the center of theirs in 10 years 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.220
 German is vertically 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.990
 so here it's less the place or 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.690
 linkedin is me the proof of 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.060
 clashes but it's also effective in 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.669
 deeper waters 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.820
 so more important when we 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.100
 just recover wimbÃ©e it is 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.980
 to have a regular movement if you want 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.000
 that this hagist hydrodynamic drag 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.780
 said that the fish 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.260
 the predator feel the vibrations 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.120
 follows them and goes directly to 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.360
 their ideal is to have a 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.570
 continuous recovery five or six 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.150
 runs nothing so that the predator that 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.120
 this well identify them approaching them 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.860
 and his seizure then care beit al 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.169
 harra find out if you do not have it 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.800
 already done and that there are two 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.810
 increases in popularity 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.280
 you will surely not hear the teeth 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.630
 some in the days that follow or 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.000
 in the following months 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.790
 so good fishing has all tried the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.360
 bath care enjoy and take some 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.360
 big fish
