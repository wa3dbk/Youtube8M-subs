 you do bars is the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.640
 engine is 16 valves double shaft 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 cams 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.620
 injection type turbo sports injection 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.780
 is the ts then this is being given 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.600
 type of maintenance we are going to change it 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 here is the time band and I'm going 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 to show how it is that they are going to take 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.559
 of reference the brands we are 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.020
 giving here a a tree bra 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.490
 ok cams where is it a tool 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.220
 special to put on time these 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.430
 engines 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.250
 this prevents the camshafts from 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 they are moving at the time of 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.780
 put it on time this is a bra 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.120
 is the one that will sustain you as you 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.510
 you can see this is a brand of 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.640
 camshaft time ok and in the 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.860
 another side is the other 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.050
 then this little bone that is here or 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.580
 this bra already brings this line 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.460
 black drawn here this arrow 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.350
 pointing up and then it's 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.820
 this tool can be found in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.360
 the live and in the amazon 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.090
 to put this 463 engine on time 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.470
 mitsubishi then how can you 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.700
 observe these are the two points of 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.830
 main reference tree 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.910
 cams or head plus apart down 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.060
 we have this the pampers the start of 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.060
 here 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.259
 make case to observe 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.490
 and we can also observe the time of 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.950
 the crankshaft pulley that has to 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.580
 to be there is that blade that looks 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.530
 there that slot 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.620
 everything has to be ok be on time 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.620
 there 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.920
 here we have this one reference 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.530
 commune by rate here on this plate and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.440
 there is also a brand in the block where 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.000
 we can take the reference that 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.610
 we practically would not need to make a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.980
 diagram at least this one that did not have 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.990
 too many brands or not even though it 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.850
 had burst the band and that the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.830
 brands were lost but this 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.120
 case that facing is working well 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.330
 and we go to this one 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.540
 to change the band 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.490
 then the dealer's band comes 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.490
 being is still here 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.730
 part number of the brand of the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.080
 Total mitsubishi that's the number of 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.900
 part that we are going to use us to 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.130
 replace this time band so 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.160
 this we are going to proceed to 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.110
 install it 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.390
 this time we are going to give you another shot 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.190
 of the video when it is properly installed 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.480
 before 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.210
 what it is still time band 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.760
 then to put them 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.330
 the cover the pulleys and everything else 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.960
 so you can see how the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.000
 already adjusted already well thought and everything the same 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.680
 let's also show them how it's going to 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 tense because that's another tool 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.000
 special that is going to occupy 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.159
 to think we're going to need this 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.269
 adapter that will go into two 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.560
 holes that it brings in the tensioning of 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.939
 the band then equal let's do 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.640
 another take when we are tensing the 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.950
 band so that you look good there 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.080
 you can see this already 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.280
 put the band right now with the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.280
 special tool that I showed you 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.880
 let's proceed here how are we going 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.020
 to proceed 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.520
 when tensing the band ok the Peronists two 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.230
 people to help them because it's a bit 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.870
 difficult here someone upstairs is going to 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.590
 be is tightening the tensioned to 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.300
 that the band is not coming back ok 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.889
 way is the little bone we had in the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.139
 camshafts we do not go to this one 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.389
 we are not going to fight now so that it moves 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.310
 more the band was well secured then 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.090
 there are already the brands down here also of 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.610
 those of the oil pump the jumper that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.340
 they call him that here there was no need to 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.639
 move the tensioner the hydraulic since 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.800
 you did not remove those pieces on 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.050
 tensioner keeps putting pressure on the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.509
 base of the tensor nador 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.080
 and they are not going to move any of that 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.870
 just here adjust what comes 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.320
 being the band 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.480
 and there has to be by certain the 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.700
 marks on time 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.860
 and well let's proceed right now 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.050
 tighten it well and let's make a take 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.760
 end of how the band was and 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.650
 later when we stopped the car all 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.480
 we're going to make another shot so 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.820
 this we will proceed to hold well 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.050
 this band tense the and we continue to 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.409
 ais 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.690
 because already installed you can 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.009
 appreciate we are here and took off the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.530
 tool that will sustain the 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.050
 camshafts down well as well 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.509
 are the brands in their time is already 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.710
 everything is perfectly fine what 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.500
 let's proceed we now 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.360
 put the spark plugs put the wires 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.169
 put the pulley that goes in front and 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.120
 let him walk like this 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.120
 to check that everything has been left 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.710
 this well then before assembling 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.749
 everything back 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.550
 you have to try to get him to walk like this for 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.919
 see if the band was not left with fire 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.020
 was not adjusted or if he did not jump 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.659
 the time to give him all his 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.900
 details have to be seen before throwing 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.490
 ride the engine then here as there is no 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.810
 need to put supports there is no 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.400
 need to put blankets 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.430
 just the pure fight from below the 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.460
 crankshaft the spark plugs and wires and you 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.819
 let's go forward so this is going to 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.819
 do this 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.030
 what 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.030
 the climbing and standard band 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.370
 before throwing it, remember 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.070
 comes 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.370
 in this place if the accessories to see 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.030
 if the band was out of adjustment or has 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.030
 to adjust more 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.689
 the right tool 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:08.669
 because adolescence 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:13.129
 time 95 and 295 turbo 2.0 engine in the 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:13.129
 same installation the same procedure 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:28.789
 I believe in my channel leave your comments 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:33.270
 there is my brother and he teaches them to 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:36.410
 computers like having computers 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.410
 how to clean them 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:43.510
 well let's go there more than tell them not 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:45.860
 comments questions and 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.280
 I was already in contact with you 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.150
 as I did previously 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.480
 we are not talking to the next 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.480
 video
