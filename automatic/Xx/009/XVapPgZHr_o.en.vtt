00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it was probably one of the best episodes

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.940 
it was probably one of the best episodes
so<00:01:11.760> far<00:01:12.060> except<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.049> episode<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.740> first

and it's a unique item I was really

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.840 
and it's a unique item I was really
excited<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> unique<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.610> just

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
excited that I got a unique it just

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.730 
excited that I got a unique it just
pushes<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.329> series<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.049> much<00:01:34.229> farther<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
pushes the series that much farther and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.679 
pushes the series that much farther and
then<00:01:35.189> believe<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.820> only<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.479> two

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
then believe it or not only like two

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
then believe it or not only like two
chests<00:01:36.960> later<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> Carroll's<00:01:38.220> top<00:01:38.579> which

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
chests later I got a Carroll's top which

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.480 
chests later I got a Carroll's top which
was<00:01:39.119> pretty<00:01:39.630> surprising<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.770> first<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.159> didn't

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
was pretty surprising at first I didn't

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
was pretty surprising at first I didn't
think<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.729> had<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.210> thought<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> skirt

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
think I had it I thought I got the skirt

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
think I had it I thought I got the skirt
originally<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.890> did<00:01:44.250> already<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> top

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
originally but I did already have a top

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
originally but I did already have a top
so<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> mean<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> duplicate<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:47.189> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so I mean that was a duplicate but a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.240 
so I mean that was a duplicate but a
Karass<00:01:47.880> top<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.240> around<00:01:48.509> 450<00:01:49.320> k5<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.710> okay<00:01:50.009> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
Karass top is around 450 k5 and okay so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.910 
Karass top is around 450 k5 and okay so
that<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.850> nice<00:01:51.360> chunk<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.720> change<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.200> add<00:01:52.710> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that is a nice chunk of change to add to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.859 
that is a nice chunk of change to add to

the Carroll's crossbow and I got really
really<00:03:08.169> sad<00:03:08.470> because<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:09.220> already<00:03:09.700> have<00:03:09.849> one

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
really sad because I already have one

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.210 
really sad because I already have one
like<00:03:10.689> this<00:03:10.870> drop<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.290> me<00:03:11.439> is<00:03:11.590> worse<00:03:11.859> than<00:03:12.099> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
like this drop to me is worse than a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.379 
like this drop to me is worse than a
curse<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.519> even<00:03:12.819> though<00:03:12.909> it's<00:03:13.060> worth<00:03:13.209> like

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
curse I even though it's worth like

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.179 
curse I even though it's worth like
foreign<00:03:13.689> decay<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.109> thing<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.769> the

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
foreign decay the thing is like the

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.159 
foreign decay the thing is like the
pistol<00:03:15.549> crossbows<00:03:15.970> are<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.419> hard<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:16.780> get<00:03:16.959> for
