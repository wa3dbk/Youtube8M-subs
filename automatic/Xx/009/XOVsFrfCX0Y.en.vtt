 I thought you were dead 16 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 At the age, boys are picture 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 most important is that you have a goal in front 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.680
 eyes have that I have and if you firmly 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.800
 enough believe in it and will jesus that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.629
 do likewise 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.760
 you have a tumor either Jesus has 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.859
 Not much to do these days 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.600
 or he is just damn fast 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.339
 unfortunately, has someone already 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.210
 chosen who comes too late 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.210
 punishes life 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.840
 I'm looking for a course for new 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.150
 courage 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.150
 Do you know that you guessed 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.229
 what is with my face i have that 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.229
 okay but you have to write 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.960
 duell this is probably me 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.350
 i am a father he imposes 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.720
 Already in the house away is easy 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 and we do not have a father 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.260
 you can still play like that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.570
 somebody there really accepted something 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.619
 but suddenly he gets a doubt what he is doing 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.990
 does 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.380
 believe in your own way 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.380
 that's the right one 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.190
 What would you say when I die? 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.190
 I would like to communicate with you 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.190
 but you screw loose that was clear 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.470
 enjoy nature no 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.100

 cinemas and tells the story of mic 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.470
 mic to a youngster only 16 years old 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.150
 lives a small town in the usa 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.870
 Getting smaller means not only more 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.940
 magna 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.350
 his name is mike tyson and he would be clear for that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.450
 the school teased that he was the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.830
 slender guy and has anything but 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.690
 something in common with a boxer though 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.920
 the alternative last name of the family 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.140
 could have had much more 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.880
 worse and it is precisely mike tyson 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.870
 a boy who does not really like it 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.580
 has on the life and preferably 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.740
 he wants to die so he sets one

 mourning announcement in the local newspaper 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.590
 up and trying to get in the head 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.180
 shoot and a percent of the people 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.980
 those who try to survive that 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.630
 Actually , that's the way mike works 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.070
 wakes up in the hospital and somehow 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.780
 everyone in the city thought after this 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.190
 mourning advertisement seen at the home market you 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.630
 you're actually dead how can this be 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.160
 be and then he has to tell somehow 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.720
 that this is a misprint his own 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.890
 mother does not want to come out that way 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.240
 that he wanted to kill himself and can 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.740
 Be correct with the fact 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.540
 that I am here a young one 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.370
 man wanted to take life and he wanted 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.030
 especially not really and especially 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.230
 must determine 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.330
 one from the doctor in the end 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.070
 he finally diagnoses that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.360
 has a tumor in the head and how it is 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.220
 the quasi the second possibility 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.900
 somehow to die and that's why 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.370
 Mike actually quite happy that 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.080
 Everything comes in the end as he does 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.820
 but hopes in the meantime 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.860
 until it is time to die or one 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.300
 to deny operation is also a 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.740
 after all, maybe one after another 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.570
 little joy in life finds one 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.280
 getting to know a woman and at the same time 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.780
 a certain one is within the prix 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.610
 life that one may question 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.050
 is not life somehow 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.239
 worth living and above all are the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.320
 core topics coconut her she already 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.450
 like the story 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.489
 ironic are almost sarcastic 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.020
 cynical about life reports one 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.580
 A film about the sea 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.320
 he reports between human life 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.880
 based on good dialogues on one 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.190
 film which is relatively quiet therefore comes in 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.989
 just just bizarre and his 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.520
 cynicism towards life and the 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.780
 meaning of life is and above all 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.430
 the question who actually has it 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.810
 deserves to live and who does not and who 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.760
 comes in the sky and who comes in the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.620
 hell these are all topics at the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.180
 Hundreds of a minute really strong 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.859
 played in this german canadian 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.900
 coproduction captured because that results 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.550
 then a tragicomedy between the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.290
 Definitely pay for life 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.030
 worth seeing a film is indeed located 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.500
 some people in some moments like that 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.840
 pulls that I would not say that is 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.340
 strong as a bear, but one of them stays his head 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.700
 afterwards one can discuss one of the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.500
 unfortunately he too 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.000
 acts in the niche and not the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.810
 but he will reach big mainstream 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.700
 definitely out of the crowd 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.990
 stick out because he is on effects 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.300
 does not really commit to one 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.710
 Planned plot and want that is nice 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.670
 also that you could almost guess 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.500
 the trailer after the 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.970
 History knows you know where to go 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.620
 the film wants and in the end it comes to 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.060
 luck also not as you suspect 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.250
 that's why there are quite a lot 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.020
 charming sweet spots on this movie the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.000
 make them absolutely worth seeing for me 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.400
 and thus get cooperative from me 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.870
 as tragicomedy 7 within 10 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.340
 possible points and overall 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.290
 seven out of ten possible points and 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.700
 which is fixed by trailer should be 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.380
 definitely watch in the cinemas 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.120
 The rental was relatively small behind it 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.560
 he will not be small in many cinemas 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.480
 It's worthwhile running later, too 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.440
 works on blu ray and dvd 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.210
 probably also really good at 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.370
 domestic cinema and that 's what I'm through 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.870
 I like to watch my rule here 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.450
 a thumb there if you liked them 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.680
 we do not leave otherwise you know that 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.870
 there are still a few left around me 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.550
 and tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, later 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.290
 are his new video and until then 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:35.300
 I hope you will be back tomorrow 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:38.070
 of course a frame of good 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.960
 david the line spacing too no no 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.960
 Cross is in the moment 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.700
 we say goodbye to our son and 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.930
 classmate a flower that never would have 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.460
 may be planted 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.060
 back to earth that's just five 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.360
 row 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.340
 that does not cost anything seven as well 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.760
 a lot of 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:13.270
 ok then rest in peace 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:18.990
 blumer 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.990
 At the very end of the morning would be great
