00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.590
 sugar 8 sheets of gelatin 200 g of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.800
 lemon juice infuse sugar theme 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.570
 ice cream mixed with corn starch and 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.200
 after a special game like 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.890
 a sugar thermometer on a drummer 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.390
 fresh water 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.310
 so how to start the recipe so 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.650
 we're going to put the egg whites to 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.680
 to mount completely firm and at the same 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.170
 time put the cooking sugar in the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.420
 lemon juice in which we made a 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.630
 rifle of the theme 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.900
 we pass lemon juice for not only 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.259
 good old men one hundred inside 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.259
 add sugar 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.440
 taking care not to put too much in 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.910
 on the sides to prevent the callas 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.840
 ministro so 300 g sugar for 200 g 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.420
 of lemon juice 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.340
 we're going to cook it with the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.320
 sugar thermometer up to 115 Greek 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.210
 with a brush and water we pass 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.430
 around 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.840
 to clean and remove small 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.830
 pieces of sugar that are around for 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.800
 avoid caramelization then do 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.540
 attention in cooking the lemon that 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.340
 takes volume quickly while 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.990
 the jokes of France in a comfort the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.160
 gelatin in cold water ice water 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.920
 you have to watch the cooking of 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.690
 sugar because with lemon juice and 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.130
 sugar takes a lot of volume against 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.290
 a lack if there was water where that 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.090
 would stay at the bottom we can prepare the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.130
 plate to rid the marshmallow 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.590
 when she is ready so a mixture of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.580
 icing sugar and cornflour 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.100
 good now I 'm in class the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.380
 cornstarch because the icing sugar all 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.850
 alone would take more humility and the 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.850
 cornstarch absorbs moisture 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.400
 we'll go back to white, we'll go well 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.739
 gelatin for the bike incorporates 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.340
 lemon juice and cooked sugar 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.120
 Argentina make it instantly 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.120
 nearly 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.550
 there is a body carrying sugar 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.310
 likecool well it mixes well with the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.540
 egg white meringue and then on 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.220
 let it spin so that the mixture will be 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.950
 this good is a touching bowl like that 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.960
 finally temperature we feel good 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.230
 blender temperature is in the process of 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.290
 regain volume and now he 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.290
 just get rid of it with a maryse 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.820
 and leave a day and a night 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:05.030
 the preparation to dry for then 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:06.640
 cut off so 48 hours later the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.540
 marshmallow to dry 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.980
 and cut it with a knife 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.189
 she simply became 4 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.189
 August 2 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.560
