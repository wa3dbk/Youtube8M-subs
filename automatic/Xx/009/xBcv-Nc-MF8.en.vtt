space<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.400> Macintosh<00:00:07.400> you<00:00:08.400> know<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
space on a Macintosh you know it's a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.730 
space on a Macintosh you know it's a
simple<00:00:09.269> process<00:00:09.420> but<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:09.960> very<00:00:10.080> useful

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
simple process but it's very useful

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.160 
simple process but it's very useful
because<00:00:10.769> ly<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.460> instead<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.840> know<00:00:12.870> going

through the files manually go and delete
delete<00:00:14.969> delete<00:00:15.000> takes<00:00:15.630> forever<00:00:15.980> this<00:00:16.980> will

drive a USB Drive you know one of those

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.690 
drive a USB Drive you know one of those
thumb<00:03:15.730> drives<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.150> plug<00:03:16.329> into<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.510> USB<00:03:17.700> okay

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
thumb drives you plug into the USB okay

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.800 
thumb drives you plug into the USB okay
so<00:03:18.760> we're<00:03:19.150> gonna<00:03:19.239> do<00:03:19.329> is<00:03:19.390> going<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.570> click<00:03:19.690> on

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
so we're gonna do is going to click on

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.979 
so we're gonna do is going to click on
hard<00:03:20.019> drive<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.120> what<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:22.239> do<00:03:22.450> what's<00:03:22.810> going

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
hard drive and what it's do what's going

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.300 
hard drive and what it's do what's going
to<00:03:23.049> do<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.380> it's<00:03:23.410> going<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.739> scan<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.160> hard

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
to do is it's going to scan the hard

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.470 
to do is it's going to scan the hard
drive<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.850> pretty<00:03:25.000> large<00:03:25.150> hard<00:03:25.420> drive

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
drive it's a pretty large hard drive

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.600 
drive it's a pretty large hard drive
hundred<00:03:25.900> eleven<00:03:26.019> gigabytes<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.459> it's

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
hundred eleven gigabytes and so it's

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.220 
hundred eleven gigabytes and so it's
going<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.760> scan<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.329> it's<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.930> find

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
going to scan it and it's going to find

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.900 
going to scan it and it's going to find
out<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:30.160> know<00:03:30.190> well<00:03:30.400> it's<00:03:30.489> pretty<00:03:30.640> much<00:03:30.760> gonna

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
out you know well it's pretty much gonna

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.850 
out you know well it's pretty much gonna
scan<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.239> whole<00:03:31.329> thing<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.810> then<00:03:31.900> determine

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
scan the whole thing and then determine

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.650 
scan the whole thing and then determine
the<00:03:32.950> file<00:03:33.130> size<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.549> each<00:03:33.670> file<00:03:33.940> each<00:03:34.239> folder

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
the file size of each file each folder

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.880 
the file size of each file each folder
and<00:03:34.840> then<00:03:34.900> it's<00:03:35.049> gonna<00:03:35.170> list<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.470> accordingly

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
and then it's gonna list it accordingly

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.240 
and then it's gonna list it accordingly
from<00:03:36.670> largest<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.120> smallest<00:03:37.209> top<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.870> bottom

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
from largest to smallest top to bottom

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.140 
from largest to smallest top to bottom
okay

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
okay

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.339 
okay
and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:40.569> there's<00:03:40.750> two<00:03:40.870> ways<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.049> viewer

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
and then there's two ways to viewer

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.690 
and then there's two ways to viewer
there's<00:03:41.620> columns<00:03:42.040> where<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.310> can<00:03:42.430> view<00:03:42.549> it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
there's columns where you can view it

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.550 
there's columns where you can view it
down<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.540> way<00:03:43.689> but<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.930> like<00:03:44.079> columns<00:03:44.409> because

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
down that way but I like columns because

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.199 
down that way but I like columns because
that<00:03:44.769> way<00:03:44.920> it's<00:03:45.099> easy<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.459> click<00:03:45.640> on<00:03:45.760> one<00:03:46.000> then

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
that way it's easy to click on one then

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.270 
that way it's easy to click on one then
you<00:03:46.239> see<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.510> contents<00:03:46.930> click<00:03:47.049> on<00:03:47.260> go<00:03:47.950> deeper

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
you see the contents click on go deeper

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.440 
you see the contents click on go deeper
into<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.459> treating<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:48.909> you<00:03:49.030> actually<00:03:49.150> find

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
into the treating so you actually find

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.240 
into the treating so you actually find
the<00:03:49.629> actual<00:03:49.750> file<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:51.010> can<00:03:51.129> actually

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
the actual file and you can actually

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.009 
the actual file and you can actually
delete<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.670> from<00:03:51.700> here<00:03:51.939> or<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.329> can<00:03:52.480> go<00:03:52.659> into

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
delete it from here or you can go into

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.479 
delete it from here or you can go into
the<00:03:53.140> finder<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.650> delete<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:53.950> down<00:03:54.099> here<00:03:54.689> so

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
the finder and delete it down here so

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.580 
the finder and delete it down here so
and<00:03:57.489> when<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.510> delete<00:03:58.780> stuff<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.290> can<00:03:59.439> click

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
and when you delete stuff you can click

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.319 
and when you delete stuff you can click
on<00:03:59.650> Romero<00:04:00.010> up<00:04:00.250> here<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:00.790> then<00:04:00.939> it'll<00:04:01.120> just

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
on Romero up here and then it'll just

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.420 
on Romero up here and then it'll just
romesha<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.530> will<00:04:02.590> tell<00:04:03.129> you<00:04:03.220> how<00:04:03.250> much

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
romesha it and it will tell you how much

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.160 
romesha it and it will tell you how much
is<00:04:03.579> left<00:04:03.609> right<00:04:04.390> now<00:04:04.540> down<00:04:04.780> here<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:05.140> says

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
is left right now down here it says

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.770 
is left right now down here it says
hundred<00:04:05.650> eleven<00:04:05.739> gigabytes<00:04:06.450> 107<00:04:07.450> gigabytes

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
hundred eleven gigabytes 107 gigabytes

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.289 
hundred eleven gigabytes 107 gigabytes
use<00:04:08.019> available<00:04:08.560> 3.54<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:09.819> it's<00:04:10.030> actually

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
use available 3.54 so it's actually

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.190 
use available 3.54 so it's actually
going<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.510> doing<00:04:10.659> this<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.019> should

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
going to doing this because I should

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.589 
going to doing this because I should
delete<00:04:11.409> some<00:04:11.560> stuff<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:12.370> best<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.670> have<00:04:12.730> well

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
delete some stuff it's best to have well

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.910 
delete some stuff it's best to have well
optimally<00:04:14.170> they<00:04:14.290> say<00:04:14.440> twenty-five<00:04:14.799> percent

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
optimally they say twenty-five percent

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.469 
optimally they say twenty-five percent
but<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.579> know<00:04:15.700> when<00:04:15.849> this<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.090> such<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> large

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
but you know when this is such a large

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.420 
but you know when this is such a large
hard<00:04:16.690> drive<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.289> little<00:04:17.650> overkill<00:04:18.010> but<00:04:18.250> I

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
hard drive it's a little overkill but I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.430 
hard drive it's a little overkill but I
would<00:04:18.910> say<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.120> know<00:04:19.269> maybe<00:04:19.570> 10<00:04:19.810> gigabytes<00:04:20.260> or

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
would say you know maybe 10 gigabytes or

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.730 
would say you know maybe 10 gigabytes or
something<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.829> that<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:22.169> but<00:04:23.169> it's<00:04:23.289> it<00:04:23.470> still

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
something like that so but it's it still

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.170 
something like that so but it's it still
runs<00:04:23.919> fine<00:04:24.100> with<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:24.370> but<00:04:24.639> it's<00:04:24.760> just<00:04:24.970> best

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
runs fine with this but it's just best

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.180 
runs fine with this but it's just best
to<00:04:25.330> have<00:04:25.720> some<00:04:25.930> space<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.350> it's<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.860> computer

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
to have some space so it's the computer

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.300 
to have some space so it's the computer
can<00:04:27.310> breathe<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.720> we<00:04:29.110> are<00:04:29.169> going<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.710> pause

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
can breathe so we are going to pause

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.860 
can breathe so we are going to pause
this<00:04:30.550> video<00:04:30.729> because<00:04:31.060> it'll<00:04:31.330> take<00:04:31.449> a<00:04:31.479> while<00:04:31.630> to

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
this video because it'll take a while to

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.500 
this video because it'll take a while to
scan<00:04:32.380> 100<00:04:32.710> Levin<00:04:32.889> gigabytes<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:34.270> will<00:04:34.419> be

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
scan 100 Levin gigabytes and I will be

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.170 
scan 100 Levin gigabytes and I will be
back<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.900> show<00:04:35.169> you<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:36.699> rest<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.030> process

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
back to show you the rest of the process

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.360 
back to show you the rest of the process
is<00:04:37.599> pretty<00:04:37.720> quick<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.320> i'll<00:04:38.770> be<00:04:38.919> back

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.540 

ok<00:04:42.210> I'm<00:04:42.510> back<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:44.100> is<00:04:44.250> what<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.370> came<00:04:44.490> up

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
ok I'm back and this is what I came up
