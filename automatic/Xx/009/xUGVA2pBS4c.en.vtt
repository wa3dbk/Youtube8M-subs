00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
so this can work really well in certain

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.599 
so this can work really well in certain
scenarios<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:16.080> certain<00:00:16.379> teams<00:00:16.590> kind<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.550> the

good passing good passers then this

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.910 
good passing good passers then this
drill<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.559> cool<00:00:58.710> really

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
drill can be really cool really

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.069 
drill can be really cool really
effective<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.059> let's<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.809> ahead<00:01:00.930> we'll

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
effective for it so let's go ahead we'll

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.660 
effective for it so let's go ahead we'll
pull<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> rink<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.920> Todd<00:01:02.160> here's<00:01:02.579> how

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
pull up the rink in here Todd here's how

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.830 
pull up the rink in here Todd here's how
it<00:01:02.760> goes

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it goes

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
it goes
on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.890> whistle<00:01:05.040> first<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.670> guys<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.060> each

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
on the whistle first you guys from each

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.370 
on the whistle first you guys from each
line<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> leave<00:01:06.840> without<00:01:06.960> pucks

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
line are going to leave without pucks

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
line are going to leave without pucks
and<00:01:07.680> they're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.820> angle<00:01:09.150> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and they're going to take an angle that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.969 
and they're going to take an angle that
looks<00:01:09.450> something<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.900> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
looks something like this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
looks something like this
now<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.700> important<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.330> stay

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
now it's really important that they stay

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.060 
now it's really important that they stay
low<00:01:12.900> enough<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.500> there's<00:01:13.680> enough<00:01:13.890> time

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
low enough so that there's enough time

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640 
low enough so that there's enough time
to<00:01:14.250> give<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> receive<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.150> passes<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.960> still

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to give and receive the passes and still

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.260 
to give and receive the passes and still
have<00:01:16.770> time<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.340> make<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> whole<00:01:18.030> drill

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
have time to make the whole drill

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
have time to make the whole drill
function<00:01:18.689> same<00:01:19.320> things<00:01:19.530> coming<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:19.920> over

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
function same things coming out over

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.660 
function same things coming out over
here<00:01:20.460> taking<00:01:20.850> nice<00:01:21.150> low<00:01:21.659> angle<00:01:22.170> again<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
here taking nice low angle again you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
here taking nice low angle again you
know<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.420> cheat<00:01:24.720> bad<00:01:24.900> angle<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.380> else

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
know don't don't cheat bad angle or else

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.640 
know don't don't cheat bad angle or else
you<00:01:25.590> start<00:01:25.710> running<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> space<00:01:27.650> then

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you start running out of space then

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
you start running out of space then
you're<00:01:28.740> gonna<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> long<00:01:29.750> length<00:01:30.750> long
