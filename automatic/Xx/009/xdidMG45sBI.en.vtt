00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.839 
strafing this is going to be a
step-by-step<00:00:06.629> tutorial<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.649> as<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.700> see

in<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.030> bottom<00:00:09.179> right<00:00:09.450> hand<00:00:09.630> corner<00:00:09.780> you're

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
in the bottom right hand corner you're

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.290 
in the bottom right hand corner you're
gonna<00:00:10.679> be<00:00:10.800> able<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.040> see<00:00:11.160> firsthand<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:12.030> it

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
gonna be able to see firsthand what it

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.330 
gonna be able to see firsthand what it
looks<00:00:12.480> like<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.900> controller<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.740> strafe<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
looks like on a controller to strafe and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.379 
looks like on a controller to strafe and
wall<00:00:14.849> bones

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
wall bones

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.620 
wall bones
first<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.470> all<00:00:16.560> strafing<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.760> its<00:00:18.029> core<00:00:18.359> is

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
first of all strafing at its core is

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.509 
first of all strafing at its core is
just<00:00:19.619> moving<00:00:20.609> left<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:22.519> but

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
just moving left and right like this but

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.580 
just moving left and right like this but
in<00:00:23.760> Gears<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.150> War<00:00:24.240> 3<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:25.080> really<00:00:25.109> need<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
in Gears of War 3 you really need to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.259 
in Gears of War 3 you really need to
incorporate<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.640> thumbstick

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
incorporate that right thumbstick

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.580 
incorporate that right thumbstick
that<00:00:27.480> right<00:00:27.660> thumbstick<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.260> what's<00:00:28.439> gonna

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that right thumbstick is what's gonna

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.620 
that right thumbstick is what's gonna
make<00:00:28.800> them<00:00:29.010> miss<00:00:29.250> their<00:00:29.490> shots<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.480> when

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
make them miss their shots so when

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
make them miss their shots so when
you're<00:00:30.750> strafing<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you're strafing you don't just want to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.950 
you're strafing you don't just want to
use<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.910> left<00:00:33.149> thumbstick<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.750> left

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
use that left thumbstick that left

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.209 
use that left thumbstick that left
thumbstick<00:00:34.200> doesn't<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:34.860> matter<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
thumbstick doesn't really matter that

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
thumbstick doesn't really matter that
right<00:00:35.640> thump<00:00:35.910> stick<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.540> matters<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
right thump stick is what matters the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
right thump stick is what matters the
most<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:38.190> what's<00:00:38.430> really<00:00:38.489> gonna

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
most because that's what's really gonna

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:49.250 
most because that's what's really gonna
throw<00:00:38.879> them<00:00:39.180> off<00:00:39.329> here's<00:00:40.079> an<00:00:40.230> in-game<00:00:40.440> example

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.830 

what<00:00:50.260> wall<00:00:50.469> bouncing<00:00:50.920> is<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.629> bouncing<00:00:52.629> from

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
what wall bouncing is is bouncing from

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.889 
what wall bouncing is is bouncing from
wall<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.140> wall<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.620> wall<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:55.360> you're<00:00:55.750> new

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
wall to wall to wall and if you're new

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.170 
wall to wall to wall and if you're new
to<00:00:55.930> wall<00:00:56.230> bouncing<00:00:56.739> I<00:00:56.949> highly<00:00:57.640> recommend<00:00:58.090> that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
to wall bouncing I highly recommend that

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.600 
to wall bouncing I highly recommend that
you<00:00:58.360> use<00:00:58.390> alternate<00:00:59.110> controls<00:00:59.470> because<00:01:00.250> what

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
you use alternate controls because what

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.880 
you use alternate controls because what
alternate<00:01:01.059> controls<00:01:01.480> do<00:01:01.719> is<00:01:01.960> they<00:01:02.440> make<00:01:02.590> it<00:01:02.710> so

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
alternate controls do is they make it so

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.770 
alternate controls do is they make it so
it's<00:01:03.040> just<00:01:03.160> one<00:01:03.519> button<00:01:03.910> for<00:01:03.940> wall<00:01:04.299> balancing

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
it's just one button for wall balancing

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.090 
it's just one button for wall balancing
and<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.049> can<00:01:05.199> just<00:01:05.379> keep<00:01:05.500> pressing<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.979> that

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
and you can just keep pressing in that

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.980 
and you can just keep pressing in that
button<00:01:06.430> repeatedly<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:07.150> jump<00:01:07.600> from<00:01:07.780> wall<00:01:07.960> to

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
button repeatedly and jump from wall to

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.830 
button repeatedly and jump from wall to
wall<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.759> kill<00:01:09.759> someone<00:01:10.060> while<00:01:10.420> you<00:01:10.630> all

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
wall to kill someone while you all

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.870 
wall to kill someone while you all
bounce<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.740> need<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.009> wall<00:01:12.190> bounce<00:01:12.430> quickly

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
bounce you need the wall bounce quickly

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.420 
bounce you need the wall bounce quickly
into<00:01:13.420> wall<00:01:13.600> bounce<00:01:13.840> quickly<00:01:14.290> you're<00:01:15.040> actually

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
into wall bounce quickly you're actually

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.490 
into wall bounce quickly you're actually
gonna<00:01:15.580> jump<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:16.720> wall<00:01:17.020> that's<00:01:17.229> either

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
gonna jump to a wall that's either

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
gonna jump to a wall that's either
behind<00:01:17.830> or<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.630> side<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.050> your<00:01:20.170> enemy<00:01:20.560> and

behind or to the side of your enemy and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350 
behind or to the side of your enemy and
you're<00:01:22.060> going<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.740> pull<00:01:23.740> away<00:01:23.920> off<00:01:24.550> that<00:01:25.119> wall

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
you're going to pull away off that wall

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.249 
you're going to pull away off that wall
at<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.750> last<00:01:25.960> second<00:01:26.520> look<00:01:27.520> at<00:01:27.850> my<00:01:28.360> thumb

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
at the last second look at my thumb

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.650 
at the last second look at my thumb
sticks<00:01:29.590> move<00:01:29.830> just<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:30.820> I'm<00:01:30.970> going<00:01:31.300> to<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
sticks move just as I'm going to the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.810 
sticks move just as I'm going to the
wall<00:01:31.840> I<00:01:32.110> swing<00:01:32.740> them<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.160> other<00:01:33.369> direction

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
wall I swing them the other direction

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.669 
wall I swing them the other direction
when<00:01:34.539> you<00:01:34.660> swing<00:01:34.869> them<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> other<00:01:35.320> direction

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
when you swing them the other direction

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:36.960 
when you swing them the other direction
that'll<00:01:36.100> prevent<00:01:36.369> your<00:01:36.520> character<00:01:36.850> from

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
that'll prevent your character from

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.609 
that'll prevent your character from
actually<00:01:37.330> planting<00:01:37.750> on<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.050> wall<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:38.530> you

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
actually planting on that wall and you

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.399 
actually planting on that wall and you
can<00:01:39.280> move<00:01:39.429> a<00:01:39.670> lot<00:01:39.880> quicker<00:01:39.910> here's<00:01:40.869> an<00:01:41.050> in-game

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
can move a lot quicker here's an in-game

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.280 
can move a lot quicker here's an in-game
example<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.100> wall<00:01:42.310> bounce
