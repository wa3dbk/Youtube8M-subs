 completely redesigned guarantees 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.310
 maximum modularity and an ace flop of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 all respect with the masters has succeeded 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.340
 in the not easy enterprise to bring to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.840
 a higher level 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.619
 one of the most successful products 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.570
 in its range the 690 cm version 3

 expandability 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.340
 the design is clearly inspired by his

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:59.330
 compared to 690 cm the dimensions of 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.250
 230 for 507 502 mm are slightly 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.260
 increased in width by height 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.390
 while the depth has decreased by 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.790
 about 2 centimeters in the front part 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 reigns the metal grid activity in 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.570
 glossy black covering wailing the head

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.580
 the contours of the cme 693 a small one 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.860
 detail that gives linked to 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.800
 product in the upper part we find 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.380
 a polycarbonate panel that 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.180
 interrupts land interaction by doing it 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.050
 scroll trilem and power buttons

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.160
 lateral that allows access to the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.560
 hardware stands out a grid on which it is 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.399
 It is possible to install two 120 fans 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.050
 mm or a single 210 fan with the 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.060
 master also proposes a version of the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.830
 keys with transparent side panel 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.649
 on which however it is not possible to install 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.630
 fans in the bottom because they are overpowered for the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.060
 almost all there is a filter 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.590
 removable dust cover for protection 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.399
 of the power supply and a possible one 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.290
 120 mm fan installed inside 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.530
 on the back we find a grid on 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.690
 where the 120 mm fan is installed 7 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.970
 Slot who is the counting your 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.350
 vertically and for favors for the

 pass the tubes over 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.150
 to the housing singing supplies 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.740
 starting to disassemble the kage 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.080
 starting from the side panels 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.210
 we note how the right bulkhead was 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.000
 worked to improve the arrangement 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.010
 of cables suffered the motherboard 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.590
 thus obtaining another 10 mm of space 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.120
 You can also install a hard drive 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.730
 2.5-inch disk 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.870
 immediately behind the motherboard and ne 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.870
 they also have the second side panel 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.790
 we have full access to the kit by pressing them 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.980
 6 plastic tongue we go to 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.170
 remove the front part behind the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.660
 which one listens to a 200 mm score 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.840
 Supplied supplied protected by a 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.190
 removable dust filter 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.390
 the first impact with the structure 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.520
 internal of the taser 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.470
 And it's weird order motor board tray 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.260
 finally presents possibilities for the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.610
 cable wiring and in the center we see the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.950
 four holes that through the appropriate ones 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.880
 supports let me install myself 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.570
 of an ssd on the back of the same in the 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.190
 lower area 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.660
 the housing for the power supply is 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.209
 equipped with four supports 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.459
 anti-vibration to decouple the ps 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.070
 from the structure and minimize the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.080
 vibration at the bottom of the structure is 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.390
 possible to install a 120 fan 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.880
 mm or another 2.5 hard drive 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.739
 inch baskets for hard drives 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.290
 are pre configured to accommodate up to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.090
 inches in the upper support area e 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.610
 quick release already seen on the tricks of 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.360
 allow indistinctly 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.930
 the installation of both types 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.329
 of years the upper panel of the case is 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.060
 a sheepfold by a screw placed on the 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.880
 retro thus exposing supports for two 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.150
 120mm fans with 140,000 injured 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.040
 or a single 200 mm fan is

 from 120 mm but customizations 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.190
 Possible are multiple and in the panel 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.850
 top there is space to reinstall 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.900
