temporarily<00:00:31.610> so<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> eight

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
temporarily so you have the eight

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880 
temporarily so you have the eight
footers<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.140> level<00:00:34.559> twelve

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
footers going on on this level twelve

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.310

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
footers going down to the ground it's

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
footers going down to the ground it's
just<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:38.090> coincidence<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.149> those<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
just a coincidence that those are the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.220 
just a coincidence that those are the
two<00:00:39.719> slices<00:00:39.960> whatever<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.530> had<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:42.230> otherwise

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
two slices whatever we had but otherwise

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
fizzle for in good shape so now we're

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
fizzle for in good shape so now we're
gonna<00:00:53.699> batten<00:00:54.210> down<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> hatches<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.780> little

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
gonna batten down the hatches a little

gonna batten down the hatches a little
bit<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.250> ready<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.489> winter<00:00:57.410> at<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> end

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
show this is just building a little

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.180 
show this is just building a little
contraption<00:01:34.050> at<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.230> bottom<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.860> I'm

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
contraption at the bottom here just I'm

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.980 
contraption at the bottom here just I'm
taking<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> our<00:01:35.880> two<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.270> twelves<00:01:36.660> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
taking some of our two by twelves that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.030 
taking some of our two by twelves that
feature<00:01:37.920> beams<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:39.560> gonna<00:01:40.560> nail<00:01:40.770> them<00:01:40.890> onto

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
feature beams I'm gonna nail them onto

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.440 
feature beams I'm gonna nail them onto
the<00:01:41.250> columns<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.940> just<00:01:42.090> splice<00:01:42.330> them

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the columns and just splice them

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
the columns and just splice them
together<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:42.960> middle<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.740> thrown<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
together in the middle just thrown a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
together in the middle just thrown a
couple<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.430> nails<00:01:44.550> then<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.630> be

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
couple of nails then and this will be

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
couple of nails then and this will be
what<00:01:45.900> we<00:01:46.020> tack<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.820> metal<00:01:48.060> panels<00:01:48.390> onto

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
what we tack the the metal panels onto

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.980 
what we tack the the metal panels onto
so<00:01:48.840> hang<00:01:49.020> them<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.620> floor<00:01:49.860> above

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
so hang them on to the floor above

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.560 
so hang them on to the floor above
they'll<00:01:51.990> hang<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.350> down<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:53.330> Cimber<00:01:56.570> so

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
they'll hang out down here Cimber so

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
they'll hang out down here Cimber so
that's<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.840> idea<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:59.010> gonna<00:01:59.160> basically

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that's the idea and I'm gonna basically

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.990 
that's the idea and I'm gonna basically
want<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> keep<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> up<00:02:00.750> off<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.110> ground<00:02:02.000> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
want to keep that up off the ground to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.710 
want to keep that up off the ground to
avoid<00:02:03.290> cross<00:02:04.290> even<00:02:04.590> pushing<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.630> right<00:02:06.630> now

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
avoid cross even pushing it up right now

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.870 
avoid cross even pushing it up right now
I<00:02:06.750> measure<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.800> exactly<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.399> how<00:02:08.670> high

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
I measure I don't exactly know how high

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.360 
I measure I don't exactly know how high
off<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> ground<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.690> need<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.649> avoid

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
off the ground I need to be to avoid

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.420 
off the ground I need to be to avoid
that<00:02:11.730> being<00:02:11.940> an<00:02:12.060> issue<00:02:12.770> but<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.280> least

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
that being an issue but we just at least

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.220 
that being an issue but we just at least
keep<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.910> all<00:02:15.030> fingers<00:02:15.209> in<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.690> bit<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
keep it all fingers in a little bit and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.930 
keep it all fingers in a little bit and
and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.160> we'll<00:02:17.310> nail<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.360> panels<00:02:18.660> onto<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
and then we'll nail the panels onto that

there's<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.889> front<00:05:02.070> of<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.310> barn<00:05:02.490> completely

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
there's the front of the barn completely

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.379 
there's the front of the barn completely
walled<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:03.479> so<00:05:03.840> we<00:05:03.990> did<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:05.820> upper<00:05:06.090> storey

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
walled in so we did the the upper storey

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.190 
walled in so we did the the upper storey
just<00:05:06.990> with<00:05:07.139> four<00:05:07.410> panels<00:05:07.830> actually<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:09.200> of

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
just with four panels actually and of

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.710 
just with four panels actually and of
course<00:05:10.440> we<00:05:10.560> still<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:11.240> little<00:05:12.240> bits<00:05:12.510> on<00:05:12.690> the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
course we still have little bits on the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.589 
course we still have little bits on the
side<00:05:13.130> because<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.880> angle<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.389> the

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
side because of the the angle of the

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:16.969 
side because of the the angle of the
roof<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.960> think<00:05:16.139> we'll<00:05:16.289> just<00:05:16.500> throw<00:05:16.710> some

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
roof I think we'll just throw some

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.450 
roof I think we'll just throw some
plywood<00:05:17.910> over<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.950> little<00:05:20.070> peak<00:05:20.310> at

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
plywood over that and the little peak at

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.940 
plywood over that and the little peak at
the<00:05:20.550> top<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:21.000> might<00:05:21.180> just<00:05:21.389> stay<00:05:21.539> open<00:05:21.950> Blake

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
the top that might just stay open Blake

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.089 
the top that might just stay open Blake
also<00:05:23.160> might<00:05:23.550> be<00:05:23.580> able<00:05:23.849> to<00:05:24.530> put<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.620> siding<00:05:26.010> on

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
also might be able to put the siding on

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.070 
also might be able to put the siding on
but<00:05:26.340> looks<00:05:26.520> like<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.940> pieces<00:05:27.479> we<00:05:27.780> have<00:05:27.930> are

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
but looks like the pieces we have are

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.390 
but looks like the pieces we have are
riding<00:05:28.590> high<00:05:28.740> enough<00:05:28.979> that<00:05:29.220> they'll

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
riding high enough that they'll

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.370 
riding high enough that they'll
interfere<00:05:30.120> with<00:05:30.300> installing<00:05:30.780> siding<00:05:31.110> there

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
interfere with installing siding there

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.140 
interfere with installing siding there
but<00:05:32.370> in<00:05:32.460> any<00:05:32.550> case<00:05:32.639> yeah<00:05:32.940> we're<00:05:33.150> pretty<00:05:33.750> much

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
but in any case yeah we're pretty much

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.680 
but in any case yeah we're pretty much
closing<00:05:36.150> up<00:05:36.300> packing<00:05:36.780> up<00:05:36.930> all<00:05:37.410> our<00:05:38.039> stuff

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
closing up packing up all our stuff

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.210 
closing up packing up all our stuff
almost<00:05:39.690> everything's<00:05:40.139> locked<00:05:40.380> away<00:05:40.620> stored

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
almost everything's locked away stored

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.879 
almost everything's locked away stored
up<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.789> yeah<00:05:42.479> so<00:05:42.750> it's<00:05:42.840> getting<00:05:43.530> set<00:05:43.740> for

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
up and yeah so it's getting set for

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.010 
up and yeah so it's getting set for
winter
