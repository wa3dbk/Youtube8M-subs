 hectares of vineyard plantations 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.600
 expected 23 thousand but are more than half 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.920
 that's more than half the term of 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.050

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.920

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.290
 I 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.020
 strain does not suffer the damages of the machine 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.810
 He says 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.610
 to the trailer to download 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 while they continue to fill the cubes 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.060
 it is unloaded on the trailer and the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 time to rest by hand the girl 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.640
 that the night cools 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.130
 all do not come here to the call of the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.689
 porridge if we go there we eat a little 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.119
 here all the gang that has been 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.819
 working hard in the vintage now 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.520
 it's time to eat lunch 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.170
 in the air the aroma is already spreading 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.170
 of a very manchega meal 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.930
 Thomas as porridge vanessa this is already a 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.880
 point to set it aside to start 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.030
 have breakfast and as you know they are 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.730
 point because when the porridge 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.530
 they start fucking that is called it is 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.070
 because they are already done they are already cooked 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.110
 and the flour is already fried and has already cooked 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.120
 he has already released the fat good guys 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.120
 Well, the lists are spent here 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.260
 and the same oscillation is repeated 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.390
 this here looks like the yenka dance 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.310
 this has to be done a little to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.260
 forward and another back we signed up 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.739

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.739
 lunch 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.500
 here the lunch hour is sacred 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.440
 but usually they are not lean with 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.069
 tomato potato with egg and among many 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.280
 things 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.800

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.530
 try them are very good and I say so 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.910
 and behind the porridge that best dessert 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.000
 that a melon of the stain 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.129
 the ideal menu to recover energy to 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.239
 bera bera bera wait but where are you going 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.239

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.040

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.040
 enjoy this environment and have it 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.930
 harvested and when they come at noon 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.820

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.740
 a dip and they already eat fresh and they 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.110
