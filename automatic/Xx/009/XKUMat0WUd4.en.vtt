00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 for me 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.570
 to 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.260
 Y 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.260
 today we are going to prepare rice with 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.150
 mushrooms and ham the ingredients are 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:27.070
 tarragon chicken broth black pepper 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:30.259
 salt onion pepper garlic ham 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.880
 mushrooms white wine and rice 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.070
 we have made a mixture of rice 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.070
 steamed to reds and wild rice 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.899
 Well the first thing we have done has been 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.870
 crush the two teeth of water and 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.110
 put them in the egg now let's take 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.380
 the onion 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.940
 and the pepper and we 're going to leave it to fire 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.100
 low until you go taking advantage 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.100
 approximately 10-15 minutes 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.519
 otherwise we are going to take what is the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.520
 chicken broth and we're going to put it to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.840
 playful and will be where we will put 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.070
 approximately one liter depending on the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.070
 rice that you go too 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.350
 Well, as the broth is already 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.350
 boiling let's take the rice 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.850
 to move it 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.930
 and let's see how our rehash of 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.930
 onion and pepper 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.040
 it's almost done but now there's a 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.500
 bit 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.030
 Now we're going to get a little salt no 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.370
 we are going to throw a lot because as then 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.960
 I'll take the ham you know what we do 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.720
 always goes a little salty to not 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.610
 spend with the salt we move a little 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.610
 and we continue to leave it on fire 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.130
 It is half as good as the little 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.009
 let's go through the pelvis to not 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.579
 find the successes of onion or 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.579
 pepper 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.760
 and we're going to take the wine 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.120
 let's let it go integrating 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.120
 all 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.300
 and let's cover it and let the wine 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.300
 evaporate 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.660
 Well, as you can see, the wine has already 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.050
 evaporated now let's take the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.050
 ham 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.200
 and we are going to move it well so that 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.200
 the lucky ham all the juice 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.100
 As you can see, the ham is already whitish 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.160
 Well now we are going to proceed to take 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.270
 mushrooms and we will move it 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.270
 everything so that it is integrated 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.700
 once the rice is done, let's go 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.890
 to be incorporated little by little 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.940
 and we are going to move everything so that 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.940
 it is integrated well 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.910
 now let's proceed to cast what is 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:08.980
 the black pepper and in the little friend of 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.980
 chau depending on how much less 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.819
 and a little tarragon 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.150
 with the egg turned off let's let 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.490
 all that big brave who goes 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.530
 taking the rice the flavor of the ham 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.350
 and the mushroom but we'll have 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.090
 approximately 5 or 10 minutes and 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.090
 then we are ready to eat
