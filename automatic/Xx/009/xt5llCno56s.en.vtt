another<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:30.470> here's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:32.630> folder<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.659> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
another one here's a folder to it so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.350 
another one here's a folder to it so
gives<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:38.479> better<00:01:39.479> idea<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.049> folder<00:01:40.409> does

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
gives you a better idea the folder does

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
weighs a few pounds but the stone here

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:57.890 
weighs a few pounds but the stone here
I'll<00:01:49.829> bring<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> model<00:01:50.610> in

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.180 

there's<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> registration<00:02:40.560> down<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:43.190> you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.590 

there<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.140> I'm<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.610> said<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:26.970> model<00:03:27.510> is

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
there you I'm like I said this model is

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.809 
there you I'm like I said this model is
super<00:03:28.260> heavy<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:28.980> I'm<00:03:29.069> gonna<00:03:29.160> set<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.520> camera

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
super heavy so I'm gonna set the camera

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:38.050 
super heavy so I'm gonna set the camera
down<00:03:29.850> again<00:03:30.740> look<00:03:31.740> over<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.220> other<00:03:32.310> side

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.040 

um<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.959> probably<00:03:40.530> weighs<00:03:40.890> close<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:42.570> six

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050

pounds so that also gives you an idea of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.380 
pounds so that also gives you an idea of
how<00:03:47.209> big<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.760> we'll<00:03:50.910> come<00:03:51.060> down<00:03:51.090> this

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
how big this is so we'll come down this

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.280 
how big this is so we'll come down this
side<00:03:51.630> now<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:54.360> got<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.690> landing<00:03:55.080> lights

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
side now you got the landing lights

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:07.839 
side now you got the landing lights
right<00:03:55.560> there

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.250 

and<00:04:08.060> there<00:04:08.840> is<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.109> tail<00:04:09.349> again<00:04:10.060> um<00:04:11.109> I'll<00:04:12.109> show

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
and there is the tail again um I'll show

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.819
