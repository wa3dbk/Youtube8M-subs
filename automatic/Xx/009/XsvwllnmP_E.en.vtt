00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.360
 the culture of the tea is millennial and goes 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 well beyond a sad little bag 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 floating in boiled water today we are going to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.090
 know three options to enjoy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.090
 this drink in the city of mexico 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.040
 eibar opened a couple of years ago in a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.250
 of the nicest corners of the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.830
 countess a few steps from the mexico park and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.700
 if you do not locate yourself, guide you by the aroma 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.700
 spices 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.910
 the chai is made with soy milk and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.010
 sugar muscovado do not use any 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.070
 artificial flavoring do not cheat and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.070
 everything is natural 100% handmade 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.989
 all six are equal 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 I think that if you change the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.040
 preparation to do the chai 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.190

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.820

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.710
 the same one that contains milk that good 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.540
 it's sweet it 's spicy we handle the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.700
 black tea that is like the original recipe 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.240

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.400

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.640
