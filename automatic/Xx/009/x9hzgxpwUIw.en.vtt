using the ability citron mold so think

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.730 
using the ability citron mold so think
of<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> cactus<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> you

of it as if you are a cactus and you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
of it as if you are a cactus and you
have<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> Gerlich<00:01:26.400> drone<00:01:26.640> once<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
have a Gerlich drone once you are in the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.819 
have a Gerlich drone once you are in the
Gerlich<00:01:27.990> drone<00:01:28.170> which<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.650> your

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
Gerlich drone which is one of your

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
Gerlich drone which is one of your
abilities<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.090> another<00:01:30.479> ability

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
abilities you then have another ability

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
abilities you then have another ability
called<00:01:31.470> corn<00:01:31.829> strike<00:01:32.100> which<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.670> use

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
called corn strike which you can use

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
called corn strike which you can use
only<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> Gerlich<00:01:34.770> drone

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
only when you are in the Gerlich drone

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
only when you are in the Gerlich drone
so<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.119> that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
so you have to think of it as that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
so you have to think of it as that
so<00:01:36.900> citron<00:01:37.409> mold<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> curl<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.490> into

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
so citron mold is when you curl up into

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
so citron mold is when you curl up into
your<00:01:39.090> ball<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.110> move<00:01:40.290> around<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
your ball and you can move around the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.399 
your ball and you can move around the
map<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.340> sort<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.790> orange<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> ball<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
map as a sort of orange or a ball and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.469 
map as a sort of orange or a ball and
that<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.310> citron<00:01:44.729> mold<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.329> believe

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that is what citron mold is I believe

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.569 
that is what citron mold is I believe
you<00:01:45.720> move<00:01:45.930> faster<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.950> may<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.369> more

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you move faster and you may have more

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.550 
you move faster and you may have more
protection<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.570> course<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.409> in

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
protection but of course when you are in

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.499 
protection but of course when you are in
Citra<00:01:49.890> mode<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:50.909> ball<00:01:51.180> Church

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
Citra mode you can then use ball Church

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
Citra mode you can then use ball Church
which<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> game<00:01:52.799> play<00:01:53.009> he

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
which you can see in the game play he

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
which you can see in the game play he
speeds<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.970> any<00:01:54.270> knocks<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.899> flying<00:01:55.500> into

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
speeds up any knocks and in flying into

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.830 
speeds up any knocks and in flying into
the<00:01:56.159> earth<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> course<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> as

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the earth so of course I think of it as

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
the earth so of course I think of it as
maybe<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> sprint<00:01:58.740> tackle<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
maybe like a sprint tackle for the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.069 
maybe like a sprint tackle for the
Ulster<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.270> sure<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.689> would<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.810> very

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
Ulster and I'm sure it would be very

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.539 
Ulster and I'm sure it would be very
effective<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.399> multiple

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
effective if you do have multiple

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.730 
effective if you do have multiple
zombies<00:02:03.149> very<00:02:03.540> close<00:02:03.780> together<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> can

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
zombies very close together so you can

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
zombies very close together so you can
take<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.280> at<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.790> same<00:02:06.030> time<00:02:06.450> now

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
take them all out at the same time now

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.510 
take them all out at the same time now
the<00:02:07.079> next<00:02:07.290> ability<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.979> did<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> see

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the next ability that we did get to see

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.059 
the next ability that we did get to see
is<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.030> energy<00:02:09.450> shield<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.830> see

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
is the energy shield and this we do see

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.010 
is the energy shield and this we do see
at<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.550> reveal<00:02:11.910> trailer<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.629> did<00:02:12.810> have

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
at the reveal trailer that we did have

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.610 
at the reveal trailer that we did have
injured

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
injured

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
injured
Morpher<00:02:13.980> -<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.670> he<00:02:14.819> pulls<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.239> shield<00:02:15.569> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
Morpher - and he pulls out a shield and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.630 
Morpher - and he pulls out a shield and
it<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.019> deflect<00:02:16.319> missiles<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.489> probably

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it can deflect missiles it can probably

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880 
it can deflect missiles it can probably
deflect<00:02:18.090> bullets<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.599> well<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.319> I'm<00:02:19.470> not<00:02:19.620> sure

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
deflect bullets as well but I'm not sure

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.130 
deflect bullets as well but I'm not sure
if<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.340> shoot<00:02:20.610> while<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.269> are<00:02:21.510> using<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
if you can shoot while you are using the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.770 
if you can shoot while you are using the
energy<00:02:22.530> shield<00:02:22.769> so<00:02:23.190> make<00:02:23.700> sure<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.360> do<00:02:24.569> see

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
energy shield so make sure if you do see

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.479 
energy shield so make sure if you do see
some<00:02:25.080> massive<00:02:25.379> rocket<00:02:25.739> coming<00:02:25.950> towards<00:02:26.370> you

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
some massive rocket coming towards you

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.640 
some massive rocket coming towards you
you<00:02:26.819> pull<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.299> energy<00:02:27.690> shield<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> maybe

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
you pull it this energy shield and maybe

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.380 
you pull it this energy shield and maybe
with<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.190> energy<00:02:29.519> shield<00:02:29.730> outs<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.180> only

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
with the energy shield outs you only

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.449 
with the energy shield outs you only
take<00:02:30.690> reduce<00:02:31.319> damage<00:02:31.709> or<00:02:31.860> maybe<00:02:32.129> you<00:02:32.310> don't

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
take reduce damage or maybe you don't

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.280 
take reduce damage or maybe you don't
take<00:02:32.760> damage<00:02:32.970> at<00:02:33.269> all<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.720> something<00:02:33.989> we

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
take damage at all that is something we

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.750 
take damage at all that is something we
don't<00:02:34.470> know<00:02:34.709> because<00:02:35.040> when<00:02:35.220> we've<00:02:35.340> seen<00:02:35.610> in

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
don't know because when we've seen in

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.130 
don't know because when we've seen in
being<00:02:35.940> attacked<00:02:36.269> with<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.629> energy<00:02:36.930> shield

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
being attacked with the energy shield

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.259 
being attacked with the energy shield
out<00:02:37.349> we<00:02:37.739> don't<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.220> his<00:02:38.430> health<00:02:38.700> indicator

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
out we don't have his health indicator

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.210 
out we don't have his health indicator
so<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.840> don't<00:02:40.049> know<00:02:40.140> if<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.470> reduced<00:02:40.890> damage

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
so we don't know if it is reduced damage

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.369 
so we don't know if it is reduced damage
or<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.000> hits<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.390> shield<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.959> doesn't<00:02:43.290> do

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
or if it hits the shield it doesn't do

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.020 
or if it hits the shield it doesn't do
any<00:02:43.590> damage<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.159> all<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.909> next

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
any damage at all but that is the next

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.789 
any damage at all but that is the next
ability<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.629> we<00:02:45.750> did<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.140> which<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
ability that we did see which is the

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.949 
ability that we did see which is the
energy<00:02:46.980> shield<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> final<00:02:48.420> ability<00:02:48.810> that

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
energy shield so the final ability that

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.960 
energy shield so the final ability that
we<00:02:49.079> do<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> citron<00:02:50.370> character<00:02:50.819> is

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
we do have for the citron character is

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.119 
we do have for the citron character is
the<00:02:51.299> EMP<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.200> although<00:02:52.379> we<00:02:52.620> don't<00:02:52.829> get<00:02:52.980> any

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
the EMP and although we don't get any

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.550 
the EMP and although we don't get any
gameplay<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.849> this<00:02:54.299> ability<00:02:54.569> in<00:02:54.930> action<00:02:55.379> if

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
gameplay of this ability in action if

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.349 
gameplay of this ability in action if
you<00:02:55.829> take<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> look<00:02:56.220> at<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.489> image<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:56.940> screen

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
you take a look at the image on screen

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.390 
you take a look at the image on screen
right<00:02:57.540> now<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:58.109> see<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.560> iron<00:02:58.950> citron

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
right now you can see the iron citron

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.000 
right now you can see the iron citron
and<00:02:59.609> also<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.390> imp<00:03:00.599> in<00:03:00.930> easy<00:03:01.319> mag<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.890> at

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and also the imp in easy mag and at

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.009 
and also the imp in easy mag and at
first<00:03:02.280> people<00:03:02.579> thought<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> fire

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
first people thought this is a fire

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.839 
first people thought this is a fire
variant<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.709> Tzemach<00:03:05.099> but<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.609> not

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
variant of the Tzemach but this is not

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.580 
variant of the Tzemach but this is not
the<00:03:05.879> case<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:07.079> that<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.349> looks<00:03:07.379> like

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
the case you can see that it looks like

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.619 
the case you can see that it looks like
the<00:03:07.799> Tzemach<00:03:08.159> has<00:03:08.489> been<00:03:08.700> electrocuted<00:03:09.299> or

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
the Tzemach has been electrocuted or

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.509 
the Tzemach has been electrocuted or
electrified<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.310> be<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
electrified and this is going to be the

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.240 
electrified and this is going to be the
EMP<00:03:11.849> ability<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:12.780> action<00:03:13.530> now<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.920> looks<00:03:14.069> like

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
EMP ability in action now it looks like

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.190 
EMP ability in action now it looks like
he's<00:03:14.400> falling<00:03:14.700> back<00:03:15.030> because<00:03:15.450> he<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:15.959> one

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
he's falling back because he is on one

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.050 
he's falling back because he is on one
foot<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.890> maybe<00:03:17.159> when<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.730> use<00:03:17.910> this

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
foot so maybe when you do use this

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.180 
foot so maybe when you do use this
ability<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.810> will<00:03:19.019> kind<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.319> stun<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.829> enemy

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
ability it will kind of stun the enemy

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.159 
ability it will kind of stun the enemy
and<00:03:20.370> knock<00:03:20.760> them<00:03:21.030> back<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.450> maybe<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:22.019> will

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
and knock them back so maybe it will

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.289 
and knock them back so maybe it will
work<00:03:22.230> very<00:03:22.739> similar<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> sonic<00:03:23.639> boom<00:03:23.849> that

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
work very similar to a sonic boom that

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.059 
work very similar to a sonic boom that
the<00:03:24.419> engineer<00:03:24.930> does<00:03:25.139> have<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.829> cannot

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
the engineer does have and you cannot

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.069 
the engineer does have and you cannot
move<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.579> few<00:03:26.760> seconds<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.419> may<00:03:27.569> be<00:03:27.630> what

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
move for a few seconds that may be what

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.539 
move for a few seconds that may be what
this<00:03:28.200> ability<00:03:28.739> does<00:03:28.889> because<00:03:29.160> we<00:03:29.250> don't<00:03:29.489> have

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
this ability does because we don't have

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.280 
this ability does because we don't have
anything<00:03:30.030> like<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.239> for<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.049> plant

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
anything like that for the plant

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.650 
anything like that for the plant
characters<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.160> maybe<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.970> what<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.359> EMP

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
characters so maybe that is what the EMP

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.020 
characters so maybe that is what the EMP
will<00:03:34.260> do<00:03:34.500> whether<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.190> has<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.579> direct

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
will do whether it has to be a direct

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.670 
will do whether it has to be a direct
hit<00:03:36.209> or<00:03:36.389> it<00:03:36.569> may<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> splash<00:03:37.410> damage

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
hit or it may do a splash damage

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.250 
hit or it may do a splash damage
surrounding<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:38.970> may<00:03:39.150> stun<00:03:39.540> multiple

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
surrounding so it may stun multiple

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.020 
surrounding so it may stun multiple
enemies<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.859> same<00:03:41.069> area<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.519> we<00:03:41.819> don't

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
enemies in the same area that we don't

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.970 
enemies in the same area that we don't
know<00:03:42.180> yet<00:03:42.389> but<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:43.049> know<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.829> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
know yet but we do know that this is the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.490 
know yet but we do know that this is the
EMP<00:03:44.310> ability<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.209> action<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.260> will<00:03:46.349> be

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
EMP ability in action and it will be

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.099 
EMP ability in action and it will be
highly<00:03:46.919> effective<00:03:47.190> against<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.269> Tzemach<00:03:48.690> so

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
highly effective against the Tzemach so

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.869 
highly effective against the Tzemach so
those<00:03:49.319> are<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.769> abilities<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.459> do<00:03:50.639> have

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
those are the abilities that we do have

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.330 
those are the abilities that we do have
for<00:03:51.209> citroen<00:03:51.720> he<00:03:51.840> has<00:03:51.930> EMP<00:03:52.440> ch<00:03:52.470> citron<00:03:53.129> mold

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
for citroen he has EMP ch citron mold

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.309 
for citroen he has EMP ch citron mold
energy<00:03:53.790> shield<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.209> ball<00:03:54.810> charge<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.260> they

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
energy shield and ball charge and they

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.589 
energy shield and ball charge and they
look<00:03:55.470> absolutely<00:03:55.620> amazing<00:03:56.280> now<00:03:57.180> we<00:03:57.239> do<00:03:57.419> get<00:03:57.569> a

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
look absolutely amazing now we do get a

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.449 
look absolutely amazing now we do get a
little<00:03:58.019> bit<00:03:58.109> more<00:03:58.260> information<00:03:58.500> about<00:03:58.889> citron

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
little bit more information about citron

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.550 
little bit more information about citron
because<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.269> see<00:04:00.480> some<00:04:00.660> gameplay<00:04:01.109> of<00:04:01.290> him

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
because we do see some gameplay of him

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.650 
because we do see some gameplay of him
in<00:04:01.709> backyard<00:04:02.549> battlegrounds<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.359> we<00:04:03.419> managed

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
in backyard battlegrounds and we managed

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.270 
in backyard battlegrounds and we managed
to<00:04:03.720> find<00:04:04.019> out<00:04:04.169> that<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.440> original<00:04:04.530> citron

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
to find out that the original citron

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.089 
to find out that the original citron
character<00:04:05.790> has<00:04:06.209> 200<00:04:06.959> health<00:04:07.230> though<00:04:07.709> they<00:04:07.889> may

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
character has 200 health though they may

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.500 
character has 200 health though they may
change<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.579> in<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.910> future<00:04:09.060> because<00:04:09.480> of

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
change this in the future because of

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.539 
change this in the future because of
course<00:04:09.900> when<00:04:10.440> they<00:04:10.560> are<00:04:10.680> doing<00:04:10.919> testing<00:04:11.370> to

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
course when they are doing testing to

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.250 
course when they are doing testing to
find<00:04:11.699> out<00:04:11.940> make<00:04:12.389> sure<00:04:12.569> all<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.930> game<00:04:13.109> is

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
find out make sure all the game is

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.990 
find out make sure all the game is
balanced<00:04:13.739> they<00:04:13.949> may<00:04:14.160> change<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.609> health<00:04:14.790> of

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
balanced they may change the health of

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.819 
balanced they may change the health of
these<00:04:15.239> characters<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:16.169> don't<00:04:16.500> think<00:04:16.709> that

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
these characters so don't think that

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.099 
these characters so don't think that
it's<00:04:17.070> going<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.310> be<00:04:17.430> 200<00:04:17.609> health<00:04:18.060> all<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.840> time

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
it's going to be 200 health all the time

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.990 
it's going to be 200 health all the time
it<00:04:19.320> because<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.769> may<00:04:19.979> change<00:04:20.340> depending<00:04:20.549> if

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
it because it may change depending if

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.670 
it because it may change depending if
they<00:04:21.180> want<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.449> balance<00:04:21.719> the<00:04:21.930> characters<00:04:22.349> to

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
they want to balance the characters to

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.140 
they want to balance the characters to
make<00:04:22.830> every<00:04:23.190> character<00:04:23.580> work<00:04:23.760> fairly

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
make every character work fairly

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.690 
make every character work fairly
together<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.560> may<00:04:25.770> change<00:04:26.159> and<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.490> course

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
together so it may change and of course

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.440 
together so it may change and of course
with<00:04:27.090> the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
with the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.120 
with the
citron<00:04:27.900> I'm<00:04:28.050> thinking<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.560> will<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:28.860> more

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
citron I'm thinking that will have more

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.190 
citron I'm thinking that will have more
health<00:04:29.400> than<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.970> original<00:04:30.420> citron<00:04:30.750> as<00:04:30.930> well

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
health than the original citron as well

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.660 
health than the original citron as well
so<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.680> also<00:04:31.920> have<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.220> remember<00:04:32.310> that

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
so you also have to remember that

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.070 
so you also have to remember that
different<00:04:32.820> variants<00:04:33.360> will<00:04:33.690> have<00:04:33.870> different

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
different variants will have different

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.110 
different variants will have different

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
want to take a look at today is the rate

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.160 
want to take a look at today is the rate
of<00:04:38.280> fire<00:04:38.670> or<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.030> fire<00:04:39.270> weapon<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.720> citron

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
of fire or the fire weapon that citron

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.530 
of fire or the fire weapon that citron
does<00:04:40.530> have<00:04:40.830> now<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.760> gameplay<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.240> the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
does have now in the gameplay of the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.540 
does have now in the gameplay of the
moon<00:04:42.780> map<00:04:43.110> we<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.710> see<00:04:43.980> two<00:04:44.370> different

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
moon map we do see two different

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.420 
moon map we do see two different
variations<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.420> citron<00:04:45.930> firing<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.980> main<00:04:47.220> one

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
variations of citron firing the main one

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.460 
variations of citron firing the main one
that<00:04:47.460> we<00:04:47.670> do<00:04:47.880> see<00:04:48.150> of<00:04:48.330> most<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.020> gameplay

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
that we do see of most of the gameplay

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.400 
that we do see of most of the gameplay
is<00:04:49.680> citron<00:04:50.250> firing<00:04:50.820> in<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.090> burst<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.540> two<00:04:51.990> but

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
is citron firing in a burst of two but

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.080 
is citron firing in a burst of two but
there<00:04:52.530> is<00:04:52.620> one<00:04:52.830> slight<00:04:53.130> little<00:04:53.580> section<00:04:53.940> in

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
there is one slight little section in

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.850 
there is one slight little section in
the<00:04:54.240> gameplay<00:04:54.420> that<00:04:54.630> we<00:04:54.840> do<00:04:55.020> see<00:04:55.290> where<00:04:55.740> you

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
the gameplay that we do see where you

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.130 
the gameplay that we do see where you
see<00:04:56.040> Rose<00:04:56.310> Colonel<00:04:57.090> Korn<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.480> citron

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
see Rose Colonel Korn and citron

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.230 
see Rose Colonel Korn and citron
capturing<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:59.010> garden<00:04:59.490> or<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.670> graveyard

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
capturing the garden or the graveyard

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.210 
capturing the garden or the graveyard
whatever<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.050> called<00:05:01.290> in<00:05:01.470> herbalist<00:05:02.010> alt

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
whatever it is called in herbalist alt

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.760 
whatever it is called in herbalist alt
but<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:02.700> can<00:05:02.820> see<00:05:03.030> citron<00:05:03.480> as<00:05:03.690> just<00:05:04.140> automatic

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
but you can see citron as just automatic

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.710 
but you can see citron as just automatic
firing<00:05:05.040> so<00:05:05.370> is<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.670> something<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.540> make

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
firing so is this just something to make

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.690 
firing so is this just something to make
the<00:05:06.840> cinematics<00:05:07.410> look<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.620> lot<00:05:07.890> better<00:05:08.040> or<00:05:08.340> is

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
the cinematics look a lot better or is

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.190 
the cinematics look a lot better or is
it<00:05:08.850> possible<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.390> be<00:05:09.480> able<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.690> change<00:05:09.990> the

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
it possible to be able to change the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.530 
it possible to be able to change the
rate<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:10.560> fire<00:05:10.770> for<00:05:11.010> citron<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.270> can<00:05:12.420> either

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
rate of fire for citron you can either

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.360 
rate of fire for citron you can either
have<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.870> as<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.080> burst<00:05:13.380> weapon<00:05:13.800> or<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.190> can

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
have it as a burst weapon or you can

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.430 
have it as a burst weapon or you can
have<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.640> as<00:05:14.820> an<00:05:14.940> automatic<00:05:15.360> weapon<00:05:15.720> but<00:05:16.260> maybe

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
have it as an automatic weapon but maybe

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.200 
have it as an automatic weapon but maybe
if<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.830> do<00:05:17.010> have<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.280> as<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.400> burst<00:05:17.640> weapon<00:05:18.000> it

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
if you do have it as a burst weapon it

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.210 
if you do have it as a burst weapon it
will<00:05:18.390> do<00:05:18.570> more<00:05:18.780> damage<00:05:18.990> or<00:05:19.290> will<00:05:19.680> have<00:05:19.860> a<00:05:19.890> less

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
will do more damage or will have a less

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.220 
will do more damage or will have a less
recoil<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:20.940> then<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.510> is<00:05:21.540> fully<00:05:21.840> automatic

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
recoil and then if it is fully automatic

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.380 
recoil and then if it is fully automatic
it's<00:05:22.590> going<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.860> be<00:05:22.950> harder<00:05:23.280> to<00:05:23.400> aim<00:05:23.670> but<00:05:24.180> over

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
it's going to be harder to aim but over

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.940 
it's going to be harder to aim but over
a<00:05:24.420> period<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.840> time<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.200> will<00:05:25.410> do<00:05:25.590> more<00:05:25.770> damage

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
a period of time but will do more damage

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.190 
a period of time but will do more damage
if<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.520> are<00:05:26.700> highly<00:05:27.120> accurate<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:28.050> is

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
if you are highly accurate that is

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.630 
if you are highly accurate that is
something<00:05:28.500> I<00:05:28.620> did<00:05:28.830> just<00:05:28.980> want<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.190> point<00:05:29.430> out

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
something I did just want to point out

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.430 
something I did just want to point out
so<00:05:29.970> maybe<00:05:30.480> we<00:05:30.720> could<00:05:30.840> get<00:05:30.960> some<00:05:31.170> more<00:05:31.260> answers

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
so maybe we could get some more answers

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.260 
so maybe we could get some more answers
on<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.830> very<00:05:32.160> very<00:05:32.370> soon<00:05:32.610> because<00:05:32.820> we<00:05:33.060> don't

on this very very soon because we don't

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.600 
on this very very soon because we don't
know<00:05:33.420> what<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.110> fire<00:05:34.290> rates<00:05:34.560> of<00:05:34.710> citron<00:05:35.190> is<00:05:35.250> is

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.970 
know what the fire rates of citron is is
it<00:05:35.940> a<00:05:36.030> burst<00:05:36.270> fire<00:05:36.570> weapon<00:05:36.660> is<00:05:37.110> it<00:05:37.380> automatic

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
it a burst fire weapon is it automatic

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.460 
it a burst fire weapon is it automatic
or<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.340> it<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.460> mix<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:38.940> both<00:05:39.210> but<00:05:39.810> anyway<00:05:40.080> that
