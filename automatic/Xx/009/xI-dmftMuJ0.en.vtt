00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.169
 so after a man's hobby got out of hand 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.369
 no not really it is the intention to start attacking 4ad 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.300
 but yes yes 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.079
 the ones started this year for the first time so found is also up to the team 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.239
 we discover how you should do it 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.839
 but then I would find it hard to weaken 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.750
 think it's it 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.000
 caution but the brother is preventing diseases 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.200
 that is actually 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.990
 the art of building that out to keep ours out that morning because there are 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.350
 a lot of beasts that 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.830
 it seems that there is still something but we will 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.590
 according to a powerless person and you have to keep up 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.160
 and see so you have to keep other snails out, especially gives birth to snails 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.920
 and with that and such things as once you have that in the breeding then 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.980
 then it's harder to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.650
 because to get out 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.160
 and but the purity and beauty process that is type is the art and 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.170
 I have to say and I have you the first year 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.490
 however, I have been lucky so far, I have very few dropouts 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 and I didn't expect that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.050
 what 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.780
 what should you perform asleep 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.790
 kramer 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.430
 pearl fruits 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.370
 but what i do is a blend belongs to the corn 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.170
 soybeans christmas 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.960
 expensive calf milk replacer and lots of lime because they must of course be able to house 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.130
 can be on the builder in addition, there are many minerals 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.760
 and we are a kind of trade for sale i suggested myself has hurray together 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.150
 cassano daily 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.630
 the flavors are there for about an hour and a half at a stand of 2 0 against 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.160
 indeed 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.830
 take it with you 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.360
 Add to that that we get bags of rest and a yo-yo 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.440
 yes we are going to travel and away sometime 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.170
 beh if she did not get any food she shuts herself off 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.090
 and then I just don't have them 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.370
 And yes if you do and if it rains then they get another trainer to perform 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.709
 we also do not have to spray, which saves time 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.809
 but it is owned though the professions are 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.599
 It is one of the oldest suspect appeals that he never knew 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.519
 there we go back to weep penta more then a bad turn the nurseries 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:25.399
 In addition, it owns the rodents expanded the fourth round 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.049
 reijnen 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.379
 the soldiers from napoleon like the animals that had snails in one hand 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.299
 he wants to reach food the laden they have done well what she is there 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.599
 found nothing so they could let you know 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.539
 park to come to sing also very well 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.599
 where well preserved 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.660
 so what is now a bit of a luxury apart from one in one 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.490
 restaurant when they were in the Netherlands 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.310
 that was left for us 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.840
 yes that was for many water food tents on the people 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.159
 maybe because you could rather be the snail's birthday 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.900
 then of those big bison there was a bear market force so lay on a pizza 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.159
 yes that cost the attacker food 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.359
 but some of seed potatoes 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.259
 has been appreciated for a few years now we think we are a bit slimy but 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.979
 it is a delicious piece of meat 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.109
 come to eat were hard to follow and our regions 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.759
 yes the 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.799
 the vineyard snail kilo pure through all the pictures and they can easily pick 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.679
 actually you have here in a few 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.139
 we even experiment in double the hobby 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:25.989
 delicious 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.839
 Normally it is that out of four in five years it has been designed 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:34.169
 that in nature only one or two survive as if as the French 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.469
 become an ex-adult 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.310
 but in these controlled circumstances 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.519
 Europe had at least 50 percent 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.019
 and nature can make a call so in that respect I am just in a hurry 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.859
 very successful 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.809
 but finally after one 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.770
 dutch you can't just take vineyard snails 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.669
 you can't just go on the netherlands 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.309
 Breda bring snails, but there aren't either 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.069
 controlled buying in the arts 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.409
 especially in Germany is actually mainly the vine snail 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.949
 cultivated by growers 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.330
 and being able to throw the day for redemptions is something 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.249
 and then you can work weeks quickly 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.849
 this the 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.850
 the other that is in the Netherlands disease that resembles this weak 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.050
 with coincidence all of them cost snails and they would see the precise ones 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.789
 extreme party that you also see in the Netherlands 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:26.629
 and this is going through the Netherlands for hopefully asylum seekers 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.100
 the crates 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.729
 matters that make you the greatest 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.830
 and the cleaning of 2010 lost a lot so that the taste improved 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.460
 that airport 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.370
 80 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.170
 6 25 Feb 11 and 25 suspects 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.539
 that you can't wait for that 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.169
 and that and then can cook 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.430
 they cut small pieces everywhere and that has to be removed 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.860
 don't let the bus get a why exactly 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.979
 to enter the premises 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.599
 rinsed the attic well and then keep them for sale for three or five 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:02.360
 minutes 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.920
 there they are taken out of their houses and then they go again 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.110
 bing up to three hours 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.900
 and uruguay and the stock bouillon to be soft 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.970
 the sale by the but that is actually a piece of their own rich meat 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.380
 you can compare a bit with the wire-reading techno to die 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.800
 to cook for quite a while and to become nice and soft 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.030
 so if we get them in the restaurant and serve in a house then that is it 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.020
 not completely fit 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.669
 the truth finding that is correct then resurrected the death after buying thousands 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:33.550
 turn in 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.680
 along with garlic boat trip on other things 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.840
 she stopped it and the layman's house 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.840
 and then warmed up so you get them 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.939
 the so-called sufficient sales market antennas first harvest 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.919
 I have to say that I still own the market 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.580
 mother develop i am partly started this year a viewing is growing 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.069
 that stuff delicious and it 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.830
 it will be great though 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.939
 I was pretty quick done with the commercial 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.130
 all aspects of land 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.309
 less than a percent of the 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.469
 that number of snails what a belgian die 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.060
 and being in Sweden 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.760
 talk about the Netherlands now 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.919
 bob theo theo cultivator 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.930
 the market must be sufficient for this in the euregio and beyond 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.569
 for a 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.589
 farms product 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.610
 it is also searching for the old one in hasselt 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.330
 And yes it is always like that too that is new that is all discovering 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.189
 this year 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.379
 but I assume that the market consists mainly of a restaurant 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.680
 which can 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.900
 it can have it there too 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.330
 processing companies 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.370
 they are natural 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.830
 But we started with 80,000 strategy not convinced that there is 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.020
 would be 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.310
 be able to spend the first year on restaurants 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.979
 I like that 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.979
 but everything goes to the bicycle for the processing industry 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.999
 in that you should be ahead of them without them 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:07:00.479
 he has diana fish he knows it is much better than you are there it is 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.849
 for growing to make it for 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.940
 but a thousand things ain't going to tour deep in the background 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.259
 also a nice board in a nice game 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:11.679
 you get used to people who claim
