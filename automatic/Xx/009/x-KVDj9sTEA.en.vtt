00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello everyone and we continue 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.220
 unpack my parcel today and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.340
 today 2 here 2 of them here it should 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.870
 be more interesting i tell you because 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.590
 previous it is generally purely so 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.570
 informative and informative videos about 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.369
 the latest news from my channel 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.250
 This is a package with aliexpress 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 such a clock 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.210
 interesting things that show time and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.790
 There is a projector that can say 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.920
 on the wall will project time but it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.670
 I think I may not show you now 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.010
 lay out on twitter or something else 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.039
 show because the previous watch 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 subway station logical twitter I 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.120
 posted a photo of how it glows during the day and 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:09.150
 at night how here we find the instruction 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:11.400
 what language but in principle and so can 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.030
 will disassemble related then 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 hooked up 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:25.340
 which is with the temperature and this is what we have here 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.700
 such a station is not a clock 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.700
 so interesting so here are the keys 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.799
 control mod up down max min and what is it 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.840
 essenza don't know so this is a connector for 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.310
 power supply 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:49.140
 By the way, there is no power without 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:56.299
 Power go here are the keys or rather 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:00.020
 reset button is a battery socket 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.020
 here or pieces 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:16.930
 I am a stand-up but this is the main display 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.550
 basic information here and here it is 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:26.230
 this unit can already tell the projector 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.300
 white is also two buttons smooth and not catch 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.440
 I know what it means then in the course we will understand 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.160
 here it turns and it can be admitted 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:41.890
 the clock is there they are behind the wall 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.370
 and somehow it turn this way or that or 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.380
 to the ceiling but this is how many 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.270
 Enough of where to send this 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.480
 a projector so he projects time i 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.670
 I think it will be interesting here by the way here 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:00.820
 something is spinning a little shorter 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.700
 for maybe it can focus but something like 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.840
 focus so that is the distance to 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.100
 it was clearly visible neither blurred and so on 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.430
 In general, what to say here is a package wrapped 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.630
 with the watch here is this information I think 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.370
 you can ask me in the comments 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:26.830
 either on twitter that's how it all works 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:31.180
 I think, too, I take off the photo when they work 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.500
 and when working here this projector so what 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.050
 thank you all for watching 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.110
 as usual, thanks to the subscribers for 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.720
 look and you want so much 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.380
 Of course, the likes are necessary because 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.670
 your likes is an incentive to make new videos 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.410
 that's all for now 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.410
 all have a good day and good mood
