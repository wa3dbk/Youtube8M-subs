parts inside the wall right here where

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.020 
parts inside the wall right here where
my<00:01:01.859> fingers<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.730> where<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> actually

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
my fingers are this is where I actually

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.490 
my fingers are this is where I actually

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
water drains out of this two and out so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.660 
water drains out of this two and out so
this<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.439> well<00:01:10.590> inside<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> insulated<00:01:11.520> wall

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this is well inside the insulated wall

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.800 
this is well inside the insulated wall

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.450 
water will not empty out of this tube
here<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> consequence<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
