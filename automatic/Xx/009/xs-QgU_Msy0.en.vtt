00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.120
 as seen in the history of the agreement imam n 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.190
 debtors have already forgiven their mobs 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.900
 financial losses in everything else 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.790
 Russians old debts with writes 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.180
 federal states 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.900
 the tax office turned to the Ministry of Finance with 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.330
 offer to write off public debt by 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.320
 transport property and 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.470
 land taxes as well as intoxication 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.239
 penalties that have accumulated before the first 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.009
 January 2009, the reasons for this 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.269
 generosity and found out our correspondent 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.730
 Alexander Osh him 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.789
 the state forgives the Russians the debts are not 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.369
 because she is generous 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.900
 but because ineffective and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.540
 just not able to collect these findings 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.719
 and proposals and the Ministry of Finance supported the idea 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.100
 declare amnesty to debtors of zero 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.249
 it comes as an offer 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.469
 due to the recognition of hopeless 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.559
 arrears of individuals 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.160
 new 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.690
 singing a fine which was by 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.550
 as of January 1, 2009 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.250
 the tax authorities honestly admit from 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.710
 existing debt collection model 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.780
 such that 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.309
 cheaper forgive them besides lists 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.219
 debtors reigns such confusion 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.430
 it's not just impossible to understand 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.190
 the value of the state of the existing than 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.740
 agreed 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.250
 this is the first reason 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.010
 the second reason is that unfortunately for 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.680
 past years 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.730
 and more will be more accurately custody order 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.260
 lower reliability of those raw data 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.820
 on the basis of which the tax is convenient to the number 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.260
 traffic police fighters from Rosreestra offended 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.540
 organizations and the complete lack of common bases 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.060
 data led to the fact that for 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.080
 for long years 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.000
 russian president pay taxes on 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.870
 real estate that did not sell or 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.350
 a car that has long been sought 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.580
 the hosts 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.170
 I'm right 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.600
 new cars five years ago 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.590
 although yes continues soon 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.140
 increase receipt of tax 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.550
 memorial provisions of the concept no matter how 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.560
 one 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.600
 lot 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.420
 the commission should inspire optimism in 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.840
 present complicated cats suddenly through 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.159
 several years is growing and today's trading 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.439
 insulting should be only the fact that 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.979
 just the other day the withdrawal of ships 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.420
 getting into this place and now leads 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.869
 this plot causes a frontal crash
