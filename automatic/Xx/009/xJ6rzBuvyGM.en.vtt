00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
all in all considering its size it's a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
all in all considering its size it's a
really<00:01:00.510> good<00:01:00.690> figure<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.140> good<00:01:01.350> alt<00:01:01.559> mode

really good figure really good alt mode

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.039

the<00:01:02.730> only<00:01:02.910> complaint<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.480> would<00:01:03.809> have

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the only complaint that I would have

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.100 
the only complaint that I would have
would<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.890> lack<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> an<00:01:06.150> Autobot<00:01:06.659> symbol

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
would be the lack of an Autobot symbol

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.160 
would be the lack of an Autobot symbol
on<00:01:07.229> top<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.619> his<00:01:07.770> grille<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.750> but<00:01:09.750> I

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
on top of his grille right there but I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
on top of his grille right there but I
guess<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.310> ahead<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.460> paint<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
guess you can just go ahead and paint a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.370 
guess you can just go ahead and paint a
little<00:01:11.909> red<00:01:12.180> dot<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.930> pretend<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
little red dot there and pretend that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
little red dot there and pretend that
it's<00:01:13.530> an<00:01:13.710> Autobot<00:01:14.100> symbol<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.520> something<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's an Autobot symbol or something but

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060 
it's an Autobot symbol or something but
considering<00:01:15.930> its<00:01:16.020> size<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.530> understandable

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
considering its size it's understandable

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.280 
considering its size it's understandable
why<00:01:17.280> Hasbro<00:01:17.759> wouldn't<00:01:18.240> decide<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.840> mold<00:01:19.049> one

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
why Hasbro wouldn't decide to mold one

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
why Hasbro wouldn't decide to mold one
in<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> said<00:01:21.420> let's<00:01:21.750> go

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
in there so with that said let's go

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
in there so with that said let's go
ahead<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.439> transform<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.250> figure<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
ahead and transform the figure here and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.830 
ahead and transform the figure here and
to<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.439> I'll<00:01:25.979> start<00:01:26.520> by<00:01:26.820> loosening<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to do that I'll start by loosening the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.469 
to do that I'll start by loosening the
center<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> cab<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.119> pull<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
center of the cab just pull it up a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.230 
center of the cab just pull it up a
little<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.350> right<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
little like that right there and the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.539 
little like that right there and the
rear<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> truck<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:35.220> form<00:01:35.430> his

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
rear of the truck actually will form his

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.390 
rear of the truck actually will form his
arms<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.299> his<00:01:36.420> hands<00:01:37.280> molded<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
arms you can see his hands molded in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
arms you can see his hands molded in
right<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.930> well<00:01:40.350> they're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
right there to do that well they're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
right there to do that well they're
connected<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:41.670> pegs<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.180> bottom<00:01:42.540> right

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
connected by pegs on the bottom right

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.460 
connected by pegs on the bottom right
there<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.700> pegs<00:01:45.079> right<00:01:46.079> behind

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
there there and two pegs right behind

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.960 
there there and two pegs right behind
the<00:01:46.680> gas<00:01:46.890> tanks<00:01:47.220> right<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.790> right

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the gas tanks right there and right

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.260 
the gas tanks right there and right
there

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.810 
there
so<00:01:49.170> we'll<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.890> ahead<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> pull<00:01:50.700> them

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
so we'll just go ahead and pull them

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.639 
so we'll just go ahead and pull them
apart<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> actually<00:01:52.500> what

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
apart like that and actually what

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.899 
apart like that and actually what
they'll<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> they'll<00:01:53.189> swivel<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
they'll do is they'll swivel from the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.630 
they'll do is they'll swivel from the
back<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.329> front<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.840> form<00:01:55.049> his<00:01:55.140> arms<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
back to the front to form his arms and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
back to the front to form his arms and
that<00:01:56.640> leaves<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.000> front<00:01:57.210> which<00:01:57.479> forms<00:01:57.930> his

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that leaves the front which forms his

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
that leaves the front which forms his
legs<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.909> we'll<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.479> ahead

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
legs so to do that we'll just go ahead

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
legs so to do that we'll just go ahead
and<00:02:00.719> pull<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:00.990> apart<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and pull that apart right there and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.280 
and pull that apart right there and
we'll<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:02.969> ahead<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.270> form<00:02:03.630> his<00:02:03.750> arms<00:02:04.079> right

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
we'll go ahead and form his arms right

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.990 
we'll go ahead and form his arms right
now<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.799> swivel<00:02:05.009> into<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> front

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.580 

and<00:02:11.000> with<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.690> done<00:02:11.960> we'll<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.319> go<00:02:12.440> ahead

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and with that done we'll just go ahead

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.730 
and with that done we'll just go ahead
and<00:02:12.680> pull<00:02:12.830> down<00:02:13.040> his<00:02:13.220> legs<00:02:14.350> now<00:02:15.350> before<00:02:15.680> you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740

there and on the bottom here you'll see

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.410 
there and on the bottom here you'll see
like<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:24.080> little<00:02:24.470> hole<00:02:24.830> right<00:02:24.860> there<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.670> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
like a little hole right there and a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.640 
like a little hole right there and a
little<00:02:26.630> peg<00:02:26.840> right<00:02:27.080> there<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.440> those<00:02:27.590> two

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
little peg right there and those two

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.010 
little peg right there and those two
will<00:02:28.130> connect<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.820> each<00:02:28.910> other<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.420> form<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
will connect to each other to form the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.590 
will connect to each other to form the
torso<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.459> just<00:02:31.790> go<00:02:31.910> ahead<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.180> connect<00:02:32.450> that

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.190 
torso so just go ahead and connect that
like<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:35.060> we'll<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:35.660> pull<00:02:35.900> down<00:02:35.930> his

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
like that and we'll just pull down his

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.570 
like that and we'll just pull down his
feet

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.820 

lastly<00:02:40.580> we'll<00:02:41.060> bring<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.989> rear<00:02:42.410> part<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
lastly we'll bring this rear part of the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.600 
lastly we'll bring this rear part of the
cab<00:02:43.130> down<00:02:43.580> which<00:02:44.000> will<00:02:44.239> expose<00:02:44.600> his<00:02:44.810> head<00:02:45.610> and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
cab down which will expose his head and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.440 
cab down which will expose his head and
there<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:48.430> legends<00:02:49.430> class<00:02:49.670> optimists

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
there you have legends class optimists

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.120 
there you have legends class optimists
in<00:02:50.570> bot<00:02:51.170> mode<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:53.660> far<00:02:54.019> as<00:02:54.110> articulation<00:02:54.830> goes

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
in bot mode as far as articulation goes

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
in bot mode as far as articulation goes
his<00:02:55.989> shoulders<00:02:56.989> are<00:02:57.260> on<00:02:57.440> ball<00:02:57.680> joints<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.310> his

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
his shoulders are on ball joints and his

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.390 
his shoulders are on ball joints and his
elbows<00:02:59.630> are<00:02:59.959> actually<00:03:00.320> on<00:03:00.440> hinge<00:03:00.680> joints<00:03:01.220> so

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
elbows are actually on hinge joints so

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.740 
elbows are actually on hinge joints so
you<00:03:01.430> get<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:01.970> can<00:03:02.030> get<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.269> good<00:03:02.390> range<00:03:02.630> of

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
you get it you can get a good range of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.160 
you get it you can get a good range of
movement<00:03:02.930> from<00:03:03.350> there<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.950> his<00:03:04.790> hips<00:03:05.750> are

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
movement from there and his hips are

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.830 
movement from there and his hips are
actually<00:03:06.739> on<00:03:07.010> ball<00:03:07.310> joints<00:03:07.700> as<00:03:07.820> well<00:03:07.850> now<00:03:08.750> he

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
actually on ball joints as well now he

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.130 
actually on ball joints as well now he
has<00:03:09.050> no<00:03:09.290> waist<00:03:09.530> articulation<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.820> no<00:03:11.510> knee

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
has no waist articulation and no knee

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.350 
has no waist articulation and no knee
articulation<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:13.100> his<00:03:13.280> head<00:03:13.549> doesn't<00:03:14.209> move

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
articulation and his head doesn't move

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.860 
articulation and his head doesn't move
at<00:03:14.510> all

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
at all

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.470 
at all
so<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.890> does<00:03:16.100> limit<00:03:16.280> poseability<00:03:16.820> somewhat

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
so that does limit poseability somewhat

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.470 
so that does limit poseability somewhat
but<00:03:17.930> considering<00:03:18.590> his<00:03:18.769> size<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.700> still

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
but considering his size it's still

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
but considering his size it's still
pretty<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:21.380> pretty<00:03:22.130> posable<00:03:22.640> figure<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.940> think

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.259 

so<00:03:27.500> as<00:03:27.769> far<00:03:27.920> as<00:03:27.980> something<00:03:28.340> small<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.670> have<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
so as far as something small to have and

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.449 
so as far as something small to have and
play<00:03:29.870> on<00:03:30.049> your<00:03:30.170> desk<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:31.010> great<00:03:31.220> figure

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
play on your desk it's a great figure

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.819 
play on your desk it's a great figure
but<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.269> wouldn't<00:03:32.810> really<00:03:33.140> see<00:03:33.560> him<00:03:33.680> as<00:03:33.799> a

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
but I wouldn't really see him as a

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.380 
but I wouldn't really see him as a
replacement<00:03:34.100> for<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.549> Voyager<00:03:35.060> or<00:03:35.180> leader

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
replacement for the Voyager or leader

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.410 
replacement for the Voyager or leader
class<00:03:35.660> figure<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.090> have<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.329> money

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
class figure but if you have the money

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.630 
class figure but if you have the money
to<00:03:38.570> spend<00:03:38.690> this<00:03:39.410> guy<00:03:39.590> goes<00:03:39.829> for<00:03:39.860> about<00:03:40.400> five

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
up it's a really good figure really

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.449 
up it's a really good figure really
solid<00:03:49.209> really<00:03:50.209> good<00:03:50.510> detailing<00:03:51.079> there<00:03:51.950> let's
