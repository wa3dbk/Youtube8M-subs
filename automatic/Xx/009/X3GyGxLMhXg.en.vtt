00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
with my one right to the occipital bone

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:06.990 
with my one right to the occipital bone

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:33.899 

then<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.720> think<00:01:07.990> we're<00:01:08.170> doing<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.440> video<00:01:08.680> with

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.469 

the<00:01:34.360> only<00:01:34.570> way<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.750> get<00:01:34.960> good<00:01:35.170> at<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:35.500> as<00:01:36.100> well

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
the only way to get good at this as well

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.730 
the only way to get good at this as well
with<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.840> practice

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
with the practice

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.210 
with the practice
I<00:01:39.770> was<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.520> year<00:01:40.850> doing<00:01:41.570> haircut<00:01:41.960> before<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.710> felt

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
I was a year doing haircut before I felt

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.680 
I was a year doing haircut before I felt
really<00:01:43.490> comfortable<00:01:43.869> with<00:01:44.869> my<00:01:45.049> confidences

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
really comfortable with my confidences

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.600 
really comfortable with my confidences
so<00:01:47.690> this<00:01:47.900> don't<00:01:48.140> come<00:01:48.350> overnight<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:49.430> like<00:01:49.580> a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
so this don't come overnight it's like a

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.249 
so this don't come overnight it's like a
meal<00:01:50.680> I'm<00:01:51.680> gonna<00:01:51.830> work<00:01:52.040> hard<00:01:53.170> you're<00:01:54.170> not

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.059 

now<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:36.970> always<00:02:37.480> keep<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.810> bangs<00:02:38.019> till<00:02:38.349> last<00:02:38.530> I

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
now I always keep the bangs till last I

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.699 
now I always keep the bangs till last I
don't<00:02:39.760> know<00:02:39.849> why<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.709> do<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:44.349> you<00:02:44.440> bring<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
don't know why what I do so you bring it

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.040 
don't know why what I do so you bring it
down<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:46.120> should<00:02:46.300> never<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.840> cut

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
down and you should never just cut

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:56.790 
down and you should never just cut
straight<00:02:47.290> across<00:02:47.349> always<00:02:47.980> cut<00:02:48.340> into<00:02:48.730> it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:04:03.520 

you<00:02:57.370> need<00:02:57.580> some<00:02:57.790> texture

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.180 

now<00:04:04.070> I'm<00:04:04.430> using<00:04:04.700> my<00:04:04.850> clickers<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.420> trim<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
now I'm using my clickers to trim the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.250 
now I'm using my clickers to trim the
edge<00:04:07.340> because<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.420> don't<00:04:08.630> really<00:04:08.780> like<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
edge because I don't really like the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.120 
edge because I don't really like the
Turner's<00:04:09.710> that<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:09.920> have

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
Turner's that I have

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.360 
Turner's that I have
so<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.880> can<00:04:12.180> see<00:04:12.360> all<00:04:12.630> I'm<00:04:12.780> using<00:04:13.020> now<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.710> trim

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
so you can see all I'm using now to trim

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.220 
so you can see all I'm using now to trim
around<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.670> ear<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.480> very<00:04:15.960> corner<00:04:18.230> now

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
around the ear is the very corner now

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.620 
around the ear is the very corner now

instead of going freehand now I have
something<00:04:39.920> it's<00:04:40.070> sort<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.400> like<00:04:40.490> using<00:04:40.700> a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
something it's sort of like using a

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.760 
something it's sort of like using a
tripod<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.630> keeping<00:04:42.200> everything<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.530> little

and there will come a time
when<00:05:35.909> you<00:05:36.299> don't<00:05:36.509> even<00:05:36.689> think<00:05:37.049> about<00:05:37.169> what

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
when you don't even think about what
