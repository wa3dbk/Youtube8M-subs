00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.730
 Good quality inexpensive 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 Happy 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.050
 I wanted you to eat it and I'm doing this 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.819
 Make that a motto 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:26.839
 To all 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.339
 Anyway, I got the same hard 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.949
 Let's go today 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.020
 I'm sorry 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.730
 Meat Russia only 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.840
 I am a second son 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.190
 I was born and raised 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 I only eat one delicious thing from my childhood 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 As we were advancing fire by this February, to port company customers 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 That kind of thought I want to convey 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.500
 It is painful 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.810
 In the chest part 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.810
 What is that but I also 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.850
 It is a measure that is frosty 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.000
 There is no figure that shows the struggling stance of hardship 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.130
 Chairperson Tsuchiya attends at 7 o'clock 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.740
 In a country called Japan 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.720
 Use the chips so it really smells Christmas 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.630
 Good 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.690
 On the contrary, I think that it is only strong 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.730
 Sometimes 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.050
 I heard about it a little thick and there is a festival revel touch there for a moment 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.610
 I'm out of stock if you do not like me 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.159
 This is also the airport 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.850
 Quick start 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.070
 Well everyone 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.490
 I want to see a lot of people 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 translation 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 On the other hand 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.290
 I could not be satisfied, so it was nice to improve 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 Like going to the codec 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.340
 3 to offer 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.100
