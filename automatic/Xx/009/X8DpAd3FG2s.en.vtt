honest<00:01:10.290> truth<00:01:11.420> one<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.780> isn't<00:01:13.350> my<00:01:13.799> favorite

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
honest truth one this isn't my favorite

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
honest truth one this isn't my favorite
style<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.119> me<00:01:15.509> I'm<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.939> big<00:01:17.939> afro

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
style on me I'm not really a big afro

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.740 
style on me I'm not really a big afro
kind<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.560> person<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.400> big<00:01:20.729> twist<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.540> or

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
kind of person I like a big twist out or

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
kind of person I like a big twist out or
a<00:01:21.780> big<00:01:21.960> braid<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.439> something<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> pattern

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
a big braid out something with a pattern

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240 
a big braid out something with a pattern
so<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.720> isn't<00:01:24.990> exactly<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.710> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.040> style

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
so this isn't exactly my kind of style
but<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.610> need<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.060> review<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> wig<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:27.990> I

but<00:03:25.500> also<00:03:25.650> maybe<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:26.010> wig<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.340> you're<00:03:26.580> not

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
but also maybe a wig that you're not

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.340 
but also maybe a wig that you're not
sure<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.240> want<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.510> buy<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.960> you<00:03:28.080> want<00:03:28.230> my

honest<00:03:28.710> opinion<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.520> but<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.000> think<00:03:30.060> this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
honest opinion on it but I think this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.480 
honest opinion on it but I think this
wig<00:03:30.570> has<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.810> great<00:03:31.110> texture<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.770> like<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.280> better

wig has a great texture I like it better

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.070 
wig has a great texture I like it better

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
because the more mimics my here because

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.410 
because the more mimics my here because
this<00:03:34.200> quote<00:03:34.470> Lee<00:03:34.650> versus<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.160> cream<00:03:35.730> that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
this quote Lee versus that cream that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.160 
this quote Lee versus that cream that
crimps

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
crimps

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.470 
crimps
kind<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.470> texture<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.820> also<00:03:39.030> let's<00:03:39.300> here's

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
kind of texture and I also let's here's

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.390 
kind of texture and I also let's here's
a<00:03:39.540> little<00:03:39.840> bit<00:03:40.050> softer<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.800> it's<00:03:40.980> not<00:03:41.190> as

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
a little bit softer so it's not as

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.340 
a little bit softer so it's not as
course<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:41.940> other<00:03:42.170> synthetic<00:03:43.170> natural

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
course it's other synthetic natural

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.560 
course it's other synthetic natural
