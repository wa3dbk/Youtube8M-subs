00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello everyone with you channel metagame and in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 This video I will tell you about the heroes 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.450
 which perfectly interacts with each 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.830
 friend on line represents for enemies 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 mortal danger 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.820
 we will consider those characters that are already 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 from the third level is able to kill 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.900
 enemy heroes we will evaluate 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.449
 bundle potential for the three main 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.369
 criterion first is the damage which is a bunch 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.680
 can inflict their abilities and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.199
 attacks the second criterion is speed with 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.210
 which they will kill the enemy and the third 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.880
 the indicator is how reliable 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 can we take them prokast your attention 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.719
 5 pairs of heroes will be presented 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.050
 perfectly interact with each other 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 and so it went 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 the first two heroes are intent apparition 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 and chaos knight apparition pumps cold 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.469
 feet and challenge a house download 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 reality rift 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.420
 the order of use of skills should be 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.180
 such one caste i'm cold feet 2 x y 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 it's worth doing a tank and reality rift 3 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 after that on both heroes 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.600
 superimposed a challenge in such a way as 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.670
 just ending the house knight 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 ravine turns frozen from cold 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.040
 feet 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 but for now the color is worth chilling dacha 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.020
 perfectly strengthen your attacks allowing you to easily 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 kill most of the heroes 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 apparition and house can during two 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 put his camps very serious 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.580
 damage however this happens far from 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.830
 instantly as it takes time to 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.780
 worked cold feet but for file 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.490
 procast is almost impossible therefore 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.680
 a bundle can be considered more than reliable 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.009
 the next couple of heroes and the crystal 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.530
 maiden and girokopter crystal studies 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.409
 crystal low and frost bytes and gyrocopter 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.299
 teaches lessons to save and homing missile 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.460
 first his enemy needs to launch a rocket 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.740
 and so that the enemy did not have time to run far 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.929
 need to use frost bytes then 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.700
 helicopter rocket take care and when 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.799
 ice will end and pass 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.799
 will rockets be used crystal new 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.140
 also do not forget to save hands 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.360
 might hurt someone else losing part 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.220
 damage to the main target also the enemy 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.500
 there will be time to say something for now 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.709
 he stands in the ice so the bunch gets 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.330
 not too high mark for reliability 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.769
 This prokast can well kill many 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.780
 heroes in full health 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.760
 However, this does not happen too fast. 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.569
 since almost everyone slept and caused damage 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.569
 they probably 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.680
 sandking owl time-tested 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.940
 a bunch of scorpion pump sand pants 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.700
 Alina Dragon Slave 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.920
 and light troyka rei bright your camp 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.299
 uses scorpion farther will be 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.200
 great opportunity too 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.000
 to stun the enemy 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 then on target are used 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.200
 dragonfly is a bunch can they put 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:55.400
 some crazy damage but 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.319
 one hope is quick and always on 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.900
 from very effective bundles this is a shadow 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.180
 demon and shadow shadow demon exploring deezer 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.510
 communities and sol katcher shadow pumps 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.220
 Avalanche ethos first Shadow demon casts 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.739
 on the enemy deezer communities and while the enemy is in 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.940
 astral makes him angry catcher about 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.340
 as soon as the action of astral 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.239
 ends tinnika worth avalanch ethos 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.489
 the only thing that can go wrong 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.319
 sometimes for creeps nearby you can 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.970
 miss with alky chiram however all 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.819
 even this bundle can be considered quite 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.919
 reliable is one of the strongest pro 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.840
 cost to start the game because all the damage 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.940
 the resulting target will be strengthened by 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.799
 soul catcher 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.630
 Pro to the wall very quickly send the enemy 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.609
 to that light to the same while the goal will be 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.450
 Got illusions have time to inflict on 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.459
 few blows 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.459
 and this will further speed up the process and 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.230
 finally the fifth pair of bing heroes 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.280
 and the centaur binga pumps the camp to him 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.150
 after a centaur empty and double edge 1 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.699
 attacks winga 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.620
 using your camp for its vtr pack 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.840
 the goal behind the bed centaur is suitable to 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.310
 say custom to hit a couple of times with your hand 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.310
 continue to make the black 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.190
 this bundle does quite tangible damage 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.000
 to start the game and do it enough 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.890
 quickly 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.690
 however sometimes we can stop where 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.209
 enough for the centaur to run up to 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:22.820
 goals during so the bunch gets no 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.290
 highest marks for reliability and so 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.150
 I told you about five and very 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.980
 effective bundles that are great 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.590
 will suit you when you play in a pair with 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.690
 friend I wish you more victories and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.340
 interesting games with you was the channel
