better they're bad first touch but he

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.010 
better they're bad first touch but he
still<00:02:45.850> gets<00:02:46.000> through<00:02:46.270> but<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.510> past<00:02:46.750> was<00:02:46.990> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.440

I'm<00:03:12.310> knocking<00:03:12.550> down<00:03:12.580> for<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.030> lack<00:03:13.420> of

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
I'm knocking down for is that lack of

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.300 
I'm knocking down for is that lack of
pace<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.530> killer<00:03:14.800> sometimes

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
pace and that is killer sometimes

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.710 
pace and that is killer sometimes
because<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.700> will<00:03:15.850> get<00:03:15.970> caught<00:03:16.240> up<00:03:16.420> on<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
because you will get caught up on the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.690 
because you will get caught up on the
ball<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.290> overall<00:03:17.650> give<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.130> guy<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.520> nine

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
ball so overall give this guy a nine

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.520 
ball so overall give this guy a nine
point<00:03:18.880> two<00:03:19.000> five<00:03:19.239> out<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.510> ten<00:03:19.750> definitely<00:03:20.500> a
