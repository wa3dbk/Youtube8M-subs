reasonable outcome for the fiscal year
is<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.570> proof<00:00:09.929> profit<00:00:10.380> before<00:00:10.500> taxes<00:00:11.099> lower

yes<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.980> think<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.700> choose<00:00:15.240> our<00:00:15.450> words

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
yes I think we have to choose our words

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.960 
yes I think we have to choose our words
carefully<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.680> 11<00:00:17.490> months<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> the

outcome<00:00:23.390> in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> current<00:00:24.869> environment<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
outcome in the current environment is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.439 
outcome in the current environment is
about<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.430> best<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.910> would<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.119> able<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
about the best we would be able to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.250 
about the best we would be able to
predict<00:00:27.869> given<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.640> circumstances<00:00:30.359> but

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
predict given all the circumstances but

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.690 
predict given all the circumstances but
what<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:31.560> those<00:00:31.710> circumstances<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
what are those circumstances I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.400 
what are those circumstances I
presumably<00:00:33.210> though<00:00:33.450> you're<00:00:33.960> talking<00:00:34.110> about

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
presumably though you're talking about

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.860 
presumably though you're talking about
costs<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.430> inflation<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.360> costs<00:00:36.750> are

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
costs and inflation because costs are

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
costs and inflation because costs are
rising<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.590> food<00:00:37.890> their<00:00:38.250> costs<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:38.610> rising

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
rising for food their costs are rising

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030 
rising for food their costs are rising
for<00:00:39.000> electricity<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:40.050> staff<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> able

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
for electricity for staff are you able

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.299 
for electricity for staff are you able
to<00:00:41.430> pass<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.180> those<00:00:42.870> costs<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.469> consumers<00:00:44.129> at

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
to pass on those costs to consumers at

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
to pass on those costs to consumers at
the<00:00:44.340> moment<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:45.030> are<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> able<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.660> absorb

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the moment or are you able to absorb

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.319 
the moment or are you able to absorb
them<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.160> dilemma<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.789> think<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
them that's the dilemma I think for a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.720 
them that's the dilemma I think for a
lot<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> businesses<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.379> you've<00:00:49.620> said<00:00:49.920> costs

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
lot of businesses as you've said costs

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.260 
lot of businesses as you've said costs
are<00:00:50.850> increasing<00:00:51.320> quite<00:00:52.320> sharply<00:00:53.270> customers

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
are increasing quite sharply customers

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.619 
are increasing quite sharply customers
incomes<00:00:54.809> aren't<00:00:55.649> increasing<00:00:56.539> there's<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
incomes aren't increasing there's a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.189 
incomes aren't increasing there's a
squeeze<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.879> it's<00:00:59.879> very<00:01:00.180> difficult<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.960> pass

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
squeeze and it's very difficult to pass

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.179 
squeeze and it's very difficult to pass
prices<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.250> price<00:01:02.520> rises<00:01:02.820> onto<00:01:03.539> customers

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
prices the price rises onto customers

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
prices the price rises onto customers
but<00:01:05.390> with<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> judicious<00:01:07.970> attempt<00:01:09.000> small

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
but with the judicious attempt small

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
but with the judicious attempt small
price<00:01:10.290> rises<00:01:10.920> will<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.400> accepted<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.210> you're

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
price rises will be accepted and you're

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
price rises will be accepted and you're
just<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.409> marketing<00:01:13.950> good

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
just going to have good marketing good

just going to have good marketing good
standards<00:01:14.820> what's<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> biggest<00:01:16.320> danger<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
standards what's the biggest danger do

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
standards what's the biggest danger do
you<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> pub<00:01:17.640> industry<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.750> now

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you think to the pub industry right now

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.399 
you think to the pub industry right now
in<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> UK<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> supermarket<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
in the UK is it is it supermarket I

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.429 
in the UK is it is it supermarket I
think<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.619> biggest<00:01:22.860> danger<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:25.110> tax

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
think the biggest danger is the tax

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.270 
think the biggest danger is the tax
system<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.729> pubs<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.540> been<00:01:27.750> used<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.650> milk

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
system it pubs have been used as milk

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
system it pubs have been used as milk
cows<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.360> years<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.900> produce<00:01:31.049> income

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
cows over the years to produce income

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.880 
cows over the years to produce income
from<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> government<00:01:32.689> we're<00:01:33.689> paying<00:01:34.049> over<00:01:34.439> 40

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
from the government we're paying over 40

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.030 
from the government we're paying over 40
percent<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.430> our<00:01:35.520> sales<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.750> tax<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.740> type

percent of our sales as tax of one type

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 
percent of our sales as tax of one type
or<00:01:38.280> another<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:39.150> far<00:01:39.570> lower<00:01:39.990> for

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
or another it's far lower for

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.889 
or another it's far lower for
supermarkets<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:42.210> think<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
supermarkets I don't think that's a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
supermarkets I don't think that's a
sustainable<00:01:43.399> proposition<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.060> country

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
sustainable proposition if the country

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.109 
sustainable proposition if the country
want<00:01:45.750> wants<00:01:46.259> pubs<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> job<00:01:47.220> created<00:01:47.909> by

want wants pubs and the job created by
them<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.020> created<00:01:49.770> nearly<00:01:50.009> 3,000<00:01:50.909> jobs<00:01:51.149> in

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
them and we created nearly 3,000 jobs in

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
them and we created nearly 3,000 jobs in
the<00:01:51.450> last<00:01:51.600> year<00:01:52.020> alone<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.640> go

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the last year alone I don't think can go

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.410 
the last year alone I don't think can go
on<00:01:54.030> sticking<00:01:54.990> out<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> taxes<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:55.979> pubs<00:01:56.420> it's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
on sticking out the taxes on pubs it's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.780 
on sticking out the taxes on pubs it's
interesting<00:01:57.689> about<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.380> you've<00:01:58.680> been

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
interesting about how you've been

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.490 
interesting about how you've been
expanding<00:01:59.790> pretty<00:02:00.060> relentless<00:02:00.500> expansion

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
expanding pretty relentless expansion

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160 
expanding pretty relentless expansion
over<00:02:01.680> quite<00:02:02.549> some<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> did<00:02:03.990> have

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
over quite some time and you did have

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020
