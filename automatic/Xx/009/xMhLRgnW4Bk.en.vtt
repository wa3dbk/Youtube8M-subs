sketches<00:01:59.100> from<00:02:00.100> there's<00:02:00.370> my<00:02:00.580> sketches<00:02:01.210> I

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
sketches from there's my sketches I

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.690 
sketches from there's my sketches I
would<00:02:01.570> pick<00:02:01.780> three<00:02:02.140> final<00:02:02.560> pieces<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.280> from

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
would pick three final pieces and from

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.610 
would pick three final pieces and from
those<00:02:03.910> three<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.240> would<00:02:04.480> evaporate<00:02:04.810> them<00:02:05.230> until

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
those three I would evaporate them until

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.530 
those three I would evaporate them until
there's<00:02:05.890> one<00:02:06.190> which<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.610> yes<00:02:06.910> that's<00:02:07.300> the

there's one which is yes that's the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.720 
there's one which is yes that's the
final<00:02:07.990> piece<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.560> then<00:02:08.649> from<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.070> piece<00:02:09.369> I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
final piece and then from that piece I

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.930 
final piece and then from that piece I
would<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.990> proper<00:02:11.440> I'm<00:02:12.070> detailed<00:02:12.550> hand

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
would to the proper I'm detailed hand
