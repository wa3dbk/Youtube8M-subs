00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.069
 bright was placed on the vertical of Valladolid 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.449

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.630
 del pisuerga the father Antonio happy was riding his telescope 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.909
 very soon he had little ado it was a monumental tetra ethyl object 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.640
 more than three hundred thousand people could witness the spectacular 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.820
 phenomenon during the four hours there is that the object remained static 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 on the skies of the city of Valladolid 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.930
 the same antonio happy recently deceased and one of the pioneers of the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.780
 Otri research in Spain could not photograph 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.260
 here would be the first of a long series of makro UFO sightings 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.090
 that had in our country a critical moment between June of 1967 and December 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.550
 of 1968 so much so that the military authorities saw themselves 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 obliged to classify as files of confidentiality the files or 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.800
 because meanwhile in the united states the blue book project will continue 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.040
 collecting hundreds of UFO cases across the country 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.380
 there was a time when the authorities were so concerned that 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.080
 they had no choice but to settle the issue 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 the operation began with the October 1966 research office of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.190
 the air force grants a scholarship the bullfighters with where the university of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.910
 Colorado 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 to study those incomprehensible testimonies 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.680
 the scholarship is endowed with 313 thousand dollars of those of then 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.420
 the objective that was proposed to the condom doctor was to determine those thousands 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.080
 of incidents had a scientific basis or not 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.440
 the team of the colorado university studied 99 records made by 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.840
 the military about so many other fortuitous cases 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.010
 the 67 of them find a satisfactory explanation while 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.360
 in almost one in three they were unable to do so 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.420
 the results speak for themselves 30% of the UFO cases lacked 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.150
 conventional justification 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.500
 about this data would have been more than enough for the doctor's team 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.820
 condom encourage the air forces to continue unraveling the mystery 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.990
 privacy that was not so and the scientist in the conclusions of his report did 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.099
 statements that irritated many and reassured a few 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.199
 According to the condom, after analyzing the UFO evidence, the official position 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.749
 be the following are textual words 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.719
 there is nothing about it I feel obliged to recommend to the government 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.769
 leave this matter because the 21st century will die laughing when it is a 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.040
 look at the things we've done and this can be one of them 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.489
 joint 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.030
 nevertheless the reality will be another very different one when according to it was known 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.440
 received the order to sign the aforementioned conclusions reasons 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.519
 the US military wanted to silence everything related to the UFO issue 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.719
 ditch the blue book because of the enormous repercussion that the subject was having 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.019
 Public opinion 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.129
 but the usaf ignored it and continued studying leanizbarrutia
