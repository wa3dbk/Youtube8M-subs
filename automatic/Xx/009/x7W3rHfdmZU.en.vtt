00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.940
 begins today another picture of the newspaper of the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 car that is teamwork where 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.890
 two or more members of our 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
 writing with make a car evaluation 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 with comments talking about the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.670
 performance design and everything about 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.340
 a model today the car chosen is the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.019
 Bravo t jet and we're going for a ride. 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.989
 with him now to show you how 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:39.059
 It's because it's the year then it was already here. 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.590
 inside the brave t-jet will start to 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.090
 speak then from the inside 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.070
 the first impression we have 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 got in the car with this opinion to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.129
 respect of him that you think 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:57.210
 finish and internal design of that car 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:58.230
 had just gotten this life you need to give 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.570
 an improved 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.559
 It is not always that we have won a screen 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.010
 multimedia and does not become one until today 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.710
 herself even more because brawn radio 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.229
 such a million of an old system was 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.500
 well finished assembled there is material evidence 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.020
 are cool as a fiber 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.540
 now that the panel is right and I like this 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.159
 set all black with details in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.979
 red button on the button here or on the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.159
 Russia on the bench that gives that sensation 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.409
 of sportiness ets interior all black 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.810
 including here on the ceiling thing that cars 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.630
 more expensive sports type audi by 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 example is this is a care that should 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.509
 please the consumer when choosing 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
 a car for as long as we know that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.880
 it is not a sporty Christmas version 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.649
 a bit more spicy a brave 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.079
 I think the consumer who buys it 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.619
 You know that, but wait anyway. 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.619
 something to that effect 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.280
 the engine 1.4 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.900
 152 horses 152 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 this is what i have heard crackers and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.150
 six-speed manual transmission that is well 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.970
 cool because every day more rare a 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.860
 sports a car sports fun 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.980
 really has a manual gearbox is a 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.810
 thing that 200 artists like 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.380
 enough this engine is not the apex 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.870
 of creativity is not a 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.090
 that we have in terms of 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.120
 CGI engine motor interpress 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.250
 but it serves well in the proposal 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.040
 She showed very young, she already has a 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.230
 development certain old way 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.850
 because we come in terms of engines 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.580
 but he behaves very well. 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.220
 has right touch down in 2000 and few 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.110
 engineers reaches the 2,500 river already 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.130
 maximum torque is a behavior 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 cool 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.910
 the truth is going to get digital clothes 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.770
 he goes there just to mention that the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.600
 We continue with the speed limit is 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.340
 a thing that bothers a little about 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.780
 this engine is that it has a hole 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.230
 torque and then the doctor is small and the turbo 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.209
 he does not quickly enter the house of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.580
 1500 1080p 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.100
 it has a ranking that bothers you but has 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.660
 car dies if you do not step on the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.500
 time to start up , especially in the 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.450
 wood 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.950
 he has put is seeking egg is here in 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.739
 panel a button with a red line 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.890
 written well see bené an acronym that he 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.590
 increases the torque of the car during a 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.150
 small period it does not affect the power 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.720
 which is very interesting it happens remains 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.459
 equal 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.260
 that is exactly when you 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.269
 want a stronger team when you want 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.000
 the carriage is a little think 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.430
 he has even more sportsmanship 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.159
 drawing 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.930
 It is cool this is the proposal of you 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.219
 have more toxin only when you need it 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.810
 one with request 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.299
 brave drawing is not a new car 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.519
 also for a long time on the road 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.859
 but I still really like drawing 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.049
 his because he has he does not have both 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.469
 wine with so he has a more 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.739
 rounded and I think this does not make 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.900
 with which he quickly loses that hour 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.250
 of novelty is what he has to think 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.280
 who agree on the order 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.099
 the educator you like to name more names 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.470
 could be a little shorter and fight 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.870
 there is no more action 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060
 He says a little but I got this. 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.370
 thing is more here in the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.949
 handy 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.810
 still in this part of mechanics and 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.940
 I quite like the sportiness 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.970
 I also think that she 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.160
 has an interesting balance between a 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.630
 cliché I 'm going to talk but between comfort 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.340
 and sportsmanship 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.620
 I wish he had a hit 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.389
 more or less than the album 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.160
 the jet is because you are a boy 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.300
 when you have a child who does not 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.970
 me and you will see that the boy 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.220
 swinging back with dandruff is not 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.810
 cool 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.240
 so for now I'll keep the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.370
 pilot then it's ok then I continue 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.020
 with brave and beautiful beauty and there is more 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.849
 something of the car a highlight that 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.889
 you want to talk I quite like 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.960
 tomorrow against the panel placed his 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.289
 This design was written by father. 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.599
 Nice to see the contract but they leave 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.870
 up the monsoons in the bathroom that 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.699
 It's close to the feeling he actually 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.979
 Look, the measure has room above the 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.229
 Portuguese is a good travel passenger 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.349
 comfortable here who have already approved a 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.810
 comfort and price behind which lies the 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.130
 so price premium is that there begins 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.349
 complicate why we like 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.060
 performance like style will like 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.370
 several things in the car but in the 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.940
 buy it 80 thousand initials 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.540
 then it starts to get heavy 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.130
 Yes the car is quite complete but the 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.320
 People know that if we put 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.380
 all the options that would let him 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.360
 completaço really like everything that 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.440
 fiat offers it reaches almost 90 thousand 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.300
 real right 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.410
 a little further back if I am not mistaken is 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.930
 one is quite salty this value but even 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.970
 initial ceiling price 80 thousand in the average hatch 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.790
 It's complicated, right? 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.430
 could not because there are other governments 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.520
 or other defendants they do not understand 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.550
 this aura sportsmanship but without a 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.540
 good sports concept to normal for the 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.910
 more affordable price or a good 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.680
 number of security items 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.540
 equipment at sea such as golf 1.4 per 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.120
 example that is good is a modern car 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.430
 and it 's more or less at this price a 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.220
 bit down in fact but look at the 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.950
 even let's go, people have to 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.110
 and it's exactly there and also 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.640
 traffic in the car is not 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.430
 We are part of the transit people. 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.050
 being brought in at this point then it is 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.050
 What have you got today, Carol Josh? 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.860
 is the next so just work on 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.419
 Today's team thanks guys 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.419
 forget the car
