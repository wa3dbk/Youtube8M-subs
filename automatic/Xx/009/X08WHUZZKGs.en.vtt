00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
card to shoot in raw but it's also a lot

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.749 
card to shoot in raw but it's also a lot
better<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.350> lot<00:01:49.409> more<00:01:50.039> post-processing

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
better a lot more post-processing

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
better a lot more post-processing
customization<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.439> that's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
customization that you can do and that's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
customization that you can do and that's
why<00:01:52.920> pros<00:01:53.189> love<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.609> shoot<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.000> raw<00:01:54.240> because

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
why pros love to shoot with raw because

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.319 
why pros love to shoot with raw because
they<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.840> extra<00:01:55.170> control<00:01:55.649> always<00:01:56.329> okay

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
they have that extra control always okay

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
they have that extra control always okay
so<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.659> brings<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.439> point<00:01:58.679> that<00:01:58.799> we're

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so that brings up the point that we're

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440 
so that brings up the point that we're
going<00:01:59.039> to<00:01:59.130> need<00:01:59.249> more<00:01:59.429> capacity<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.390> do

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
going to need more capacity so what do

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
going to need more capacity so what do
you<00:02:00.539> recommend<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you recommend there you have to have a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.550 
you recommend there you have to have a
card<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:02.999> store<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> lot<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.049> files

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
card that can store a lot of files

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.219 
card that can store a lot of files
whether<00:02:05.009> you're<00:02:05.249> shooting<00:02:05.609> raw<00:02:05.789> or<00:02:06.060> jpeg<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
whether you're shooting raw or jpeg the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.440 
whether you're shooting raw or jpeg the
sandisk<00:02:07.710> extreme<00:02:07.859> not<00:02:08.519> only<00:02:08.789> does<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> right

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
sandisk extreme not only does it right

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.960 
sandisk extreme not only does it right
fast<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.200> isn't<00:02:10.440> reliable<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.819> get

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
fast and isn't reliable but you can get

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.590 
fast and isn't reliable but you can get
some<00:02:12.180> big

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
some big

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.150 
some big
gigabyte<00:02:12.930> cards<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:13.560> you're<00:02:13.710> not<00:02:13.800> constantly

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
gigabyte cards so you're not constantly

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.580 
gigabyte cards so you're not constantly
switching<00:02:14.970> out<00:02:15.210> all<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:15.510> cards<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.050> got<00:02:16.380> it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
switching out all your cards you got it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.190 
switching out all your cards you got it
now<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:17.040> about<00:02:17.100> formatting<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.820> card

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
now what about formatting that card

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.960 
now what about formatting that card
formatting<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.590> important<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.760> keith

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
formatting is really important the keith

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.990 
formatting is really important the keith
is<00:02:21.410> sometimes<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:22.890> take<00:02:23.550> your<00:02:23.670> pictures

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
is sometimes you can take your pictures

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.160 
is sometimes you can take your pictures
and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.540> put<00:02:24.720> them<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.900> your<00:02:25.020> computer

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and then you put them on your computer

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.440 
and then you put them on your computer
and<00:02:25.650> then<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.280> want<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.610> delete<00:02:27.000> them<00:02:27.300> all

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
and then you want to delete them all

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.990 
and then you want to delete them all
instead<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.320> saying<00:02:28.590> delete<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.790> should

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
instead of saying delete all you should

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.060 
instead of saying delete all you should
go<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.600> format<00:02:31.050> your<00:02:31.140> card<00:02:31.440> because<00:02:31.830> that

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
go in and format your card because that

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.800 
go in and format your card because that
guarantees<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.640> your<00:02:32.940> card<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.330> wiped<00:02:33.630> clean

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
guarantees that your card is wiped clean

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.560 
guarantees that your card is wiped clean
ready<00:02:34.740> for<00:02:34.950> new<00:02:35.100> images<00:02:35.580> don't<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.390> worry

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
ready for new images don't have to worry

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.020 
ready for new images don't have to worry
about<00:02:36.690> structural<00:02:37.440> things<00:02:37.800> going<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:38.310> you'll

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
about structural things going on you'll

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.060 
about structural things going on you'll
avoid<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.570> lot<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.870> missing<00:02:40.470> image<00:02:40.830> or

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
avoid a lot of missing image or

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.790 
avoid a lot of missing image or
corrupted<00:02:41.670> image<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.210> might<00:02:42.330> happen<00:02:42.800> okay

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
corrupted image that might happen okay

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.530 
corrupted image that might happen okay
now<00:02:43.950> there's<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.190> lot<00:02:44.370> more<00:02:44.400> manual<00:02:45.000> controls

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
