00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.790
 and that's everyone knows the little ones 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.140
 24 for the sixty-fifth episode of 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.840
 the bvk rohff in which we see one 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.580
 secret passage in a tree so good 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.990
 match and that tree in the lab that 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.670
 does a little bit suspect is an art 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.560
 in the lab especially that there is some brawl 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.110
 give a little bit everywhere a good shot 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.340
 it's not the best example in the world 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.740
 I could have done horn here I 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.539
 wanted to put the system inside 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.550
 so it's better when it's more 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.500
 natural but well here it is in the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.880
 lab I can not do better in order to 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.890
 make a big build of two 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.780
 hours all that helps me no weapons month 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.550
 the system how he worked well everything 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.470
 simply you just have to ask a 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.239
 redstone torch you pass you 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.309
 are in your secret passage of course 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.420
 it can be accessed to initiate you not 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.850
 did not build my you from you 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.670
 do your little other room that's getting 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.399
 created here and to come out it's enough 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.780
 to do the same and here it was 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.620
 not a revolution at the level of 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.590
 redstone systems 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.869
 but I think the lead and the idea of 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.820
 the tree is quite interesting then 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.979
 I had already seen this idea on others 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.140
 English-speaking channels but I wanted 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.940
 do my little system I did in 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.010
 kind of contact the maximum and I 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.260
 I have not seen more compact and that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.840
 so suddenly I offer you it's gone 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.210
 you make a kind of rectangle a 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.549
 kind of rectangle with two hens of 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.140
 redstone on each side then of the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.229
 comparators who are going to do some sort of 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.080
 nice clubs ok then we'll create them 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.150
 the pistons that finally take care not to create 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.210
 rather place the pistons that deals 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.509
 from the door flat to a point towards a 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.570
 block with a powder is stone and 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:48.460
 then between 1 and 1.1 block then you 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.280
 go put 2 pistons right in front 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.049
 like those here and there we make the door 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.990
 so suddenly there you go to put the 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.759
 wood the pot of the tree you did 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.689
 logic 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.710
 ok then we will take care of doing 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.340
 feeding so well the torch that 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.190
 will be here who will feed this piston 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.110
 with finally who will feed this piston 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.569
 who will then feed the loop through 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.200
 at this block of redstone 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 then you have to know that you will have to 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.390
 go out so suddenly master so 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.739
 we will do exactly the same thing at 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.299
 piston is a block and it's nickel on 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.220
 remove it because this time it does not 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.709
 served then what is important to 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.230
 know it's not this piston that will go 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.150
 active and finally reopen the door that's 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.459
 that other track or actually but of 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.239
 shot he'll have to go get it 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.299
 with two redstone hens one block is 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.769
 a blog that contains a torch and 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.110
 blow activate this one so wait 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.849
 we have to put this little block back because 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.900
 So it's time that's it's a 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.150
 little bug of minecraft 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.170
 so who's finally who had us 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.670
 allowed to make a system 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.959
 who were there at the very bottom it was 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.709
 the pg 5 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:05.870
 it was huge what he did 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:10.049
 replay that structure 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.060
 here and is it working one nickel 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.319
 can pass quietly and surely 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.420
 is now up to you to do 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 your little shelter 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.769
 ok well listen 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.639
 on that we meet again 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.959
 today he had not and not I 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.829
 you repeat it because he has the bac who 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.230
 inhale bac 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.400
 finally there is Saturday but suddenly they 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.530
 call the time to turn drying 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.260
 month we could be there on Saturday 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.329
 morning we will make you your little 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.329
 structure 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.329
 okay 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.239
 go hello to all do not hesitate to 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.239
 put a little green thumbs
