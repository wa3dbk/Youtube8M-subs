 control for oily skin system for 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.410
 sensitive skin in this case we will use 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.660
 the system for mixed skin since as 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.480
 we can observe our customer account 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.580
 with a skin with these characteristics 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.470
 as we can see it has more brilliance in what 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.840
 which is front in nose and chin what 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.240
 is the t zone and the cheek areas 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.130
 they are drier 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.680
 before starting to do a cleaning 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.299
 facial do not forget to disinfect your hands 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.950
 with the antibacterial gel 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.950
 silvÃ¡n step 1 clean we begin 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.590
 let's apply the facial cleansing gel 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.320
 balancing there are two ways of doing it 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.630
 one of them is to apply the product in 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.289
 the five points of the face that are 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.060
 front nose cheeks and chin or else I 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.850
 I have a technique that I think you can 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.730
 work true on the product in the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.890
 yolk of his hands 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.920
 with the hands previously moistened in 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.310
 water is spread throughout the palm 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 from the hands we will apply the facial gel 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.869
 from the neck 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.310
 we climb to chin lips nose cheeks and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.990
 front 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.170
 and we started making movements 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.599
 circulate all over the face until 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.260
 the product is completely 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.720
 distributed by him 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.000
 once it is already applied we are going to 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.879
 remove it with cotton wool moistened in 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.939
 water we also start from this 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.939
 neck as upward movements 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.150

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.819
 superior lip 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.560
 nose cheeks 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.590
 and front 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.680
 we flip the cottons as you can see 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.750
 all the cosmetic was removed 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.750
 and we finish cleaning 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.210
 nose cheeks upper lip 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.380
 chin 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.430
 and which 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.010
 Step 2 refresh and tone now 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.130
 we will apply the refreshing facial injury 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.060
 Balancing this will be applied on two 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.060
 cottons 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.870
 We apply enough product to 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.940
 moisten the cottons quite well 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.180
 and we will repeat the same movements 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.180
 from the neck up 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.819
 cheeks 20 and we went down 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.709
 side this lotion besides finishing 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.319
 of removing waste makeup 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.870
 It will also hydrate and tone the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.580
 skin maintaining its balance between fat 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.250
 and water step 3 hydrate we will use the 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.420
 moisturizing facial moisturizing lotion 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.180
 with sun protection factor of 15 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.330

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.270
 apply on the nose nose cheeks and 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.340
 chin the product or this technique 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.989
 that I like very much that is to pour the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.989
 product on the tips of your fingers 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.030
 spread it lightly and now if 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.030
 We will start working from the front 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.110
 in the form of prayer and we extend the 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.110
 neck 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.830
 cheeks nose and forehead 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 we went down outside and now 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.680
 we will begin to do the massages of 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.220
 absorption in this case we will do some 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.220
 dictatorships 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.990
 to distribute the product 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:48.380
 later we will do this click 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.380
 will help activate 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.550
 and suckers 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.550
 with the latter will be absorbed 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.929
 besides that it will give a great rest to 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.929
 your client 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.849
 as part of hydration and 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.650
 we will treat the eye contour with 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.399
 our new capsules with royal jelly 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.350
 do not miss them, let's apply the capsule 

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:21.590
 on the fingertip 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.590
 and then in the contours 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.230
 lower and higher we distribute 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:31.710
 perfectly well the product until 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:35.010
 be around the contour and now 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.700
 we will make absorption movements and 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.700
 activation 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.370
 These are absorption 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.360
 these are activation 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.720
 and these are of completion that 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.120
 they call cupping 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.620
 apart from that the contour rests a lot 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.040
 of eyes doing this kind of 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.500
 movements 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.020
 something that we can not ignore 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.090
 is the additional protection to the lotion 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.810
 hydrating day with the factor of 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.640
 sunscreen of 40 the same will be of 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.010
 night only that changing the injury 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.050
 Facial balancing day by cream 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.170
 facial balancing at night and omitting 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.410
 the sunblock as you could see is 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.330
 very simple are three steps twice to 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.720

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.720
 with you
