there's<00:01:02.730> straight<00:01:03.270> ones<00:01:06.170> there's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> big<00:01:07.380> one

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
there's straight ones there's a big one

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.650 
there's straight ones there's a big one
so<00:01:08.369> what's<00:01:08.580> happened<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.060> during<00:01:09.450> running

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
so what's happened is during running

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.530 
so what's happened is during running
something's<00:01:10.140> dropped<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:11.150> just<00:01:12.150> jammed

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
something's dropped in there just jammed

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.370 
something's dropped in there just jammed
the<00:01:12.690> motor<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.150> motor<00:01:15.420> i<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:15.990> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the motor up so this motor i think is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.030 
the motor up so this motor i think is
definitely<00:01:16.979> toast<00:01:18.740> considering<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.860> not

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
definitely toast considering it's not

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.770 
definitely toast considering it's not
worth<00:01:20.220> much<00:01:20.550> it's<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:20.940> really<00:01:21.270> worth<00:01:21.450> trying

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
worth much it's not really worth trying

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.370 
worth much it's not really worth trying
