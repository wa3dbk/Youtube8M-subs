00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so much the case on what for for example

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.540 
so much the case on what for for example
the<00:02:33.600> song<00:02:33.750> empty-nesters<00:02:34.650> which<00:02:34.830> has<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> jam

the song empty-nesters which has a jam

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.360 
the song empty-nesters which has a jam
in<00:02:35.790> its<00:02:36.240> runtime<00:02:36.720> or<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.530> track<00:02:37.770> run<00:02:38.040> baby<00:02:38.250> run

tender<00:02:41.640> ballad<00:02:42.510> also<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.710> vocals

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
tender ballad also I think the vocals

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.280 
tender ballad also I think the vocals
are<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> step<00:02:44.460> up<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.150> album<00:02:45.330> Chaz<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.110> not

amazing<00:04:52.409> singer<00:04:52.949> but<00:04:53.129> he<00:04:53.520> does<00:04:53.759> seem<00:04:54.029> to<00:04:54.150> be

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
amazing singer but he does seem to be

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.209 
amazing singer but he does seem to be
putting<00:04:54.539> in<00:04:54.840> more<00:04:55.080> effort<00:04:55.139> with<00:04:55.770> putting<00:04:56.069> the
