00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
would necessarily say that I could think

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
would necessarily say that I could think

but<00:00:35.670> let's<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.090> about<00:00:36.269> this<00:00:36.629> he's<00:00:37.620> actually

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
but let's think about this he's actually

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
but let's think about this he's actually
prescribed<00:00:38.820> volunteering<00:00:39.690> his<00:00:39.780> treatments

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

depression<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.049> wish<00:00:46.470> would<00:00:46.589> be<00:00:46.739> good<00:00:46.890> for

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
depression I wish would be good for

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.090 
depression I wish would be good for
chronic<00:00:47.519> hair<00:00:47.909> loss<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.720> if<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.650> think

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
chronic hair loss but if just we think

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
chronic hair loss but if just we think
about<00:00:50.370> why<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.670> might<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.239> true<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.799> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
about why this might be true I think it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.340 
about why this might be true I think it
makes<00:00:53.040> sense<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:54.089> a<00:00:54.150> personal<00:00:54.449> basis<00:00:55.080> years

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
