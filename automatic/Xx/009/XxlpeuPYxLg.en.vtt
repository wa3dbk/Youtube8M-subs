00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.279
 hi to all youtube friends that the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.610
 your black and speak to you today I am 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.990
 forced to do the ozein tec profile 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.489
 down with the cell phone since I can't 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.059
 more to find the webcam 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:41.110
 so nothing this here on the list that 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.870
 I played at the regional coast end 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.699
 I did not post a week in the morning 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.860
 I have not in fact qualified the 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.970
 mat you see here I did n't win 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.970
 but I bought it immediately after the tournament 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.589
 anyway, I don't give it because I like it 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.949
 really too much 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.909
 however the but the deck is 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:09.040
 changed a lot compared to the last one 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 eve brought it right away then we have 9 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:24.640
 cama staple then wg double spark s s 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.219
 after this tournament I think I 'll take them off 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.929
 because they didn't serve me relatively 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:34.200
 more than that after born in share 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.280
 nothing these that were really big 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.159
 I also think of increasing them to three or 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.140
 to play the text shoji part i would like e 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:47.560
 slim the bat 40 since I have it 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:51.810
 played at 41 then triple pod is certain 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:57.520
 another secret, however, triple typhoon 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.649
 triple tanky a feature of the geckos e 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.030
 snatches that are practically the cards 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:07.479
 ban goals even if they are not 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.990
 technically in the bathroom then I have 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.990
 triple mirror force triple row indexes 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.670
 nothing to say triple forward that knows me 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.100
 right between will have to touch the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.560
 next double mind and crashes coming out 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.300
 me the card of the very strong goal against 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.290
 all at levels of almost confiscation and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.530
 less then a really strong 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.930
 torrential tribute a warning 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:47.740
 solemn is the former three boys a macrocosm 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:52.130
 includes double ultimate lightning cd 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.080
 no coffee, stronger castel than 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.240
 What can I say 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.600
 put one down when entering a 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.890
 hitch detaching one is nothing to say 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.990
 then the tigers hole that dropped into one 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.490
 match against clifford but right for the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.790
 defense as much the voice lost in 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:16.610
 non-steel departure double cowboy 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.790
 a box crisis that against skilled rain 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.750
 it didn't help me just because he had it 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.930
 tolta is easy soft heart dragon 103 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:32.090
 engorgement 101 exitu un caos the rocks of 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.190
 dual fuel side suits 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.370
 I played double maxi double frank yes 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.400
 a double king share and dried tender 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.620
 double double shadow without magic 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.190
 double iron wall and double mistake 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:54.200
 then exchange reports I have not traded 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.720
 a lot however for briona I gave briona 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.260
 that I took these two cards more 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.920
 money I took a canape 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.320
 last mint beautiful for so long 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.720
 I was also looking for because there is half a mind 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.489
 for the montarmi my earing meta e 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.010
 then a dead last teda turbo pack 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.479
 really really too sexy too 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.479
 nice of course not 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.770
 so moving on to match reports 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.540
 first round berco neqrouz of a child 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.040
 I win easy 20 so this deck is 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.260
 I had prepared especially against 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.050
 the ajax even though there were three out of 34 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.230
 people where prevalence and anger e 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.420
 which was also a bit predictable 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.750
 since almost all have net de 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.300
 cated with the second cese of prague 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.240
 round berco hero of one of my team mates 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.540
 I win 2 to the first of peach tanky a 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.480
 top I do a cast el conca but a 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.220
 bounce his dragon rco del vuoto or 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.590
 dark I don't remember exactly 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.620
 what it was then with castles of mischio 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:11.900
 cassel and remained 1900 and I beat them 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:16.820
 Direct won the third clifford beak 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:20.750
 of clifford is certainly fine because skilled 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.070
 rain is a cancer of this tech and if not 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:29.450
 see typhoon practically useless to stay 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.250
 there to play then fourth I lose against the 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.910
 burning saw two teammates 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.980
 I have to be honest I'm glad that 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.080
 he won because he was the only one 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.120
 of him to qualify by doing eighth 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.380
 place 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.150
 but I also heard a bit about it 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.340
 fuck because this deck had it 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.940
 prepared mainly against burning 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:56.420
 abyss neqrouz shuttle on the fifth 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.390
 I win against shuttle has nothing to say 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.780
 you just need to have seen the main deck for 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.400
 understand against triggered but certainly not anymore 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.770
 that positive 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.410
 the sixth back hell and initially 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.020
 I was afraid though thanks to the side and a 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.430
 bit of ass I can overturn 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:18.500
 practically a game lost with 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:21.560
 vanity then they arrive 1 I do 42 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.150
 unfortunately I had the tie break a little low 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.660
 therefore not 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.550
 I managed to get in the top eight 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.920
 nothing so what else can I say 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.780
 this was report of the region of 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.440
 matter plus the de crisis of yo sangiu 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:39.730
 next week I hope to go to 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:44.040
 regional manduria but I really think 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:48.730
 no for school and other commitments 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.260
 reasons and no boys so this 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.090
 video recorded brutally with a 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.090
 mobile from everything I hope to receive 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:59.080
 immediately the sky to find again the 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:01.780
 webcam otherwise I'll have to buy you a 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.340
 another time I digress later so 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.610
 he retires all to the next hello a 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.610
 all
