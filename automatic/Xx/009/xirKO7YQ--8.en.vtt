use him and I've had him in my mind too

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.670 
use him and I've had him in my mind too
because<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.180> perimeter<00:03:39.810> defense<00:03:40.530> that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
because of that perimeter defense that

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.949 
because of that perimeter defense that
he<00:03:40.830> plays<00:03:41.100> along<00:03:41.820> with<00:03:41.970> his<00:03:42.120> athleticism<00:03:42.660> and

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959

his outside shot I really think he's

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.520
