the<00:02:03.119> mate<00:02:03.680> what<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.860> will<00:02:05.070> truly<00:02:05.280> cool<00:02:05.610> about

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the mate what they will truly cool about

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.059 
the mate what they will truly cool about
the<00:02:06.210> battle<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.320> fish<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the battle with the fish is the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.449 
the battle with the fish is the
controller<00:02:08.520> sort<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.119> vibrates<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:11.009> guess

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
controller sort of vibrates so I guess

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.670 
controller sort of vibrates so I guess
it<00:02:11.970> feels<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> fish<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.500> know

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it feels like a fish is on I don't know

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.430 
it feels like a fish is on I don't know
I've<00:02:13.800> never<00:02:13.830> really<00:02:14.310> gone<00:02:14.430> fishing<00:02:14.970> before

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
I've never really gone fishing before

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.320 
I've never really gone fishing before
but<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.099> think<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.760> doing<00:02:17.790> so

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
but you would think that in doing so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.449 
but you would think that in doing so
there<00:02:18.930> would<00:02:19.019> be<00:02:19.050> some<00:02:19.280> vibration<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.430> your

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
there would be some vibration in your

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.970 
there would be some vibration in your
control<00:02:21.060> I'm<00:02:21.690> definitely<00:02:21.989> having<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.769> right

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
control I'm definitely having that right

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.520 
control I'm definitely having that right
now<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:23.880> zabbix<00:02:24.360> Beck's<00:02:24.780> fishing<00:02:25.290> rock

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
now with my zabbix Beck's fishing rock

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.220 
now with my zabbix Beck's fishing rock
and<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> reel<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.209> which<00:02:27.450> which<00:02:27.870> works

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
and then you reel in which which works

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
and then you reel in which which works
it<00:02:28.530> feels<00:02:28.769> good<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.519> they<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.819> line<00:02:30.060> tension

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
it feels good and they have line tension

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.300 
it feels good and they have line tension
on<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> top<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.380> what<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.860> want<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.100> keep
