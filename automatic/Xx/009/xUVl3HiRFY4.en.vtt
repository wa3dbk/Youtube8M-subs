well on that scenario Bob would have a
much<00:01:16.380> longer<00:01:16.590> shelf<00:01:17.009> life<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> his<00:01:17.700> PC

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
much longer shelf life out of his PC

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.640 
much longer shelf life out of his PC
than<00:01:18.360> George<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.960> let's<00:01:19.140> say<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
than George but let's say you have the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
than George but let's say you have the
same<00:01:19.860> mindset<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> George<00:01:20.850> has<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.330> I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
same mindset that George has what I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
same mindset that George has what I
recommend<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> buy<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> gtx<00:01:22.860> 980ti<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
recommend you to buy a gtx 980ti or a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.280 
recommend you to buy a gtx 980ti or a
graphics<00:01:24.240> card<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.110> have

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
graphics card like that so you can have

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.770 
graphics card like that so you can have
a<00:01:25.439> much<00:01:25.710> longer<00:01:25.920> lifespan<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.000> PC<00:01:27.390> no

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
a much longer lifespan out of your PC no

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.390 
a much longer lifespan out of your PC no
I<00:01:27.810> wouldn't<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> beauty

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I wouldn't at all because the beauty

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
I wouldn't at all because the beauty
about<00:01:29.490> PC<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.479> upgrade<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
about PC is that you can upgrade it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.789 
about PC is that you can upgrade it
whenever<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.350> want

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
whenever you want

I<00:01:31.890> would<00:01:32.130> tell<00:01:32.310> George<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> buy<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> GTX<00:01:33.390> 970

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I would tell George to buy the GTX 970

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
I would tell George to buy the GTX 970
now<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.470> eighteen<00:01:34.829> months<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.189> two<00:01:35.369> years

now and in eighteen months or two years

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.399 
now and in eighteen months or two years
down<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.909> line<00:01:36.060> he<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.240> sell<00:01:36.630> his<00:01:36.810> 970<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
down the line he can sell his 970 and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.890 
down the line he can sell his 970 and
just<00:01:37.740> buy<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.130> AMD's<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.880> nvidia<00:01:39.450> latest

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
just buy one of AMD's or nvidia latest

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
just buy one of AMD's or nvidia latest
and<00:01:40.049> greatest<00:01:40.259> GPUs<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.280> how<00:01:41.369> you'd<00:01:41.549> be

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and greatest GPUs that's how you'd be

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.520 
and greatest GPUs that's how you'd be
more<00:01:41.850> efficient<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.450> buying<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:42.899> PC<00:01:43.259> part

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
more efficient with buying your PC part

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.170 
more efficient with buying your PC part
but<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> find<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.610> balance

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
but you have to find a balance

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.399 
but you have to find a balance
don't<00:01:45.329> buy<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> graphics<00:01:45.960> card<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
don't buy a graphics card that you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
don't buy a graphics card that you
probably<00:01:46.590> won't<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.009> happy<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.729> six

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
probably won't be happy with in six

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.399 
probably won't be happy with in six
months<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.570> having<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> upgrade<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
months and then having to upgrade it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.780 
months and then having to upgrade it
that<00:01:49.590> quickly<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.549> point

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that quickly because at that point

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
that quickly because at that point
you're<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.210> wasting<00:01:51.570> money<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.320> to

you're just wasting money you have to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
you're just wasting money you have to
find<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> balance<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.369> goes<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.700> more

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
find a balance and this goes for more

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609 
find a balance and this goes for more
