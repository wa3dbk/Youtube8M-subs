00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.140
 understand 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:06.020

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:09.170

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.810

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:26.979
 They will take your target young people are not 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.979
 here the target is now the following 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.770
 done that they can realize that in the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.000
 vision is that you were together with 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.100
 cletus nÃ© 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.119
 only that it is one of the many missions that 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.119
 allows you to 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:02:00.200
 good now you here around the one and see 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.270
 he asks you to follow him, but if 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.580
 you ignore it it simply ignores the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.480
 athlete can get his car from another 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:20.600
 car right now on the map 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:30.560
 This place where the goose is exactly 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:36.470
 look what it 4 stars 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:40.730
 with that however I have seen youtuber finding 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.989
 one way to do it here was not 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.180
 sm secret let was not discovered 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.500
 for me since we already discovered I'm going 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.300
 leave the channel on youtube of the person who 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.050
 discovered I do not remember right now who 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.470
 was 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:59.120
 so come on, you can see that the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.760
 We managed to abandon him . 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 get out of the athlete 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.930
 simply the mission did not fail because 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.299
 generally conservative its allies in the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.590
 mission thus speaks the mission failed 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.220
 abandoned 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.570
 whatever michael frank lester only that 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.880
 if only in this case he does not 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.630
 would set out notes that you drop 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.120
 he 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:31.459
 There you go in good faith the forum 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.470
 with this car, you're trying to find another 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:41.870
 Look, people with a cough, I do not know why. 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:44.890
 I do not know why more people but I ended up 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.890
 getting pennies 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.739
 I think I should have finished this 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.909
 in Kurdish for those who do not know 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:57.780
 queen cast 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:04:06.000
 fortunately a strong focus where 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:07.859
 keita de guerra knows she has fighters is 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.239
 Actually, I'm a military strongman. 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:16.829
 I was confused by a military fort where 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:21.090
 have different planes need 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:25.650
 exactly to steal the 9th penalty shootout and 96th 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.240
 are they going to 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.520
 need the neighborhood can steal things that 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.039
 you can already intervene in this 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.440
 street here you may have noticed here 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.080
 that when you come here 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.849
 man already starts complaining in this case 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.380
 you go is the following you can go by 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.030
 There you can no more but 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.370
 from the failed mission and talk about 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.440
 work killed innocent people for 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.539
 cause the following on this mission 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.930
 Your goal is to take things off in some 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.930
 objects 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.580
 This mission is for you to shoot with a suit. 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.570
 in some other objects and 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.659
 animals 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.990
 out there you're killing humans you 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:16.320
 miss a mission to steal a 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.020
 The truck that went to the track is because it is 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.740
 my other car failed 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.740
 Let's say he got stuck 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.610
 ae 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:33.810
 Then I do not know the little truck. 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.020
 turn the button right here may realize that 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.879
 I invaded the fort 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.740
 nobody noticed I can still destroy 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:46.710
 fence under you want the jet here now 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.400
 The situation here here, I note 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.409
 is a supersonic jet and also some 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.940
 types of airplanes and helicopters eyes 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.940
 can see is that plane right game 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.530
 So it's going to steal a jet. 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:09.840
 war helicopter 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:15.620

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.789
 be careful with him 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.840
 so this is personal for watching 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:42.330
