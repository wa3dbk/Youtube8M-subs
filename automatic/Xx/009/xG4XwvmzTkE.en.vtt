00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.880

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.710
 I bring you the revised unboxing of this 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.149
 accessory that the company has sent us 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.239
 bowls and is a usb port charger or 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.730
 it's going to be a charger but you're not going 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.340
 to need your picture this has 7 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.040
 usb tickets so you can connect your 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.380
 iphone your ipad or ipod touch and your cell phone 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.620
 android so you can connect what 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.240
 you want what is loaded via us that 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.390
 is quite father I think that 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.259
 definitely this is the future of what 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.079
 that awaits us soon since everything 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.790
 what we need or everything we have 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.640
 electronically speaking it is loaded 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.579
 through a usb today and well let's go 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.050
 to see how it works or what it brings 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.560

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.890
 ok load see this is this that moves 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.800
 here we have the first cable connected 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.090
 it looks very good do not get in the camera 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.880
 ready excuse me that little one 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.380
 interruption here this is that my dog 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.480
 is about to get into the shot as 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.060
 I'm here on the floor sitting down well 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.140
 I came to see it comes out here we found this 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.459
 I'm going to disconnect it to go like that 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.560
 descatalogando and we can see that 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.900
 they work correctly here is wind 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.110
 this leaves now the entrance of the next 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.440
 is this one 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.650

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.190
 here we remove it and it is this 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:28.919
 ready now let's put this with 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.919
 cord cited what we put back 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.340
 well here I think the usb cable be that 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.060
 it's wrong because if I saw it half broken but 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:44.020
 It's not loading , it's loading without 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:49.770
 no problem would be the third port 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.800
 usb and now I need the android cell 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.970
 to see that it works correctly to see 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.120

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.930
 let's put it and where is the entrance 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:08.360
 this is the micro usb input that we can 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.360
 see here and ready we 're going to put 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:16.230
 we can see what load lights the bulb 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.090
 without any any problem like 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.490
 I was telling you at the beginning of 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.280
 video this is definitely 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.069
 it's the future you know everything we have 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.710
 currently technologically speaking it 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.800
 charge by means of a usb your cell phone 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.690
 iphone your tablet your ipad all that 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.030

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.900

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.380

 it works but it's going to need to be charged 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.050
 It has more than one week without battery out 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.120
 it needs to load but you can see 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.650
 The ports that work 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.889
 we tried the four ports that I could 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.199
 get for charging work 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.599
