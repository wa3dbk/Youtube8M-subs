00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
past I think anybody if you look at
transitioning<00:00:42.060> and<00:00:42.240> having<00:00:42.570> success<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
transitioning and having success at the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
transitioning and having success at the
next<00:00:43.410> level<00:00:43.560> systems<00:00:44.400> do<00:00:44.550> come<00:00:44.790> into<00:00:45.000> play<00:00:45.150> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
next level systems do come into play and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.210 
next level systems do come into play and
you<00:00:45.480> look<00:00:45.720> at<00:00:45.810> Gus<00:00:45.990> Malzahn<00:00:46.410> he<00:00:46.860> makes<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
you look at Gus Malzahn he makes it

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.710 
you look at Gus Malzahn he makes it
pretty<00:00:47.400> easy<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.940> quarterbacks<00:00:48.450> you're<00:00:48.630> gonna

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720

they<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.460> under<00:00:53.730> him<00:00:53.880> that's<00:00:54.090> true<00:00:54.510> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
they know under him that's true but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.610 
they know under him that's true but
there's<00:00:54.810> no<00:00:54.960> doubt<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> talk<00:00:55.590> about

Gus Malzahn it's a it's a quarterback

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.310 
Gus Malzahn it's a it's a quarterback
friendly<00:01:02.670> offense<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.210> adjust<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.110> whatever

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
friendly offense that adjust to whatever

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
friendly offense that adjust to whatever
he<00:01:04.680> has<00:01:04.860> extremely<00:01:05.400> well<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> number<00:01:06.150> one

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
he has extremely well the number one

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.000 
he has extremely well the number one
thing<00:01:06.360> he<00:01:06.690> has<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.230> him<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:07.620> now<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
thing he has going for him right now and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.640 
thing he has going for him right now and
my<00:01:08.130> estimation<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.850> why<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.690> most<00:01:09.990> jobs<00:01:10.380> come

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
my estimation is why do most jobs come

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
my estimation is why do most jobs come
open<00:01:10.950> because<00:01:11.460> you've<00:01:11.820> lost<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.659> team<00:01:12.930> won

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
open because you've lost this team won

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
open because you've lost this team won

10 games a year ago he has stepped into

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
10 games a year ago he has stepped into
a<00:01:15.330> situation<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.590> quality

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
a situation that's got some quality

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.920 
a situation that's got some quality
players<00:01:17.220> he<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.120> mold<00:01:18.390> his<00:01:18.630> scheme

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
players he can now mold his scheme
