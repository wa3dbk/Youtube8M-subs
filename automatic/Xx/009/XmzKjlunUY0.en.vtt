00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 do something out of your life that's what they do 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.180
 entire productivity gurus of the persuasions 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.099
 say you have to get something out of your life 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.760
 because otherwise is wasted 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.309
 Time 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.929
 Now every minute of his life 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.969
 use productively and you are not allowed to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.850
 just sit around or be lazy 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.260
 or let you go but you have to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.630
 work on me and have to constantly 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.550
 go forward and I mean that is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.099
 total nonsense 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.439
 behind it is the idea that your life 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 in itself has no value and that you 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.040
 first have to make something out of that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 you live as this raw material 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120
 must use and make something out of it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.219
 what should be worth something in the future 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.329
 and I think that's cheese 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.180
 I believe that to be alive in itself 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 the value is okay that's it alive too 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.200
 in itself is worth, there is nothing 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.149
 what else you should get or 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.719
 anything else but to be alive 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.699
 that's what we what's great is that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.859
 great is what you can look forward to 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.920
 why you can be happy 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.199
 just that you exist that is enough 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 so and then you can do something with it 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.920
 but you want to do it because you are 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.180
 you are happy about your life 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 glad that you are here 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 gratitude for this on this planet 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.229
 be just like a kid on the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.390
 Adventure playground so do not sound around 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.680
 to achieve something but just 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.720
 because it's just on the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.880
 Adventure playground is and because it is in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.830
 the situation is up somewhere 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.500
 or just slip into europe 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.540
 just because it can do that and that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.130
 reason why the whole productivity 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.840
 our tools are always something you always have 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 should do and the reason why many 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
 people always have penetrated to do something 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 People are not able to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.960
 Doctor waiting room to sit and nothing 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.200
 but believe you have to do something 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.920
 read or have to think about that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.420
 what plan is that I think so 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.770
 not so much that people really 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.619
 would seriously try nowhere 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 otherwise to get there but only 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.310
 that they run away from themselves 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.290
 that does not mean that your time is not 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.800
 they want to waste their time 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.620
 all the time with facebook with 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.630
 the illustrated read this but 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.030
 they want to run away from themselves 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.240
 They want to run away from the thought 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.010
 they will come if they really want to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.870
 alone while doing nothing 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.220
 that means the thought machines jumps 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.140
 any thoughts come from alone 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.310
 which I asked and therefore long ago 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.200
 you keep getting rid of that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.940
 responsible in this impeller in this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.480
 hamsterrad where you think you have to 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 create something so definitely has 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.630
 the big picture with this whole you 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.970
 you have to do something at all 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.790
 otherwise the great part of the live 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.080
 the right thing about this wheel is that you 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.440
 to make something out of his life 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.990
 It's just that you do not hold back 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.360
 should not that be you 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.490
 like the little child that scares up 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.700
 the adventure playground is and indeed 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.860
 the castle would like to climb high though 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.860
 fear of it is something else 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.960
 Children think or fear him 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.820
 has that it does not know exactly 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.170
 how to climb the climbing wall because 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.310
 it has not read a book about it 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.770
 and so on and so forth 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.209
 that means when someone says to you 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.770
 Do something out of your life then that means 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.080
 not that you have anything from his life 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.970
 it is that it is created out of it 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.650
 that we end up with something 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.300
 Result should be there and be 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.800
 could see what I've done what 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.570
 I have made of my life 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.459
 it does not end up anyway 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.840
 you're dead and you'll be buried as well 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.489
 all those who do not care about their life 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.600
 and your two graves 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.520
 will not be different 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.230
 that's why you do not have to do anything 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.980
 created from your life but 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.420
 The only important thing is that you have one 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.709
 man are you for that you are here on 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.360
 the planet that you recognize them 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.940
 all a great adventure playground for 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.010
 you are and secondly, if you are 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.060
 realize that now you have it impuls 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.340
 what you want to try that you 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.470
 something irritates you that you do not 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.110
 hold back that you are not afraid 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.360
 I later and that you do not think oh 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.370
 I'm good enough for that 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.989
 you like the little kid on the 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.000
 Adventure playground it has no fear 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.860
 that is not shy is not that 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.330
 Someone is afraid of them 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.830
 you are not good enough you are allowed to 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.090
 That's not what you have to do until Christmas 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.560
 wait you may you have your 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.170
 make birthday or something 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.510
 that you just go and things 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.329
 tried on which you are curious you 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.590
 only have this one life and that's why 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.540
 use is user is not 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.880
 to do something but use it 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.860
 simply because it's already there 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.990
 it's already there you do not have to do anything 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.169
 get in the future but yours 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.740
 Aliveness is already here and everything 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.070
 what you have to do you have to do it yourself 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.860
 But do everything the good advice says 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.950
 is that you take advantage of what you have 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.750
 you the cover of you take you 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.570
 stop holding yourself back 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.400
 So keep it funny to keep it small 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.790
 to be almost shy and think 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.560
 even tomorrow, later or later 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.889
 I let someone else but 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.650
 manoeuvrable something fascinated throw 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.070
 all caution in the wind try it 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.090
 out 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.750
 ok so much for this video and listen 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.750
