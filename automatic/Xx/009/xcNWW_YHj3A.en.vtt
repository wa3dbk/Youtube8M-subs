an n-type battery close it up it feels

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.770 
an n-type battery close it up it feels
kind<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:53.940> not<00:02:54.940> as<00:02:55.090> heavy<00:02:55.269> as<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.510> thought

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
kind of not as heavy as I thought

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.009
