let's<00:04:09.459> go<00:04:09.610> ahead<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:10.090> say<00:04:10.330> ok<00:04:10.959> if<00:04:11.320> we<00:04:12.010> move

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
let's go ahead and say ok if we move

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.280 
let's go ahead and say ok if we move
about<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.730> timeline<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.780> can<00:04:13.959> see<00:04:14.140> that

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
about the timeline you can see that

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.930 
about the timeline you can see that
After<00:04:14.620> Effects<00:04:14.920> has<00:04:15.160> applied<00:04:15.520> your<00:04:15.820> raw

After Effects has applied your raw

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.849 
After Effects has applied your raw

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
settings to the whole clip so let's give

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.159 
settings to the whole clip so let's give
it<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:18.220> little<00:04:18.910> pre<00:04:19.269> render<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.780> check<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.079> out

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
it a little pre render to check it out

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.110 
it a little pre render to check it out
you<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:20.919> do<00:04:21.130> this<00:04:21.370> by<00:04:21.609> going<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
you can do this by going to the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.570 
you can do this by going to the

then<00:04:24.880> Ram<00:04:25.330> preview<00:04:25.630> or<00:04:26.080> just<00:04:26.980> use<00:04:27.130> the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
then Ram preview or just use the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.440 
then Ram preview or just use the
keyboard<00:04:27.490> shortcut<00:04:28.150> ctrl<00:04:28.840> zero

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.270 

well<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.350> think<00:04:36.560> this<00:04:36.830> looks<00:04:37.010> pretty<00:04:37.070> good

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
well I think this looks pretty good

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.310 
well I think this looks pretty good
myself<00:04:37.610> but<00:04:38.300> if<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.600> decide<00:04:38.900> you'd<00:04:39.110> like<00:04:39.230> to
