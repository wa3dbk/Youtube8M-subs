Monster High you put you still I mean
there's<00:04:45.770> still<00:04:45.890> somewhat<00:04:46.550> lack<00:04:46.700> of<00:04:46.880> mobility

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
there's still somewhat lack of mobility

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.000 
there's still somewhat lack of mobility
her<00:04:48.440> head<00:04:49.690> does<00:04:50.690> not<00:04:50.750> move<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.620> don't<00:04:51.800> move<00:04:51.919> her

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
her head does not move so don't move her

break<00:04:54.650> something<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.580> whole<00:04:56.080> workings<00:04:57.080> of

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
break something the whole workings of

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.330 
break something the whole workings of
this<00:04:57.770> top<00:04:58.010> part<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.370> her<00:04:58.520> um<00:04:59.300> her<00:05:00.370> arms<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:03.340> what

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
this top part of her um her arms so what

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.909 
this top part of her um her arms so what
I've<00:05:04.520> gathered<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.480> that<00:05:05.750> you<00:05:06.380> can<00:05:06.530> play<00:05:06.770> with

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
I've gathered is that you can play with

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.750 
I've gathered is that you can play with
our<00:05:06.980> arms<00:05:07.430> from<00:05:07.820> our<00:05:07.970> elbow<00:05:08.300> down<00:05:09.430> but<00:05:10.430> in

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
our arms from our elbow down but in

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.090 
our arms from our elbow down but in
terms<00:05:10.790> of<00:05:11.270> her<00:05:11.450> shoulder<00:05:11.870> don't<00:05:12.740> play<00:05:12.919> with

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
terms of her shoulder don't play with

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.500 
terms of her shoulder don't play with
those<00:05:13.220> because<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:13.910> is<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.300> whole

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
those because that is the whole

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.600 
those because that is the whole
mechanism<00:05:16.600> that's<00:05:17.600> at<00:05:17.780> play<00:05:17.960> here<00:05:18.290> so<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:19.430> can

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
mechanism that's at play here so you can

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.380 
mechanism that's at play here so you can
move<00:05:19.790> her<00:05:20.860> her<00:05:21.860> elbows<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:22.790> you<00:05:22.940> can<00:05:23.060> move<00:05:23.180> her

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
move her her elbows and you can move her

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.900 
move her her elbows and you can move her
wrists<00:05:23.840> but<00:05:24.740> just<00:05:24.950> you<00:05:25.370> can't<00:05:25.400> move<00:05:25.729> her

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
wrists but just you can't move her

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.570 
wrists but just you can't move her
shoulders<00:05:26.800> because<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:28.130> won't<00:05:28.340> really<00:05:28.520> work

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
shoulders because it won't really work

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.940 
shoulders because it won't really work
and<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.000> may<00:05:29.120> end<00:05:29.300> up<00:05:29.479> breaking<00:05:29.630> something<00:05:30.110> her

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
and it may end up breaking something her

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.040 
and it may end up breaking something her
eyes<00:05:31.160> are<00:05:31.220> actually<00:05:32.030> kind<00:05:32.270> of<00:05:32.330> cool<00:05:32.510> I<00:05:32.570> wasn't

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
eyes are actually kind of cool I wasn't

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.650 
eyes are actually kind of cool I wasn't
quite<00:05:33.169> sure<00:05:33.260> if<00:05:33.380> I'd<00:05:33.560> like<00:05:33.770> that

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
quite sure if I'd like that

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.150 
quite sure if I'd like that
but<00:05:36.660> i<00:05:36.690> like<00:05:36.960> how<00:05:37.230> her<00:05:37.380> eyes<00:05:37.560> kind<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:37.890> move<00:05:38.040> up

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
but i like how her eyes kind of move up

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.910 
but i like how her eyes kind of move up
