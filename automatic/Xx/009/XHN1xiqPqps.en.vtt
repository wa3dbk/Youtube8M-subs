00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
hanging in there but I have a feeling

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.560 
hanging in there but I have a feeling
it's<00:02:01.259> not<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> survive<00:02:02.280> however<00:02:03.119> there

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's not going to survive however there

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.370 
it's not going to survive however there
is<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.170> root<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
is this one root here can you see that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.740 
is this one root here can you see that
there's<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.950> root<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.030> growing

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
there's that one root that is growing

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.010 
there's that one root that is growing
every<00:02:10.590> day<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.550> that's<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.000> good<00:02:12.300> sign

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
every day so that's a good sign

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.830 
every day so that's a good sign

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
little knob there initially I thought it

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.520 
little knob there initially I thought it
was<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> spike<00:03:38.880> was<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.140> be<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> spike

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
was a spike was going to be a spike

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.380 
was a spike was going to be a spike
turns<00:03:40.860> out<00:03:41.040> just<00:03:41.490> to<00:03:41.700> root<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:45.140> this<00:03:46.140> one<00:03:46.440> here

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
turns out just to root so this one here

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.070 
turns out just to root so this one here
it<00:03:48.390> got<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.600> little<00:03:48.840> bit<00:03:49.140> too<00:03:49.530> much<00:03:49.890> Sun<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:51.080> put
