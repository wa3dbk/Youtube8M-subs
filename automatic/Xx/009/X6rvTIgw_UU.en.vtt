you<00:01:30.930> don't<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.380> too<00:01:31.439> crazy<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.100> like

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you don't want to go too crazy with like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
you don't want to go too crazy with like
a<00:01:32.700> tiny<00:01:33.090> sample<00:01:33.420> set<00:01:33.810> early<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> year<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
a tiny sample set early in the year and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
a tiny sample set early in the year and
especially<00:01:34.979> when<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> got<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> road

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
especially when you got like a road

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.770 
especially when you got like a road
favorite<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.610> yeah<00:01:39.360> i'm<00:01:39.540> thinking

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
favorite like this but yeah i'm thinking

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.850 
favorite like this but yeah i'm thinking
this<00:01:39.840> might<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> those<00:01:40.439> sides<00:01:40.680> were

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
this might be one of those sides were

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
this might be one of those sides were
the<00:01:40.979> Sharps<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.549> public's<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the Sharps and the public's then the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
the Sharps and the public's then the
public<00:01:42.840> pounds<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> same<00:01:43.890> side<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
public pounds on the same side and the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.350 
public pounds on the same side and the
books<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.700> birds<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> think

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
books get birds that what you think

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.569 
books get birds that what you think
might<00:01:45.540> happen<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.930> i<00:01:46.159> think<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> i<00:01:47.340> think

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
might happen here i think that i think

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.550 
might happen here i think that i think
the<00:01:47.880> Sharks<00:01:48.210> grabbed<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> whole<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the Sharks grabbed the whole of the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
the Sharks grabbed the whole of the
minus<00:01:49.920> four<00:01:50.130> line<00:01:50.369> took<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> four<00:01:51.240> points

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
minus four line took the four points

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090 
minus four line took the four points
with<00:01:51.720> seattle<00:01:52.200> knowing<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> was

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
with seattle knowing that that was

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.850 
with seattle knowing that that was
potentially<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> best<00:01:54.689> line<00:01:54.960> at

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
potentially going to be the best line at

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.039 
potentially going to be the best line at
the<00:01:56.100> time<00:01:56.369> now<00:01:57.180> i<00:01:57.210> think<00:01:57.360> they're<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the time now i think they're going to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109 
the time now i think they're going to
start<00:01:58.290> looking<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.729> really

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
start looking at this game and really

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270

realize<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.170> dallas<00:02:01.560> cowboys<00:02:01.950> seem

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
realize that this dallas cowboys seem

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.120 
realize that this dallas cowboys seem
might<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.939> turned<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.299> page<00:02:03.560> from<00:02:04.560> its<00:02:04.770> recent

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
might have turned a page from its recent

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.240 
might have turned a page from its recent
history<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.390> game<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:07.129> comes<00:02:08.129> down

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
history and this game really comes down
