00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
through the air with high force so the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.680 
through the air with high force so the
engineers<00:03:49.670> have<00:03:49.910> email<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.300> completely

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
engineers have email is completely

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.480 
engineers have email is completely
different<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.140> high<00:03:51.350> damage<00:03:51.620> very<00:03:52.160> little

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
different it's high damage very little

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.420 
different it's high damage very little
force<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.420> all<00:03:53.570> fire<00:03:53.870> based<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:55.160> this<00:03:55.310> is

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
force and it's all fire based so this is

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.010 
force and it's all fire based so this is
going<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.640> help<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.150> engineer<00:03:56.570> take<00:03:56.810> out

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
going to help the engineer take out

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.430 
going to help the engineer take out
heavily<00:03:57.650> armoured<00:03:57.980> opponents<00:03:59.440> we've

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
heavily armoured opponents we've

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.040 
heavily armoured opponents we've
revamped<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.130> enemy<00:04:01.580> AI<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.120> mass<00:04:02.300> effect<00:04:02.750> 3

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
revamped the enemy AI and mass effect 3

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.830 
revamped the enemy AI and mass effect 3
so<00:04:03.500> here<00:04:04.010> Erickson<00:04:04.760> adept<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.420> as<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.660> can

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
so here Erickson adept and as you can

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.720 
so here Erickson adept and as you can
see<00:04:05.870> shooting<00:04:06.500> The<00:04:06.740> Guardian<00:04:07.070> head-on<00:04:07.490> is

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
see shooting The Guardian head-on is

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.370 
see shooting The Guardian head-on is
probably<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.360> best<00:04:08.510> way<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:08.930> going<00:04:09.200> about

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
probably not the best way of going about

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.740 
probably not the best way of going about
it<00:04:09.650> but<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.460> adapt<00:04:10.820> has<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> trick<00:04:11.450> up<00:04:11.600> his

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
it but the adapt has a trick up his

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.200 
it but the adapt has a trick up his
sleeve<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.830> pull<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.370> shield<00:04:13.700> right<00:04:14.000> out

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
sleeve you can pull the shield right out

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.660 
sleeve you can pull the shield right out
of<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.360> Guardians<00:04:14.810> hand<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.710> other<00:04:16.040> classes

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
of the Guardians hand and other classes

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.220 
of the Guardians hand and other classes
may<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.090> different<00:04:17.510> strengths<00:04:18.020> or

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
may have different strengths or

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.380 
may have different strengths or
weaknesses<00:04:18.260> against<00:04:19.190> certain<00:04:19.459> enemies<00:04:19.730> so

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
weaknesses against certain enemies so

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.600 
weaknesses against certain enemies so
for<00:04:20.630> example<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.350> Cerberus<00:04:21.830> engineer<00:04:22.340> can

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
for example the Cerberus engineer can

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.580 
for example the Cerberus engineer can
deploy<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.000> little<00:04:23.480> turret<00:04:23.990> in<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.320> world

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
deploy a little turret in the world

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.250 
deploy a little turret in the world
which<00:04:25.340> is<00:04:25.490> pretty<00:04:25.700> hard<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.060> deal<00:04:26.390> with<00:04:26.420> but<00:04:26.870> if

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
which is pretty hard to deal with but if

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.530 
which is pretty hard to deal with but if
you're<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.590> engineer<00:04:27.770> player<00:04:28.400> class<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.390> can

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
you're the engineer player class you can

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.080 
you're the engineer player class you can
hack<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.320> turret<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:30.860> turn<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.340> against<00:04:31.940> the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
hack that turret and turn it against the
