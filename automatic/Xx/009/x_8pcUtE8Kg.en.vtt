00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.799
 You started with that eagerness to enter the 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.710
 competences but more than anything as a 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.799
 hobby did not want to be a footballer and good 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.649

 of being the product action is a sensor 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 of movement that was thought is very 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.119
 similar to who he is but he has the great 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 advantage that you do not need or with 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.860
 device apart as an xbox if not 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.240
