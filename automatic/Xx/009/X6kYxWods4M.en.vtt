pretty<00:01:08.280> light<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:09.110> wouldn't<00:01:10.110> say<00:01:10.200> they're<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
pretty light I wouldn't say they're a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
pretty light I wouldn't say they're a
minimal<00:01:10.890> shoe<00:01:11.130> there's<00:01:11.490> there's<00:01:12.000> cushioning

minimal shoe there's there's cushioning
here<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.140> first<00:01:13.470> thing<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.479> is

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
here the first thing that you see is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.539 
here the first thing that you see is
this<00:01:16.740> hole<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:22.189> this<00:01:23.189> whole

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
this hole right in the back this whole

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.410 
this hole right in the back this whole
will<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.180> easy<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.830> pull<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> shoe<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.420> that's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
will be easy to pull the shoe on that's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.740 
will be easy to pull the shoe on that's
a<00:01:27.570> big<00:01:27.750> difference<00:01:27.960> from<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.600> skechers<00:01:30.600> go

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
a big difference from the skechers go

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.469 
a big difference from the skechers go
run<00:01:30.780> ride<00:01:31.110> three<00:01:31.590> they<00:01:32.189> still<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
run ride three they still have the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.590 
run ride three they still have the
insert<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.829> her<00:01:35.040> soul<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.450> had

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
insert in her soul just like they had

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
insert in her soul just like they had
last<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.590> time<00:01:37.829> they<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.100> flat<00:01:38.490> laces

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
last time this time they have flat laces

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.859 
last time this time they have flat laces
I<00:01:39.650> like<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> really<00:01:41.640> neat<00:01:41.939> there

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
are these little ridges here and I think

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.270 
are these little ridges here and I think
that's<00:01:48.390> gonna<00:01:48.540> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.930> lock<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.590> laces<00:01:50.070> in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.110 
when I put these on these just felt like
a<00:02:24.880> glove<00:02:25.210> so<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:25.990> going<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.410> my<00:02:26.620> new

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
a glove so this is going to be my new

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.080 
a glove so this is going to be my new
treadmill<00:02:28.120> shoe<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.770> my<00:02:29.860> main<00:02:30.130> criticisms

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
treadmill shoe one of my main criticisms

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.420 
treadmill shoe one of my main criticisms
was<00:02:32.080> right<00:02:32.980> here<00:02:33.490> when<00:02:33.690> there's<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.930> Bend

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
was right here when there's this Bend

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.260 
was right here when there's this Bend
there's<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:37.660> creates<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.410> crease<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.940> you

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
there's this creates this crease but you

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.500 
there's this creates this crease but you
you<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.350> see<00:02:41.560> from<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.250> go<00:02:42.670> run<00:02:42.880> ride<00:02:43.090> fours

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
you can see from the go run ride fours

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.280 
you can see from the go run ride fours
that<00:02:44.050> they<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:45.090> let's<00:02:46.090> show<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:47.020> way

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
that they have let's show you this way

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.740 
that they have let's show you this way
it<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.890> actually<00:02:48.250> smaller<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:52.090> i<00:02:52.120> don't<00:02:52.540> think

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it is actually smaller so i don't think

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.210 
it is actually smaller so i don't think
i'm<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.020> get<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.709> st.<00:02:54.010> that

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
i'm going to get that that st. that

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.770 
i'm going to get that that st. that
creasing<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:54.940> we<00:02:55.090> see<00:02:55.270> here<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:56.130> might<00:02:57.130> just

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
creasing like we see here it might just

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.240 
creasing like we see here it might just
been<00:02:58.780> right<00:02:59.020> there<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.620> we<00:02:59.739> won't<00:02:59.890> have<00:03:00.040> that

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
been right there and we won't have that

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.610 
been right there and we won't have that
creasing<00:03:00.790> problem<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.720> don't<00:03:01.900> skechers<00:03:02.440> did

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
creasing problem so I don't skechers did

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.800 
creasing problem so I don't skechers did
you<00:03:02.770> watch<00:03:02.950> my<00:03:03.160> video<00:03:03.459> last<00:03:03.790> time<00:03:04.030> thank<00:03:04.630> you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
you watch my video last time thank you

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.920 
you watch my video last time thank you
the<00:03:05.650> mesh<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.430> also<00:03:07.060> different<00:03:07.300> check<00:03:07.780> out

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
the mesh is also different check out

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.210 
the mesh is also different check out
this<00:03:08.110> mesh

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.210 

so<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.430> see<00:03:16.640> for<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.840> mesh<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.890> it's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
so you can see for this mesh it is it's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.600 
so you can see for this mesh it is it's
a<00:03:19.370> tighter<00:03:19.670> weave<00:03:21.130> it's<00:03:22.130> almost<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.580> a

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
a tighter weave it's almost like a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.210 
a tighter weave it's almost like a
constellation<00:03:23.480> there<00:03:24.050> of<00:03:24.230> stars<00:03:24.590> look<00:03:25.130> at

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
constellation there of stars look at

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.010 
constellation there of stars look at
that<00:03:25.340> let's<00:03:25.610> test<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.150> breathability<00:03:29.020> you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
that let's test the breathability you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.740 
that let's test the breathability you
could<00:03:30.140> do<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.410> with<00:03:30.530> new<00:03:30.740> shoes<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:32.510> seems

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
could do that with new shoes it seems

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.120 
could do that with new shoes it seems
like<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:33.500> you're<00:03:33.620> going<00:03:33.710> to<00:03:33.770> have<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.920> lot<00:03:34.100> of

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
like here you're going to have a lot of

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.880 
like here you're going to have a lot of
breathability<00:03:34.550> but<00:03:35.540> here<00:03:36.230> there's<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.560> lot<00:03:36.860> of

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
breathability but here there's a lot of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.980 
breathability but here there's a lot of
in<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.490> back<00:03:37.670> there's<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.030> lot<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.210> padding<00:03:38.540> and

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
in the back there's a lot of padding and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.070 
in the back there's a lot of padding and
so<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:40.370> tongue<00:03:40.670> thickness<00:03:41.240> is<00:03:41.420> about<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
so the tongue thickness is about the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.130 
so the tongue thickness is about the
same<00:03:42.290> from<00:03:42.590> last<00:03:42.680> time<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.580> around<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.630> ankle

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
same from last time and around the ankle

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.290 
same from last time and around the ankle
we<00:03:45.620> still<00:03:45.830> got<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.070> support<00:03:46.520> but<00:03:47.000> we<00:03:47.060> do<00:03:47.180> have

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
we still got the support but we do have

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.050 
we still got the support but we do have
this<00:03:47.450> hole<00:03:47.720> here<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:48.290> guess<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.790> helps<00:03:49.790> also

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
this hole here I guess that helps also

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.010 
this hole here I guess that helps also
with<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.540> breathability<00:03:51.380> still<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:53.150> M

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
with the breathability still the M

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.560 
with the breathability still the M
strike<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.920> mid-foot<00:03:55.400> strike<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.300> still

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
strike the mid-foot strike and you still

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.080 
strike the mid-foot strike and you still
got<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.750> kind<00:03:57.320> of<00:03:57.380> rocking<00:03:58.010> idea<00:03:58.640> for<00:03:59.000> the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
got that kind of rocking idea for the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.750 
got that kind of rocking idea for the
shoe<00:03:59.360> there's<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.170> larger<00:04:00.650> s<00:04:01.810> for<00:04:02.810> skechers<00:04:03.260> I

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
shoe there's a larger s for skechers I

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.700 
shoe there's a larger s for skechers I
don't<00:04:04.760> think<00:04:04.970> they<00:04:05.060> made<00:04:05.270> any<00:04:05.540> changes<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:06.410> the

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
don't think they made any changes to the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.830 
don't think they made any changes to the
bottoms<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.640> 3s<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.180> fours<00:04:08.450> are

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
bottoms the 3s and the fours are

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.330 
bottoms the 3s and the fours are
identical<00:04:09.800> I<00:04:09.950> would<00:04:10.130> say<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:12.340> little

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
identical I would say a little

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.260 
identical I would say a little
reflective<00:04:14.030> material<00:04:14.720> in<00:04:14.840> there<00:04:15.970> that's<00:04:16.970> good

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
reflective material in there that's good

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.670 
reflective material in there that's good
really<00:04:17.600> do<00:04:17.930> look<00:04:18.260> like<00:04:18.440> there's

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
really do look like there's

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.970 
really do look like there's
constellations<00:04:19.640> on<00:04:19.820> there<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:21.650> can<00:04:21.799> see<00:04:21.830> the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
constellations on there you can see the

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.820 
constellations on there you can see the
Big<00:04:22.250> Dipper<00:04:22.720> practicing<00:04:23.720> some<00:04:23.960> serious

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
Big Dipper practicing some serious

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.270 
Big Dipper practicing some serious
declines<00:04:25.400> on<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.940> treadmill<00:04:26.870> air<00:04:27.280> just

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
declines on the treadmill air just

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.910 
declines on the treadmill air just
kidding

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.820 

just<00:04:35.790> as<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.000> side<00:04:36.360> note<00:04:36.420> i'm<00:04:36.900> not<00:04:37.200> throwing<00:04:37.590> the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
just as a side note i'm not throwing the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.710 
just as a side note i'm not throwing the
ride<00:04:38.250> threes<00:04:38.730> away<00:04:39.030> i'm<00:04:39.360> going<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.600> be<00:04:39.690> using

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
ride threes away i'm going to be using

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.170 
ride threes away i'm going to be using
these<00:04:40.260> day<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> day<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.430> i'm<00:04:41.580> just<00:04:41.910> not<00:04:42.030> going

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
these day to day and i'm just not going

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.520 
these day to day and i'm just not going
to<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.360> running<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.780> they<00:04:42.930> look<00:04:43.080> pretty<00:04:43.110> cool

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
to be running it they look pretty cool

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.000 
to be running it they look pretty cool
with<00:04:43.680> jeans<00:04:43.980> i<00:04:44.310> think<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:46.050> wider<00:04:46.260> toe<00:04:46.560> box<00:04:46.590> it

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
with jeans i think the wider toe box it

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.090 
with jeans i think the wider toe box it
allows<00:04:47.220> your<00:04:47.490> toes<00:04:47.880> display<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:48.990> when<00:04:49.950> you're

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
allows your toes display out when you're
