two because this piece of board boys
about<00:00:37.290> ten<00:00:37.559> pounds<00:00:38.090> now<00:00:39.469> this<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
about ten pounds now this here is a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.149 
about ten pounds now this here is a
piece<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:43.260> industrial<00:00:44.750> cardboard<00:00:45.750> tubing<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
piece of industrial cardboard tubing and

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.599 
piece of industrial cardboard tubing and
it's<00:00:47.670> roughly<00:00:47.999> three<00:00:48.749> inches<00:00:49.019> in<00:00:49.140> diameter

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
it's roughly three inches in diameter

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.139 
it's roughly three inches in diameter
and<00:00:50.609> through<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> PVC<00:00:52.170> pipe<00:00:52.379> so

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
and through that we have a PVC pipe so

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.899 
and through that we have a PVC pipe so
what<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.239> did<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.710> glue<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> pipe<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
what we did was we glue the pipe to the

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.849 
what we did was we glue the pipe to the
board<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> bottom<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.019> then<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.739> took

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
board on the bottom and then we took

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.279 
board on the bottom and then we took
these<00:00:59.010> little<00:00:59.339> spacers<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.239> glue<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
these little spacers and glue them to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.210 
these little spacers and glue them to
the<00:01:01.319> inside<00:01:01.409> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.989> cardboard<00:01:03.989> pipe<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the inside of the cardboard pipe so that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
the inside of the cardboard pipe so that
would<00:01:05.370> be<00:01:05.489> stable<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.240> try<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> push<00:01:06.810> on

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
would be stable so if I try to push on

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.280 
would be stable so if I try to push on
it<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> doesn't<00:01:08.130> hardly<00:01:08.550> move<00:01:08.760> much<00:01:09.290> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it it doesn't hardly move much so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
it it doesn't hardly move much so
theoretically<00:01:12.229> theoretically<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:14.130> we've

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
theoretically theoretically when we've

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.090 
theoretically theoretically when we've
got<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> cake<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.799> it'll<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.890> nice<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
got the cake on there it'll be nice and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
got the cake on there it'll be nice and
stable<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:18.120> right<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:18.630> first

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
stable all right so this is the first

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
stable all right so this is the first
part<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> video<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.650> we'll<00:01:19.950> come<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.160> as

styrofoam on there covered in fondant

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
styrofoam on there covered in fondant
and<00:02:08.820> this<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> real<00:02:10.410> cake<00:02:10.680> it's

we'll be back here we got a fondant on
the<00:03:23.860> actual<00:03:24.860> cake<00:03:25.190> now<00:03:26.170> kind<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.350> skirt<00:03:27.710> on

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
the actual cake now kind of a skirt on

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.220 
the actual cake now kind of a skirt on
the<00:03:27.950> bottom<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.370> as<00:03:28.490> you<00:03:28.640> can<00:03:28.790> see<00:03:29.230> which

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
the bottom of it as you can see which

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.750 
the bottom of it as you can see which
we're<00:03:30.440> taking<00:03:30.770> off

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.180

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
and again we know it's not perfect but I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.860 
and again we know it's not perfect but I
guess<00:03:40.370> what<00:03:40.520> we're<00:03:40.640> finding<00:03:40.849> is<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.300> making<00:03:41.660> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
guess what we're finding is it making a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.970 
guess what we're finding is it making a
circle<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.290> really<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.920> easy<00:03:44.709> our<00:03:45.709> first<00:03:45.980> one

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
circle is really not easy our first one

00:03:47.980 --> 00:04:09.229 
circle is really not easy our first one

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
you know that will actually pass for a

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.040 
you know that will actually pass for a
