the<00:01:52.220> simce<00:01:52.580> Jim<00:01:53.210> Frey<00:01:53.420> gets<00:01:53.600> pushed<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:54.140> and

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
the simce Jim Frey gets pushed in and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.270 
the simce Jim Frey gets pushed in and
then<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.950> sure<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.580> be<00:01:55.700> pushing<00:01:55.910> back<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:57.280> that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
then is sure to be pushing back on that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.940 
then is sure to be pushing back on that
cell<00:01:58.789> contacts<00:01:59.300> there<00:01:59.569> what<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.710> SEP

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
cell contacts there what the SEP

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.370 
cell contacts there what the SEP
contacts<00:02:01.509> does<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:02.720> job<00:02:03.110> is<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.530> tell<00:02:03.740> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
contacts does this job is to tell the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
contacts does this job is to tell the
iPhone<00:02:06.380> when<00:02:06.740> there's<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.979> SIM<00:02:07.220> card<00:02:07.270> inside<00:02:08.270> it

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
iPhone when there's a SIM card inside it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.830 
iPhone when there's a SIM card inside it
so<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.319> can<00:02:09.500> start<00:02:09.679> reading<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.399> SIM<00:02:10.729> card<00:02:10.840> now

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
so it can start reading the SIM card now

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.350 
so it can start reading the SIM card now
the<00:02:12.500> way<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.950> does<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.160> is<00:02:13.430> well<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.060> pushes

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the way it does that is well it pushes

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.650 
the way it does that is well it pushes
down<00:02:14.569> on<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.260> should<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.910> separating

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
down on this you should be separating

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.770 
down on this you should be separating
the<00:02:17.750> contacts<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.180> isn't<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.569> some

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the contacts and it isn't for some

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.010 
the contacts and it isn't for some
reason<00:02:21.200> if<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.440> try<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:23.060> get<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.300> contacts<00:02:23.750> to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
reason if I try to get the contacts to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.200 
reason if I try to get the contacts to
separate

separate

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.270 
separate
can't<00:02:27.210> do<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.480> because<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.260> sim<00:02:28.740> tray<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
can't do that because the sim tray is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.100 
can't do that because the sim tray is
all<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.580> way<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.730> now<00:02:30.690> that's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.930> little

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
all the way in now that's a little

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.559 
all the way in now that's a little
strange<00:02:31.440> because<00:02:31.740> as<00:02:32.730> far<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.150> sim<00:02:33.330> tray

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
strange because as far as the sim tray

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.610 
strange because as far as the sim tray
concerned<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.980> working<00:02:35.610> properly<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.500> should

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
concerned is working properly you should

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.559 
concerned is working properly you should
try<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.830> get<00:02:38.040> those<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.370> settle<00:02:38.730> right<00:02:38.760> there

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
try to get those to settle right there

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.500 
try to get those to settle right there
we<00:02:39.660> go<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.760> should<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.060> happening

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.910 

the<00:02:45.510> contact<00:02:45.959> should<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.140> separate<00:02:46.650> there<00:02:46.830> we

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the contact should be separate there we

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.300 
the contact should be separate there we
go

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
go

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.430 
go
you<00:02:47.520> see<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.810> contact<00:02:49.170> should<00:02:49.380> be

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
you see that the contact should be

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.920 
you see that the contact should be
suffered<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.130> will<00:02:50.280> tell<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.730> phone<00:02:50.940> that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
suffered that will tell the phone that

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.600 
suffered that will tell the phone that
said<00:02:52.200> there's<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.500> SIM<00:02:52.709> card<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:53.160> there<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.520> to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
said there's a SIM card in there and to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.479 
said there's a SIM card in there and to
start<00:02:53.850> reading<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.360> now<00:02:55.310> everything<00:02:56.310> looks

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
start reading it now everything looks

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.890 
start reading it now everything looks
normal<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:56.880> it's<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.209> doing<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.690> would

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
normal but it's not doing that I would

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.680 
normal but it's not doing that I would
say<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.739> sort<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.610> SIM<00:02:59.790> card<00:03:00.090> has<00:03:00.270> been<00:03:00.300> pushed

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
say the sort of SIM card has been pushed

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.110 
say the sort of SIM card has been pushed
back<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.140> hasn't<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:02.280> exactly<00:03:02.940> what's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
back but it hasn't so exactly what's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.770 
back but it hasn't so exactly what's
going<00:03:03.330> on<00:03:03.480> there

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
going on there

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.460 
going on there
I<00:03:03.900> don't<00:03:04.290> know<00:03:05.000> but<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.480> know<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.440> be

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I don't know but I know that it can be

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.610 
I don't know but I know that it can be
fixed<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:08.430> need<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.700> get<00:03:08.850> these<00:03:09.620> contacts

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
fixed just we need to get these contacts

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.330 
fixed just we need to get these contacts
separated<00:03:13.760> there<00:03:14.760> isn't<00:03:15.090> sort<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:16.080> fix<00:03:16.830> for

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
separated there isn't sort of a fix for

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.250 
separated there isn't sort of a fix for
this<00:03:17.430> because<00:03:17.640> everything<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.840> where<00:03:19.110> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
this because everything is where it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.680 
this because everything is where it
should<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:19.709> exactly<00:03:20.370> what's<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.420> I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
should be exactly what's going on I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.350 
should be exactly what's going on I
think<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:23.010> could<00:03:23.220> be<00:03:23.340> something<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.850> do<00:03:23.970> with

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
think it could be something to do with

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.990 
think it could be something to do with
the<00:03:24.750> location<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.400> mainboard

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
the location of the mainboard

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.080 
the location of the mainboard
it<00:03:27.570> could<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> little<00:03:28.530> too<00:03:28.709> far<00:03:29.010> back<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:29.880> it

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
it could be a little too far back if it

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.460 
it could be a little too far back if it
is<00:03:30.239> then<00:03:30.480> it's<00:03:30.660> going<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> put<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.140> further

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
is then it's going to put it further

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.100 
is then it's going to put it further
away<00:03:31.860> from<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.430> SIM<00:03:32.670> tray<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.840> SIM<00:03:34.079> tray

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
away from this SIM tray so the SIM tray

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.840 
away from this SIM tray so the SIM tray
won't<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.650> able<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.860> press<00:03:35.100> these<00:03:35.310> contacts

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
won't be able to press these contacts

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.509 
won't be able to press these contacts
apart<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.380> could<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.160> problem

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
apart but so that could be a problem

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.699 
apart but so that could be a problem
with<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.000> case<00:03:39.239> for<00:03:39.959> example<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.410> could<00:03:40.560> be

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
with the case for example it could be

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.390 
with the case for example it could be
something<00:03:41.070> else

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
something else

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.430 
something else
I<00:03:41.519> know<00:03:42.030> there<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.420> fix<00:03:42.720> for<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.200> because<00:03:43.320> I'm

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
I know there is a fix for it because I'm

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.650 
I know there is a fix for it because I'm
going<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.650> find<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:44.160> because<00:03:44.370> all<00:03:45.329> we<00:03:45.450> need<00:03:45.570> to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
going to find it because all we need to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.440 
going to find it because all we need to
do<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.110> get<00:03:46.380> these<00:03:46.590> contacts<00:03:47.160> separated<00:03:47.910> so

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
do is get these contacts separated so

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.690 
do is get these contacts separated so
that's<00:03:48.600> why<00:03:48.720> what<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:48.900> try<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.140> do<00:03:49.769> now<00:03:50.040> I'm

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
that's why what I try to do now I'm

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.490 
that's why what I try to do now I'm
going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.910> try<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.090> get<00:03:51.390> something<00:03:51.840> that's

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
going to try to get something that's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.740 
going to try to get something that's
going<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.829> work<00:03:52.920> not<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:53.670> but<00:03:53.910> also<00:03:54.269> if

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
going to work not just now but also if

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.900 
going to work not just now but also if
the<00:03:54.870> SIM<00:03:55.049> card<00:03:55.079> was<00:03:55.410> taken<00:03:55.769> out<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.519> put<00:03:56.730> back

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
the SIM card was taken out and put back

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.840 
the SIM card was taken out and put back
in<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.480> what<00:03:57.630> would<00:03:57.750> keep<00:03:58.049> working<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:59.610> what'd

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
in so what would keep working so what'd

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.060 
in so what would keep working so what'd
ya<00:04:00.060> find<00:04:00.299> something<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.959> get<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.980> work

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
ya find something to get it to work

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.420 
ya find something to get it to work
properly<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.940> then<00:04:03.269> okay<00:04:04.079> yeah<00:04:04.440> what<00:04:05.070> I've

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
properly and then okay yeah what I've

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.750 
properly and then okay yeah what I've
got<00:04:06.090> here<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.829> you<00:04:07.890> see<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> contacts

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
got here and so you see the contacts

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.410 
got here and so you see the contacts
there<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.269> with<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.590> foam<00:04:11.459> on<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
there just with a bit of foam on and

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.229 
there just with a bit of foam on and
that<00:04:12.900> works<00:04:13.860> just<00:04:14.010> right<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.850> be<00:04:14.940> able<00:04:15.030> to

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
that works just right to be able to

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.380 
that works just right to be able to
separate<00:04:15.630> those<00:04:15.810> contacts

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
separate those contacts

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.120 
separate those contacts
now<00:04:18.390> just<00:04:18.630> looking<00:04:18.930> at<00:04:19.050> it<00:04:19.170> from<00:04:19.560> here<00:04:19.770> looks

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
now just looking at it from here looks

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.000 
now just looking at it from here looks
absolutely<00:04:20.400> fine<00:04:20.910> now<00:04:21.590> one<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> things<00:04:22.920> I

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010

absolutely fine now one of the things I
didn't<00:04:23.220> mention<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.990> want<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.500> work<00:04:25.680> not

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
didn't mention I want this to work not

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.550 
didn't mention I want this to work not
just<00:04:26.460> now<00:04:26.850> but<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> future<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:27.840> if<00:04:28.440> you

just now but in the future so if you
take<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.040> SIM<00:04:29.640> card<00:04:29.670> out<00:04:30.060> for<00:04:30.780> example<00:04:31.230> by

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
take the SIM card out for example by

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.160 
take the SIM card out for example by
doing<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:32.270> you've<00:04:33.270> got<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.690> contacts<00:04:34.550> that

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
doing that you've got the contacts that

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.540 
doing that you've got the contacts that
come<00:04:37.170> together<00:04:37.350> again<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:38.850> press<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.210> in<00:04:39.420> and

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
come together again to press that in and

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.780 
come together again to press that in and
the<00:04:41.550> separate<00:04:42.000> again

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.100 

there<00:04:46.390> you<00:04:46.450> go<00:04:46.950> well<00:04:47.950> so<00:04:47.980> take<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.640> out<00:04:48.760> again

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
there you go well so take it out again

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.960 
there you go well so take it out again
contact<00:04:50.110> there

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
contact there

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.480 
contact there
put<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.090> back<00:04:52.240> in<00:04:52.770> push<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.920> back<00:04:54.040> down<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.400> to

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
put it back in push it back down so to

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.440 
put it back in push it back down so to
say<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:55.450> contacts<00:04:55.870> separate<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:58.270> that's

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
say the contacts separate so that's

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.910 
say the contacts separate so that's
pretty<00:04:58.570> much<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.930> really<00:04:59.080> that's<00:04:59.410> all<00:04:59.620> done

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
gap between the top of that contact on

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.930 
gap between the top of that contact on
the<00:05:04.240> back<00:05:04.480> over<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.110> SIM<00:05:05.380> card<00:05:05.410> slot<00:05:05.940> what

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
the back over the SIM card slot what

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.070 
the back over the SIM card slot what
I'll<00:05:07.000> do<00:05:07.120> next<00:05:07.300> I'll<00:05:07.540> go<00:05:07.660> everything<00:05:07.930> else

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
I'll do next I'll go everything else

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
together and we'll see the sim card back

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.550 
together and we'll see the sim card back
in<00:05:13.000> action<00:05:13.150> with<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.750> phone<00:05:14.050> having<00:05:14.290> same
