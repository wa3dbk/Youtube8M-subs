00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.970
 to make a lush tombs flower 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.630
 First, cut out the paper blank for 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.630
 petals 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.490
 now we put paper preparation 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.560
 tissue and outline the boundaries of the petals of all 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.560
 need to make forty five petals 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.980
 each petal is singed over a candle and 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.980
 give it the desired shape 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 from a square satin ribbon 5 by 5 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.380
 centimeters cut circle which edge 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.380
 singe over the candle 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.069
 proceed to the creation of the middle of the flower 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.060
 we cut out a strip 50 from four from organza 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.630
 centimeter 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.959
 edges singe over the candle fold it 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.620
 width in half and on the edge of laying 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:40.000
 thread stitches tighten and attach 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.000
 midpoint round shape 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.710
 glue petals round base 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.739
 petals of each subsequent row 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.120
 should be located between the petals 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.459
 previous row 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.780
 when all the petals are glued glued 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.459
 the middle of the flower hope this master
