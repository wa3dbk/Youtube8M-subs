as<00:01:02.609> you'd<00:01:03.059> expect<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.660> basically<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.769> Xbox<00:01:05.040> 60

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
as you'd expect so basically the Xbox 60

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
as you'd expect so basically the Xbox 60
and<00:01:05.489> ps3<00:01:05.729> versions<00:01:06.180> both<00:01:06.420> run<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.780> 720p<00:01:07.650> 60fps

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and ps3 versions both run at 720p 60fps

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.850 
and ps3 versions both run at 720p 60fps
and<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.720> Pokemon<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.350> confirmation

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and now we have Pokemon for confirmation

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
and now we have Pokemon for confirmation
that<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.189> Xbox<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> ps4<00:01:12.119> versions<00:01:12.750> will

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that the Xbox one and ps4 versions will

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.640 
that the Xbox one and ps4 versions will
run<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.290> say<00:01:13.799> 1080p<00:01:14.340> 60fps<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.540> 1080p<00:01:15.930> 60fps<00:01:16.259> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
run at say 1080p 60fps so 1080p 60fps is

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.620 
run at say 1080p 60fps so 1080p 60fps is
