and there are something to you
periodically<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.409> pretty<00:01:07.530> much<00:01:07.740> almost

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
periodically but it's pretty much almost

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.880 
periodically but it's pretty much almost
just<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.640> drunk<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.479> junk<00:01:09.810> drawer<00:01:10.470> of

Dungeons and Dragons and I see it as a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.289 
Dungeons and Dragons and I see it as a
tremendous<00:01:16.530> amount<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> needless<00:01:18.259> paperwork

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
tremendous amount of needless paperwork

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.640 
tremendous amount of needless paperwork

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
was anticlimactic and just think about

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.310

why's my viewing audience here with with

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.690 
why's my viewing audience here with with
the<00:02:15.260> terminology<00:02:15.799> that<00:02:16.159> my<00:02:16.249> gaming<00:02:16.579> group

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
the terminology that my gaming group

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.649 
the terminology that my gaming group
uses<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:19.340> way<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.730> way<00:02:19.819> we<00:02:20.060> look<00:02:20.480> at<00:02:20.629> it

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
uses and the way the way we look at it

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.750 
uses and the way the way we look at it
is<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:24.200> know<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.650> should<00:02:25.129> seem<00:02:25.340> realistic

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
is you know it should seem realistic

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.309 
is you know it should seem realistic
like<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.329> someone<00:02:26.659> was<00:02:26.749> actually<00:02:26.840> watching

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
like if someone was actually watching

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.780 
like if someone was actually watching
the<00:02:27.379> game<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:27.650> they'd<00:02:27.739> be<00:02:27.799> like<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.639> was

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the game what they'd be like that was

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.520 
the game what they'd be like that was
his<00:02:28.939> booty<00:02:29.239> or<00:02:29.510> were<00:02:29.810> they<00:02:29.959> they<00:02:30.290> come<00:02:30.469> on

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
his booty or were they they come on

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.530 
his booty or were they they come on
Macleod<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:31.099> was<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.639> know<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.389> that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
Macleod that was you know that that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.440 
Macleod that was you know that that
makes<00:02:32.719> sense<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.260> there's<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.560> lot<00:02:33.739> of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
makes sense that there's a lot of

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.520 
makes sense that there's a lot of
coherency<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.659> the<00:02:35.810> ideas<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.409> you're

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
coherency to the ideas that you're

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.039 
coherency to the ideas that you're
pitching<00:02:37.159> here<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.939> can<00:02:38.359> I<00:02:38.510> can<00:02:38.659> by<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.840> I

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
pitching here and I can I can by that I

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.599 
pitching here and I can I can by that I
can't<00:02:39.230> believe<00:02:39.439> that<00:02:39.620> from<00:02:39.980> an<00:02:40.069> audience<00:02:40.310> or<00:02:40.549> a

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
can't believe that from an audience or a

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.250 
can't believe that from an audience or a
standpoint<00:02:41.120> as<00:02:41.450> if<00:02:41.749> you<00:02:41.900> know<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.109> game

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
standpoint as if you know the game

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.589 
standpoint as if you know the game
itself<00:02:42.530> or<00:02:42.769> or<00:02:42.950> sort<00:02:43.909> of<00:02:43.969> like<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.389> show

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599
