00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
think about if song for me but there are

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.110 
think about if song for me but there are
so<00:02:44.920> many<00:02:44.980> songs<00:02:45.310> out<00:02:45.580> there<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.910> probably

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
so many songs out there that probably

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.150 
so many songs out there that probably
could<00:02:46.360> make<00:02:46.569> us<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:46.840> last<00:02:47.080> one<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.069> know

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
could make us this last one but you know

could make us this last one but you know
I<00:02:48.190> think<00:02:48.400> I'm<00:02:48.700> actually<00:02:48.850> going<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.830> want<00:02:50.830> to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
I think I'm actually going to want to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.760 
I think I'm actually going to want to
reach<00:02:51.069> out<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> little<00:02:51.459> bit<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.200> go<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.410> Chandra

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770

reach out a little bit and go to Chandra
where<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.850> probably<00:02:55.660> people<00:02:55.990> may<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.290> think

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
where and probably people may not think

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.320 
where and probably people may not think
that<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.740> would<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:57.880> still<00:02:58.150> rock

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
that I would like this it's still rock

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.750
