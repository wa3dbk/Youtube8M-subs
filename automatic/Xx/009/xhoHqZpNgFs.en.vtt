00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.769
 the situation in mexico, for which the rehearsal of the comparsa ará berá 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.699
 We are working with everyone but with a lot of energy 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:10.779
 a lot of strength 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.739
 so that's what keeps us 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.199
 the riverbank working 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.989
 not to mention they are already a classic the girls come to lose a few pounds and 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.710
 get in shape surely 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380
 pillar to take advantage and 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.789
 It's good because 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.189
 but also some come with their 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.589
 guess with friends until the moment of alarm the barrier to that burden the 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.739
 fit ev made and I wish it from the heart 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.960
 because that's where the rostrum ended and the wind goes on for this, 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 comparseros 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.880
 let's remember how he will be of the nozaleda family 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.710
 ará berá will send it back summer 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.270
 I have presented the history of music but those are going to be played 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.490
 key moments that have to do 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.719
 with our carnival 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.599
 that is to say with him with the formation of what would be the samba school 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.590
 which is the great reservoir of biting music in our carnival is what 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.920
 more you like this year 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.930
 the theme the musical variant is going to be quite 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.780
 the election choice so the people varied 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.890
 if that is what motivates the comparsero and in turn that does so 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 up was the grandstand 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.290
 francese is going to be interesting for 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.659
 give strength to the comparsa the new corsa arms a challenge for all 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.650
 without words after a question of mine 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.210
 no and we too 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.990
 We are not in good condition and with this new the truth 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 that all the time the air the mystery of what is going to happen 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.160
 well i think that 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.360
 what happens in the corso that does not pass missions or at least we're going 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.620
 we try the very important stage or for the dancer 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.080
 and it turns out that here we had breakfast the first day and that's why 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.720
 so it's going to be quite a challenge lara 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.330
 good one goal with the challenge of filling pastor his new weapon july 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.210
 we also have the challenge 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.910
 hundreds of corsódromo new to marc as a result 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.530
 distance longer 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.929
 but very narrow 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.299
 let's see how we can deal with all the guys we have this 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.570
 year we grow rosemary we have almost 540 members 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.000
 Christian to make the adjustments he took for granted there is still time there 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.109
 adjust the theme of the displacement location suit 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.109
 because you also have to look at the dimension of the backs 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.349
 your responsibility from March 4 to July 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.749
 my responsibility is that the comparsa between time 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.249
 and that all people in turn can enjoy what we are going to 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.169
 to show 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.229
 even though they see 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:32.419
 joy 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.509
 and the crazy guy who's going to carry on for years
