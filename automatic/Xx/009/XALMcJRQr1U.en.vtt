for the door that yet that we make so I
do<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.199> did<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.529> finished<00:00:31.830> test<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
do I did a finished test because the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
do I did a finished test because the
last<00:00:32.550> couple<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> weeks<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.680> terrible

pretty<00:00:40.770> much<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> entire<00:00:41.399> time<00:00:41.430> 100%

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
pretty much the entire time 100%

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
pretty much the entire time 100%
humidity<00:00:42.480> outside<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> took<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
humidity outside so I took that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.420 
humidity outside so I took that
opportunity<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.910> finish<00:00:45.300> two<00:00:45.450> pieces<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> wood

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
opportunity to finish two pieces of wood

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.299 
opportunity to finish two pieces of wood
sixteenth<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.520> an<00:00:47.640> inch<00:00:47.670> thick<00:00:48.739> but<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:50.010> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
sixteenth of an inch thick but all in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.170 
sixteenth of an inch thick but all in
grain<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:52.140> grain<00:00:52.550> pretty<00:00:53.550> much<00:00:53.670> acts<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
grain in grain pretty much acts as a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.580 
grain in grain pretty much acts as a
sponge<00:00:54.649> for<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:56.129> moisture<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.730> wood<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
sponge for for moisture in wood so I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
sponge for for moisture in wood so I
knew<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.850> painted<00:01:00.329> both<00:01:00.539> sides<00:01:00.809> not

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
knew that if I painted both sides not

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.709 
knew that if I painted both sides not
paint<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> brush<00:01:03.210> both<00:01:03.420> sides

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
paint but if I if I brush both sides

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.350 
paint but if I if I brush both sides
with<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.049> protective<00:01:04.619> finish<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.240> was<00:01:06.240> going

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
with this protective finish I was going

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
with this protective finish I was going
to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.510> able<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> tell<00:01:06.900> whether<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to be able to tell whether or not the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.859 
to be able to tell whether or not the
finish<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.670> effective<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.270> blocking<00:01:09.420> out

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
finish was effective in blocking out

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.910 
finish was effective in blocking out
that<00:01:09.900> moisture<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> wood<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.260> keeping<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that moisture in the wood and keeping it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
that moisture in the wood and keeping it
from<00:01:14.070> warping<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.700> what's<00:01:14.939> happened<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
from warping and what's happened is this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.090 
from warping and what's happened is this
piece<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> left

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
