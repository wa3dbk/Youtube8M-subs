can expand it with the micro SD card

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.980 
can expand it with the micro SD card
slot<00:06:54.349> there<00:06:54.889> and<00:06:55.210> then<00:06:56.210> over<00:06:56.240> here<00:06:56.449> what<00:06:56.810> looks

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
slot there and then over here what looks
