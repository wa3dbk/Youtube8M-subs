we're<00:00:13.920> here<00:00:14.100> testing<00:00:14.550> the<00:00:14.730> Everest<00:00:15.299> for

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
we're here testing the Everest for

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.089 
we're here testing the Everest for
testing<00:00:16.020> here<00:00:16.260> because<00:00:16.590> we've<00:00:16.770> got<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
testing here because we've got the

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.620 
testing here because we've got the
temperature<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.640> need<00:00:17.790> we've<00:00:18.090> got<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.360> fuels

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.150 
temperature we need we've got the fuels
we<00:00:18.810> need<00:00:19.020> we've<00:00:19.349> got<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> tracks<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.099> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
we need we've got the tracks and the

we need we've got the tracks and the
facilities<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.700> we<00:00:20.880> need<00:00:21.740> but<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.040> real

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550

temperature altitude all those things

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.979 
temperature altitude all those things
affect<00:00:35.879> how<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:36.940> engine<00:00:37.270> performs<00:00:37.719> the

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
affect how the engine performs the

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.020 
affect how the engine performs the
engines<00:00:38.350> most<00:00:38.649> stressed<00:00:39.129> when<00:00:39.489> it's<00:00:39.699> real

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
engines most stressed when it's real

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.600 
engines most stressed when it's real
it's<00:00:40.270> really<00:00:40.570> dry<00:00:40.930> would<00:00:41.739> probably<00:00:42.100> almost

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
it's really dry would probably almost

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.880 
it's really dry would probably almost
reach<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.269> point<00:00:43.420> of<00:00:43.570> overheating<00:00:44.199> a<00:00:44.440> couple

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
reach the point of overheating a couple

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.610 
reach the point of overheating a couple
hundred<00:00:45.010> times<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.489> day<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:47.170> engines<00:00:47.440> got<00:00:47.559> a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
hundred times a day the engines got a

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.069 
hundred times a day the engines got a
self<00:00:47.890> protecting<00:00:48.370> strategy<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:49.030> onboard<00:00:49.570> so

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
self protecting strategy in onboard so

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.139 
self protecting strategy in onboard so
the<00:00:50.589> torque<00:00:51.070> will<00:00:51.220> reduce<00:00:51.579> when<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:51.909> get<00:00:52.059> to

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
the torque will reduce when we get to

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.600 
the torque will reduce when we get to
that<00:00:52.269> point<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:52.750> we<00:00:53.019> basically<00:00:53.409> push<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.129> past

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
that point so we basically push it past

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.910 
that point so we basically push it past
the<00:00:54.850> maximum<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.570> then<00:00:56.350> we'll<00:00:56.500> give<00:00:56.649> it<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.800> bit

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
the maximum and then we'll give it a bit

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.720 
the maximum and then we'll give it a bit
of<00:00:56.979> a<00:00:57.040> cool-down<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.670> then<00:00:57.760> go<00:00:57.909> again

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of a cool-down and then go again

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.350 
of a cool-down and then go again
carousel<00:01:00.730> Dan<00:01:00.850> all-wheel<00:01:01.120> drive<00:01:01.330> and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
carousel Dan all-wheel drive and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.330 
carousel Dan all-wheel drive and
rear-wheel<00:01:01.690> drive<00:01:01.840> configurations<00:01:02.770> and<00:01:03.040> so

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
rear-wheel drive configurations and so

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.280 
rear-wheel drive configurations and so
it<00:01:03.460> has<00:01:03.580> to<00:01:03.730> have<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.970> engine<00:01:04.120> setup<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.170> make

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
it has to have the engine setup to make

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.720 
it has to have the engine setup to make
me<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.740> most<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.220> package<00:01:06.550> in<00:01:06.670> the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
me the most of the package in the

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.390 
me the most of the package in the
availability<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.360> space<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:09.040> in<00:01:09.160> order<00:01:09.250> to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
availability of space so in order to

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.010 
availability of space so in order to
give<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> requirements<00:01:10.510> that<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.660> customer

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
give the requirements that the customer

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.990 
give the requirements that the customer
needed<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:11.620> engine<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.460> intake<00:01:12.790> system

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
needed the engine and the intake system

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.850 
needed the engine and the intake system
and<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.420> exhaust<00:01:13.720> system<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.260> all<00:01:14.410> unique<00:01:14.650> to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
and the exhaust system is all unique to

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.980 
and the exhaust system is all unique to
this<00:01:14.950> vehicle<00:01:15.490> which<00:01:16.120> then<00:01:16.330> all<00:01:16.480> feeds<00:01:16.810> into

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
this vehicle which then all feeds into

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.330 
this vehicle which then all feeds into
what<00:01:17.170> we<00:01:17.380> do<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.770> engine<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.190> how<00:01:18.280> we

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
what we do in the engine and how we

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.950 
what we do in the engine and how we
calibrate<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:20.010> we<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:22.420> things<00:01:22.570> like<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:22.930> a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
calibrate it we use things like this a

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.750 
calibrate it we use things like this a
dinette<00:01:23.260> trailer<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:24.070> load<00:01:24.220> up<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.460> vehicle

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
dinette trailer to load up the vehicle

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.020 
dinette trailer to load up the vehicle
as<00:01:24.850> much<00:01:25.030> as<00:01:25.150> possible<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:27.730> particular

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
as much as possible in this particular

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.200 
as much as possible in this particular
test<00:01:28.450> we're<00:01:28.780> testing<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.680> engine<00:01:30.310> at<00:01:30.790> maximum

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
test we're testing the engine at maximum

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.140 
test we're testing the engine at maximum
stress<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:32.619> basically<00:01:33.160> like<00:01:33.490> towing<00:01:33.940> a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
stress this is basically like towing a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.090 
stress this is basically like towing a
maximum<00:01:34.630> load<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.560> you're<00:01:35.650> towing<00:01:35.830> something

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
maximum load so you're towing something

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.040 
maximum load so you're towing something
so<00:01:36.460> heavy<00:01:36.729> or<00:01:37.030> up<00:01:37.150> a<00:01:37.270> hill<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.690> car<00:01:37.930> is

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
so heavy or up a hill that the car is

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.990 
so heavy or up a hill that the car is
actually<00:01:38.350> slowing<00:01:38.619> down<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.640> have<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.850> pull

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
actually slowing down you have to pull

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.900 
actually slowing down you have to pull
it<00:01:40.090> down<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.660> get<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.869> up<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.110> hill

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
it down here to get it up a hill

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.270 
it down here to get it up a hill
fuels<00:01:43.480> vary<00:01:43.780> wildly<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.590> all<00:01:44.680> these<00:01:44.890> fuels

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
fuels vary wildly and all these fuels

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.310 
fuels vary wildly and all these fuels
have<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.610> different<00:01:46.210> ratio<00:01:46.480> which<00:01:46.900> they<00:01:47.080> burn

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
have a different ratio which they burn

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.930 
have a different ratio which they burn
they're<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:48.040> different<00:01:48.250> stoichiometric

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
they're so different stoichiometric

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.820 
they're so different stoichiometric
ratio<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.050> need<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.200> make<00:01:50.410> sure<00:01:50.620> the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
ratio and so we need to make sure the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.520 
ratio and so we need to make sure the
engine<00:01:51.250> can<00:01:51.520> cope<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.420> operate<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:53.260> up<00:01:53.350> top

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
engine can cope and operate to up top

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.950 
engine can cope and operate to up top
term<00:01:53.740> under<00:01:54.220> any<00:01:54.370> conditions<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:55.570> means<00:01:55.840> we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
term under any conditions this means we

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.090
