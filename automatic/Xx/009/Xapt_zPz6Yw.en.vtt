00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.590
 hello very good to all friends of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.809
 youtube is your friend the cry and this time 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.059
 I bring you the continuation or a second 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.849
 tutorial to set up your TV by 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.509
 medium of the hdmi cable to play as they can 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.430
 watch 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.860
 well my TV and I changed it is not 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.110
 the sony bravia I had with easier 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:28.400
 accessibility for this rd 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.400
 the hdmi but it's still projected 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.160
 by hdmi and the process is a bit 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.970
 different but it's the simplest 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.930
 so then the only thing we are going to do 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.290
 is to go to our play and look for the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.390
 the option that says system settings 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.239
 you have not found this we're going to let's 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.730
 to look for the option here in 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.450
 control by hdmi and the only thing we're going to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.030
 to do is to put it in if it's going to look like 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.000
 a system that although the system is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.890
 activated to interact with speech 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 if you want more than three see more total 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.470
 they give him ok and ready now what he's going 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.550
 to pass is for example that if I arrive 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.580
 turn off the TV 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.840
 with good watch now 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.370
 and you have to be on, I'm going to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.370
 turn off the television you need 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.350
 the play will start by power and it's going to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.350
 pay 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.240
 but there is not so much light but it's that I'm 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.040
 recording this well in the cures ok 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.310
 Once this is turned off, let's turn it on again 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310
 play 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.110
 let's give the signal to telepresence 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.770
 mentioned with but as I say now 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 I also have many 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.570
 will learn automatically 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.970
 and will learn in the channel that they have 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 let for example I crystal I left it 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.710
 here the logo where the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.810
 play but it's not like the last method 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.180
 that it turned on and went directly to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.720
 channel where you had connected the play 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.479
 This is the only fault with the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.190
 televisions that are not sony bravia of the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.470
 same brand of play 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.370
 but it is one of the ways we 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.050
 to configure this hdmi method and 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.760
 obviously 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.160
 once this is configured 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.530
 hdmi control you can not change the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.910
 channel by mistake you're going to have to give it 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.400
 input and this and get out there is no put tv 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.690
 Well I hope if they dislike it 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.130
 Any doubt in the comments already 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.680
 you know here is my d 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.910

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.710
 what to add and have doubts 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.560
 the TV that I already have, I do not know if I already 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:56.440

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.450
