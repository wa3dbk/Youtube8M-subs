nutrition<00:02:15.300> but<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.170> has<00:02:16.380> been<00:02:16.530> interesting<00:02:16.740> to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
nutrition but it has been interesting to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.850 
nutrition but it has been interesting to
play<00:02:17.610> around<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.240> app<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.660> see<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
play around with the app and see the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.809 
play around with the app and see the
functionality<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.640> how<00:02:20.819> easy<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.819> it

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
functionality and how easy it is and it

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.760 
functionality and how easy it is and it
sort<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.510> only<00:02:24.690> shows<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.470> how<00:02:25.560> many

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
sort of not only shows you how many

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.589 
sort of not only shows you how many
calories<00:02:25.920> you've<00:02:26.310> eaten<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.180> sort<00:02:27.569> of

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
calories you've eaten but it sort of

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.540 
calories you've eaten but it sort of
gives<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> food<00:02:28.530> score<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.280> actually

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
gives you a food score so you actually

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.160 
gives you a food score so you actually
know<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.060> quality<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.510> food<00:02:30.870> you're<00:02:31.110> eating

know the quality of food you're eating

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.229 
know the quality of food you're eating
so<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.160> found<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.819> quite<00:02:33.060> interesting

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
so I found that quite interesting

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.610 
so I found that quite interesting
fantastic<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.360> didn't<00:02:36.600> know<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> did<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.989> um

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
fantastic I didn't know it did that um

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.420 
fantastic I didn't know it did that um
and<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:39.720> based<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.140> some<00:02:40.440> kind<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.860> American

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
and it's based on some kind of American

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.820 
and it's based on some kind of American
guidelines<00:02:41.880> i<00:02:42.060> guess<00:02:42.239> but<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.290> pretty<00:02:43.620> good

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
guidelines i guess but it's pretty good

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
guidelines i guess but it's pretty good
i<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.099> quite<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.489> bit<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.760> nutrition<00:02:45.330> about

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
i know quite a bit of nutrition about

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.620 
i know quite a bit of nutrition about
nutrition<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.709> seems<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.670> seems<00:02:47.880> legit<00:02:48.330> so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
nutrition and it seems it seems legit so

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.270 
nutrition and it seems it seems legit so
it's<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.590> all<00:02:49.800> right<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:50.100> me<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:51.110> also<00:02:52.280> if

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
it's it's all right for me and also if

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.400 
it's it's all right for me and also if
people<00:02:53.940> use<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.120> lot<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.690> people<00:02:54.959> use<00:02:55.200> my

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
people use a lot of people use my

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.110 
people use a lot of people use my
fitness<00:02:55.620> pal<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:56.130> nutrition<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.700> syncs<00:02:57.000> with

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
fitness pal for nutrition it syncs with

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.520 
fitness pal for nutrition it syncs with
that<00:02:57.330> as<00:02:57.480> well<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.930> don't<00:02:58.110> have<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.319> do<00:02:58.440> it

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that as well so you don't have to do it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.580 
that as well so you don't have to do it
twice<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.600> also<00:03:00.900> sings<00:03:01.230> with<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> lot

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
twice and and it also sings with a lot

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.729 
twice and and it also sings with a lot
of<00:03:01.620> other<00:03:01.860> fitness<00:03:02.519> apps<00:03:03.299> like<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.140> strava

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
it I was hesitant at first to like start

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.920 
it I was hesitant at first to like start
missing<00:03:38.519> with<00:03:38.640> nutrition<00:03:39.239> because<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.660> don't

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
missing with nutrition because I I don't

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.380 
missing with nutrition because I I don't
usually<00:03:40.079> track<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:41.370> then<00:03:41.519> once<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:41.910> tried<00:03:42.209> it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
usually track but then once I tried it

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.750 
usually track but then once I tried it
out<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.870> saw<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.739> was<00:03:43.920> sort<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.160> very<00:03:44.310> easy

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
out I saw that it was sort of very easy

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.300 
out I saw that it was sort of very easy
and<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.239> interface<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:46.049> lot<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.470> fun<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.709> it

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
and the interface is a lot of fun and it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.630 
and the interface is a lot of fun and it
sort<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.970> makes<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.420> easy<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.440> fun<00:03:50.340> at<00:03:50.579> the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
sort of it makes it easy and fun at the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.819 
sort of it makes it easy and fun at the
same<00:03:50.700> time<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.390> it's<00:03:51.570> sort<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.290> leaves<00:03:52.560> quite
