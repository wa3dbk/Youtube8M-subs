welcome to another weekly Lightroom edit

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.230 
welcome to another weekly Lightroom edit
now<00:00:17.860> I<00:00:17.890> shot<00:00:18.310> this<00:00:18.430> image<00:00:18.610> out<00:00:18.880> in<00:00:19.030> China

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
now I shot this image out in China

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.210 
now I shot this image out in China
obviously<00:00:20.020> if<00:00:20.500> you<00:00:20.590> guys<00:00:20.710> haven't<00:00:20.920> figured

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
obviously if you guys haven't figured

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.400 
obviously if you guys haven't figured
that<00:00:21.250> out<00:00:21.340> by<00:00:21.550> now<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.990> I<00:00:23.080> thought<00:00:23.260> it<00:00:23.349> was

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
that out by now and I thought it was

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.019 
that out by now and I thought it was
really<00:00:23.650> cool<00:00:23.920> and<00:00:24.189> you<00:00:24.460> guys<00:00:24.580> probably<00:00:24.730> know

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
really cool and you guys probably know

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.700 
really cool and you guys probably know
why<00:00:25.210> but<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.660> thought<00:00:26.200> was<00:00:26.349> really<00:00:26.470> cool

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
why but I thought was really cool

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.800 
why but I thought was really cool
because<00:00:26.890> this<00:00:27.099> has<00:00:27.279> got<00:00:27.340> to<00:00:27.640> be<00:00:27.670> one<00:00:28.660> of<00:00:28.689> the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
because this has got to be one of the

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.780 
because this has got to be one of the
most<00:00:28.960> patriotic<00:00:29.500> groups<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.279> fishermen<00:00:30.550> I've

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
most patriotic groups of fishermen I've

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.090 
most patriotic groups of fishermen I've
ever<00:00:30.910> seen<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:31.390> they're<00:00:32.349> just<00:00:32.560> there<00:00:32.800> their

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
ever seen and they're just there their

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.830 
ever seen and they're just there their
boats<00:00:33.340> are<00:00:33.489> just<00:00:33.640> littered<00:00:34.120> with<00:00:34.149> red<00:00:34.570> and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
boats are just littered with red and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.600 
boats are just littered with red and
with<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.079> Chinese<00:00:35.770> flag<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.370> with

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
with the Chinese flag and with

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.790 
with the Chinese flag and with
everything<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.510> was<00:00:37.630> awesome<00:00:37.930> very<00:00:38.530> very

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
everything that was awesome very very

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.490 
everything that was awesome very very
kind<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.190> just<00:00:39.910> had<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.180> Chinese<00:00:40.780> feel<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.260> it

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
kind of just had that Chinese feel to it

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.280 
kind of just had that Chinese feel to it
so<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.520> shot<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.000> image<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.480> let's<00:00:43.960> go<00:00:44.110> over

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
so I shot the image and let's go over

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.100 
so I shot the image and let's go over
how<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.829> was<00:00:44.950> shot<00:00:45.219> I<00:00:45.520> shot<00:00:46.180> on<00:00:46.420> my<00:00:46.510> Canon<00:00:46.870> 5d

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
how it was shot I shot on my Canon 5d

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.980 
how it was shot I shot on my Canon 5d
Mark<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.820> once<00:00:48.820> again<00:00:48.940> shot<00:00:49.300> full<00:00:49.600> Ross<00:00:49.810> I

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
Mark to once again shot full Ross I

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.480 
Mark to once again shot full Ross I
could<00:00:50.110> have<00:00:50.410> my<00:00:50.530> freedom<00:00:50.830> in<00:00:50.920> cropping<00:00:51.160> later

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
could have my freedom in cropping later

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.800 
could have my freedom in cropping later
on<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.030> then<00:00:52.750> we<00:00:53.500> shot<00:00:53.740> at<00:00:53.950> one<00:00:54.450> 250<00:00:55.450> point<00:00:55.660> 8

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
on and then we shot at one 250 point 8

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.610 
on and then we shot at one 250 point 8
iso<00:00:56.350> 200<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.940> on<00:00:58.090> our<00:00:58.180> 72<00:00:58.540> millimeter<00:00:58.960> lens<00:00:59.200> so

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
iso 200 and on our 72 millimeter lens so

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.710 
iso 200 and on our 72 millimeter lens so
zoom<00:01:00.100> back<00:01:00.220> quite<00:01:00.490> far<00:01:00.520> are<00:01:01.300> standing<00:01:01.630> back

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
zoom back quite far are standing back

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.569 
zoom back quite far are standing back
quite<00:01:01.960> far<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.170> zoomed<00:01:02.530> all<00:01:02.740> the<00:01:02.770> way<00:01:02.860> in<00:01:03.130> and

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
quite far and zoomed all the way in and

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.130 
quite far and zoomed all the way in and
the<00:01:03.850> reason<00:01:04.000> why<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:04.210> often<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.900> even

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the reason why I often do that even

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.210 
the reason why I often do that even
though<00:01:05.229> it's<00:01:05.409> not<00:01:05.500> necessary<00:01:05.890> these<00:01:06.009> boats

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
though it's not necessary these boats

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.980 
though it's not necessary these boats
weren't<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.850> far<00:01:07.060> away<00:01:07.210> actually<00:01:07.630> stood

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
weren't that far away actually stood

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.080 
weren't that far away actually stood
back<00:01:08.170> further<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:09.520> basically<00:01:09.790> just<00:01:09.909> to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
back further was basically just to

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.569 
back further was basically just to
compress<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:11.710> background<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.369> pull

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
compress that that background to pull

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.130 
compress that that background to pull
the<00:01:12.729> background<00:01:13.149> in<00:01:13.360> and<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.630> make<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:13.899> look

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
the background in and to make it look

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.139 
the background in and to make it look
like<00:01:14.320> these<00:01:14.500> boats<00:01:14.710> were<00:01:14.860> much<00:01:15.610> closer<00:01:15.939> to

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
like these boats were much closer to

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.550 
like these boats were much closer to
they<00:01:16.270> are<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.990> each<00:01:17.110> other<00:01:17.320> than<00:01:17.500> they

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
they are to each other than they

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.070 
they are to each other than they
actually<00:01:17.860> were<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:19.210> gives<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.450> nice<00:01:19.659> kind<00:01:19.930> of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
actually were it gives a nice kind of

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.310 
actually were it gives a nice kind of
that<00:01:20.740> that<00:01:21.190> lens<00:01:22.000> distortion<00:01:22.540> compression<00:01:23.110> in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
that that lens distortion compression in

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.110 
that that lens distortion compression in
the<00:01:23.380> background<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.580> that's<00:01:24.850> kind<00:01:25.090> of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
the background so that's kind of

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.230 
the background so that's kind of
oftentimes<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.780> trick<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.229> I'll<00:01:26.320> use<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.400> want

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
oftentimes a trick that I'll use so want

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.730 
oftentimes a trick that I'll use so want
to<00:01:28.300> shot<00:01:28.450> this<00:01:28.630> image<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:29.170> mean<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:29.350> actually

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
to shot this image I mean I actually

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.890 
to shot this image I mean I actually
remove<00:01:30.190> my<00:01:30.310> information<00:01:30.850> when<00:01:31.540> I<00:01:31.570> shot<00:01:31.780> this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
remove my information when I shot this

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.260 
remove my information when I shot this
image<00:01:32.049> I<00:01:32.290> thought<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:33.670> image<00:01:33.970> would<00:01:34.090> look

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
image I thought this image would look

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.620 
image I thought this image would look
great<00:01:34.720> kind<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.290> as<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.920> know<00:01:36.820> not<00:01:37.090> black<00:01:37.479> and

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
great kind of as you know not black and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.780 
great kind of as you know not black and
white<00:01:37.690> but<00:01:37.840> just<00:01:38.290> kind<00:01:39.040> of<00:01:39.100> vintage<00:01:39.400> tone

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
white but just kind of vintage tone

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.310 
white but just kind of vintage tone
except<00:01:40.240> for<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> red<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> really<00:01:41.080> want<00:01:41.260> that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
except for the red I really want that

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.530 
except for the red I really want that
red<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.799> pop<00:01:42.040> because<00:01:42.370> that's<00:01:42.580> what<00:01:42.850> this

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
red to pop because that's what this

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.030 
red to pop because that's what this
image<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:43.900> kind<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.170> all<00:01:44.320> about<00:01:44.470> just<00:01:44.920> that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
image is kind of all about just that

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.680 
image is kind of all about just that
patriotism<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.090> everything<00:01:46.299> like<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.450> so

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
patriotism and everything like that so

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.390 
patriotism and everything like that so
that's<00:01:47.409> how<00:01:47.590> I'm<00:01:47.650> going<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.799> produce<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.220> so

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
that's how I'm going to produce it so

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.590 
that's how I'm going to produce it so
let's<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.119> started

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
let's get started

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.240 
let's get started
I'm<00:01:49.720> gonna<00:01:49.900> adjust<00:01:50.409> my<00:01:50.590> white<00:01:50.770> balance<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.130> a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
I'm gonna adjust my white balance just a

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.100 
I'm gonna adjust my white balance just a
tiny<00:01:51.430> bit<00:01:51.640> up<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:52.299> let's<00:01:52.690> go<00:01:52.810> up<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:52.990> about

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
tiny bit up to let's go up to about

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.440 
tiny bit up to let's go up to about
5,000<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.070> then<00:01:54.610> let's<00:01:54.790> take<00:01:54.940> our<00:01:55.150> brightness

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
5,000 and then let's take our brightness

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.289 
5,000 and then let's take our brightness
up<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.470> start<00:01:57.190> bringing<00:01:57.460> our<00:01:57.670> blacks<00:01:57.970> into

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
up and start bringing our blacks into

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.960 
up and start bringing our blacks into
the<00:01:58.390> image<00:01:59.220> go<00:02:00.220> brightness<00:02:00.549> up<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.729> little<00:02:00.850> bit

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
the image go brightness up a little bit

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.210 
the image go brightness up a little bit
more<00:02:01.260> that<00:02:02.260> looks<00:02:02.470> about<00:02:02.590> right<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:03.040> don't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
more that looks about right I don't

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.160 
more that looks about right I don't
really<00:02:03.520> need<00:02:03.760> any<00:02:03.970> fill<00:02:04.299> light<00:02:04.510> if<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.780> feel

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
really need any fill light if I feel

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.510 
really need any fill light if I feel
like<00:02:05.320> it's<00:02:05.470> only<00:02:05.650> gonna<00:02:05.830> serve<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.250> kind<00:02:06.430> of

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
like it's only gonna serve to kind of

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.219 
like it's only gonna serve to kind of
decrease<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.479> drama<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> image<00:02:08.049> so<00:02:08.110> I'm

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
decrease the drama of the image so I'm

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.229 
decrease the drama of the image so I'm
not<00:02:08.319> gonna<00:02:08.470> add<00:02:08.619> any<00:02:08.769> fill<00:02:08.979> light<00:02:09.239> recovery

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
not gonna add any fill light recovery

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.820 
not gonna add any fill light recovery
will<00:02:10.450> use<00:02:10.659> if<00:02:10.840> we<00:02:10.959> really<00:02:11.230> need<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.500> but<00:02:11.709> right

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
will use if we really need to but right

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.350 
will use if we really need to but right
now<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.069> looks<00:02:12.099> fine<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.790> contrast<00:02:13.239> is

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
now it looks fine and the contrast is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.490 
now it looks fine and the contrast is
great<00:02:13.599> I'm<00:02:13.720> actually<00:02:13.840> gonna<00:02:14.080> boost<00:02:14.319> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
great I'm actually gonna boost the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.670 
great I'm actually gonna boost the
contrast<00:02:14.680> more<00:02:15.599> again<00:02:16.599> there's<00:02:16.780> no<00:02:16.930> faces<00:02:17.590> in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
contrast more again there's no faces in

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.899 
contrast more again there's no faces in
the<00:02:17.769> image<00:02:17.980> there's<00:02:18.189> nothing<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.610> I'm

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
the image there's nothing that I'm

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.030 
the image there's nothing that I'm
really<00:02:19.330> worried<00:02:19.750> about<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.439> know<00:02:20.470> super

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
really worried about like you know super

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.140 
really worried about like you know super
strong<00:02:21.250> highlights<00:02:21.700> or<00:02:21.819> anything<00:02:21.939> like<00:02:22.090> that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
strong highlights or anything like that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.300 
strong highlights or anything like that
so<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.750> don't<00:02:23.169> have<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.409> need<00:02:23.680> for<00:02:23.859> recovery<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
so I don't have a need for recovery and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.770 
so I don't have a need for recovery and
I<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.549> also<00:02:24.669> boost<00:02:24.999> contrast<00:02:25.680> significant

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
I can also boost contrast significant

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.699 
I can also boost contrast significant
without<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.110> worrying<00:02:27.319> about<00:02:27.500> that

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
without really worrying about that

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.880 
without really worrying about that
either<00:02:28.100> let's<00:02:29.000> take<00:02:29.330> Rick<00:02:29.780> clarity<00:02:30.590> all<00:02:30.740> up

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
either let's take Rick clarity all up

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.230 
either let's take Rick clarity all up
200<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:31.430> if<00:02:31.490> we<00:02:31.550> have<00:02:31.670> any<00:02:31.819> fringing

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
200 and see if we have any fringing

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.480 
200 and see if we have any fringing
because<00:02:33.080> if<00:02:33.380> we<00:02:33.500> do<00:02:33.740> I'm<00:02:33.860> gonna<00:02:33.950> pull<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.310> back

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
because if we do I'm gonna pull it back

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.550 
because if we do I'm gonna pull it back
but<00:02:34.730> if<00:02:34.850> not<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.360> want<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.600> keep<00:02:35.750> clarity<00:02:36.470> as

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
but if not I want to keep clarity as

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.050 
but if not I want to keep clarity as
high<00:02:36.740> as<00:02:36.920> possible<00:02:37.400> without<00:02:37.520> having<00:02:37.760> any

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
high as possible without having any

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.850 
high as possible without having any
fringing<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.510> looks<00:02:38.660> like<00:02:38.750> about<00:02:38.840> plus<00:02:39.200> 60<00:02:39.680> is

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
fringing it looks like about plus 60 is

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.260 
fringing it looks like about plus 60 is
the<00:02:40.490> point<00:02:40.880> where<00:02:40.970> we<00:02:41.030> start<00:02:41.240> getting

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
the point where we start getting

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.330 
the point where we start getting
fringing<00:02:41.810> on<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.500> edge<00:02:42.709> right<00:02:42.920> here<00:02:42.980> so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
fringing on this edge right here so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.370 
fringing on this edge right here so
we'll<00:02:43.489> leave<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.700> right<00:02:43.910> there<00:02:44.140> all<00:02:45.140> I'm<00:02:45.290> gonna

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
we'll leave it right there all I'm gonna

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.660 
we'll leave it right there all I'm gonna
do<00:02:45.530> next<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:46.040> we're<00:02:46.250> going<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.400> take<00:02:46.520> our

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
do next is we're going to take our

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.610 
do next is we're going to take our
vibrance<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.300> again<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.840> want<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> red<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.410> be

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
vibrance up again I want the red to be

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.860 
vibrance up again I want the red to be
super<00:02:48.920> punchy<00:02:49.310> we're<00:02:50.270> also<00:02:50.390> gonna<00:02:50.510> take<00:02:50.720> up

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
super punchy we're also gonna take up

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.840 
super punchy we're also gonna take up
our<00:02:50.989> saturation<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.100> I'll<00:02:52.489> show<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.760> what

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
our saturation and I'll show you what

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.130 
our saturation and I'll show you what
we're<00:02:52.940> gonna<00:02:53.030> do<00:02:53.209> with<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.480> I'm<00:02:53.780> not<00:02:53.959> gonna

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
we're gonna do with this I'm not gonna

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.330 
we're gonna do with this I'm not gonna
leave<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.680> saturate<00:02:55.040> because<00:02:55.220> obviously

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
leave it this saturate because obviously

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.559 
leave it this saturate because obviously
it<00:02:55.580> doesn't<00:02:55.790> look<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:55.910> great<00:02:56.209> when<00:02:56.450> it's

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
it doesn't look that great when it's

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.720 
it doesn't look that great when it's
supersaturated<00:02:57.140> like<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.430> what<00:02:58.610> we're

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
supersaturated like this so what we're

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.860 
supersaturated like this so what we're
gonna<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.209> I'm<00:02:59.300> going<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.450> close<00:02:59.630> up<00:02:59.660> my

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
gonna do is I'm going to close up my

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.979 
gonna do is I'm going to close up my
basic<00:03:01.060> panel<00:03:02.060> now<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.420> we're<00:03:02.510> gonna<00:03:02.570> go<00:03:02.810> down

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
basic panel now and we're gonna go down

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.670 
basic panel now and we're gonna go down
to<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:04.220> HSL<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.090> right<00:03:05.269> there<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:06.500> we're

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
to the HSL so right there and we're

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.750 
to the HSL so right there and we're
going<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.860> do<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.010> basically<00:03:07.160> just<00:03:07.340> pull<00:03:07.730> down

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
going to do is basically just pull down

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.150 
going to do is basically just pull down
the<00:03:08.120> saturation<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.780> these<00:03:08.930> other<00:03:09.110> colors<00:03:09.320> now

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
the saturation of these other colors now

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.620 
the saturation of these other colors now
the<00:03:10.550> easiest<00:03:10.760> way<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:10.910> do<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.480> to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
the easiest way to do that is just to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.320 
the easiest way to do that is just to
click<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.110> your<00:03:12.380> little<00:03:12.980> adjustment<00:03:13.580> tool

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330

I don't want to do is kill all the other
color<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.890> just<00:03:21.920> want<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.280> pull<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:22.670> out<00:03:22.790> a

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
color I just want to pull it out a

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.420 
color I just want to pull it out a
little<00:03:23.090> bit<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.709> I'm<00:03:24.709> going<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.860> do<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.130> just<00:03:25.340> uh

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
little bit so I'm going to do is just uh

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.979 
little bit so I'm going to do is just uh
and<00:03:25.880> what<00:03:26.180> might<00:03:26.300> be<00:03:26.420> easier<00:03:26.810> actually

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
and what might be easier actually

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.320 
and what might be easier actually
because<00:03:27.459> when<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.550> click<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:28.940> drag<00:03:28.970> it's

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
because when you click and drag it's

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.390 
because when you click and drag it's
usually<00:03:29.450> affecting<00:03:30.019> one<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.769> two<00:03:30.950> colors<00:03:31.130> at<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
usually affecting one to two colors at a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.699 
usually affecting one to two colors at a
time<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.120> want<00:03:32.360> it<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.110> kind<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.380> affect

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
time and I want it to kind of affect

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.840 
time and I want it to kind of affect
them<00:03:33.829> evenly<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.310> I'm<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:34.459> gonna<00:03:34.579> pull<00:03:34.820> down

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.850 
them evenly so I'm just gonna pull down
the<00:03:35.150> yellows<00:03:35.480> I'm<00:03:36.260> gonna<00:03:36.440> pull<00:03:36.620> down<00:03:36.650> the

greens I'm gonna pull down the Blues a
little<00:03:39.350> bit<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:40.549> then<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:42.290> know<00:03:42.410> we<00:03:42.560> can

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
little bit and then the you know we can

Purple's a magentas you don't really
have<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.570> much<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.320> doesn't<00:03:45.530> really

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
have that much of so it doesn't really

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.360 
have that much of so it doesn't really
matter<00:03:45.799> if<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.010> drop<00:03:46.250> them<00:03:46.690> significantly<00:03:48.370> we

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
matter if you drop them significantly we

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.650 
matter if you drop them significantly we
do<00:03:49.519> want<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.760> keep<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.060> oranges<00:03:50.360> because<00:03:50.570> if

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
do want to keep the oranges because if

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.970 
do want to keep the oranges because if
you<00:03:50.750> notice<00:03:50.900> if<00:03:51.200> we<00:03:51.290> pull<00:03:51.440> down<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.650> oranges

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
you notice if we pull down the oranges

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.860 
you notice if we pull down the oranges
that<00:03:52.010> affects<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.519> Reds<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.420> we<00:03:53.510> want<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.720> keep

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
that affects the Reds so we want to keep

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.720 
that affects the Reds so we want to keep

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
just a tiny bit and then I might want to

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.940 
just a tiny bit and then I might want to
boost<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.920> Reds<00:03:58.100> just<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.400> tiny<00:03:58.549> bit<00:03:59.739> all<00:04:00.739> right

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
in it but again it's very kind of just

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.210 
in it but again it's very kind of just
poppy<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:18.109> see<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.410> red<00:04:18.709> just<00:04:18.859> all<00:04:19.070> over

poppy and you see that red just all over
the<00:04:19.370> place<00:04:19.419> so<00:04:20.419> let's<00:04:20.810> do<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.049> little<00:04:21.260> more<00:04:21.440> make

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
the place so let's do a little more make

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.620 
the place so let's do a little more make
it<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.859> image<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.220> little<00:04:22.340> more<00:04:22.580> gritty<00:04:22.820> so

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
it this image a little more gritty so

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.260 
it this image a little more gritty so
I'm<00:04:23.750> gonna<00:04:23.870> go<00:04:24.050> down<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.530> my<00:04:24.800> detail<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.640> let's

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
I'm gonna go down to my detail and let's

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.140 
I'm gonna go down to my detail and let's
enhance<00:04:26.539> and<00:04:27.200> sharpen<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.680> image<00:04:27.919> so<00:04:28.789> let's

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
enhance and sharpen the image so let's

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.390 
enhance and sharpen the image so let's
zoom<00:04:29.450> in<00:04:29.570> on<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.690> point<00:04:30.289> so<00:04:30.470> we<00:04:30.560> can<00:04:30.590> see<00:04:30.919> where

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
zoom in on a point so we can see where

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.250 
zoom in on a point so we can see where
it's<00:04:31.520> at<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:31.940> we'll<00:04:32.450> start<00:04:32.750> again<00:04:32.870> with<00:04:33.140> my

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
it's at and we'll start again with my

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.140 
it's at and we'll start again with my
defaults<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.160> see<00:04:34.490> where<00:04:34.669> we're<00:04:34.789> at<00:04:34.820> from

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
defaults and see where we're at from

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.589 
defaults and see where we're at from
there<00:04:36.610> okay<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.760> like<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.030> I'm<00:04:38.210> gonna<00:04:38.330> go<00:04:38.479> even

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
there okay I like that I'm gonna go even

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:39.909 
there okay I like that I'm gonna go even
higher<00:04:38.900> because<00:04:39.110> again<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.530> want<00:04:39.710> this<00:04:39.770> image

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
higher because again I want this image

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:40.239 
higher because again I want this image
to<00:04:40.039> be

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249 
to be

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.139 
to be
very<00:04:40.399> very<00:04:40.549> gritty<00:04:40.879> very<00:04:41.289> uh<00:04:42.519> just<00:04:43.519> kind<00:04:44.089> of

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
adjustment brush to increase that detail

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.609 
adjustment brush to increase that detail
so<00:04:55.669> let's<00:04:56.059> reset<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.449> by<00:04:56.629> holding<00:04:56.959> alt<00:04:57.109> and

00:04:57.609 --> 00:04:57.619 
so let's reset it by holding alt and

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:00.069 
so let's reset it by holding alt and
click<00:04:57.829> on<00:04:57.979> reset<00:04:58.339> and<00:04:58.669> then<00:04:59.449> we're<00:04:59.719> just<00:04:59.749> going

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:00.079 
click on reset and then we're just going

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:02.859 
click on reset and then we're just going
to<00:05:00.139> basically<00:05:00.949> increase<00:05:01.339> clarity<00:05:01.819> to<00:05:01.909> 100<00:05:02.359> and

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:02.869 
to basically increase clarity to 100 and

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.219 
to basically increase clarity to 100 and
cleave<00:05:03.169> sharpness<00:05:03.709> a<00:05:03.919> little<00:05:04.249> bit<00:05:04.339> more<00:05:05.229> and

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
cleave sharpness a little bit more and

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.999 
cleave sharpness a little bit more and
we're<00:05:06.379> gonna<00:05:06.469> go<00:05:06.709> right<00:05:06.979> over<00:05:07.009> these<00:05:07.489> boats

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
we're gonna go right over these boats

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.139 
we're gonna go right over these boats
again<00:05:10.009> I'm<00:05:10.069> gonna<00:05:10.189> remove<00:05:10.459> it<00:05:10.639> from<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:10.939> edges

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:11.149 
again I'm gonna remove it from the edges

and we're gonna add some grain let's

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.149 
and we're gonna add some grain let's
zoom<00:05:58.849> in<00:05:58.999> just<00:05:59.089> so<00:05:59.179> we<00:05:59.269> can<00:05:59.360> kind<00:05:59.509> of<00:05:59.599> see<00:05:59.839> it

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
zoom in just so we can kind of see it

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.319 
zoom in just so we can kind of see it
and<00:06:01.159> let's<00:06:01.579> start<00:06:02.649> we'll<00:06:03.649> start<00:06:03.919> with<00:06:04.039> about

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:04.329 
and let's start we'll start with about

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:07.389 
and let's start we'll start with about
+61<00:06:05.329> that<00:06:06.049> size<00:06:06.469> to<00:06:06.679> be<00:06:06.739> a<00:06:06.769> little<00:06:07.009> bit<00:06:07.099> smaller

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:07.399 
+61 that size to be a little bit smaller

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.459 
+61 that size to be a little bit smaller
and<00:06:07.789> the<00:06:08.539> roughness<00:06:08.779> to<00:06:08.929> be<00:06:09.139> a<00:06:09.169> little<00:06:09.319> bit

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
and the roughness to be a little bit

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.709 
and the roughness to be a little bit
smaller<00:06:09.709> as<00:06:09.889> well<00:06:10.209> let's<00:06:11.209> zoom<00:06:11.389> out<00:06:11.509> see<00:06:11.689> if

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
smaller as well let's zoom out see if

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.229 
smaller as well let's zoom out see if
it's<00:06:11.899> noticeable<00:06:12.439> yeah<00:06:13.429> looks<00:06:13.729> great<00:06:14.089> right

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:14.239

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:27.499 
just kind of adjust exposure around the

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:29.979 
just kind of adjust exposure around the
image<00:06:27.739> to<00:06:27.949> pull<00:06:28.189> the<00:06:28.659> attention<00:06:29.659> into<00:06:29.899> the

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:29.989 
image to pull the attention into the

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.049 
image to pull the attention into the
center<00:06:30.319> and<00:06:30.589> so<00:06:31.159> that's<00:06:31.429> exactly<00:06:31.699> what<00:06:31.819> I<00:06:31.909> do

00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:32.059 
center and so that's exactly what I do

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:33.729 
center and so that's exactly what I do
we're<00:06:32.209> just<00:06:32.239> gonna<00:06:32.419> add<00:06:32.629> a<00:06:32.659> couple<00:06:32.989> brushes<00:06:33.499> so

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:33.739 
we're just gonna add a couple brushes so

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:34.989 
we're just gonna add a couple brushes so
I'm<00:06:33.799> going<00:06:33.919> to<00:06:33.979> add<00:06:34.039> one<00:06:34.219> right<00:06:34.339> here<00:06:34.669> going

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:34.999 
I'm going to add one right here going

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:37.029 
I'm going to add one right here going
from<00:06:35.149> the<00:06:35.299> bottom<00:06:35.569> up<00:06:35.989> to<00:06:36.019> about<00:06:36.319> the<00:06:36.469> BA<00:06:36.619> base

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
from the bottom up to about the BA base

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.189 
from the bottom up to about the BA base
of<00:06:37.219> the<00:06:37.279> boat<00:06:37.539> so<00:06:38.539> the<00:06:38.629> midpoint<00:06:38.809> goes<00:06:39.110> at

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
of the boat so the midpoint goes at

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.929 
of the boat so the midpoint goes at
about<00:06:39.349> the<00:06:39.409> base<00:06:39.559> of<00:06:39.709> the<00:06:39.769> boat<00:06:39.919> and<00:06:40.159> then

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:40.939 
about the base of the boat and then

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.459 
about the base of the boat and then
we're<00:06:41.149> going<00:06:41.329> to<00:06:41.509> adjust<00:06:41.989> the<00:06:42.169> exposure<00:06:42.439> down

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:44.469 
we're going to adjust the exposure down

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.779 
we're going to adjust the exposure down
just<00:06:45.469> to<00:06:45.529> the<00:06:45.619> point<00:06:45.769> where<00:06:45.979> it<00:06:46.189> and<00:06:46.339> wanted<00:06:46.699> to

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
just to the point where it and wanted to

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.309 
just to the point where it and wanted to
obviously<00:06:47.179> still<00:06:47.449> look<00:06:47.599> natural<00:06:47.959> so<00:06:47.989> I<00:06:48.169> don't

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
obviously still look natural so I don't

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.069 
obviously still look natural so I don't
want<00:06:48.439> it<00:06:48.469> to<00:06:48.559> look<00:06:48.679> too<00:06:48.739> much<00:06:49.039> so<00:06:49.249> about<00:06:49.339> 0.88

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:50.079 
want it to look too much so about 0.88

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:52.959 
want it to look too much so about 0.88
0.78<00:06:51.079> is<00:06:51.229> around<00:06:51.469> where<00:06:51.709> I<00:06:51.769> want<00:06:51.979> it<00:06:52.099> again

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969 
0.78 is around where I want it again

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:54.100 
0.78 is around where I want it again
we're<00:06:53.059> gonna<00:06:53.149> do<00:06:53.269> the<00:06:53.360> same<00:06:53.479> thing<00:06:53.689> from<00:06:53.749> the

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
we're gonna do the same thing from the

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.170 
we're gonna do the same thing from the
pull<00:06:54.560> it<00:06:54.680> down<00:06:54.710> so<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.220> midpoint<00:06:55.550> touches

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
pull it down so the midpoint touches

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.369 
pull it down so the midpoint touches
just<00:06:57.110> kind<00:06:57.289> of<00:06:57.319> like<00:06:57.470> the<00:06:57.650> horizon<00:06:58.190> line<00:06:58.370> and

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379 
just kind of like the horizon line and

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.540 
just kind of like the horizon line and
then<00:07:00.379> we're<00:07:00.500> gonna<00:07:00.620> pull<00:07:00.889> that<00:07:01.069> back<00:07:01.310> a<00:07:01.340> little

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
then we're gonna pull that back a little

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.240 
then we're gonna pull that back a little
bit<00:07:01.699> to<00:07:01.940> get<00:07:02.900> not<00:07:03.110> too<00:07:03.409> much<00:07:03.620> only<00:07:03.979> one<00:07:04.099> a

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
bit to get not too much only one a

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.820 
bit to get not too much only one a
little<00:07:04.520> bit<00:07:04.669> a<00:07:05.139> little<00:07:06.139> bit<00:07:06.229> goes<00:07:06.379> a<00:07:06.409> long<00:07:06.620> way

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
little bit a little bit goes a long way

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.860 
little bit a little bit goes a long way
with<00:07:07.009> this<00:07:07.069> kind<00:07:07.280> of<00:07:07.340> stuff<00:07:07.550> so<00:07:07.720> always<00:07:08.720> keep

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
with this kind of stuff so always keep

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.360 
with this kind of stuff so always keep
it<00:07:08.990> very<00:07:09.139> subtle<00:07:09.500> kind<00:07:09.800> of<00:07:09.889> hand<00:07:10.099> when<00:07:10.220> you're

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
it very subtle kind of hand when you're

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.980 
it very subtle kind of hand when you're
adjusting<00:07:10.460> these<00:07:10.849> kind<00:07:11.030> of<00:07:11.060> things<00:07:11.270> I'm<00:07:11.900> gonna

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
adjusting these kind of things I'm gonna

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.089 
adjusting these kind of things I'm gonna
pull<00:07:12.199> it<00:07:12.259> down<00:07:12.379> just<00:07:12.409> a<00:07:12.590> little<00:07:12.620> more<00:07:12.919> so<00:07:13.039> it

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:13.099 
pull it down just a little more so it

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.670 
pull it down just a little more so it
looks<00:07:13.250> a<00:07:13.310> little<00:07:13.370> more<00:07:13.520> natural<00:07:14.379> it's<00:07:15.379> okay<00:07:15.620> if

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
looks a little more natural it's okay if

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.290 
looks a little more natural it's okay if
the<00:07:15.800> tops<00:07:16.039> of<00:07:16.129> the<00:07:16.220> boats<00:07:16.400> dark<00:07:16.669> in<00:07:16.789> a<00:07:16.849> tiny<00:07:17.030> bit

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
the tops of the boats dark in a tiny bit

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.659 
the tops of the boats dark in a tiny bit
it<00:07:17.539> won't<00:07:17.690> be<00:07:17.750> very<00:07:17.870> noticeable

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
it won't be very noticeable

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.279 
it won't be very noticeable
okay<00:07:19.669> let's<00:07:20.000> last<00:07:20.509> thing<00:07:20.720> go<00:07:20.840> down<00:07:20.960> our<00:07:21.110> lens

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:21.289 
okay let's last thing go down our lens

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.980 
okay let's last thing go down our lens
Corrections<00:07:21.770> and<00:07:22.360> I<00:07:23.360> think<00:07:23.750> I'm<00:07:23.870> gonna

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
Corrections and I think I'm gonna

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.689 
Corrections and I think I'm gonna
reverse<00:07:24.379> the<00:07:24.530> vignette<00:07:24.830> just<00:07:24.979> a<00:07:25.039> tiny<00:07:25.280> bit<00:07:25.520> and

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 
reverse the vignette just a tiny bit and

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.740 
reverse the vignette just a tiny bit and
then<00:07:25.849> pull<00:07:26.090> in<00:07:26.330> the<00:07:26.479> midpoint<00:07:28.479> let's<00:07:29.479> pull<00:07:29.690> in

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
then pull in the midpoint let's pull in

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.390 
then pull in the midpoint let's pull in
a<00:07:29.840> little<00:07:29.930> bit<00:07:30.110> less<00:07:30.319> and<00:07:30.770> do<00:07:30.949> a<00:07:30.979> little<00:07:31.280> bit

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
a little bit less and do a little bit

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.649 
a little bit less and do a little bit
less<00:07:31.580> on<00:07:31.789> here<00:07:32.860> all<00:07:33.860> right<00:07:34.009> and<00:07:34.449> that<00:07:35.449> looks

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:35.659 
less on here all right and that looks

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:37.990 
less on here all right and that looks
great<00:07:35.960> where<00:07:36.289> it's<00:07:36.409> at<00:07:36.650> if<00:07:36.949> I<00:07:37.280> want<00:07:37.580> I<00:07:37.729> can<00:07:37.789> add

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
great where it's at if I want I can add

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.430 
great where it's at if I want I can add
a<00:07:38.030> little<00:07:38.449> bit<00:07:38.629> of<00:07:38.659> split<00:07:38.900> toning<00:07:39.139> where<00:07:39.409> I

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 
a little bit of split toning where I

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.899 
a little bit of split toning where I
might<00:07:39.800> just<00:07:40.009> put<00:07:40.159> a<00:07:40.190> little<00:07:40.460> bit<00:07:40.550> of<00:07:40.669> Blues

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:40.909 
might just put a little bit of Blues

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.240 
might just put a little bit of Blues
into<00:07:41.120> my<00:07:41.240> shadows<00:07:41.659> just<00:07:41.900> to<00:07:42.620> give<00:07:42.830> it<00:07:42.949> a<00:07:43.039> nice

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.250 
into my shadows just to give it a nice

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.420 
into my shadows just to give it a nice
little<00:07:44.169> kind<00:07:45.169> of<00:07:45.259> added<00:07:45.710> little<00:07:45.949> touch<00:07:46.159> to<00:07:46.190> it

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430 
little kind of added little touch to it

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.670 
little kind of added little touch to it
it<00:07:46.729> adds<00:07:46.969> just<00:07:47.150> a<00:07:47.330> nice<00:07:47.509> I<00:07:47.870> don't<00:07:48.110> know<00:07:48.229> how<00:07:48.560> to

describe it but I like to oftentimes add
a<00:07:51.379> little<00:07:51.590> bit<00:07:51.710> of<00:07:51.740> blues<00:07:52.009> and<00:07:52.280> then<00:07:52.370> a<00:07:52.400> tiny

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:52.699 
a little bit of blues and then a tiny

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:54.369 
a little bit of blues and then a tiny
bit<00:07:52.969> of<00:07:53.150> maybe<00:07:53.300> yellows<00:07:53.690> into<00:07:53.900> the<00:07:53.990> highlights

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:54.379 
bit of maybe yellows into the highlights

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:56.499 
bit of maybe yellows into the highlights
it<00:07:55.069> kind<00:07:55.280> of<00:07:55.310> gives<00:07:55.490> it<00:07:55.580> a<00:07:55.699> very<00:07:55.729> editorial
