00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
got to port underneath just about here

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.299 
got to port underneath just about here
and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:54.090> two<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> side<00:00:55.230> along<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and then two in the side along with a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
and then two in the side along with a
card<00:00:56.670> reader<00:00:56.879> they're<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.719> conveniently

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
card reader they're really conveniently

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
card reader they're really conveniently
placed<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.640> only<00:00:59.820> problem<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
placed the only problem I have with the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.049 
placed the only problem I have with the
USB<00:01:00.989> hub<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.559> when<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.219> turn<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.489> monitor<00:01:02.940> on

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
USB hub is when you turn the monitor on

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.329 
USB hub is when you turn the monitor on
it<00:01:03.390> seems<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.199> disconnect<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.189> wet

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it seems to disconnect all of you wet

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.539 
it seems to disconnect all of you wet
all<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> USB<00:01:06.570> devices<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> few<00:01:08.130> seconds

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
all of the USB devices for a few seconds

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
all of the USB devices for a few seconds
I'm<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.600> sure<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:09.960> supposed<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I'm not sure if it's supposed to do that

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
I'm not sure if it's supposed to do that
but<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.310> annoying<00:01:11.790> especially<00:01:11.909> if

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
but it's really annoying especially if

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
but it's really annoying especially if
you've<00:01:12.600> got<00:01:12.810> things<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.350> hard<00:01:13.680> drives

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you've got things like hard drives

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.999 
you've got things like hard drives
connected<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.210> very<00:01:15.330> practical<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:16.200> all

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.710 

the<00:01:20.009> dell<00:01:20.250> u2410<00:01:21.240> has<00:01:22.009> plenty<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> inputs<00:01:23.720> VGA

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the dell u2410 has plenty of inputs VGA

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.270 
the dell u2410 has plenty of inputs VGA

to DVI inputs displayport hdmi component
and<00:01:29.460> composite<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.040> connect

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and composite so you can connect

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
and composite so you can connect
everything<00:01:32.729> you've<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.630> monitor

all at the same time it's got a kind of
cable<00:01:38.009> management<00:01:38.220> system<00:01:38.909> built<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.270> which

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
cable management system built in which

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
cable management system built in which
is<00:01:39.479> basically<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.380> hole<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.799> leg<00:01:41.070> for

is basically just a hole in the leg for

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
is basically just a hole in the leg for
all<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> cables<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> go<00:01:42.119> through<00:01:42.350> it's<00:01:43.350> easy

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
all the cables to go through it's easy

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.969 
all the cables to go through it's easy
to<00:01:43.770> change<00:01:44.670> from<00:01:45.470> through<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.649> different

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
to change from through the different

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.179 
to change from through the different

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
inputs using the on-screen display so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.609 
inputs using the on-screen display so
could<00:01:50.369> come<00:01:50.520> over<00:01:50.549> here<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:52.259> buttons

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
could come over here it's got buttons

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
could come over here it's got buttons
down<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> side<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.570> move<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.869> finger

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
down the side as you move your finger

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.170 
down the side as you move your finger
close<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> light<00:01:56.130> comes<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.610> which<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
close to one the light comes on which is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.380 
close to one the light comes on which is
really<00:01:57.360> cool<00:01:57.630> too<00:01:58.159> simple<00:01:59.159> blue<00:01:59.340> LEDs<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.299> when

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
really cool too simple blue LEDs so when

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.690 
really cool too simple blue LEDs so when
you<00:02:00.479> open<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> menu<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.610> of

very<00:03:33.329> slight<00:03:33.750> pink<00:03:34.410> glow<00:03:34.950> our<00:03:35.930> pink<00:03:36.930> tint<00:03:37.320> but

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
very slight pink glow our pink tint but

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.830 
very slight pink glow our pink tint but
I<00:03:37.920> can<00:03:38.190> only<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:38.970> notice<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.600> when<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
I can only really notice it when I

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.860 
I can only really notice it when I
compare<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.829> white<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:42.060> another<00:03:42.540> monitor

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
compare it to white on another monitor

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.780 
compare it to white on another monitor
so<00:03:43.440> maybe<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> other<00:03:44.040> monitor<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.670> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
so maybe it's the other monitor that to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.500 
so maybe it's the other monitor that to
do<00:03:44.940> blue<00:03:45.299> I'm<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.410> really<00:03:46.620> sure<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.360> it's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
do blue I'm not really sure and so it's

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.380 
do blue I'm not really sure and so it's
got<00:03:48.829> great<00:03:49.829> colors<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.400> contrast<00:03:50.610> the
