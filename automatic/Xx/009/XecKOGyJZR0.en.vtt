maybe buy your Hyper's that are
invincible<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.640> that's<00:00:58.640> not<00:00:58.790> why<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.360> thought

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
invincible and that's not why I thought

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.000 
invincible and that's not why I thought
it<00:01:00.379> would<00:01:00.470> be<00:01:00.559> interesting<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:01.129> show<00:01:03.010> what

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
it would be interesting to show what

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.410 
it would be interesting to show what

specific range on the care canceled

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.710 
specific range on the care canceled
where<00:01:17.110> it<00:01:18.110> will<00:01:18.229> cross<00:01:18.470> up<00:01:19.270> notice<00:01:20.270> I'm<00:01:20.570> using

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
going to start that from any of our

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.520 
going to start that from any of our
grabs<00:01:40.190> or<00:01:40.690> if<00:01:41.690> you<00:01:41.810> ever<00:01:41.899> hit<00:01:42.080> a<00:01:42.140> clothesline

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530

from<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.190> coma<00:01:43.369> for<00:01:43.490> with<00:01:44.000> Spencer<00:01:44.390> or<00:01:44.509> whatnot

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
from a coma for with Spencer or whatnot

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.080 
from a coma for with Spencer or whatnot
or<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.979> guess<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.789> nicest<00:01:47.660> part<00:01:47.899> would<00:01:48.050> be<00:01:49.090> you

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
or I guess the nicest part would be you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.180 
or I guess the nicest part would be you
think<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:51.170> can<00:01:51.289> keep<00:01:51.500> doing<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:51.950> over<00:01:52.009> and

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
think you can keep doing it over and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.609 
think you can keep doing it over and
over<00:01:52.340> again<00:01:52.690> if<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:53.810> know<00:01:53.960> that<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> opponent

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
over again if you know that the opponent

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.960 
over again if you know that the opponent
doesn't<00:01:54.740> have<00:01:54.979> any<00:01:55.130> invisible<00:01:55.369> moves<00:01:55.789> in<00:01:55.910> the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
doesn't have any invisible moves in the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.380 
doesn't have any invisible moves in the
air<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:57.530> can<00:01:57.709> go<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:57.950> town<00:01:58.160> now<00:01:58.880> what<00:01:59.030> happens

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
air you can go to town now what happens

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.859 
air you can go to town now what happens
when<00:01:59.569> you<00:01:59.630> have<00:02:00.729> back<00:02:01.729> recovery

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.460 

same<00:02:08.869> crap<00:02:10.150> okay<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.840> important<00:02:15.260> part

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
same crap okay so the important part

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.660 
same crap okay so the important part
about<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:15.860> if<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.250> know<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
about this is if you know that the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.540 
about this is if you know that the
opponent<00:02:17.000> doesn't<00:02:17.120> have<00:02:17.390> any<00:02:17.720> sort<00:02:18.110> of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
opponent doesn't have any sort of

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.059 
opponent doesn't have any sort of
invincible<00:02:19.550> aerial<00:02:19.940> moves<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.709> repeat

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
invincible aerial moves you can repeat

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.430 
invincible aerial moves you can repeat
this<00:02:22.340> process<00:02:23.590> as<00:02:24.590> long<00:02:24.950> as<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.640> want<00:02:26.440> because

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
this process as long as you want because

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.720 
this process as long as you want because
it<00:02:27.620> doesn't<00:02:27.920> really<00:02:28.010> matter<00:02:28.250> what<00:02:28.519> direction

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
it doesn't really matter what direction

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.870 
it doesn't really matter what direction
they<00:02:29.120> recover<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.069> do<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.580> exact

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
they recover if you do it the exact

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.370 
they recover if you do it the exact
timing<00:02:32.420> which<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.019> it<00:02:33.200> really<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.590> bad<00:02:35.380> and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
timing which is it really that bad and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.280 
timing which is it really that bad and
you'll<00:02:36.560> end<00:02:36.739> up<00:02:37.150> reciting<00:02:38.150> them<00:02:38.450> every<00:02:38.959> single

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
you'll end up reciting them every single

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.140 
you'll end up reciting them every single
time<00:02:40.360> without<00:02:41.360> needing<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.280> predict<00:02:43.280> where

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
time without needing to predict where

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.870 
time without needing to predict where
they're<00:02:44.330> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.569> end<00:02:44.690> up<00:02:48.340> now<00:02:49.340> look<00:02:49.519> at<00:02:49.670> that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
they're going to end up now look at that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.709 
they're going to end up now look at that
experiment<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:50.959> enjoy<00:02:51.230> yourself<00:02:51.560> guys
