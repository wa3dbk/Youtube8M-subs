00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello and welcome back to the second one 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.740
 day was overdone but I have 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.259
 Now a professional explains the war 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.889
 later because now you're thinking about it 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.380
 so what's the problem with that? 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 Dirty at the beginning and from now on 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 therefore, this is already a topaz 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.760
 least neatly built and me 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.109
 I have the first one here now 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.850
 Attack command of the first wave made 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 always make waves when he is not 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.189
 then makes tourists or push is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.510
 slower because of the pressure of the attacks 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.429
 so for example again briefly 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.740
 Transfiguration when the attack had 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.570
 attack delay and the second wore 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.649
 the idea behind it is now the one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.719
 illertisser south is a bad one 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.829
 example down here for example so 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.090
 if five troops are lighter here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.050
 The Angels attack the five of them 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.760
 Delay we only go one 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.230
 attacking delay has again 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 has won the second goal 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 the next provinces with these 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.899
 Wave attacks since you just stop very much 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.310
 a lot faster if he just something 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.310
 wanted to break 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.270
 so here is the first wave, so to speak 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.770
 important now enjoy the experiences 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.330
 collect the area now wrong 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.860
 had more melee go 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.240
 that is pure intention with that just 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.160
 already gain experience for the 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 general and for the troops, so that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.040
 actually then too 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.630
 could beat with power later that was 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.950
 extremely extremely important is this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.420
 battle experience and that's why I have 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.370
 now troops are actually not 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.710
 would be necessary at the front to that 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.850
 do so the Frenchman has 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.600
 decided not to go to war 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.300
 enter 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 the same goes for england and i have 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.780
 Blitzkrieg is still going on at the same time 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 this purely things say boni everything 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.910
 conceded the converted whole 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.080
 politics and will it again 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.010
 Send planes where you active them 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.050
 and that's just her now 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.420
 ground attacks for extremely efficient though 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.020
 here too, the experience and collects experience 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.800
 memory 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.750
 that's just what we see here 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.310
 quite a lot of text with the techno 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.710
 So if I still have it cheaper 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.150
 on it clique that is me here I 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.350
 Of course, do not do it now 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.490
 now that's probably 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.160
 Click here for something like this 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.020
 for example, if it's down here 70 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.700
 percent of the day comes from the air 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.800
 combat experience what you on the ground 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 attacks get 70 percent of the tec 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.789
 sem cheaper if he has one then 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.560
 makes accordingly from that is earlier 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.780
 The better the hacking the better 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.759
 industry the better is experience 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.830
 Collect the better the policies 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.810
 So what am I actually talking about? 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.970
 so it will attack me the first waves 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 a wave is flooded out of the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.620
 opponent and you see that too 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.800
 not necessarily so that now here 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.470
 a problem would already be mobilized 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.140
 At 100% manpower make opponents now 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.660
 not necessarily say so the hectic 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.610
 Cavalry is not necessarily now 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.900
 Ready to fight and we have less 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.910
 than three hours needed around the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.900
 entire front 1 to push backwards 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.680
 yes i already imagine why 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.090
 France does not go to war 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.650
 occurred because now stop too 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.370
 no better the fear your magino line 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.680
 to lose 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.209
 while I have only little apathetic 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.520
 troops at the front here, however 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.900
 not my rent partly so 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.310
 is not that france now here 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.359
 not through but it could not be so 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.439
 that we could then conquer 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:01.549
 so bomb attack ingrid just times 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.290
 ask to collect the plate now 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:10.040
 collected 19 already and here exactly look 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.230
 0 116 , many resorts are first day 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.760
 and let's go machine otherwise 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 here all purely to the entire front 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.730
 and I have two options now 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.319
 I can do the war a bit 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.840
 draw length and with blitzkrieg directly 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.859
 everything finish normally makes 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.680
 do it as fast as you can 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.849
 because you do not necessarily have two fronts 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.560
 war have wild france 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.389
 usually the war will come 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.040
 but the Frenchman seems somehow 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.500
 not to be bothered and therefore able to 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.019
 I actually think about it here now 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.280
 certain pine volumes of mine just that 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.379
 possibility to give a bit more 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.219
 fight 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.599
 so i could do it super fast now 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.740
 finish with poland but i see now 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.420
 also not where the advantage lies 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.620
 because of which theme the troops are such 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.450
 Associations here, for example , will be in 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.640
 later on the future is further rebuilt only 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.660
 I have no armor , he has such associations 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.620
 I will be here for example now 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.270
 maybe fight a little bit more 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.680
 let and let the marines fight 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.960
 and the paratroopers the experiences 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.950
 Collect these wave tactics 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.690
 trying to apply 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.310
 but now not really consistent 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.530
 perform because that would lead to 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.820
 I'll give birth to you so soon 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.360
 Take a little time to mine 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.620
 aircraft 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.100
 which are now quiet yet a 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.660
 chasing through chats 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.070
 defense as a bomber from the third 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.600
 but eventually came the 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.970
 war then I 'll send you here now 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.620
 Over and I would say that you are here 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.140
 also fans could get driving 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.750
 somewhere for fights and for 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.060
 bomb campings and reconfigure 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.090
 So everything has something to do with air 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.090
 fallen air experience comes told 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:45.340
 good man forgave on the ground then always 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.510
 by not show live by exactly 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.550
 so exciting is that he is not in the 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.870
 yes already my associations are faith 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.330
 I undisputed so I could yes 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.770
 everything is a kettle now broken 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.770
 or do as I said not
