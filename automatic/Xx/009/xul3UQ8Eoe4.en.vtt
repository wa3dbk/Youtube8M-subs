00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
all right this piece right here was

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.830 
all right this piece right here was
where<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> old<00:00:08.580> latch<00:00:08.910> connected<00:00:09.629> to<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
where the old latch connected to the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.140 
where the old latch connected to the
slider<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.100> the<00:00:11.219> old<00:00:11.430> latch<00:00:11.699> that<00:00:12.029> we're

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
slider this is the old latch that we're

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.330 
slider this is the old latch that we're
not<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.449> to<00:00:12.539> be<00:00:12.629> using<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.920> I'm<00:00:14.100> just<00:00:14.219> going

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
not going to be using so I'm just going

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:30.160 
not going to be using so I'm just going
to<00:00:14.430> cut<00:00:14.639> them<00:00:14.699> both<00:00:14.820> out<00:00:15.029> we<00:00:15.629> don't<00:00:15.719> need<00:00:15.840> them

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.540 

all<00:00:31.170> right<00:00:31.289> now<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.680> cut<00:00:31.860> that<00:00:32.009> latch<00:00:32.279> out

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
all right now that we cut that latch out

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
all right now that we cut that latch out
and<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.239> hid<00:00:33.420> pivot<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.350> don't<00:00:34.530> need<00:00:34.649> either

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and the hid pivot we don't need either

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
and the hid pivot we don't need either
one<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.129> them<00:00:35.250> okay<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.569> reason<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.960> did<00:00:37.140> that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
one of them okay the reason we did that

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.599 
one of them okay the reason we did that
is<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:37.589> we're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.010> put<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.339> piece

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
is because we're going to put this piece

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.259 
is because we're going to put this piece
right<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.679> the<00:00:40.800> way

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
right here and it was really in the way

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.009 
right here and it was really in the way
so<00:00:42.269> when<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.199> weld<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.649> piece<00:00:43.979> in<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.870> won't

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
so when we weld this piece in we won't

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.000 
so when we weld this piece in we won't
even<00:00:46.140> need<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:46.679> we're<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
even need that because we're going to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.770 
even need that because we're going to
put<00:00:47.100> our<00:00:47.190> new<00:00:47.370> latch<00:00:47.579> right<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:47.999> for<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
it's pretty simple

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.199 
it's pretty simple

pieces a couple pieces of cardboard and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.310 
pieces a couple pieces of cardboard and
trimmed<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> edge<00:01:05.930> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> going

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
trimmed them to the edge this is going

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.950 
trimmed them to the edge this is going
to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.740> piece<00:01:08.119> sorry<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.539> right<00:01:09.810> here

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to be one piece sorry this right here

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
to be one piece sorry this right here
will<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.350> piece<00:01:10.700> this<00:01:11.700> will<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.360> another

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
will be one piece this will be another

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.380 
will be one piece this will be another
piece<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.320> goes<00:01:13.469> to<00:01:13.649> here<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.789> this<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.240> be

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
piece it goes to here then this will be

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
piece it goes to here then this will be
another<00:01:15.659> piece<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:16.469> reason<00:01:16.770> I'm<00:01:16.860> doing<00:01:17.039> them

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
another piece the reason I'm doing them

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.099 
another piece the reason I'm doing them
in<00:01:17.310> three<00:01:17.549> pieces<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.840> hammer

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
in three pieces is because I can hammer

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.240 
in three pieces is because I can hammer
and<00:01:19.350> dalian<00:01:19.770> together

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and dalian together

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.029 
and dalian together
now<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.359> look<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
now if you look this right here is

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.209 
now if you look this right here is
pretty<00:01:23.850> similar<00:01:24.359> to<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.829> what<00:01:26.100> I'm

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
pretty similar to this but what I'm

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.190 
pretty similar to this but what I'm
going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.640> at<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.969> end<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:28.020> done

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
going to do at the end when I get done

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.959 
going to do at the end when I get done

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.940 
doing all this fabricating I'm going to
take<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.210> over<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.750> metal<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.859> like

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

can<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.030> always<00:01:42.689> cut<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.109> little<00:01:43.289> big<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
can I always cut it a little big so I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.459 
can I always cut it a little big so I
can<00:01:43.829> grind<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> down<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.609> I'm<00:01:45.390> trying<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.719> you

can grind it down and I'm trying to you
know<00:01:46.499> mimic<00:01:46.890> these<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.429> I<00:01:47.520> take<00:01:47.700> both<00:01:47.969> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
know mimic these so if I take both of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.060 
know mimic these so if I take both of
these<00:01:48.270> I'll<00:01:48.509> I'll<00:01:49.049> kind<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> slide<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> tables

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
these I'll I'll kind of slide the tables

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.370 
these I'll I'll kind of slide the tables
together<00:01:50.359> and<00:01:51.359> I'll<00:01:51.509> show<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.289 

and<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.340> pretty<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.610> how<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.180> it

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and this is pretty much how you do it

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.350 
and this is pretty much how you do it
you<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.260> hand<00:01:58.799> fabricate<00:01:59.400> everything<00:01:59.850> now

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you just hand fabricate everything now

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.810 
you just hand fabricate everything now
it's<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.720> exactly<00:02:01.229> perfect<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:02.520> once<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.790> put

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
it's not exactly perfect but once I put

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.660 
it's not exactly perfect but once I put
that<00:02:03.180> door<00:02:03.390> paddle<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.900> over<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.430> see

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
how they're going to line up and how

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.510 
how they're going to line up and how
they're<00:02:07.050> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> look<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:08.190> I'll<00:02:08.310> need

couple<00:04:12.080> little<00:04:12.170> tack<00:04:12.500> welds<00:04:13.040> but<00:04:13.850> we're<00:04:14.000> going

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
couple little tack welds but we're going

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.000 
couple little tack welds but we're going
to<00:04:14.180> cut<00:04:14.450> this<00:04:14.690> piece<00:04:15.110> right<00:04:15.320> here<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.770> graft

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
to cut this piece right here and graft

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.220 
to cut this piece right here and graft
it<00:04:16.220> together<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.510> that's<00:04:17.660> pretty<00:04:17.870> much<00:04:17.989> all

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230
