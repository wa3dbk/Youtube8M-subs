them in the past and I've gotten a lot
of<00:00:09.059> good<00:00:09.210> responses<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:09.870> them<00:00:09.990> with<00:00:10.110> questions

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
of good responses on them with questions

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200 
of good responses on them with questions
that<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> had<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.160> different<00:00:11.759> issues<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.150> I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
am having an issue right now and it's

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.720 
am having an issue right now and it's
related<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.859> peach<00:00:17.070> tree<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> have

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
related to the one peach tree I have

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.689 
related to the one peach tree I have
here<00:00:18.029> if<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.539> take<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> look<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.699> this

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
here if you take a look at it here this

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.140 
here if you take a look at it here this
tree<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.180> really<00:00:21.210> leaning<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.140> side<00:00:23.150> it's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
tree is really leaning to the side it's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.939 
tree is really leaning to the side it's
actually<00:00:24.240> got<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> lot<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> fruit<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.380> which

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
actually got a lot of fruit on it which

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.490 
actually got a lot of fruit on it which
you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.140> look<00:00:28.320> down

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you can see here but if you look down

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200 
you can see here but if you look down
here<00:00:28.560> look<00:00:29.220> how<00:00:29.340> much<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> thing's<00:00:29.849> leaning

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
here look how much that thing's leaning

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
here look how much that thing's leaning
you<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.500> trees<00:00:31.740> behind<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> there

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you can see the trees behind it there

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.010 
you can see the trees behind it there
see<00:00:33.030> how<00:00:33.090> they're<00:00:33.210> all<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> line<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.899> then

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
see how they're all in the line and then

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.780 
see how they're all in the line and then
you<00:00:34.140> look<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> I'll<00:00:35.520> show<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you look at this one and I'll show you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.690 
you look at this one and I'll show you
the<00:00:36.140> bottom<00:00:37.140> part<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.579> see

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the bottom part of it here you can see

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
the bottom part of it here you can see
how<00:00:38.940> much<00:00:39.059> that's<00:00:39.270> coming<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.110> now

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
how much that's coming out like that now

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.410 
how much that's coming out like that now
I've<00:00:40.920> made<00:00:41.070> videos<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> said<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> past

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
I've made videos like I said in the past

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.630 
I've made videos like I said in the past
on<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.770> wasn't<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.430> last

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
on this and this wasn't like this last

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.010 
on this and this wasn't like this last
year<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.000> definitely<00:00:45.059> wasn't<00:00:45.420> leaning<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
year it definitely wasn't leaning to the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
year it definitely wasn't leaning to the
extent<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
extent that it is now and I think a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.560 
extent that it is now and I think a
major<00:00:48.680> problem<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.129> most<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
major problem is that most of this of

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.139 
major problem is that most of this of
the<00:00:52.020> foliage<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> growing<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.610> side<00:00:53.850> see

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
the foliage is growing on that side see

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.490 
the foliage is growing on that side see
if<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.420> step<00:00:54.570> around<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.350> see

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
if I can step around here so you can see

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
if I can step around here so you can see
it<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:55.710> better<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:57.719> loaded

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it a little better you see how loaded

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.860 
it a little better you see how loaded
this<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.410> over<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
this is over here and then like this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
this is over here and then like this
this<00:01:01.320> should<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> dead<00:01:01.980> center<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this should be the dead center of the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
this should be the dead center of the
tree<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.910> there's<00:01:03.660> hardly<00:01:03.840> anything<00:01:04.170> there

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
tree and there's hardly anything there

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.509 
tree and there's hardly anything there
but<00:01:04.470> everything's<00:01:04.739> growing<00:01:04.949> over<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.369> this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
but everything's growing over here this

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.149 
but everything's growing over here this
is<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> main<00:01:06.830> leader<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
is pretty much the main leader of the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
is pretty much the main leader of the
tree<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.670> growing<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> way

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
tree right there growing all the way

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
tree right there growing all the way
over<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:10.320> these<00:01:10.470> other<00:01:10.650> trees<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> I'll

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
over into these other trees and I'll

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.899 
over into these other trees and I'll
show<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.600> below<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.580> can<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.760> how

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
show you down below here you can see how

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
show you down below here you can see how
that<00:01:14.970> thing's<00:01:15.299> basically<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:16.110> come<00:01:16.710> in

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that thing's basically just come in

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
that thing's basically just come in
right<00:01:17.100> over<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> step<00:01:18.659> back<00:01:18.780> even

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
right over and if I step back even

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
right over and if I step back even
further<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> probably<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> better

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
further you can probably see a better

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.460 
further you can probably see a better
idea<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.270> how<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> lines<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.170> these<00:01:22.320> other

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
idea of how it lines up with these other

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.859 
idea of how it lines up with these other
ones<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> there's<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> tree<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.509> front<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.810> me

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
ones so there's the tree in front of me

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
ones so there's the tree in front of me
and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:26.310> two<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and you can see one two and then the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.020 
and you can see one two and then the
third<00:01:27.299> one<00:01:27.979> way<00:01:28.979> tilted<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> other

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
third one way tilted and then the other

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.569 
third one way tilted and then the other
one<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.210> fine<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> did<00:01:31.950> some<00:01:32.159> searching<00:01:32.520> on

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
one is fine so I did some searching on

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.880 
one is fine so I did some searching on
the<00:01:32.700> internet<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.299> couldn't<00:01:33.540> find

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the internet and I really couldn't find

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
the internet and I really couldn't find
what<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.159> about<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:36.570> initial<00:01:36.840> thought

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
what to do about this my initial thought

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
what to do about this my initial thought
on<00:01:37.170> correcting<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> maybe<00:01:38.340> put<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
on correcting this was to maybe put a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
on correcting this was to maybe put a
stake<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.119> through<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> middle<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> tree

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
stake up through the middle of the tree

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
stake up through the middle of the tree
maybe<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:41.369> 8-foot<00:01:41.670> stake<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.450> take

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
maybe like an 8-foot stake and then take

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
maybe like an 8-foot stake and then take
bungee<00:01:43.770> cords<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.310> something<00:01:44.640> kind<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
bungee cords or something kind of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.719 
bungee cords or something kind of
pliable<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> try<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> strap<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> tree<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.549> so

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
pliable and try to strap the tree up so

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.130 
pliable and try to strap the tree up so
I<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.970> bring<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> back<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> center<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:48.990> that's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I can bring it back to center if that's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.929 
I can bring it back to center if that's
at<00:01:49.259> all<00:01:49.320> possible<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.610> didn't<00:01:50.790> want

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
at all possible but I really didn't want

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
at all possible but I really didn't want
to<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.180> without<00:01:51.600> checking<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.140> someone

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
to do that without checking with someone

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080 
to do that without checking with someone
that<00:01:52.649> actually<00:01:52.979> knows<00:01:53.189> about<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.820> trees

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that actually knows about these trees

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.850 
that actually knows about these trees
and<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.079> idea<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.799> if

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and if that's a good idea or not or if

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
and if that's a good idea or not or if
even<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.460> anything<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> other

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
even even do anything and the other

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
even even do anything and the other
thing<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.020> thinking<00:01:58.320> about<00:01:58.409> doing<00:01:58.799> was

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
thing I was thinking about doing was

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.440 
thing I was thinking about doing was
since<00:01:59.219> most<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> tree<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> leaning<00:02:00.149> over

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
since most of the tree is leaning over

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.100 
since most of the tree is leaning over
this<00:02:00.719> way

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this way

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.539 
this way
I<00:02:01.140> thought<00:02:01.500> maybe<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.799> could<00:02:01.860> correct<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.399> when

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
I thought maybe I could correct it when

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
I thought maybe I could correct it when
I<00:02:02.579> prune<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> late<00:02:04.079> winter<00:02:04.290> by

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I prune this in the late winter by

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.620 
I prune this in the late winter by
pretty<00:02:05.219> much<00:02:05.250> cutting<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> tree<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.390> right

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
pretty much cutting the tree like right

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.419 
pretty much cutting the tree like right
there<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.590> trying<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> bring<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.310> back

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
there and then trying to bring it back

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.619 
there and then trying to bring it back
straight<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.030> mean<00:02:09.179> you're<00:02:09.300> always<00:02:09.420> going

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
straight up I mean you're always going

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.630 
straight up I mean you're always going
to<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.869> lien<00:02:10.770> there<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.400> then<00:02:11.520> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to have that lien there but then it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.490 
to have that lien there but then it
would<00:02:11.790> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.090> straighten<00:02:12.420> itself<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
would kind of straighten itself out and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140 
would kind of straighten itself out and
go<00:02:13.620> back<00:02:13.800> up<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.160> maybe<00:02:14.310> let<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.700> stuff<00:02:14.940> grow

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
go back up and maybe let the stuff grow

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.090 
go back up and maybe let the stuff grow
off<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.320> really<00:02:16.530> sacrifice<00:02:17.070> a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
off that but it would really sacrifice a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.470 
off that but it would really sacrifice a
lot<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.460> this<00:02:17.550> tree<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.270> lot

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
lot of this tree and you can see a lot

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.360 
lot of this tree and you can see a lot
of<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.600> production<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.140> there<00:02:19.380> would<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.070> gone

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
of the production on there would be gone

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
of the production on there would be gone
but<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.880> really<00:02:21.510> can't<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.020> thing

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
but I just really can't have this thing

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.780 
but I just really can't have this thing
growing<00:02:22.680> sideways<00:02:22.890> I'm<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.490> concerned

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
growing sideways I'm really concerned

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.460 
growing sideways I'm really concerned
that<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.330> going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> eventually<00:02:25.380> just

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that it's just going to eventually just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.650 
that it's just going to eventually just
uproot<00:02:25.980> itself<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.520> fall<00:02:26.700> over<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.630> that

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
uproot itself and fall over so that

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.760 
uproot itself and fall over so that
brings<00:02:27.930> me<00:02:28.020> back<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.260> my<00:02:28.350> original<00:02:28.380> question

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
brings me back to my original question

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.800 
brings me back to my original question
what<00:02:29.730> should<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.030> about<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.390> tree<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.630> know

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
what should I do about this tree I know

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.240 
what should I do about this tree I know
there's<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.170> lot<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.410> people<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.770> here<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.040> are

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
there's a lot of people on here that are

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.140 
there's a lot of people on here that are
going<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.490> able<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.670> help<00:02:32.760> me<00:02:32.910> out<00:02:32.940> with

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
going to be able to help me out with

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.030 
going to be able to help me out with
this<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.410> no<00:02:34.530> idea<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.980> don't

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
this I just have no idea and I don't

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.680 
this I just have no idea and I don't
want<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> do<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.490> wrong<00:02:35.640> thing<00:02:36.000> I'm<00:02:36.450> not

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
want to do the wrong thing I'm not

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.120 
want to do the wrong thing I'm not
planning<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.200> really<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.650> anything<00:02:38.010> unless

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
planning to really do anything unless

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.920 
planning to really do anything unless
I'm<00:02:38.430> staking<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.060> which<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.270> could<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.690> but

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
I'm staking it which I could do now but

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.930 
I'm staking it which I could do now but
if<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.110> prune<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.620> won't<00:02:40.710> be<00:02:40.830> until<00:02:41.040> late

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
if I prune it it won't be until late

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.220 
if I prune it it won't be until late
winter<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.300> usually<00:02:42.600> do<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.840> like<00:02:43.020> January

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
winter I usually do that like January

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.410 
winter I usually do that like January
February<00:02:43.530> after<00:02:44.040> most<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.520> cold<00:02:45.060> streaks

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
February after most of the cold streaks
