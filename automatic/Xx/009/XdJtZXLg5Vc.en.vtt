00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
think that the main support of this is

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.179 
think that the main support of this is
you<00:02:14.060> know<00:02:14.209> people<00:02:15.049> have<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.560> have<00:02:15.680> supporting

you know people have to have supporting

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.830 
you know people have to have supporting
like<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.489> don't<00:02:16.580> have<00:02:16.819> support<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.659> don't

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
like if you don't have support you don't

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.479 
like if you don't have support you don't
have<00:02:17.989> anyone<00:02:18.290> telling<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.739> keep<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:19.400> and
