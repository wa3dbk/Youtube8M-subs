 now again with you in this 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.600
 opportunity we are going to teach you 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.819
 make these beautiful little flowers 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.329
 Japanese very easy and simple 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:15.559
 elaborate materials for this square 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:17.179
 on ribbon or 3 x 3 ati fabrics 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.009
 centimeters 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.250
 we are going to use a pearl for the 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:25.179
 center a circle cut out of cardboard 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.329
 felt in the material that you 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.490
 want to use it to place it, let's 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.110
 use the silicone gun and in 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.110
 this opportunity the soldering iron 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.570
 the soldering iron can get it in 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.760
 hardware stores or in tool stores 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.980
 use a simple normal soldering iron for 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.690
 crafts are very economical I hope 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.530
 they get it because we are going to do many 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.600
 flowers with that with that tool 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.760
 then we will start to elaborate the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.430
 petals and the elaborate five petals 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.950
 you can do it from the amount of 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 petals that you want we double the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.020
 tape in half forming a triangle 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.810
 one end we take it to the 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.350
 center the other end again at 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.350
 center 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.820
 forming of this figure then we fold 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.070
 we doubled and here we have our 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.070
 petals super easy simple 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.900
 for those who do not have the soldering iron what 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.490
 can do with the heat of the candle 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.520
 here we are 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.689
 burning the tips with our soldering iron 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.689
 we paste and 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.900
 already the petals are elaborated for 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.150
 This flower 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.850
 using the circle that had them 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.850
 commented we started to apply silicone 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.420
 and we started to place the petals 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.420
 followed 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.430
 we organize the petals 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.540
 finally we place in the center a 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.540
 little bit of silicone 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.219
 pearl 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.500
 and we have finished one more flower 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 I hope you liked this video 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.030
 we wait in a next opportunity
