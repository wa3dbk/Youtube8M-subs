00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
focal length is my favorite focal length

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.660 
focal length is my favorite focal length
to<00:00:23.699> work<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.630> m6<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.320> before<00:00:26.310> picking

to work with on my m6 and before picking
up<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.970> Zeiss<00:00:27.269> 35<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> couple<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> weeks

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
ago
I've<00:00:29.670> tried<00:00:29.880> lenses<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.390> Voigtlander<00:00:31.080> Leica

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
I've tried lenses from Voigtlander Leica

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.530 
I've tried lenses from Voigtlander Leica
and<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:32.099> Zeiss<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.300> guys<00:00:33.480> know

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and now Zeiss now just so you guys know

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
and now Zeiss now just so you guys know
before<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.620> started<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.100> want

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
before we really get started I do want

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
before we really get started I do want
to<00:00:35.370> mention<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> f2<00:00:36.600> version

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to mention that this is the f2 version

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
to mention that this is the f2 version
of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> lens<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> Zeiss<00:00:37.890> does<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.460> an<00:00:38.579> F<00:00:38.700> 2.8

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
of the lens and Zeiss does make an F 2.8

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
of the lens and Zeiss does make an F 2.8
version<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> lens<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> little<00:00:40.980> bit

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
version of the lens so it's a little bit

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
version of the lens so it's a little bit
slower<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:42.180> by<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.360> know<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.780> stop<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
slower just by you know one stop and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.930 
slower just by you know one stop and
it's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:43.980> bit<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.250> affordable<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it's a little bit more affordable and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's a little bit more affordable and
actually<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> depth<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> lens<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
actually the depth of the lens is just a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.830 
actually the depth of the lens is just a
little<00:00:47.430> bit<00:00:47.550> shorter<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
little bit shorter but because this is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
little bit shorter but because this is
the<00:00:48.960> f2<00:00:49.320> version<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> lens<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.219> lot<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the f2 version of the lens a lot of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.979 
the f2 version of the lens a lot of
people<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> compare<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.420> lens<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
people like to compare this lens to the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.660 
people like to compare this lens to the
35<00:00:52.379> millimeter<00:00:52.559> super<00:00:53.070> crown<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.430> Leica

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
35 millimeter super crown from Leica

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
35 millimeter super crown from Leica
simply<00:00:54.449> because<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> same<00:00:55.289> focal

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
simply because it's the same focal

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.350 
simply because it's the same focal
length<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:56.340> maximum<00:00:56.520> aperture<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
length and the same maximum aperture and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
length and the same maximum aperture and
Zeiss<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.870> known<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.440> their<00:00:58.530> lenses<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
Zeiss is known for their lenses so I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
Zeiss is known for their lenses so I
have<00:00:59.879> had<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> couple<00:01:00.300> different<00:01:00.780> versions<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
have had a couple different versions of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.020 
have had a couple different versions of
the<00:01:01.620> Zoomer<00:01:01.890> Chron<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.430> 35<00:01:02.820> millimeter

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the Zoomer Chron the 35 millimeter

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.630 
the Zoomer Chron the 35 millimeter
version<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.799> I've<00:01:04.890> had<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.489> can

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
version and now that I've had this I can

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.130 
version and now that I've had this I can
kind<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> compare<00:01:06.030> them<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> little<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
kind of compare them a little bit and I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.210 
kind of compare them a little bit and I
am<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.530> sharing<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:07.860> thoughts<00:01:08.070> on

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
a rangefinder lens a lot of the older
lenses<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.520> bit<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:27.030> longer

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
lenses it's a little bit you know longer

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
lenses it's a little bit you know longer
than<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.409> most<00:01:28.650> modern<00:01:28.979> rangefinder

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
than that but on most modern rangefinder

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
than that but on most modern rangefinder
lenses<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.270> point<00:01:30.600> seven<00:01:30.930> meters<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> pretty

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
lenses that point seven meters is pretty

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.350 
lenses that point seven meters is pretty
standard<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.640> mentioned<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
standard so like I mentioned this is the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
standard so like I mentioned this is the
f/2<00:01:33.689> lens<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.470> aperture<00:01:34.770> range<00:01:35.070> ranges

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
f/2 lens so your aperture range ranges

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.149 
f/2 lens so your aperture range ranges
from<00:01:35.759> F<00:01:36.000> 2<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> way<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> f-22<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
from F 2 all the way to f-22 and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.060 
from F 2 all the way to f-22 and
interesting<00:01:39.119> enough<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.720> lens<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.530> like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
interesting enough on this lens and like

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
interesting enough on this lens and like
with<00:01:41.250> Moses<00:01:41.610> ice<00:01:41.729> lenses<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.810> third

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
with Moses ice lenses you have third

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
with Moses ice lenses you have third
stop<00:01:43.439> clicks<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.040> between<00:01:44.369> apertures<00:01:44.820> meaning

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
stop clicks in between apertures meaning

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
stop clicks in between apertures meaning
you<00:01:45.659> don't<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> half<00:01:46.560> stop<00:01:46.860> between

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you don't just have a half stop between

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.609 
you don't just have a half stop between
you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> say<00:01:47.909> F<00:01:48.090> 2<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.479> 2.8<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.470> are

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
you know say F 2 and 2.8 there are

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.740 
you know say F 2 and 2.8 there are
actually<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> third<00:01:50.670> stop<00:01:50.970> clicks<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.420> between

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
actually a third stop clicks in between

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.929 
actually a third stop clicks in between
and<00:01:52.159> ideally<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> give

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and ideally this is just going to give

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.149 
and ideally this is just going to give
you<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> lot<00:01:54.479> more<00:01:54.630> precise<00:01:55.170> control<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.920> your

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you a lot more precise control over your

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
you a lot more precise control over your
exposure<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.119> another<00:01:57.329> thing<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> note<00:01:57.780> about

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
exposure so another thing to note about

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
exposure so another thing to note about
the<00:01:58.140> aperture<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> fact<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.250> all

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the aperture is the fact that with all

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.190 
the aperture is the fact that with all
the<00:01:59.670> Zeiss<00:01:59.880> lenses<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.420> I've<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the Zeiss lenses that I've had the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
the Zeiss lenses that I've had the
aperture<00:02:01.649> clicks<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:02.100> really<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.729> stiff

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
aperture clicks are really really stiff

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780 
aperture clicks are really really stiff
and<00:02:03.329> strong<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.219> some<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> lenses<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and strong and some of the lenses that

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.520 
and strong and some of the lenses that
I've<00:02:05.909> had<00:02:06.119> from<00:02:06.240> other<00:02:06.479> companies<00:02:06.840> even<00:02:07.350> like

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
I've had from other companies even like

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.350 
I've had from other companies even like
a<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.009> aperture<00:02:08.489> ring<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.000> really

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
a the aperture ring is really really

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.850 
a the aperture ring is really really
loose<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.869> would<00:02:10.020> kind<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.500> find<00:02:10.679> myself

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
loose and I would kind of find myself

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.830 
loose and I would kind of find myself
you<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.430> accidentally<00:02:11.940> bumping<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.510> but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
you know accidentally bumping it but

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.809 
you know accidentally bumping it but
with<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> Zeiss<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.500> don't<00:02:13.620> think

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
with the Zeiss I don't think

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.280 
with the Zeiss I don't think
I would<00:02:13.969> ever<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:14.480> issue<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:15.109> lens

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
I would ever have that issue the lens

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.929 
I would ever have that issue the lens
does<00:02:15.530> accept<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.950> lens<00:02:16.159> hood<00:02:16.249> as<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.640> can<00:02:16.760> see

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
does accept a lens hood as you can see

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.089 
does accept a lens hood as you can see
here<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.989> bayonet<00:02:18.379> style<00:02:18.499> lens<00:02:18.859> hood

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
here and it's a bayonet style lens hood

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.770 
here and it's a bayonet style lens hood
meaning<00:02:19.549> you<00:02:19.879> don't<00:02:20.090> screw<00:02:20.359> it<00:02:20.389> on<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.659> front

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
meaning you don't screw it on the front

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.020 
meaning you don't screw it on the front
of<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.989> lens<00:02:21.139> like<00:02:21.379> a<00:02:21.409> filter<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:22.370> simply

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
of the lens like a filter you simply

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.699 
of the lens like a filter you simply
just<00:02:23.180> push<00:02:23.420> in<00:02:23.629> once<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.989> line<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.319> up<00:02:24.409> and

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
just push in once you line it up and

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.800 
just push in once you line it up and
twist<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.489> locks<00:02:25.700> into<00:02:25.879> place<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.540> you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
twist and it locks into place and you

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.970 
twist and it locks into place and you
don't<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.079> to<00:02:27.170> worry<00:02:27.349> about<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.680> lens<00:02:27.859> hood

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
don't have to worry about the lens hood

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.920 
don't have to worry about the lens hood
falling<00:02:28.430> off<00:02:28.579> or<00:02:28.760> anything<00:02:28.969> like<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:29.629> on

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
falling off or anything like that so on

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.300 
falling off or anything like that so on
a<00:02:29.959> lot<00:02:30.109> of<00:02:30.170> rangefinder<00:02:30.739> lenses<00:02:31.129> especially

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
a lot of rangefinder lenses especially

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.789 
a lot of rangefinder lenses especially
in<00:02:31.879> mount<00:02:32.150> lens<00:02:32.329> is<00:02:32.480> what<00:02:32.689> you<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.469> a

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
in mount lens is what you have is this a

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.920 
in mount lens is what you have is this a
little<00:02:34.280> focusing<00:02:34.909> aid<00:02:35.150> on<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:35.480> bottom<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.870> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
little focusing aid on the bottom of the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.440 
little focusing aid on the bottom of the
lens<00:02:36.139> and<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.739> differs<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:37.909> each<00:02:38.150> different

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
lens and it differs on each different

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.059 
lens and it differs on each different
kind<00:02:38.599> of<00:02:38.719> lens<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:38.959> use<00:02:39.019> especially<00:02:39.980> if

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
kind of lens you use especially if

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.379 
kind of lens you use especially if
you're<00:02:40.189> switching<00:02:40.519> from<00:02:40.819> different<00:02:41.120> brands

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
you're switching from different brands

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.110 
you're switching from different brands
but<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.409> Zeiss<00:02:42.590> lens<00:02:42.889> is<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.669> majority<00:02:44.090> of

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
but on the Zeiss lens is the majority of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.839 
but on the Zeiss lens is the majority of
them<00:02:44.389> if<00:02:44.599> not<00:02:44.810> all<00:02:45.139> of<00:02:45.379> them<00:02:45.560> I'm<00:02:45.680> not<00:02:45.799> sure<00:02:45.859> but

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
them if not all of them I'm not sure but

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:47.830 
them if not all of them I'm not sure but
the<00:02:46.909> majority<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.299> them<00:02:47.450> they<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.689> this

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
the majority of them they have this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.379 
the majority of them they have this
little<00:02:48.139> bump<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.579> little<00:02:49.879> bump<00:02:50.120> on

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
little bump it's like a little bump on

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.720 
little bump it's like a little bump on
the<00:02:50.510> bottom<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.900> lens<00:02:51.109> and<00:02:51.469> I've<00:02:52.340> seen<00:02:52.609> it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
the bottom of the lens and I've seen it

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.399 
the bottom of the lens and I've seen it
used<00:02:52.909> a<00:02:53.060> lot<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.239> different<00:02:53.329> ways<00:02:53.719> some<00:02:54.079> people

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
used a lot of different ways some people

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.979 
used a lot of different ways some people
just<00:02:54.620> simply<00:02:54.799> push<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:56.180> know<00:02:56.329> basically

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
just simply push you know basically

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.449 
just simply push you know basically
apply<00:02:57.260> pressure<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.829> little<00:02:58.040> bump<00:02:58.219> and

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
apply pressure to that little bump and

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.740 
apply pressure to that little bump and
kind<00:02:58.639> of<00:02:58.699> focus<00:02:58.909> back<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.389> forth<00:02:59.599> this<00:02:59.689> way

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
kind of focus back and forth this way

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.379 
kind of focus back and forth this way
I've<00:03:00.409> seen<00:03:00.680> people<00:03:01.040> kind<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.459> use<00:03:01.730> two<00:03:01.939> fingers

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
I've seen people kind of use two fingers

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.000 
I've seen people kind of use two fingers
and<00:03:02.599> kind<00:03:02.719> of<00:03:02.840> pinch<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.349> little<00:03:03.590> bump<00:03:03.769> there

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
and kind of pinch the little bump there

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.490 
and kind of pinch the little bump there
and<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.400> know<00:03:04.519> focus<00:03:05.150> back<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:05.510> forth<00:03:05.719> it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
and you know focus back and forth it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.990 
and you know focus back and forth it
really<00:03:06.769> doesn't<00:03:07.040> matter<00:03:07.129> some<00:03:07.489> people<00:03:07.760> hate

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
really doesn't matter some people hate

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.849 
really doesn't matter some people hate
this<00:03:08.209> about<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.780> Zeiss<00:03:08.959> lenses

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
this about the Zeiss lenses

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.250 
this about the Zeiss lenses
I<00:03:09.889> really<00:03:10.549> don't<00:03:10.639> seem<00:03:10.939> to<00:03:11.030> mind<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.449> I've<00:03:11.870> had

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
I really don't seem to mind it I've had

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.050 
I really don't seem to mind it I've had
you<00:03:12.829> know<00:03:12.949> a<00:03:13.159> bunch<00:03:13.549> of<00:03:13.669> different

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
you know a bunch of different

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.610 
you know a bunch of different
rangefinder<00:03:14.689> lenses<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.169> a<00:03:15.230> lot<00:03:15.379> of<00:03:15.409> them

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
rangefinder lenses and a lot of them

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.979 
rangefinder lenses and a lot of them
have<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.280> tab<00:03:16.909> which<00:03:17.209> is<00:03:17.239> pretty<00:03:17.689> standard

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
have the tab which is pretty standard

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.539 
have the tab which is pretty standard
it's<00:03:18.319> got<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.739> little<00:03:18.979> cup<00:03:19.189> for<00:03:19.459> your

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
it's got like a little cup for your

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.699 
it's got like a little cup for your
finger<00:03:19.909> but<00:03:20.840> really<00:03:21.169> if<00:03:21.229> you<00:03:21.319> just<00:03:21.349> put

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
finger but really if you just put

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.619 
finger but really if you just put
pressure<00:03:22.009> on<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.699> works<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.180> same<00:03:23.209> way

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
pressure on this it works the same way

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.509 
pressure on this it works the same way
so<00:03:24.259> a<00:03:24.290> lot<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.560> people<00:03:24.829> do<00:03:24.979> like<00:03:25.009> to<00:03:25.159> complain

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
so a lot of people do like to complain

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.860 
so a lot of people do like to complain
about<00:03:25.639> that<00:03:25.879> but<00:03:25.939> I<00:03:26.120> really<00:03:26.449> don't<00:03:26.540> think<00:03:26.659> it's

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
about that but I really don't think it's

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.110 
about that but I really don't think it's
a<00:03:26.959> big<00:03:27.109> deal<00:03:27.319> another<00:03:28.310> thing<00:03:28.489> people<00:03:28.699> really

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
a big deal another thing people really

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.670 
a big deal another thing people really
like<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.269> complain<00:03:29.659> about<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.169> lens<00:03:30.439> is

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
like to complain about with this lens is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.280 
like to complain about with this lens is
the<00:03:30.709> fact<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.579> it's<00:03:31.849> a<00:03:32.150> pretty<00:03:32.569> long<00:03:32.900> lens

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
the fact that it's a pretty long lens

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.319 
the fact that it's a pretty long lens
not<00:03:34.159> in<00:03:34.280> terms<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.669> focal<00:03:34.970> length<00:03:35.000> but

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
not in terms of the focal length but

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.390 
not in terms of the focal length but
just<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:35.659> the<00:03:35.689> depth<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.319> know<00:03:36.439> from<00:03:36.799> where

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
just in the depth you know from where

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.399 
just in the depth you know from where
the<00:03:37.549> lens<00:03:37.790> mounts<00:03:38.599> on<00:03:38.689> with<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.870> camera<00:03:39.229> all

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
the lens mounts on with the camera all

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.749 
the lens mounts on with the camera all
the<00:03:39.470> way<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:40.040> front<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.370> lens<00:03:40.549> and

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:40.759 
the way to the front of the lens and

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.089 
the way to the front of the lens and
with<00:03:41.509> the<00:03:41.629> lens<00:03:41.840> hood<00:03:41.959> on<00:03:42.169> there<00:03:42.349> it's<00:03:42.590> not<00:03:42.829> a

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
with the lens hood on there it's not a

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.580 
with the lens hood on there it's not a
you<00:03:43.519> know<00:03:43.549> pancake<00:03:44.209> style<00:03:44.599> lens<00:03:44.840> by<00:03:45.109> any<00:03:45.290> means

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
you know pancake style lens by any means

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.399 
you know pancake style lens by any means
but<00:03:45.859> it's<00:03:46.009> really<00:03:46.340> not<00:03:46.609> bad<00:03:46.819> at<00:03:46.879> all<00:03:47.199> the<00:03:48.199> lens

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
but it's really not bad at all the lens

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.839 
but it's really not bad at all the lens
that<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.650> actually<00:03:48.799> traded<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.400> for<00:03:49.459> which

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
that I actually traded this for which

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.390 
that I actually traded this for which
was<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.000> 50<00:03:50.449> millimeter<00:03:50.599> zoom<00:03:50.840> Ekron<00:03:51.259> it<00:03:52.159> was

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
was a 50 millimeter zoom Ekron it was

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.300 
was a 50 millimeter zoom Ekron it was
just<00:03:52.729> as<00:03:52.879> long<00:03:53.120> as<00:03:53.269> this<00:03:53.449> lens<00:03:53.689> was<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.889> lot

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
just as long as this lens was so a lot

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.589 
just as long as this lens was so a lot
of<00:03:55.340> people<00:03:55.609> complain<00:03:55.909> about<00:03:55.939> this<00:03:56.299> being<00:03:56.509> a

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
of people complain about this being a

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.420 
of people complain about this being a
really<00:03:56.870> long<00:03:57.049> lens<00:03:57.319> but<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.769> don't<00:03:57.979> really<00:03:58.129> see

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
really long lens but I don't really see

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.849 
really long lens but I don't really see
it<00:03:58.579> like<00:03:59.479> I<00:03:59.569> said<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.870> 2.8<00:04:00.349> version<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.739> this

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
it like I said the 2.8 version of this

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.679 
it like I said the 2.8 version of this
lens<00:04:01.069> is<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.370> little<00:04:01.669> bit<00:04:01.790> shorter<00:04:02.150> but

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
lens is a little bit shorter but

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.509 
lens is a little bit shorter but
especially<00:04:03.560> if<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.709> take<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:03.979> lens<00:04:04.129> hood<00:04:04.340> off

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
especially if you take the lens hood off

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.209 
especially if you take the lens hood off
I<00:04:04.729> mean<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.359> lens<00:04:05.569> is<00:04:05.840> really<00:04:06.079> really<00:04:06.500> pretty

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
I mean the lens is really really pretty

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.039 
I mean the lens is really really pretty
standard<00:04:07.849> as<00:04:08.000> far<00:04:08.030> as<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.329> rangefinder<00:04:08.599> lens

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
standard as far as a rangefinder lens

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.899 
standard as far as a rangefinder lens
goes<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.590> that's<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.430> thing<00:04:10.669> you<00:04:10.699> know

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
goes and that's the thing you know

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.270 
goes and that's the thing you know
people<00:04:11.870> complain<00:04:12.229> about<00:04:12.259> the<00:04:12.530> size<00:04:12.769> of<00:04:12.979> it<00:04:13.099> but

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
people complain about the size of it but

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.189 
people complain about the size of it but
if<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.459> compare<00:04:13.729> this<00:04:13.879> to<00:04:13.939> a<00:04:14.090> normal<00:04:14.449> SLR<00:04:14.930> lens

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 
if you compare this to a normal SLR lens

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.920 
if you compare this to a normal SLR lens
it's<00:04:15.889> still<00:04:16.310> really<00:04:16.820> really<00:04:17.000> small<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.810> know

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
it's still really really small you know

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.319 
it's still really really small you know
in<00:04:18.079> that<00:04:18.169> regard<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:18.620> like<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.639> said<00:04:19.729> it's<00:04:20.060> it's

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
in that regard so like I said it's it's

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.520 
in that regard so like I said it's it's
another<00:04:20.570> one<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.780> those<00:04:20.840> things<00:04:21.079> that<00:04:21.229> people

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
another one of those things that people

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.230 
another one of those things that people
complain<00:04:21.829> about<00:04:21.979> I<00:04:22.250> don't<00:04:22.370> really<00:04:22.729> see<00:04:23.029> the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
complain about I don't really see the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.510 
complain about I don't really see the
point<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:24.139> doesn't<00:04:24.529> really<00:04:24.650> bother<00:04:24.889> me<00:04:25.099> but<00:04:25.490> I

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
point it doesn't really bother me but I

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.360 
point it doesn't really bother me but I
figured<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:25.909> would<00:04:25.940> make

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
figured I would make

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.710 
figured I would make
because<00:04:26.790> it's<00:04:26.970> such<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> common<00:04:27.419> thing<00:04:27.690> that

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
because it's such a common thing that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.210 
because it's such a common thing that
people<00:04:27.990> like<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.350> bring<00:04:28.500> up<00:04:28.650> with<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.010> lens

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
people like to bring up with this lens

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.280 
people like to bring up with this lens
so<00:04:29.699> I'm<00:04:29.790> not<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.940> big<00:04:30.120> fan<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.330> unboxing<00:04:30.960> videos

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
so I'm not a big fan of unboxing videos

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.450 
so I'm not a big fan of unboxing videos
so<00:04:31.530> instead<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.889> that<00:04:32.010> I'm<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.310> going<00:04:32.430> to

Chrome<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.610> for<00:04:56.820> me<00:04:56.910> I've<00:04:57.090> had<00:04:57.270> two<00:04:57.449> different

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
Chrome so for me I've had two different

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.360 
Chrome so for me I've had two different
versions<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.290> 35<00:04:58.680> millimeter<00:04:58.889> super

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
versions of the 35 millimeter super

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.219 
versions of the 35 millimeter super
chrome<00:04:59.580> I've<00:04:59.820> had<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.270> modern<00:05:00.690> version<00:05:01.080> which

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
chrome I've had the modern version which

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.110 
chrome I've had the modern version which
is<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.410> aspherical<00:05:02.010> version<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.520> I've<00:05:02.940> had<00:05:03.090> a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
is the aspherical version and I've had a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.480 
is the aspherical version and I've had a
version<00:05:03.389> four<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.110> for<00:05:04.949> me<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.310> main

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
version four and for me the main

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.070 
version four and for me the main
difference<00:05:05.850> that<00:05:05.940> I<00:05:06.060> saw<00:05:06.330> in<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.570> two<00:05:06.720> lenses

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
difference that I saw in the two lenses

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.100 
difference that I saw in the two lenses
not<00:05:07.889> on<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.669> you<00:05:09.060> know<00:05:09.150> actual<00:05:09.449> lens<00:05:09.690> itself

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
not on the you know actual lens itself

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.170 
not on the you know actual lens itself
because<00:05:10.440> they<00:05:10.590> were<00:05:10.650> size<00:05:11.490> differences<00:05:12.030> and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
because they were size differences and

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.969 
because they were size differences and
stuff<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.479> that<00:05:12.720> but<00:05:13.289> as<00:05:13.470> far<00:05:13.500> as<00:05:13.710> the

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
stuff like that but as far as the

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.560 
stuff like that but as far as the
outcome<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.669> know<00:05:14.699> the<00:05:14.970> lens<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.330> what<00:05:15.479> you

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
outcome you know the lens and what you

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.540 
outcome you know the lens and what you
can<00:05:15.720> get<00:05:15.900> from<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.199> lens<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:17.039> version<00:05:17.370> four

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
can get from the lens the version four

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.460 
can get from the lens the version four
had<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.760> little<00:05:17.970> bit<00:05:18.120> more<00:05:18.150> character<00:05:18.539> to<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.900> it

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
had a little bit more character to it it

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.320 
had a little bit more character to it it
had<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> lot<00:05:20.070> more<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.490> classic<00:05:21.030> kind<00:05:21.240> of

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
had a lot more of that classic kind of

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.170 
had a lot more of that classic kind of
look<00:05:21.510> whereas<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.530> modern<00:05:22.889> version<00:05:23.460> as<00:05:23.970> you

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
look whereas the modern version as you

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.520 
look whereas the modern version as you
would<00:05:24.270> expect<00:05:24.630> from<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.810> modern<00:05:24.990> lens

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
would expect from a modern lens

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.740 
would expect from a modern lens
it<00:05:25.650> was<00:05:25.919> extremely<00:05:26.880> sharp<00:05:27.090> from<00:05:27.389> corner<00:05:27.720> to

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
it was extremely sharp from corner to

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.840 
it was extremely sharp from corner to
corner<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:29.310> know<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.550> had<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:29.789> really

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
corner and you know it had that really

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.300 
corner and you know it had that really
clinical<00:05:30.720> clean<00:05:31.080> kind<00:05:31.410> of<00:05:31.470> look<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.979> so<00:05:32.190> if

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
clinical clean kind of look to it so if

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.860 
clinical clean kind of look to it so if
I<00:05:32.400> were<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.610> compare<00:05:32.820> this<00:05:33.030> lens<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.450> one<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.750> my

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
I were to compare this lens to one of my

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.180 
I were to compare this lens to one of my
super<00:05:34.200> cons<00:05:34.410> that<00:05:34.530> I've<00:05:34.680> had<00:05:34.889> it<00:05:35.099> would

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
super cons that I've had it would

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.740 
super cons that I've had it would
definitely<00:05:35.340> be<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.729> aspherical<00:05:36.389> version

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
definitely be the aspherical version

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.480 
definitely be the aspherical version
simply<00:05:37.260> because<00:05:37.680> they're<00:05:37.889> both<00:05:38.039> modern

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
simply because they're both modern

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.550 
simply because they're both modern
lenses<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.120> they're<00:05:39.330> both<00:05:39.479> extremely<00:05:40.169> sharp

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
lenses and they're both extremely sharp

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.409 
lenses and they're both extremely sharp
from<00:05:40.860> corner<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.220> corner<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.880> results<00:05:42.300> to

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
from corner to corner and the results to

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.540 
from corner to corner and the results to
me<00:05:42.630> seem<00:05:43.229> almost<00:05:43.440> identical<00:05:44.220> I've<00:05:44.370> been

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
me seem almost identical I've been

from the bygone back to back and I
really<00:05:48.630> don't<00:05:48.750> see<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.020> difference<00:05:49.500> at<00:05:49.650> all

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
now something to know is the fact that

you're shooting with a digital sensor
you<00:05:57.599> know<00:05:57.750> your<00:05:57.960> results<00:05:58.320> may<00:05:58.470> vary<00:05:58.500> on<00:05:58.889> things

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
whatsoever

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.810 
whatsoever
maybe<00:06:18.840> if<00:06:18.990> I<00:06:19.080> zoomed<00:06:19.380> in<00:06:19.560> on<00:06:19.620> each<00:06:20.190> scan<00:06:20.520> and

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
maybe if I zoomed in on each scan and

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.760 
maybe if I zoomed in on each scan and
checked<00:06:21.180> corner-to-corner<00:06:21.630> on<00:06:22.199> every<00:06:22.560> single

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
checked corner-to-corner on every single

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.950 
checked corner-to-corner on every single
photo<00:06:23.099> and<00:06:23.460> really<00:06:23.940> really<00:06:24.240> analyzed<00:06:24.690> each

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
photo and really really analyzed each

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.930 
photo and really really analyzed each
frame<00:06:25.289> just<00:06:25.650> on<00:06:25.919> how<00:06:26.099> the<00:06:26.160> lens<00:06:26.490> handled<00:06:26.880> the

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
frame just on how the lens handled the

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.879 
frame just on how the lens handled the
situation<00:06:27.090> I<00:06:27.660> might<00:06:28.260> be<00:06:28.410> able<00:06:28.530> to<00:06:28.590> find<00:06:28.800> a

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
situation I might be able to find a

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.980 
situation I might be able to find a
difference<00:06:29.220> in<00:06:29.370> there<00:06:29.550> maybe<00:06:29.940> but<00:06:30.539> even<00:06:30.570> if<00:06:30.870> I

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
difference in there maybe but even if I

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.779 
difference in there maybe but even if I
did<00:06:31.229> I<00:06:31.470> don't<00:06:31.650> think<00:06:32.010> it<00:06:32.160> would<00:06:32.250> justify<00:06:32.610> the

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
did I don't think it would justify the

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.730 
did I don't think it would justify the
price<00:06:33.210> difference<00:06:33.630> because<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:34.169> Leica<00:06:34.380> lens

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
price difference because the Leica lens

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.030 
price difference because the Leica lens
it<00:06:35.039> retails<00:06:35.789> at<00:06:35.909> about<00:06:36.140> $3,000<00:06:37.140> and<00:06:37.380> upward

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
it retails at about $3,000 and upward

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.440 
it retails at about $3,000 and upward
that<00:06:38.310> if<00:06:38.460> you're<00:06:38.610> wanting<00:06:38.850> to<00:06:38.970> get<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.210> chrome
