after<00:00:26.110> when<00:00:27.110> yugioh<00:00:27.980> loss<00:00:28.160> against<00:00:28.460> the

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
after when yugioh loss against the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.060 
after when yugioh loss against the
androids<00:00:28.940> the<00:00:29.090> next<00:00:29.450> real<00:00:29.750> a<00:00:30.290> stroke<00:00:30.890> when<00:00:30.920> he

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
androids the next real a stroke when he

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.799 
androids the next real a stroke when he
got<00:00:31.190> was<00:00:31.430> from<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.730> cell<00:00:32.149> after<00:00:32.329> it<00:00:32.509> turned<00:00:32.660> into

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
got was from a cell after it turned into

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.319 
got was from a cell after it turned into
perfect<00:00:33.079> cell<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.739> I<00:00:34.670> think<00:00:34.850> there's<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.030> mini

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
perfect cell and I think there's a mini

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.840 
perfect cell and I think there's a mini
sort<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.870> brawl<00:00:36.140> with<00:00:36.379> trunks<00:00:37.070> beforehand<00:00:37.700> so

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
sort of brawl with trunks beforehand so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.700 
sort of brawl with trunks beforehand so
i<00:00:38.000> just<00:00:38.270> put<00:00:38.480> trunks<00:00:38.719> in<00:00:38.900> there<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.320> just<00:00:39.620> to

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
i just put trunks in there and just to

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.900 
i just put trunks in there and just to
make<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.950> video<00:00:40.130> a<00:00:40.190> bit<00:00:40.340> longer<00:00:40.520> as<00:00:40.730> well

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
make the video a bit longer as well

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.310 
make the video a bit longer as well
because<00:00:41.180> one<00:00:41.390> against<00:00:41.630> one<00:00:41.810> isn't<00:00:41.930> gonna<00:00:42.110> bail

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
because one against one isn't gonna bail

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.600 
because one against one isn't gonna bail
last<00:00:42.440> very<00:00:42.710> long<00:00:42.740> time<00:00:43.070> not<00:00:43.160> playing<00:00:43.400> with<00:00:43.550> the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610
