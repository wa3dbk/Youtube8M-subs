a dozen times agrees it still makes that
noise<00:00:19.680> let's<00:00:20.680> put<00:00:20.829> a<00:00:20.860> new<00:00:20.980> one<00:00:21.009> in<00:00:21.220> there<00:00:21.369> good

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.060 

he<00:00:38.540> looked<00:00:38.720> about<00:00:38.810> 3<00:00:39.140> grand<00:00:39.170> for<00:00:39.500> ships<00:00:39.860> out<00:00:40.040> at

he looked about 3 grand for ships out at

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.410 
he looked about 3 grand for ships out at
first<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.610> like<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:40.790> said<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.270> don't

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
first and like I said it and I don't

for the three grand shifts but wouldn't

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.180 
for the three grand shifts but wouldn't
be<00:01:04.809> bad<00:01:05.020> if<00:01:05.050> I<00:01:05.290> just<00:01:05.470> wanted<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.860> speed

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
be bad if I just wanted to speed

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.680 
be bad if I just wanted to speed
transmission<00:01:06.760> but<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.090> want<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.390> get<00:01:07.480> on<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
do 10 grand get up to six you're sitting

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.070 
do 10 grand get up to six you're sitting
on<00:01:14.680> their<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:16.570> got<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.750> pretty<00:01:16.900> little

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
on their of it just got a pretty little

on their of it just got a pretty little
jump<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.470> it<00:01:17.530> I've<00:01:18.310> never<00:01:18.490> never<00:01:19.150> had<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.420> all

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
jump to it I've never never had it all

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 

brick<00:01:42.150> streets<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.659> hard<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
brick streets are a little hard to get a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:58.030 
brick streets are a little hard to get a
smooth<00:01:43.670> place<00:01:44.670> huh

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.800 

so<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.460> can<00:01:58.700> live<00:01:58.850> with<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.090> first<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.450> second

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
so I can live with the first a second

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.010 
so I can live with the first a second

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.850 

after<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.539> even<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.560> get<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
after that even if you get it up to

after that even if you get it up to
3,000<00:02:11.430> RPM<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.910> still<00:02:12.180> not<00:02:12.330> shifting<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.870> the

3,000 RPM so still not shifting in the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.710 

later<00:02:44.840> on<00:02:44.990> I'll<00:02:45.140> see<00:02:45.290> what<00:02:45.470> role
