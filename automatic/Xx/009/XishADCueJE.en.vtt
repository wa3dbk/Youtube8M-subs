00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.780 
sound and also I got my power supply
down<00:03:15.660> here<00:03:16.100> actual<00:03:17.100> power<00:03:17.250> supply<00:03:17.730> is

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
down here actual power supply is

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.050 
down here actual power supply is
installed<00:03:18.569> upside<00:03:18.959> down<00:03:19.430> there's<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.549> vent

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
installed upside down there's a vent

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.910 
installed upside down there's a vent
port<00:03:21.299> on<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> very<00:03:21.840> bottom<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.620> case

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
port on the very bottom of this case

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.530 
port on the very bottom of this case
that<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.840> could<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:26.609> can<00:03:26.760> install<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.239> upside

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
that you could you can install it upside

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.569 
that you could you can install it upside
down<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.109> could<00:03:28.260> vent<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.430> only

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
down and you could vent it the only

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.309 
down and you could vent it the only
problem<00:03:30.030> with<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.840> can't<00:03:31.079> set

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
problem with that is that you can't set

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.770 
problem with that is that you can't set
it<00:03:31.349> on<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> carpet<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.359> set<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.569> on

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
it on a carpet you have to set it on

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.140 
it on a carpet you have to set it on
something<00:03:34.079> hard<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.799> could<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.220> proper

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
something hard so you could have proper

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.970 
something hard so you could have proper
air<00:03:36.389> ventilation<00:03:39.260> other<00:03:40.260> than<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.920> mean

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
air ventilation other than that I mean

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.309 
air ventilation other than that I mean
there<00:03:41.430> really<00:03:41.459> wasn't<00:03:41.940> any<00:03:42.209> much<00:03:42.450> room<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.079> put

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
there really wasn't any much room to put

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.979 
there really wasn't any much room to put
any<00:03:43.980> height<00:03:44.430> any<00:03:44.609> wiring<00:03:44.880> on<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.359> inside

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.460 

wiring<00:03:48.989> placement<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.799> pretty<00:03:50.040> tight<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.519> here

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
wiring placement is pretty tight in here

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.550 
wiring placement is pretty tight in here
want<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.560> take<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.739> look<00:03:53.040> oh<00:03:53.549> no<00:03:54.349> can't<00:03:55.349> really

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
want to take a look oh no can't really

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.400 
want to take a look oh no can't really
see<00:03:55.799> but<00:03:56.359> seems<00:03:57.359> like<00:03:57.450> wires<00:03:57.780> are<00:03:58.049> everywhere

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
see but seems like wires are everywhere

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.000 
see but seems like wires are everywhere
I<00:03:58.970> tried<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.120> tack<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.109> down<00:04:01.380> as<00:04:01.560> much<00:04:01.590> as<00:04:01.799> I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
I tried to tack it down as much as I

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.330 
I tried to tack it down as much as I
could<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:04.709> know<00:04:04.799> how<00:04:04.889> that<00:04:04.950> goes

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
could but you know how that goes

00:04:06.340 --> 00:05:01.300 
could but you know how that goes
all<00:04:07.000> right<00:04:07.209> well<00:04:07.390> then<00:04:07.540> turn<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:07.900> on

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.580 

and<00:05:01.970> as<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:02.389> can<00:05:02.540> see<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:02.930> can<00:05:03.080> control<00:05:03.440> the

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
and as you can see you can control the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.540 
and as you can see you can control the
film<00:05:03.860> here<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:05.480> could<00:05:05.630> turn<00:05:05.810> them<00:05:05.990> off<00:05:06.170> if<00:05:06.590> I

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
film here you could turn them off if I

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.210 
film here you could turn them off if I
wanted<00:05:07.910> to

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.800 

and<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:10.910> could<00:05:11.240> turn<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.540> light<00:05:11.690> off<00:05:11.720> also<00:05:12.580> and

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
and I could turn the light off also and

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.490 
and I could turn the light off also and
the<00:05:14.810> lights<00:05:15.020> also<00:05:15.380> sound<00:05:15.650> activated<00:05:18.970> so<00:05:19.970> I

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
the lights also sound activated so I

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.940 
the lights also sound activated so I
could<00:05:21.500> have<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:22.660> react<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.900> music<00:05:24.350> if<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.620> had<00:05:24.770> my

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
could have it react to music if I had my

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:40.430 
could have it react to music if I had my
music<00:05:25.310> on

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.650 

see<00:05:41.040> there's<00:05:41.370> my<00:05:41.640> temperature<00:05:42.120> control<00:05:42.630> you

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
see there's my temperature control you

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.840 
see there's my temperature control you
could<00:05:43.110> see<00:05:43.320> you<00:05:43.530> could<00:05:43.710> check<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.310> CPU

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
could see you could check the CPU

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.260 
could see you could check the CPU
temperature<00:05:45.890> the<00:05:46.890> harddrive<00:05:47.550> temperature

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
temperature the harddrive temperature

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.380 
temperature the harddrive temperature
and<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.860> system<00:05:50.250> temperature<00:05:50.730> which<00:05:50.970> I<00:05:51.150> have

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
and the system temperature which I have

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.220 
and the system temperature which I have
actually<00:05:51.870> clocking<00:05:52.290> on<00:05:52.410> the<00:05:52.590> arm<00:05:52.830> Ram<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:57.230> it

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
actually clocking on the arm Ram so it

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.100 
actually clocking on the arm Ram so it
also<00:05:58.410> tells<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:58.860> time<00:05:59.070> and<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.610> date<00:06:00.110> tells

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
also tells the time and the date tells

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.140 
also tells the time and the date tells
you<00:06:01.260> what's<00:06:01.530> moving<00:06:01.950> and<00:06:02.250> got<00:06:02.400> fans<00:06:02.670> moving

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
you what's moving and got fans moving

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.990 
you what's moving and got fans moving
hard<00:06:03.480> drives<00:06:03.750> moving<00:06:04.430> you<00:06:05.430> could<00:06:05.550> also<00:06:05.700> change

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
hard drives moving you could also change

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.900 
hard drives moving you could also change
the<00:06:06.210> speed<00:06:06.420> of<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.660> fan<00:06:06.870> with<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.880> but<00:06:08.880> I

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
the speed of the fan with this but I

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.060 
the speed of the fan with this but I
don't<00:06:09.210> have<00:06:09.390> that<00:06:09.930> but<00:06:10.170> that<00:06:10.920> particular

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
don't have that but that particular

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.890 
don't have that but that particular
function<00:06:11.820> doesn't<00:06:12.030> really<00:06:12.390> work<00:06:12.600> very<00:06:12.840> good

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
function doesn't really work very good

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.810 
function doesn't really work very good
that's<00:06:13.290> why<00:06:13.440> I<00:06:13.470> use<00:06:13.770> this<00:06:14.010> particular<00:06:14.370> fan

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
that's why I use this particular fan

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:28.950 
that's why I use this particular fan
controller<00:06:15.210> it<00:06:15.420> works<00:06:15.570> way<00:06:15.990> better

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.749 

but<00:06:29.500> there<00:06:29.680> you<00:06:29.710> go<00:06:29.800> I'm<00:06:30.039> not<00:06:30.070> a<00:06:30.220> super<00:06:30.580> hard

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
but there you go I'm not a super hard

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:36.270 
but there you go I'm not a super hard
gamer<00:06:31.030> so<00:06:31.509> I<00:06:31.539> don't<00:06:31.870> really<00:06:33.090> have<00:06:34.889> many<00:06:35.889> games

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
gamer so I don't really have many games

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:43.370 
gamer so I don't really have many games
I<00:06:36.729> got<00:06:37.660> by<00:06:37.840> a<00:06:37.919> 3.0<00:06:39.300> 500<00:06:40.300> gig<00:06:40.509> hard<00:06:40.539> drive<00:06:40.840> here

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
I got by a 3.0 500 gig hard drive here

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:54.950 
I got by a 3.0 500 gig hard drive here
that<00:06:44.380> I<00:06:44.410> have<00:06:44.650> plugged<00:06:44.889> in<00:06:50.699> and<00:06:51.699> there<00:06:51.850> it<00:06:51.940> is

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.889 

hope<00:06:55.530> you<00:06:55.650> enjoy
