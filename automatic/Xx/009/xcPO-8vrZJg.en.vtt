00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.970
 two movements of the slider do very 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.960
 beautiful and fashionable toni toni toning 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:27.250
 photos, so let's get started 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 as usual we do by purchasing the layer to the background 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:36.429
 conditions add mask mass 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.819
 level adjustment layer and here 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:42.999
 tools are very simple very easy to 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:48.039
 We choose to work in blue 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:52.289
 channels how does it work if we move 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:55.469
 these sliders, that is, we add 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.139
 yellow color on the photo 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.909
 if long light colors air and 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:07.390
 add blue color but if we will 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.909
 do so and so it turns out not 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.409
 beautiful effect yellow and blue then she 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.079
 It turns out in bright colors appear and 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.479
 it turns ugly 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.430
 we will return to work here with these 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.049
 sliders 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:32.679
 it means light colors we add 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:33.609
 the yellow color of the dark bell is answering 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.219
 beyond the dark area 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:42.850
 we in the dark she add blue 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:48.570
 we tint the blue color as you can see already 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.570
 a very interesting effect is obtained 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.570
 effect like a film photo 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.930
 which previously were recorded on film 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:04.060
 but let's add some more blue 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.640
 we open the red channel and move already 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:14.260
 here is this slider quite a bit we 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.959
 add a little yolk 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.060

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:31.930
 the result is two simple ones 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.610
