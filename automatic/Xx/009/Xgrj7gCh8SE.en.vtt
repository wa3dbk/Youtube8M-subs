you could see that it became a man

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.200 
you could see that it became a man
because<00:01:58.500> he<00:01:58.530> became<00:01:58.829> physical<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> tough<00:01:59.909> I

about him I think it was a lot of
insecurity<00:02:36.140> because<00:02:36.260> when<00:02:36.860> you're<00:02:37.040> out<00:02:37.070> into

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
to function a little bit differently

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.550 
to function a little bit differently
