00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.000
 Your role as an observer is going to go on. 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.759
 Here I am now mixing egg yolk and egg yolk should not be ripe. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.460
 Let's get married I was home two four 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.880
 U 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.880
 By mixing 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.810
 Pour the whites and make meringue in fear now. 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.810
 Let's go. Let 's cry. 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.330
 Now do meringue'm the head gatchumyeon 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:45.580
 Now to this extent , I'll mix the meringue a little bit. 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:49.960
 So who is to mix as it rolled into the back who led the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:56.080
 Foundation up as bubbles off en 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 It's very important now. We mix the last remaining meringue and get some cheese. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.770
 I'm going to change. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.019
 I'm really good at it. 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.739
 Give me a little tg and I'll mix it. 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.810
 Do not let this bubble sink. 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.440
 I mix it up like this. 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.560
 Let's put this in the container. 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.650
 Why is there a bit of a bug on the outside? 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:32.120
 This one isnt andoejyo the next job so 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.530
 It's in the jug. It's in the oven and it's moist. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.459
 It's like having a bubble so it's a bubble bath. 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.959
 The temperature of a little warm water is a bit more likely to succeed, so the probability of success 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.750
 Go high. 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.489
 Now I think most of the exceptions should be put before this . 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:54.069
 I'm coming in . 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.069

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.019
 Tell me to fail. 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.740
