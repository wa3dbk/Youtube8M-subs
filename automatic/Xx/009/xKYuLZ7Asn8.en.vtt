00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.270
 a video in the intro video and 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.220
 though probably via a channel 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.309
 about readers what's going on 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.190
 and that's about pc videos and indeed 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.509
 many wanted as i returned april 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.779
 have done is only because men's fashion 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.300
 on the first april or in the first program 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.769
 where do I have the quotation marks that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.130
 I now continue to do pc videos and so on 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.289
 immediately 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.109
 but many have fun way 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.880
 I was glad that I did not think so 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.840
 and it annoyed me that it was 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.000
 it was a joke 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 my mobile has vibrated there, think you have 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 it belongs and that's why I'm mine 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.079
 I think I make two channels and that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.280
 Ethics two might be considered as one 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.649
 bit by jack frost with a look 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.820
 because the spex is two men but mine 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.140
 frankly, nothing better 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 I think of something better 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.320
 think of writing in the comments 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 then maybe the name is taken 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.309
 erwin jordan video or should be then 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.510
 All right but I am currently involved 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.390
 it would be good if it was good 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.559
 hard with it 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.550
 I said my quotes the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.680
 So brand it just like that 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.970
 common name or that is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.040
 common name that at that time easy 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.260
 is preserved and that is already one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.479
 connection to the main channel exist 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.310
 So stay tune! 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.360
 subscribe and just click 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.470
 channel stop by always come like that 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.130
 I have video sessions channel concept 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.110
 I just thought 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.840
 it will be very simple video me 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.340
 will record with obs is why 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.350
 The quality may not be that good 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.229
 may also be because that my pc no 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.290
 full hd screen will make 720 ps 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.689
 we screen 768 or something 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.100
 something is upstairs modern like him 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.450
 also always like these little ones 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.430

 with openbroadcast software and yes it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 keep that good old time in mind 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 that means everything has to change quickly 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.880

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.799
 no matter what is war than three minutes 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.600
 goes or two minutes five minutes or 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.040
 how long it's actually 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.689
 not so long or bed what my 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.730
