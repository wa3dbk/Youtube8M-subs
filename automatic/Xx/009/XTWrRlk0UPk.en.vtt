I<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:27.120> used<00:03:28.130> as<00:03:29.130> far<00:03:29.489> as<00:03:29.580> like<00:03:29.700> high-end

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
I have used as far as like high-end

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.770 
I have used as far as like high-end
tablets<00:03:30.450> go

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
tablets go

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.940 
tablets go
we're<00:03:31.650> high-end<00:03:32.250> scanners<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.810> have<00:03:33.810> used<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
we're high-end scanners I have used the

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.250 
we're high-end scanners I have used the
snap-on<00:03:35.340> verus<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:37.200> Mac<00:03:37.590> mentor<00:03:39.260> things

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
snap-on verus and the Mac mentor things

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.930 
snap-on verus and the Mac mentor things
mentor<00:03:40.650> touch<00:03:40.830> or<00:03:40.980> whatever<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.370> whatever

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
mentor touch or whatever is whatever

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.380 
mentor touch or whatever is whatever
their<00:03:43.010> most<00:03:44.010> expensive<00:03:44.280> one<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> think

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
their most expensive one is so I think

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.509 
their most expensive one is so I think
it<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.570> like<00:03:45.690> eight<00:03:45.840> thousand<00:03:46.230> dollars<00:03:46.519> and

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
it was like eight thousand dollars and

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.180 
it was like eight thousand dollars and
Varys<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.230> ten<00:03:49.230> thousand<00:03:49.680> but<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.040> think

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
Varys was ten thousand but I think

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.530 
Varys was ten thousand but I think
snap-on<00:03:50.519> how<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.730> deal<00:03:51.000> we<00:03:51.180> could<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.390> should

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
snap-on how to deal we could I should

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.970 
snap-on how to deal we could I should
get<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.720> Varys<00:03:51.959> for<00:03:52.170> like<00:03:52.320> half<00:03:52.530> price<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:52.920> was

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
get to Varys for like half price it was

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.080 
get to Varys for like half price it was
like<00:03:53.130> five<00:03:53.340> grand<00:03:53.640> or<00:03:53.790> something<00:03:54.290> anyway

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
like five grand or something anyway

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.070 
like five grand or something anyway
