00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.460
 Many people have asked me today like 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:08.640
 it can be the 662 cartridge or the 112 that 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.580
 in the background they are practically the same 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.700
 these cartridges with the printer 1 ones 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.279
 15 15 hp and I think it's a very good 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.589
 moment to give them how to withdraw 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.900
 this cartridge so today I'm going to 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.900
 teach how to remove the 662 cartridge 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.340
 good to start 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.339
 we have to be clear that we did not have to 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.949
 need one more listen than with the other 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.710
 video so let's start turning on 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.360
 the printer 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.019
 for the next step I'm going to 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.920
 remember that it is important how to recharge 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.560
 the cartridge and in other cases have a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.900
 There is a hand and I think I can load a place 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.790
 where can you go 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.940
 so let's start with following 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 steps as a first step what we're going to 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.820
 do is going to be removing the cartridges from the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.430
 printer in sense 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 a very important die and the cartridges 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.930
 they can not be completely empty is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.880
 say just not after it starts to miss 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.490
 undo ink and this process 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.469
 As I said before, it must be almost 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.780
 empty if they are completely empty 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.259
 this will not work if as following 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.039
 step let's unplug the printer 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.750
 directly it is important that you 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:52.780
 turned on when disconnecting 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.030
 the important thing is this is the moment 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.580
 when one should go to recharge the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.650
 cartridges because we should leave it 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.560
 disconnected with the open opener 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.229
 for half an hour minimum there are people who 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.900
 recommend between half an hour later 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.310
 personally I say at least half an hour like this 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.680
 that at this point is where one should 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.440
 Take advantage to recharge the cartridge or 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.200
 send it to recharge 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.770
 a beast recharged in cartridge we are going to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.520
 proceed to insert it again but 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.130
 the printer must still be disconnected 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.980
 so let's try the cartridges and 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.610
 once inserted we will connect the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.210
 printer 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.940
 which should light alone if not 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.040
 lonely heras start all 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.340
 process again 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.340
 to 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.730
 and there are a few cases but they are 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.470
 possible that the printer detects and 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.290
 the cartridges are loaded as a 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.530
 new cartridge this is due to an error 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.159
 that usually happens when the printer 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.129
 disconnected for a long time and this one 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:09.220
 usually turn off alone in waking state 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.489
 for that reason not to leave them connected 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.129
 several several days or several hours of 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.530
 service loading immediately inside 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.510
 of the term between half an hour 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.060
 now as my printer usually asks for a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.370
 sheet to turn them on let's accept 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.860
 a sheet to make sure it's not 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.750
 If you have detected the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.850
 cartridges as new as it is not 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.459
 printing anything that has to do with 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.890
 cleaning the cartridges we can 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.530
 realize that the cartridge reads it as 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.440
 used 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.090
 now to prove that the cartridges 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.610
 they are effectively printing we are going to 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.620
 stop a color image for 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.090
 make sure that both the black and 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.090
 color in this feeling 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.840
 here we can see in quick camera as the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.740
 company now scans and prints in color 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.740
 the drawing he has in the scanner and 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.480
 we can notice how it is printing 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.850
 feels more in other words to say 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.460
 that this process works 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.970
 but as I said it is important to continue 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.890
 all these steps to have fusion of 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.080
 other things that are wrong that in culture 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.900
 two at a time was an error message with 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.880
 Regarding the demanding cartridges arrives 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.100
 to happen is completely normal is 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.870
 easy and not from the mouth so the circuit 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.030
 this video do not forget to give your lex 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.480
 subscribe and I would not appreciate much I'm 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.290
 stick acz and as always see you in 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.290
 another video
