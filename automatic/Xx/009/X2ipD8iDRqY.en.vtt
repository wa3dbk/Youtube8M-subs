00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.780 

so<00:00:09.840> sometimes<00:00:10.260> organizing<00:00:10.950> files<00:00:11.190> by<00:00:11.400> folders

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
so sometimes organizing files by folders

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.030 
so sometimes organizing files by folders
just<00:00:12.000> doesn't<00:00:12.540> work<00:00:12.690> for<00:00:12.990> instance<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.920> may

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
just doesn't work for instance you may

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.580 
just doesn't work for instance you may
have<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.460> document<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.299> belongs<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.020> multiple

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
have a document that belongs in multiple

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.800 
have a document that belongs in multiple
folders<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.730> better<00:00:17.880> way<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
folders so a better way to do it is to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050 
folders so a better way to do it is to
tag<00:00:19.199> files<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.859> same<00:00:20.070> way<00:00:20.189> might<00:00:20.460> tag<00:00:20.699> photos

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
tag files in same way might tag photos

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.929 
tag files in same way might tag photos
or<00:00:21.480> music<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.789> use

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
or music now the way to do this and use

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.700 
or music now the way to do this and use
something<00:00:24.269> called<00:00:24.300> spotlight<00:00:24.900> comments<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
something called spotlight comments it

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.660 
something called spotlight comments it
allows<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.369> add<00:00:26.910> tags<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.960> files<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.160> then

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
allows you to add tags to files and then

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
allows you to add tags to files and then
you<00:00:29.760> could<00:00:29.910> search<00:00:30.300> by<00:00:30.510> those<00:00:30.720> tags<00:00:30.960> later<00:00:31.260> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you could search by those tags later so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.380 
you could search by those tags later so
here<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.550> folder<00:00:32.820> filled<00:00:33.210> with

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
may need to open it to see it now I can

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
may need to open it to see it now I can
add<00:00:52.289> tags<00:00:53.070> let<00:00:53.670> me<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.969> call<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:54.899> something

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
add tags let me just call them something

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.529 
add tags let me just call them something
simple<00:00:55.260> let's<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> names<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> can

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
simple let's just use it names so I can

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
simple let's just use it names so I can
add<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> tag<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.350> Jones<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.070> separate

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
add a tag like Jones and I can separate

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.369 
add a tag like Jones and I can separate
it<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.969> commas<00:01:01.039> Smith<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.989> then<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it with commas Smith and then I can

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.100 
it with commas Smith and then I can
close<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.150> one<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> next<00:01:06.930> one

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
close that one go to the next one

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.410 
close that one go to the next one
command<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> add<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:09.229> tag<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:11.420> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
command I and add a tag there and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
command I and add a tag there and
continue<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
continue down now you would do this

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.850 
continue down now you would do this
ideally<00:01:14.970> while<00:01:15.360> creating<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.900> documents<00:01:16.409> not

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
ideally while creating the documents not

ideally while creating the documents not
after<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> fact<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.909> shortcut<00:01:18.810> by<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
after the fact a shortcut by the way is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
after the fact a shortcut by the way is
to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.770> command<00:01:20.250> option<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.570> hold<00:01:21.689> down

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
to do command option I if I hold down

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
to do command option I if I hold down
the<00:01:21.900> option<00:01:22.229> key<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.100> it's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the option key you can see here it's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
the option key you can see here it's
command<00:01:23.640> option<00:01:23.909> I'd<00:01:24.000> show<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.720> inspector

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
command option I'd show the inspector

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
command option I'd show the inspector
who<00:01:25.710> looks<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> info<00:01:26.670> window<00:01:26.939> but
