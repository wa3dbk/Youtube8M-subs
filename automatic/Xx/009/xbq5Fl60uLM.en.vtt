00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
opposite another thing that was good

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
opposite another thing that was good
about<00:01:06.330> having<00:01:06.720> ruby<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> big<00:01:07.439> bra<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
about having ruby is a big bra is that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670 
about having ruby is a big bra is that
it<00:01:08.790> gave<00:01:08.939> me<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.299> guess<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.810> goal<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> try<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it gave me I guess a goal to try and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.789 
it gave me I guess a goal to try and
beat<00:01:10.850> wish<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> rush<00:01:12.119> ready<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.680> in

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
beat wish the rush ready which in

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.060 
beat wish the rush ready which in
retrospect<00:01:14.130> isn't<00:01:14.760> actually<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> hard<00:01:16.070> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
retrospect isn't actually that hard I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
retrospect isn't actually that hard I
think<00:01:18.030> he's<00:01:18.180> beat<00:01:18.420> me<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:19.080> try<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
think he's beat me because try as I

think he's beat me because try as I
might<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.950> don't<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.119> I'll<00:01:21.240> ever<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.509> able<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
might I don't think I'll ever be able to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
might I don't think I'll ever be able to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
get a girl quite like Cassandra hell I
nearly<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.170> should<00:01:25.320> even<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.830> her<00:01:25.950> set

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
nearly think we should even get her set

I've<00:01:57.899> come<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.920> realize<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
I've come to realize that this is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.180 
exactly what these two home a connection
that<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> blazing<00:02:04.350> fire<00:02:04.530> cannot<00:02:05.009> be

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
that like a blazing fire cannot be

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.809 
that like a blazing fire cannot be
contained<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:06.390> flickered<00:02:06.780> sprawled<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.200> scene

contained but flickered sprawled a scene

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.039 
contained but flickered sprawled a scene
many<00:02:08.819> people<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.269> married<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.780> they're

love<00:02:12.450> never<00:02:12.660> has<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> happy<00:02:13.170> ending<00:02:13.319> because

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
love never has a happy ending because

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.430 
love never has a happy ending because
true<00:02:14.430> love<00:02:14.459> never<00:02:14.790> ends<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:16.349> is

true love never ends and that is
something<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.799> think<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.069> can<00:02:17.220> all<00:02:17.370> am<00:02:17.519> be

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
something I think we can all am be

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.850 
something I think we can all am be
whether<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.540> are<00:02:18.660> new<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.930> love<00:02:19.049> well

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
whether we are new to love well

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.250 
whether we are new to love well
acquainted<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.489> love<00:02:20.730> or<00:02:21.000> yet<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.750> find<00:02:21.989> it

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.690 

so<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.349> reflection<00:02:25.799> of<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.220> propose<00:02:26.670> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
so in reflection of this I propose a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.690 
so in reflection of this I propose a
toast<00:02:27.000> not<00:02:27.810> only<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.380> happy<00:02:28.650> couple<00:02:28.700> but
