 hi girls today I you 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.389
 found with a new video and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.190
 it's a video that I'm too much 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.020
 glad to do because it is 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 of my christmas contest and that's it 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.250
 really something that I spent 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.300
 time to find brands for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.250
 find the little logo manage yourself 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.780
 concoct and here I am really 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.779
 happy because it will allow me 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.910
 also to thank you so much because 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.680
 that we are soon stimulated on my channel 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.750
 and that's really something 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.949
 which touches me enormously I am but 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.439
 just super happy 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.250
 6000 subscribers but it's just huge six 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 thousand people 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 Anyway, it's just great and it's me 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.399
 motivates even more to make videos 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.790
 even better that will please you again 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.320
 more 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.850
 and that's really my point 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.410
 continue this adventure with you and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.610
 with all the others youtube is you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.140
 have noticed I have a little hat 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.340
 great owl on the head I'm going 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.260
 remove it because I'm so hot 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.640
 so we will first start with the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 lots and then I would tell you all 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.870
 conditions so the first two 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.520
 long was concocted per month and they 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.410
 each contain four small 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.719
 products so in the first batch all 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.250
 first you're going to have a party that's 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 the overdose that is just a killing 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.879
 gold game I've already finished my bottle 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.650
 me she's just great so I'm going 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.420
 to show you a little the bottle so here we go 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 it looks like that it's just a 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.110
 wonder this smell is just awesome 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 that a smell strong enough so 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 so you still have to like it but 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.540
 frankly this is one of the starters 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.369
 favorite the second product you 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.720
 will have in this lot it's a product that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.670
 comes from the brand jeannard thesis and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.979
 it's a body milk I already have a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.689
 perfume of this brand and it's really 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.200
 great i love the smell is just a 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.729
 killing 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.320
 the third product you will have a little 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.270
 nail polish by marionnaud 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 and it's the 40 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 cosmic gold is a very pretty rose gold 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.960
 and with that you will also have a step back 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.250
 afraid of home lipstick so raise 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.140
 which is a little bit the same color as 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.759
 the varnish from elsewhere for the second no 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.770
 you will also have a perfume 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.390
 but this time it's at the desjardins 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.490
 from clarence it's also 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.900
 super nice it's a very very scent 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.420
 flowered so here it comes as 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.700
 that's a flat 35 min liters when 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.290
 same and it is really great they are 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.610
 super good and that's the mark 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.830
 Clarins is a brand that I love 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.869
 enormously then always in the same 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.640
 lot you're going to have a cream for them 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.290

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.750

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.440
 a soothing care of the brand derma gore 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.450
 so that's in itself a little bit for them 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.920
 acne or sensitive skin last 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.500

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.170

 after application and over the long term 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.980

 win two tattoos each on the 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.959
 site makes everyone small so for those 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.420
 who do not know these are fake 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.430
 tattoos so country tattooing you see 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.340
 clean of any age and so you feast 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.040
 fake tattoos that hold between 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.290
 one to two weeks it seems to me I have 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.459
 tested one for now but it makes a 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.019
 day that I have it so I can not 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.900
 To tell you too much too much 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.159
 so it's love is enough 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.720
 and if not I have a second one 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.950
 present like those I like a little 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.200
 less but that's still great 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.459
 hot and so that's all I'm you 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.199
 will say if it ever new 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.729
 really hold or not I might have 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.500
 not have to put it there because I saw 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.699
 play volleyball and I take the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.710
 balloons on the other hand is it okay maybe 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.690
 leave very quickly 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.800
 so I do not know I'll hold you at 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.479
 running I'll tell you if that holds 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.760
 really but in all cases 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.220
 two of you will be able to win two 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.660
 tattoos of their choice on this site and 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.150
 this is a concept that I like 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.130
 it's quite original so to have a 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.210
 little tattoo a week or two 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.800
 it's pretty good 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.139
 we will immediately go to 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.270
