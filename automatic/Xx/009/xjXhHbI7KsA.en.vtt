00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.099 
is starting to really really come out a
lot<00:00:22.380> better<00:00:23.420> remember<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:24.600> rocks<00:00:24.960> were

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
lot better remember these rocks were

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
lot better remember these rocks were
covered<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.920> slime<00:00:26.220> only<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> week<00:00:27.029> ago

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
there but how clean they are now

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.810 
there but how clean they are now
compared<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.950> what<00:00:35.160> they<00:00:35.309> were<00:00:35.989> is<00:00:36.989> amazing

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
compared to what they were is amazing

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.810 
compared to what they were is amazing
I've<00:00:38.820> been<00:00:39.210> making<00:00:39.899> sure<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.440> my<00:00:40.620> ph<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.700> at

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
I've been making sure that my ph is at

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.779 
I've been making sure that my ph is at
the<00:00:41.940> correct<00:00:42.059> level<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:46.039> I've<00:00:47.039> turned<00:00:47.460> down

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the correct level and I've turned down

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.410 
the correct level and I've turned down
my<00:00:48.180> lights<00:00:48.899> they're<00:00:49.620> only<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.940> about<00:00:51.030> four

had a mat which was about about 9 to 10
hours<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.480> day<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.940> basically<00:00:59.940> try<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> remove

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
hours a day just basically try to remove

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.830 
hours a day just basically try to remove
the<00:01:00.660> food<00:01:00.870> source<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.559> slime<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> far

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the food source for the slime and so far

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
the food source for the slime and so far
it's<00:01:04.049> worked<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.470> well<00:01:05.060> I'm<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's worked really well I'm going to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.870 
it's worked really well I'm going to
keep<00:01:06.450> doing<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.049> doing<00:01:07.820> until<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
keep doing what I'm doing until I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.429

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
of it and then I'll jump it back up to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.719 
of it and then I'll jump it back up to
regular<00:01:13.880> time<00:01:14.880> frame<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.100> new<00:01:17.130> guy<00:01:17.430> I

new torch call it's of orange tipped
torch<00:01:43.500> crow<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> compare<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.570> my

torch crow you can compare it to my

torch crow you can compare it to my
other<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.729> that<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> difference

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
other one here that was the difference

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.340 
other one here that was the difference
in<00:01:48.390> color<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:50.450> got<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
in color I got this one this one was a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.920

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
actually fragged from the store the guys

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.380 
actually fragged from the store the guys
tank<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> store<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.430> stuff<00:01:56.640> from<00:01:57.890> I

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
tank at the store I get my stuff from I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.590 
tank at the store I get my stuff from I
might<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.509> lost<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.960> few<00:02:01.140> SPS<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
might have lost a few SPS up here when I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.030 
might have lost a few SPS up here when I
when<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> took<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> rocks<00:02:04.469> out<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.829> cleaned

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
when I took the rocks out and cleaned

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.709 
when I took the rocks out and cleaned
them<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.250> think<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.460> sat<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:05.939> dry<00:02:06.240> too<00:02:06.299> long

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
them I think they sat out dry too long

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.910 
them I think they sat out dry too long
see<00:02:07.590> how<00:02:07.649> they're<00:02:07.860> white<00:02:08.099> now<00:02:09.200> but<00:02:10.200> uh<00:02:10.229> see

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
see how they're white now but uh see

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.380 
see how they're white now but uh see
this<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.250> did<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> exact<00:02:11.670> same<00:02:11.700> thing<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
this one did the exact same thing and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.640 
this one did the exact same thing and
now<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:12.930> getting<00:02:13.140> its<00:02:13.290> color

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650

and killing it because I was moving it
every<00:02:46.109> time<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.620> plant<00:02:47.430> somewhere<00:02:47.639> I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790
