00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.620
 Mountain is Hiroki even if in 2014 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.870
 It's kinda music to sell photos 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.230
 I thought that I wanted to work hard after a long time and bought a little variously, but one of those people 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.610
 Is 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 I would like to introduce it as a standard monitor headphone as it is a standard among sony mother 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.590
 Is raising 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 mdr cd 9- st 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.460
 It is a monitor headphone It is a detailed point 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.640
 When I go to textiles , there is a day in his country 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.460
 Cormorant that please look 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.670
 The reproduction frequency band or something like that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:45.340
 The length of the code says 2.5m 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.650
 Body also room does not include code to guess is about 200g 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.630
 Play during the stereo 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.790
 Isn't it 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.200
 I'd think of whether there are those who say What I diet pointer headphones 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.210
 Also 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:06.020
 win the rings router is headphones 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.450
 My nanny is a little trouble that its resolution is higher than that of a very ordinary one . 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.409
 It is a feature to feel 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 When 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.000
 What kind of thing is that resolution is high 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.680
 Speaking of example 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.780
 If you hear the band's song with this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.540
 Recommendation of drum Oh 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.810
 Drum bus 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:33.220
 The bass guitar vocals really remember one rear wheel clearly and firmly 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.220
 It will be 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.869
 It's hard to say 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 I mon went so ne 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.040
 For example, beats audio and so on are the usual heads of audio technica and so on 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 Let's say it's a fond 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.350
 I feel like a get used to high spirits with great sound is king has been little emphasis 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.050
 But also 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:06.220
 Here's a thing of feeling that would respect Shitaga, not enough things really speaking and 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:10.540
 It is the head method of feeling that it becomes easy to hear each one 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.030
 After that there are a lot of monitor headphones from around 5000 yen and why is the flight 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.900
 It is to say whether this time chose this 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:23.769
 Frankly because there is never used only this country 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.769
 It's been a long time ago and I was doing Ando 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.620
 Even though because the opportunity to recordings I was there several times 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.120
 It is always this which is left when going to the studio 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.270
 It is this that is put on 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.810
 Because this is a bit of the best 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.880
 I did this this time 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.610
 It's kind of like it's good to make music, it's kind of like it's good enough 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.670
 I think it's a feeling 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.010
 If I have more stuff, I will eat already 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.480
 But it might be the Sennheiser and go to either the over there 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.200
 Yummy tombs It feels like this would be fine and it would be safe to buy this for the time being 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.519
 Say 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.459
 head for Why I was talking about this time Yes I introduced it this time 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:11.410
 Monitor head 4 from Sony 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:14.590
 mdr c 900 st was 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.060
 Really ne the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.290
 If you get lost because of the 8 holes in the Monica , buy Kore 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.769
 I guess is I feel it 's Oh 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.770
 Well I did come to mean that please try to check everyone 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:32.030
