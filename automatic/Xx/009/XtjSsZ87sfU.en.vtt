00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.850
 not exciting enough 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.230
 well i guess this one was it 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.880
 tension the previous may have surpassed you 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.880
 you have to play the game in hungary 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 when i'm and or the match he does one more 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.710
 that you what 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.930
 think he was a whiting more before 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 5 during what of which the the steam 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.470
 greenlight 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 it seems that you can be toilet or hard man 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.890
 the match today 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.980
 yes thank you hear what chopin or cost yes 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.780
 Pro-Life Glucose will be another one 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 really big game and well i think that below 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 The old timber player will be more of a place 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 really really good 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.290
 second half hour show year ruben yes 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.920
 reasonable we tim and i love ukiko there 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.899
 in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.510
 and i put it in oils you actually start 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.539
 I think it's difficult to match you 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.870
 makes yourself too difficult, I think 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.699
 I say very awkward cells I think 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.880
 that after in the second minute it did 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.940
 arrears come by 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.920
 my own doing is actually the same 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.449
 chasing the facts 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.370
 guess story of this was that was 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.440
 that do have more resilience 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.210
 release and import and troy and abs you thrill 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.660
 import apricots 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.370
 yes the pictures take how to bed and replay 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.620
 last week 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.510

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.700

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.910

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.729
 impotent for the tim front axle and axel i 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.850
 wikango we to positive atmosphere that 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.410
 not leave now and then half an hour starts 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.030
 psv and then you make a number 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.160
 great goals 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.020
 yes, I think that wallace is nice 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.720
 I have to say take out a loan 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.820
 very nice inside but good after van 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.820
 visitors to goal 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.140
 I say uncle spend time behind one 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.300
 on again came on starting 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.460
 lead and then we just fixed it 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.600
 know if that's the hard thing that's why you 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.360
 a few times behind the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.100
 facts have to come up with while you 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.940
 scores fantastic my indicates put out 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.300
 easy off 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.979
 well exactly and look think that was good 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.450
 have remained mentally strong by in 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.810
 never to give up by 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.490
 Going alone are the points that come out 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.720
 must because we actually give goal 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.060
 yourself that scrappy or risk or family 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.260

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.590

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.790
 two more club art form 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.350
 because were almost four if I am good 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.620

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.330
 yes it almost creates two more ball 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.320
 first half and both two of the 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.850

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.910

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.130
 yes related to my own goal 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.960
 two goals and assistants 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.660
 I think says enough today you can 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.840
 but with a second place yes yes certainly 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.840
