00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
alright so before we look at modifiers

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:02.629 
alright so before we look at modifiers
we're<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.829> take<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.949> look<00:00:02.159> at<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.340> 3d

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
we're going to take a look at the 3d

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.340 
we're going to take a look at the 3d
cursor<00:00:02.790> which<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.419> thing<00:00:03.600> here<00:00:03.780> it's

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
cursor which is this thing here it's

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.690 
cursor which is this thing here it's
three<00:00:04.589> main<00:00:04.740> functions<00:00:05.130> are<00:00:05.250> for<00:00:05.400> adding

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
three main functions are for adding

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.369 
three main functions are for adding
meshes<00:00:06.060> it'll<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.660> find<00:00:06.839> where<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> match<00:00:07.200> is

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
meshes it'll to find where the match is

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.860 
meshes it'll to find where the match is
placed<00:00:07.680> as<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.910> mentioned<00:00:09.210> earlier<00:00:09.330> if<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.690> go

placed as I mentioned earlier if you go
down<00:00:10.019> here<00:00:10.349> into<00:00:10.800> 3d<00:00:11.160> cursor<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.670> use<00:00:11.910> it

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
down here into 3d cursor you can use it

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.459 
down here into 3d cursor you can use it
to<00:00:12.179> select<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.509> pivot<00:00:12.960> point<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.290> an<00:00:13.380> object

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
to select a pivot point for an object

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.799 
to select a pivot point for an object
rotation<00:00:14.009> or<00:00:14.250> scale<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.759> most<00:00:15.420> importantly

the<00:00:15.960> 3d<00:00:16.289> cursor<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> tool<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.160> use<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the 3d cursor is the tool you use to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.070 
the 3d cursor is the tool you use to
redefine<00:00:17.880> an<00:00:18.000> object's<00:00:18.359> origin<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:18.869> center

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080

modifier<00:00:53.219> we're<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> look<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
modifier we're going to look at is the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
modifier we're going to look at is the
mirror<00:00:54.329> modifier<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
mirror modifier so if you go to the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.060 
mirror modifier so if you go to the
wrench<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.309> I've<00:00:56.879> modifier<00:00:57.600> mere<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.949> will

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
wrench here I've modifier mere that will

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
wrench here I've modifier mere that will
bring<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.280> these<00:00:59.430> options<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.539> modifiers

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
bring up these options now all modifiers

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.720 
bring up these options now all modifiers
are<00:01:01.230> non-destructive<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.280> any<00:01:02.370> point<00:01:02.489> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
are non-destructive so at any point you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
are non-destructive so at any point you
could<00:01:02.879> change<00:01:03.059> any<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> these<00:01:03.510> options<00:01:03.570> change

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
could change any of these options change

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.870 
could change any of these options change
the<00:01:04.680> order<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.040> which<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.369> modifiers<00:01:05.760> are

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the order in which the modifiers are

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.359 
the order in which the modifiers are
applied<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.720> X<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> close<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.439> now

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
applied or go to this X and close it now

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
applied or go to this X and close it now
modifiers<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.299> terms<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.659> object<00:01:10.110> mode

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
modifiers think in terms of object mode

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.929 
modifiers think in terms of object mode
so<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> mirrored<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
so here you see if i go to mirrored on

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.940 
so here you see if i go to mirrored on
the<00:01:12.030> y<00:01:12.180> axis<00:01:12.210> which<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.080> green<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> pull

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the y axis which is the green and pull

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.649 
the y axis which is the green and pull
this<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> side<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.670> object<00:01:15.030> mode<00:01:15.090> i'm<00:01:15.420> also

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this to the side in object mode i'm also

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.289 
this to the side in object mode i'm also
moving<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> origin<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.040> nothing<00:01:17.430> happens<00:01:17.790> now

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
moving the origin so nothing happens now

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
moving the origin so nothing happens now
if<00:01:18.420> i<00:01:18.509> undo<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.200> into<00:01:19.320> edit<00:01:19.500> mode<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
if i undo that and go into edit mode and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
if i undo that and go into edit mode and
pull<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.280> side<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.970> origin<00:01:21.390> stays<00:01:21.630> in

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
pull it to the side the origin stays in

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
pull it to the side the origin stays in
the<00:01:21.869> same<00:01:22.049> place<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:22.979> beard<00:01:23.369> across

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the same place and now it's beard across

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.160 
the same place and now it's beard across
another<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> consider<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
another thing to consider is that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
another thing to consider is that
modifiers<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.189> terms<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> local

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
modifiers think in terms of the local

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120 
modifiers think in terms of the local
axis<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.630> i<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> local<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.950> see

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
axis so if i go to local here you see

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.499 
axis so if i go to local here you see
right<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.790> still<00:01:29.850> aligned<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
right now it's still aligned with the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
right now it's still aligned with the
global<00:01:30.840> axis<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.439> i<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.619> back<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> object

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
global axis but if i go back to object

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.179 
global axis but if i go back to object
mode<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.790> rotate<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.869> I've<00:01:34.229> changed<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
mode and rotate this I've changed the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.370 
mode and rotate this I've changed the
axis<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:36.030> mirroring<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.990> undo

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
axis on which I'm mirroring it if I undo

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
axis on which I'm mirroring it if I undo
that<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.130> same<00:01:38.310> rotation<00:01:38.850> at<00:01:38.970> edit

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that and do that same rotation at edit

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.870 
that and do that same rotation at edit
mode<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.799> my<00:01:40.920> local<00:01:41.250> axis<00:01:41.579> didn't

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
mode you can see my local axis didn't

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
mode you can see my local axis didn't
change<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.570> mirroring<00:01:42.840> across<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> same

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
change so it's mirroring across the same

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.950 
change so it's mirroring across the same
global<00:01:43.979> axis<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.970> any<00:01:45.000> point<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.509> object

mode<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.259> wanted<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> apply<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.310> local<00:01:47.670> axis<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
mode I wanted to apply my local axis and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
mode I wanted to apply my local axis and
convert<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.810> back<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> global<00:01:49.619> axis<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.159> can

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
convert it back to the global axis I can

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.639 
convert it back to the global axis I can
do<00:01:50.399> control<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.960> case<00:01:52.200> apply

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
do control a and in this case apply

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.249 
do control a and in this case apply
rotation<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.390> local<00:01:54.899> axis

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
rotation and you can see my local axis

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
rotation and you can see my local axis
is<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.590> same<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> global<00:01:56.280> alright<00:01:56.820> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
is now the same as the global alright so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
is now the same as the global alright so
one<00:01:57.119> mirroring<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> merge<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
one mirroring if you want to merge the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
one mirroring if you want to merge the
vertices<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.100> center<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.790> is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
vertices in the center all you do is

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.190 
vertices in the center all you do is
just<00:02:00.030> turn<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.270> clipping<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.140> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
just turn on clipping here and when you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.389 
just turn on clipping here and when you
move<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> together<00:02:01.710> you'll<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
move it together you'll see that the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
move it together you'll see that the
entire<00:02:02.640> center<00:02:03.000> line<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.479> merged<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
entire center line is not merged and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
entire center line is not merged and
then<00:02:04.439> something<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.860> consider<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
then something to consider for all the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
then something to consider for all the
rest<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.909> modifiers<00:02:06.299> are<00:02:06.509> these<00:02:06.689> four<00:02:06.930> buttons

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
rest of modifiers are these four buttons

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.469 
rest of modifiers are these four buttons
here<00:02:07.469> mainly<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.399> three<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.060> one<00:02:09.330> will

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
here mainly these three this one will

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.510 
here mainly these three this one will
render<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> modifier<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.830> off<00:02:10.950> this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
render with the modifier on or off this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.250 
render with the modifier on or off this
one<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:11.849> basically<00:02:12.180> preview<00:02:12.690> for<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.050> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
one will basically preview for you and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.790 
one will basically preview for you and
then<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.500> one

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
then this one

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.380 
then this one
will<00:02:13.950> allow<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.310> edit<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.940> its<00:02:15.120> final

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
will allow you to edit it in its final

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.570 
will allow you to edit it in its final
modified<00:02:15.840> state<00:02:16.200> such<00:02:16.530> as<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.370> most

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
modified state such as this the most

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.070 
modified state such as this the most
common<00:02:17.880> one<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> toggle<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.870> last

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
common one is just to toggle this last

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.420 
common one is just to toggle this last
one<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.620> off<00:02:19.710> depending<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.340> you're

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
one on and off depending on what you're

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.160 
one on and off depending on what you're
trying<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:21.780> moving<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.140> a

remove<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.750> goes<00:02:51.870> back<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.200> normal

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
remove this and it goes back to normal

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.530 
remove this and it goes back to normal
or<00:02:53.280> if<00:02:53.400> instead<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.700> wanted<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.090> apply<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.420> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
or if instead I wanted to apply it I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.240 
or if instead I wanted to apply it I
just<00:02:54.750> go<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> object<00:02:55.290> mode<00:02:55.320> apply<00:02:55.800> now<00:02:55.830> when<00:02:56.220> i

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
just go to object mode apply now when i

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.380 
just go to object mode apply now when i
go<00:02:56.310> back<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.580> edit<00:02:56.910> mode<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.150> see<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
go back to edit mode you see the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.630 
go back to edit mode you see the
subdivision<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.020> now<00:02:58.140> applied<00:02:58.520> alright<00:02:59.520> so

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
subdivision is now applied alright so

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.710 
subdivision is now applied alright so
now<00:02:59.760> we're<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> go<00:03:00.120> over<00:03:00.240> smoothing

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
now we're going to go over smoothing

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.370 
now we're going to go over smoothing
groups<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.230> go<00:03:02.070> into<00:03:02.220> edit<00:03:02.340> mode<00:03:02.460> select<00:03:02.970> all

scroll<00:03:04.380> down<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.770> can<00:03:04.800> choose<00:03:05.070> between

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
scroll down you can choose between

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.400 
scroll down you can choose between
smooth<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.880> flat<00:03:06.000> shading<00:03:06.420> here<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.260> want

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
smooth and flat shading here so you want

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.770 
smooth and flat shading here so you want
smooth<00:03:07.740> go<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> modifiers<00:03:08.880> add<00:03:09.180> new<00:03:09.420> edge

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
smooth go to modifiers add new edge

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.690 
smooth go to modifiers add new edge
split<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.740> if<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.920> dive<00:03:11.100> into<00:03:11.310> object<00:03:11.670> mode

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
split so if you dive into object mode

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.100 
split so if you dive into object mode
you<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.210> here<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.570> created<00:03:12.930> different

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
you can see here it's created different

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.230 
you can see here it's created different
smoothing<00:03:13.620> groups<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.340> angle<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.820> set<00:03:15.000> here

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
smoothing groups the angle is set here

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.940 
smoothing groups the angle is set here
so<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.570> automatically<00:03:16.080> anything<00:03:16.590> sharper

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
so it's automatically anything sharper

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.770 
so it's automatically anything sharper
than<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.100> 30<00:03:17.370> degree<00:03:17.580> angle<00:03:17.730> creating<00:03:18.450> separate

smoothing<00:03:19.170> groups<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.620> see<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.770> here

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
smoothing groups you can see that here

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.120 
smoothing groups you can see that here
or<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.959> take<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.230> angle<00:03:22.620> up<00:03:22.770> or

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
or here you can take this angle up or

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.460 
or here you can take this angle up or
down<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.610> get<00:03:23.790> different<00:03:23.970> results<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:25.380> you

wanted to manually mark an edge is sharp

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.350 
wanted to manually mark an edge is sharp
you<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.050> select<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.560> control<00:03:29.070> e-mark<00:03:30.030> sharp

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
you just select it control e-mark sharp

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.570 
you just select it control e-mark sharp
and<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.739> has<00:03:31.830> created<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.250> separate

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.670 
solve this is select everything control
end<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.780> all<00:04:09.870> attempt<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.290> recalculate

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
end and that all attempt to recalculate

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.410 
end and that all attempt to recalculate
all<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.130> normals<00:04:11.459> outside<00:04:11.790> which<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
all the normals outside which is the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.060 
all the normals outside which is the
same<00:04:12.600> as<00:04:12.780> hitting<00:04:12.930> recalculate<00:04:13.590> right<00:04:13.800> here

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
same as hitting recalculate right here

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.380 
same as hitting recalculate right here
and<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.820> doesn't<00:04:15.120> solve<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.330> problem

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
and if that doesn't solve the problem

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.759 
and if that doesn't solve the problem
then<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.840> can<00:04:15.989> just<00:04:16.080> go<00:04:16.230> through<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.560> flip

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
then you can just go through and flip

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.289 
then you can just go through and flip
direction<00:04:17.190> manually<00:04:17.609> all<00:04:17.910> right<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.239> I'm

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
direction manually all right so I'm

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.909 
direction manually all right so I'm
going<00:04:18.480> to<00:04:18.510> go<00:04:18.630> over<00:04:18.660> reit<00:04:18.989> apology<00:04:19.470> now<00:04:19.650> and

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
going to go over reit apology now and

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.010 
going to go over reit apology now and

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
the retail po features i just do it

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.520 
the retail po features i just do it
using<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.150> shrink<00:04:24.539> wrap<00:04:24.690> modifier<00:04:24.840> which<00:04:25.289> i

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
using the shrink wrap modifier which i

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.650 
using the shrink wrap modifier which i
think<00:04:25.650> works<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:26.460> as<00:04:26.610> well<00:04:26.669> anyway<00:04:27.210> if<00:04:27.330> not

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
think works just as well anyway if not

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.810 
think works just as well anyway if not

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
the material section really quick just

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.470 
the material section really quick just
out<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.160> do<00:04:41.250> one<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.670> go<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.790> diffuse<00:04:42.300> and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
just choose a bright color so it makes

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.560 
just choose a bright color so it makes

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
it easier to see what you're doing then

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.570 
it easier to see what you're doing then

06<00:04:53.430> @<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.060> tour<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.390> I<00:04:54.570> made<00:04:54.780> for<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.140> and

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
06 @ that tour and I made for this and

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.720 
06 @ that tour and I made for this and
then<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.620> tab<00:04:55.890> for<00:04:56.130> edit<00:04:56.310> mode<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.640> i'll<00:04:56.700> show

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
then you tab for edit mode and i'll show

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.210 
then you tab for edit mode and i'll show
you<00:04:56.910> how<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.300> works<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.620> if<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.860> remember

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
you how this works I so if you remember

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.620 
you how this works I so if you remember
this<00:04:59.250> function<00:04:59.910> here<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.300> one<00:05:00.450> that's

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
this function here is the one that's

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.150 
this function here is the one that's
going<00:05:00.720> to<00:05:00.810> switch<00:05:01.020> between<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.500> edited<00:05:01.920> mesh

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
going to switch between the edited mesh

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.070 
going to switch between the edited mesh
and<00:05:02.430> then<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.760> cage<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.240> mesh<00:05:03.450> for<00:05:03.720> rito

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
and then the cage of the mesh for rito

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.990 
and then the cage of the mesh for rito
bo<00:05:04.320> is<00:05:04.470> honestly<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.890> time<00:05:05.250> that<00:05:05.430> I<00:05:05.520> use<00:05:05.820> this

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
bo is honestly the time that I use this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.850 
bo is honestly the time that I use this
the<00:05:06.180> most<00:05:06.360> sometimes<00:05:07.170> it's<00:05:07.350> just<00:05:07.410> beneficial

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
the most sometimes it's just beneficial

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.530 
the most sometimes it's just beneficial
to<00:05:08.070> have<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.430> cage<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.880> sometimes<00:05:09.240> I<00:05:09.360> like

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
to have it in cage and sometimes I like

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.420 
to have it in cage and sometimes I like
to<00:05:09.570> work<00:05:09.870> more<00:05:10.140> on<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.440> top<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.800> mesh<00:05:11.010> so

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
to work more on the top of the mesh so

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.250 
to work more on the top of the mesh so
here<00:05:11.640> you<00:05:11.790> just<00:05:12.120> want<00:05:12.390> to<00:05:12.510> get<00:05:12.600> it<00:05:12.750> as<00:05:12.810> close<00:05:12.990> as

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
here you just want to get it as close as

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.860 
here you just want to get it as close as
possible<00:05:13.290> and<00:05:14.030> I<00:05:15.030> think<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.330> want<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.630> work<00:05:15.810> like

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
possible and I think I want to work like

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.990 
possible and I think I want to work like
this<00:05:16.290> so<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:16.800> easiest<00:05:17.130> if<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:17.490> uh<00:05:17.520> nuh<00:05:17.700> clued

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
this so it's easiest if you uh nuh clued

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.370 
this so it's easiest if you uh nuh clued
the<00:05:18.150> background<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:19.020> just<00:05:19.200> start

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
the background and you just start

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.260 
the background and you just start
extruding<00:05:20.010> like<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.570> maybe<00:05:21.570> rotate<00:05:23.270> extrude

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
extruding like this maybe rotate extrude

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.440 
extruding like this maybe rotate extrude
extrude<00:05:25.640> so<00:05:26.640> then<00:05:26.760> once<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.060> have<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.210> rough

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
extrude so then once you have a rough

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.240 
extrude so then once you have a rough
area<00:05:27.690> laid<00:05:28.020> out<00:05:28.200> the<00:05:28.380> best<00:05:28.560> thing<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.830> do<00:05:28.980> is

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
area laid out the best thing to do is

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.930 
area laid out the best thing to do is
apply<00:05:29.790> this<00:05:30.320> add<00:05:31.320> modifier<00:05:32.190> again<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.820> just

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
apply this add modifier again and just

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.930 
apply this add modifier again and just
reapply<00:05:33.480> it<00:05:33.710> and<00:05:34.710> now<00:05:35.280> you<00:05:35.310> see<00:05:35.610> it'll<00:05:35.790> be<00:05:35.910> a

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
reapply it and now you see it'll be a

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.880 
reapply it and now you see it'll be a
lot<00:05:36.150> cleaner<00:05:36.480> as<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:37.110> smooth<00:05:37.410> this<00:05:37.620> so<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:37.860> can

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
lot cleaner as you smooth this so I can

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.380 
lot cleaner as you smooth this so I can
scale<00:05:38.340> this<00:05:38.550> out<00:05:38.820> smooth<00:05:40.970> see<00:05:41.970> what<00:05:42.120> it<00:05:42.210> looks

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
scale this out smooth see what it looks

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.710 
scale this out smooth see what it looks
like<00:05:42.570> like<00:05:42.780> this<00:05:43.020> maybe<00:05:43.680> move<00:05:43.980> some<00:05:44.190> points

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
like like this maybe move some points

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.680 
like like this maybe move some points
smooth<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:47.430> see<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:47.910> ends<00:05:48.270> up<00:05:48.360> being<00:05:48.570> a

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
smooth and you see it ends up being a

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.240 
smooth and you see it ends up being a
pretty<00:05:48.720> fast<00:05:49.200> way<00:05:49.440> of<00:05:49.470> doing<00:05:49.860> this<00:05:52.250> something

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
pretty fast way of doing this something

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.440 
pretty fast way of doing this something
that's<00:05:53.430> really<00:05:53.610> important<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.180> think<00:05:54.210> about

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
that's really important to think about

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.270 
that's really important to think about
if<00:05:54.750> you're<00:05:55.020> doing<00:05:55.260> a<00:05:55.290> hard<00:05:55.500> surface<00:05:55.680> modeling

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
if you're doing a hard surface modeling

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.040 
if you're doing a hard surface modeling
a<00:05:56.400> lot<00:05:56.580> of<00:05:56.700> times<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:57.000> just<00:05:57.180> want<00:05:57.390> to<00:05:57.540> cut<00:05:57.930> the

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
a lot of times you just want to cut the

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.020 
a lot of times you just want to cut the
polygon<00:05:58.500> count<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.860> bit<00:05:59.040> but<00:05:59.220> you<00:05:59.340> want<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.700> use

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
polygon count a bit but you want to use

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.390 
polygon count a bit but you want to use
deers<00:06:00.390> vertex<00:06:00.990> is<00:06:01.230> what<00:06:01.560> I've<00:06:01.680> noticed<00:06:01.919> I<00:06:02.190> use

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
deers vertex is what I've noticed I use

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.040 
deers vertex is what I've noticed I use
all<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.640> time<00:06:02.790> for<00:06:03.150> hard<00:06:03.330> surface<00:06:03.660> modeling

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
all the time for hard surface modeling

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.690 
all the time for hard surface modeling
because<00:06:04.470> a<00:06:04.560> lot<00:06:04.830> of<00:06:04.860> times<00:06:05.100> I<00:06:05.250> want<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.520> match

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
because a lot of times I want to match

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.610 
because a lot of times I want to match
what's<00:06:06.030> underneath<00:06:06.270> pretty<00:06:06.690> precisely<00:06:07.169> so

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
what's underneath pretty precisely so

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.440 
what's underneath pretty precisely so
then<00:06:07.770> here<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.280> see<00:06:08.490> is<00:06:08.640> actually<00:06:08.820> snapping

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
then here you see is actually snapping

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.150 
then here you see is actually snapping
to<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.720> vertices<00:06:10.020> underneath<00:06:10.590> of<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:10.830> tour

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
to the vertices underneath of the tour

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.520 
to the vertices underneath of the tour
in<00:06:11.310> you<00:06:12.240> see<00:06:12.419> here<00:06:12.810> this<00:06:13.050> is<00:06:13.290> where<00:06:13.410> it

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
in you see here this is where it

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.200 
in you see here this is where it
snapping<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:14.100> is<00:06:14.250> any<00:06:14.430> one<00:06:14.580> of<00:06:14.640> these<00:06:14.790> vertices

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
snapping to is any one of these vertices

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.270 
snapping to is any one of these vertices
yeah<00:06:16.020> other<00:06:16.350> than<00:06:16.380> not<00:06:16.710> all<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.130> same

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
yeah other than not all the same

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.780 
yeah other than not all the same
functions<00:06:17.760> work<00:06:17.940> control<00:06:18.419> are<00:06:18.600> at<00:06:18.960> loop<00:06:19.790> move

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
functions work control are at loop move

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.060 
functions work control are at loop move
these<00:06:21.000> around<00:06:21.440> s<00:06:22.520> scale<00:06:23.520> or<00:06:24.500> rotate<00:06:25.500> all<00:06:25.800> that

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
these around s scale or rotate all that

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.980 
these around s scale or rotate all that
good<00:06:26.250> stuff<00:06:26.280> so<00:06:26.790> you<00:06:27.120> should<00:06:27.300> be<00:06:27.330> able<00:06:27.600> to<00:06:27.780> end

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
good stuff so you should be able to end

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.409 
good stuff so you should be able to end
up<00:06:28.140> doing<00:06:28.380> this<00:06:28.470> pretty<00:06:28.710> quickly<00:06:29.240> alright<00:06:30.240> so

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
up doing this pretty quickly alright so

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.490 
up doing this pretty quickly alright so
that's<00:06:30.540> all<00:06:30.780> I'm<00:06:30.900> going<00:06:30.990> to<00:06:31.050> cover<00:06:31.200> in<00:06:31.380> this

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
that's all I'm going to cover in this

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.890 
that's all I'm going to cover in this
video<00:06:31.680> next<00:06:32.220> video<00:06:32.580> I'll<00:06:32.700> go<00:06:32.730> over<00:06:32.880> a<00:06:33.180> curb<00:06:33.750> and

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
video next video I'll go over a curb and

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.990 
video next video I'll go over a curb and
array<00:06:34.169> modifier<00:06:34.710> maybe<00:06:35.100> a<00:06:35.190> few<00:06:35.430> others<00:06:35.760> that

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
array modifier maybe a few others that

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.320 
array modifier maybe a few others that
I'll<00:06:36.479> do<00:06:36.630> UV<00:06:36.990> mapping<00:06:38.030> materials<00:06:39.030> may<00:06:39.270> be

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
I'll do UV mapping materials may be

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.910 
I'll do UV mapping materials may be
sculpting<00:06:39.930> in<00:06:40.080> particles

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
sculpting in particles

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.980 
sculpting in particles
