00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Last week you met the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.649
 story of a pellet farmer who 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.840
 creates jobs to diversify production 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.969
 Today we go to the municipality of tapes 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 know a property that has the same 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.539
 type of creation only this time is for 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 optimize production of irrigated rice 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.369
 about three generations of his family. 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.630
 eroni all in catu is dedicated to the cultivation 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 of rice 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 the producer chose to diversify more 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.190
 did not leave tradition aside and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 continued with the grain 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.770
 The difference is that you started exploring 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.379
 new ideas to increase income 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.200
 and the special secret of its beautiful to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.910
 optimize rice production is well 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.910
 saved down here 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.690
 About 20 years ago I was beautiful. 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 realized the shortage in catching fish 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.820
 the open market for the creation of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.460
 in captivity he wasted no time and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.890
 decided to invest in fish farming 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.380
 which I did not imagine would be the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.990
 key to change the crop 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.030
 ten years later he found a way 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.780
 to reduce costs in the production of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.659
 rice 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.360
 combining the two cultures 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.490
 the work was done because of those 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.970
 network work that where 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 they implanted ps in the fields of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.700
 rice that where there was a blade of water 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.720
 very low and our region has very 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.780
 predators 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.460
 then we had a big miss in 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 fish placed in the crop 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.479
 I was observing that if people 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.790
 reverse this situation when 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.710
 rice to produce rice and when 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.479
 lay the profile were the fish 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.610
 we could go deeper into this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.540
 that the fish would have a 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.060
 refuge to defend against predators 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.549
 the work of the fish to eat March in the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.079
 end of harvest and runs until October when 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.329
 planting occurs 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.640
 during this period, the animals 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.399
 soil preparation for the new crop 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.619
 to ensure the efficiency of the technique. 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.770
 producer works with loads of four 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.560
 species and each of them performance 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.570
 does not specify grass carp has a 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.090
 herbivorous fish that feeds only 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.920
 vegetables such as weeds and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.970
 plants available on the blade 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.340
 water 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.570
 feces also contribute to fertilization 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.480
 from soil 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.570
 the silver coating acts on the filtering of the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.820
 water mainly consumes organisms 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.370
 microscopes and bacteria 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.950
 the big head carp is also 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.140
 considered a filtering species to 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.250
 difference is that it filters organisms 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.800
 larger 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.060
 already the Hungarian carp is known as a 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.490
 bottom fish 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.730
 I usually swallow and return the 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.950
 habit that cleans the environment and 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.540
 besides consuming grains and seeds also 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.120
 feeds on insects 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.880
 the method adopted for being the nito requires 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.080
 appropriate treatment for each stage of 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.420
 fish life 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.260
 annually the producer acquires around 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.300
 1,200 fingerlings newborn fish 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.660
 they need to go through a few steps 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.580
 until they are ready to populate the areas 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.700
 flooded with rice 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.870
 the producer to implant the crop 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.150
 have to acquire the fingerlings of the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.910
 Specialized Terminology Medical Terminology 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.250
 him in a nursery where he is a 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.420
 covered tank to prevent predators 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.550
 attack 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310
 from there we put him 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.670
 greater amount to take it to the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.380
 juvenile part that is around a paul 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.709
 20 centimeters in size 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.470
 from this phase they put themselves 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.570
 within the area where the rice was 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.510
 rice is harvested from the water and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.120
 If you take this fish to the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.050
 next planting he will be in 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.840
 two pounds and you should be 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.860
 wondering where these 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.410
 fish 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.530
 after doing the work in the field the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.930
 Covers are prepared for 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.690
 commercialization of captive fish 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.299
 has more supply than the artisanal one and arrives 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.640
 to the consumer for lower prices 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.440
 thinking about the guaranteed return with 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.660
 sale of adult fish 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.930
 the farmer has some care to 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.720
 ensure the quality of the meat 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.020
 one of them is to keep the animals at 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.139
 least one year in the purification process 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.259
 at this stage the food and the quality of the 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.810
 water from the dam must be controlled and 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:45.310
 he does not have too much mud in the 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.169
 because it alters the taste of the fish and 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.000
 should always be based on 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.199
 with food eg maize 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.509
 crushed aepin crushed sweet potato or 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.669
 rice residues 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.430
 since it implemented the new routine of 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.889
 your production is beautiful and noticed some 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.610
 advantages and had no reason to 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.590
 regret low if the cost of production 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.270
 drastically because it uses a minimum 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.169
 of soil preparation equipment 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:18.259
 as well as no need to 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.030
 using pesticides as well as 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.949
 chemical fertilization because that 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.220
 the letter already makes a fertilization 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.789
 and the benefits do not stop for 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.639
 there 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.470
 captive breeding 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.460
 also shows gains for the environment 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.130
 environment 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.830
 together with the ps we will develop 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.169
 also attracted at last all those 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.810
 texts that are native to our region 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.849
 and the person has a good sense when doing 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.220
 the expense makes this species 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:53.770
 Go back to the ghosnies finally and go 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.770
 repopulating the whole new IMF
