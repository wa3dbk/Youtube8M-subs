00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.260 

if<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.199> given<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:02.010> velocity<00:00:02.370> graph<00:00:02.820> we're

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
if we're given this velocity graph we're

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.670 
if we're given this velocity graph we're
gonna<00:00:03.360> find<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.600> total<00:00:03.959> distance<00:00:04.230> traveled

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
gonna find the total distance traveled

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.070 
gonna find the total distance traveled
again<00:00:04.890> these<00:00:05.730> are<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.060> velocities<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
again these are the velocities the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.830 
again these are the velocities the
speeds<00:00:09.800> after<00:00:10.800> one<00:00:11.010> two<00:00:11.700> three<00:00:12.300> four<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.809> five

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
speeds after one two three four and five

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.780 
speeds after one two three four and five
seconds<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.469> after<00:00:13.710> five<00:00:13.920> seconds<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> person

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
seconds so after five seconds the person

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.160 
seconds so after five seconds the person
stopped<00:00:16.550> if<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.850> want<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> find<00:00:18.359> total<00:00:18.810> distance

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
stopped if I want to find total distance

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
stopped if I want to find total distance
remember<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> velocities<00:00:20.279> -<00:00:20.760> total<00:00:21.090> distance

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
remember the velocities - total distance

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.310 
remember the velocities - total distance
you<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.439> understand<00:00:23.420> velocity<00:00:27.230> do<00:00:28.230> you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
you have to understand velocity do you

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
you have to understand velocity do you
understand<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.689> derivative<00:00:31.309> of<00:00:32.309> time<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
understand is the derivative of time of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
understand is the derivative of time of
position<00:00:34.219> velocity<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> derivative

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
position velocity is the derivative

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.389 
position velocity is the derivative
position<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.950> want<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:38.250> from

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
position so if I want to go from

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
position so if I want to go from
velocity<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.899> position<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
velocity to position don't you have to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.549 
velocity to position don't you have to
integrate<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.290> what<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.379> need<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
integrate it so what you need to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.770 
integrate it so what you need to
understand<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.539> going

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
understand here is you're actually going

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.700 
understand here is you're actually going
to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> taking<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.350> integral<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:48.660> velocity<00:00:49.170> in

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to be taking the integral of velocity in

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150 
to be taking the integral of velocity in
respects<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.280> time<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.660> DT<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> what's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
respects to time so it's DT and what's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
respects to time so it's DT and what's
my<00:00:53.309> interval<00:00:55.160> well<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.149> zero<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
my interval well what is it from zero to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
my interval well what is it from zero to
five<00:00:58.230> seconds<00:01:00.620> that's<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.129> trying<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
five seconds that's what I'm trying to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
five seconds that's what I'm trying to
calculate<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.449> total<00:01:03.840> distance<00:01:04.170> traveled

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
calculate the total distance traveled

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.429 
calculate the total distance traveled
the<00:01:04.769> total<00:01:05.070> position<00:01:05.670> after<00:01:06.710> time<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:09.439> going

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the total position after time is going

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.719 
the total position after time is going
from<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:10.979> integrating<00:01:11.549> over

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
from here to here it's integrating over

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.050 
from here to here it's integrating over
the<00:01:12.240> five<00:01:12.630> seconds<00:01:14.210> now

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
the five seconds now

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.870 
the five seconds now
if<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.600> this

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
if we do this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.100 
if we do this
well<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> find<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> air<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.899> curve

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
well I want to find the air in the curve

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
well I want to find the air in the curve
we<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:22.710> formula<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.119> look

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
we don't have a formula but can we look

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030 
we don't have a formula but can we look
at<00:01:24.450> these<00:01:24.630> shapes<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> kind<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.380> find<00:01:25.740> areas

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
at these shapes and kind of find areas

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.630 
at these shapes and kind of find areas
of<00:01:26.070> trapezoids<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:29.070> approximate

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
of trapezoids and just approximate

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.740 
of trapezoids and just approximate
theirs<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> best<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
theirs the best thing you can do is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.920 
theirs the best thing you can do is
approximate<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> first

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
approximate this one so for the first

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.320 
approximate this one so for the first
rectangle<00:01:34.670> do<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
rectangle do you see that you have a

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.969 
rectangle do you see that you have a
rectangle<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.880> oops

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
rectangle here oops

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.169 
rectangle here oops
can<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.970> kind<00:01:42.149> of

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
can you kind of see if I just kind of

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:50.620 
can you kind of see if I just kind of
make<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:42.420> rectangles

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.450 

so<00:01:51.200> make<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.439> rectangles<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.070> then<00:01:52.159> make<00:01:52.369> the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
so make the rectangles and then make the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.950 
so make the rectangles and then make the
little<00:01:52.670> triangles<00:01:53.090> above<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:53.420> or<00:01:53.720> at<00:01:53.840> these

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
little triangles above it or at these

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.249 
little triangles above it or at these
trapezoids<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:55.060> trap<00:01:56.060> his<00:01:56.180> way<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.360> would

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
trapezoids to trap his way to would

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.210 
trapezoids to trap his way to would
actually<00:01:57.560> work<00:01:57.650> better<00:01:59.380> but<00:02:00.380> uh<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:02.060> it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
actually work better but uh for it

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.219 
actually work better but uh for it
actually<00:02:04.220> let's<00:02:04.369> just<00:02:04.520> use<00:02:04.610> trapezoids<00:02:08.229> when

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
actually let's just use trapezoids when

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.750 
actually let's just use trapezoids when
traveling<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.709> be<00:02:09.830> very<00:02:10.069> accurate<00:02:12.400> okay

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
traveling to be very accurate okay

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760 
traveling to be very accurate okay
so<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> width<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.410> all<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.560> them

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
so the width is one for all of them

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.699 
so the width is one for all of them
correct<00:02:16.720> for<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.810> first<00:02:18.020> trapezoid<00:02:18.319> what's

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
correct for the first trapezoid what's

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.860 
correct for the first trapezoid what's
my<00:02:18.800> first<00:02:18.950> height<00:02:19.220> about<00:02:19.819> 85<00:02:22.330> plus<00:02:23.330> my<00:02:23.540> second

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
my first height about 85 plus my second

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.270 
my first height about 85 plus my second
height<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:25.420> 55<00:02:26.420> oh<00:02:26.860> by<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.890> way<00:02:28.010> don't<00:02:28.220> we

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
height is 55 oh by the way don't we

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.540 
height is 55 oh by the way don't we
divide<00:02:28.400> by<00:02:28.670> two<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.310> remember<00:02:31.430> that

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
divide by two do is remember that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.840 
divide by two do is remember that
trapezoids<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.930> take<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.730> you're<00:02:34.730> gonna

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
trapezoids you take the you're gonna

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.790 
trapezoids you take the you're gonna
divide<00:02:35.239> by<00:02:35.390> two<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:36.080> width<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.380> each<00:02:36.500> one<00:02:36.709> is

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
divide by two the width of each one is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.449 
divide by two the width of each one is
one<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.430> divided<00:02:37.760> by<00:02:37.850> two<00:02:38.739> anywho<00:02:39.739> that's

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
one and you divided by two anywho that's

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.150 
one and you divided by two anywho that's
the<00:02:40.730> first<00:02:41.030> trapezoid<00:02:41.590> plus<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.860> second

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
the first trapezoid plus what the second

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.500 
the first trapezoid plus what the second
trapezoid<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.060> second<00:02:47.360> one<00:02:47.450> that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
trapezoid the for the second one that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:56.380 
trapezoid the for the second one that
goes<00:02:47.780> from<00:02:47.959> 55<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:52.130> 30<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:54.760> then<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.940> next<00:02:56.209> one

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
goes from 55 to 30 and then the next one

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:05.770 
goes from 55 to 30 and then the next one
goes<00:02:56.420> from<00:02:59.920> 30<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:02.590> 20<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.030> then<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> next<00:03:05.630> one

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
goes from 30 to 20 and then the next one

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:20.070 
goes from 30 to 20 and then the next one

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:31.540 

ten<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.959> zero<00:03:26.680> now<00:03:29.709> if<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.890> find<00:03:31.160> all<00:03:31.400> those

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
ten to zero now if you find all those

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.660 
ten to zero now if you find all those
trapezoids<00:03:33.819> you're<00:03:34.819> going<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:36.670> get

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
trapezoids you're going to get

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.360 
trapezoids you're going to get
approximately<00:03:40.930> 145<00:03:41.930> now<00:03:42.770> it's<00:03:43.010> not<00:03:43.130> going<00:03:43.310> to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
approximately 145 now it's not going to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.860 
approximately 145 now it's not going to
be<00:03:43.430> exactly<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:44.240> but<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.840> books<00:03:45.050> is<00:03:45.200> 145<00:03:46.870> got

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
be exactly that but the books is 145 got

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.140 
be exactly that but the books is 145 got
it<00:03:50.080> if<00:03:51.080> we<00:03:51.230> did<00:03:51.410> all<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:52.000> hopefully<00:03:53.000> we<00:03:53.060> get

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
it if we did all this hopefully we get

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.220 
it if we did all this hopefully we get
around<00:03:53.300> hundred<00:03:53.600> four<00:03:53.690> we<00:03:53.810> probably<00:03:53.989> get

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
around hundred four we probably get

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.260 
around hundred four we probably get
exactly<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.680> but<00:03:55.130> if<00:03:55.520> we<00:03:55.700> had<00:03:55.820> more<00:03:56.000> exact

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
exactly that but if we had more exact

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.860 
exactly that but if we had more exact
points<00:03:56.720> this<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.380> what<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.560> should<00:03:57.650> get<00:03:58.870> so

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
points this is what you should get so

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.390 
points this is what you should get so
we're<00:03:59.959> going<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.140> add<00:04:00.290> up<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.620> inside<00:04:00.980> that's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
we're going to add up the inside that's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.150 
we're going to add up the inside that's
the<00:04:01.519> velocity<00:04:01.640> now<00:04:02.060> why<00:04:02.810> again<00:04:03.260> is<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.800> total

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the velocity now why again is the total

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.390 
the velocity now why again is the total
distance<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:06.110> integral<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.890> velocity<00:04:09.400> let's

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
distance the integral of velocity let's

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.960 
distance the integral of velocity let's
think<00:04:10.519> about<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:10.910> um<00:04:12.700> what<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.760> need<00:04:13.910> to

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
think about this um what you need to

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.180 
think about this um what you need to
realize<00:04:14.330> is<00:04:15.370> if<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.579> integrated<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:18.130> do<00:04:19.130> you

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
realize is if I integrated this do you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.979 
realize is if I integrated this do you
understand<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:19.880> technically<00:04:20.450> I'm<00:04:20.780> going<00:04:20.900> to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
understand I technically I'm going to

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:31.870 
understand I technically I'm going to
jump<00:04:21.140> down<00:04:21.320> here<00:04:21.700> would<00:04:22.700> have<00:04:26.380> s<00:04:27.380> sub<00:04:29.229> T<00:04:30.880> from

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
jump down here would have s sub T from

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.880 
jump down here would have s sub T from
five<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.270> zero<00:04:33.340> here's<00:04:34.340> okay<00:04:34.430> with<00:04:34.640> that<00:04:35.890> isn't

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
five to zero here's okay with that isn't

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.200 
five to zero here's okay with that isn't
the<00:04:36.950> integral<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.370> velocity<00:04:37.460> position<00:04:40.210> is

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the integral of velocity position is

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.499 
the integral of velocity position is
that<00:04:41.270> okay

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
that okay

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.129 
that okay
so<00:04:44.509> if<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.780> wanted<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.050> solve<00:04:45.350> this<00:04:46.840> well<00:04:47.840> isn't

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
so if I wanted to solve this well isn't

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:57.960 
so if I wanted to solve this well isn't
that<00:04:48.590> going<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.639> be<00:04:50.289> s<00:04:52.000> five<00:04:53.020> minus<00:04:54.020> s<00:04:54.289> of<00:04:54.699> zero

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.839 

let<00:04:58.970> me<00:04:59.030> look<00:04:59.090> at<00:04:59.270> that<00:05:00.580> isn't<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.759> the

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
let me look at that isn't that the

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.210 
let me look at that isn't that the
position<00:05:02.389> after<00:05:02.569> five<00:05:03.050> seconds<00:05:03.620> which<00:05:04.190> is

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
position after five seconds which is

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.879 
position after five seconds which is
zero<00:05:04.690> minus<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.960> position<00:05:06.139> at<00:05:07.569> zero<00:05:11.800> if<00:05:12.800> you

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
zero minus the position at zero if you

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.200 
zero minus the position at zero if you
subtract<00:05:13.250> those<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.789> should<00:05:13.819> get<00:05:14.090> that

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
subtract those you should get that

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.830 
subtract those you should get that
answer<00:05:17.830> anyways
