here<00:00:42.550> Barney<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.990> can<00:00:44.140> see<00:00:44.350> he's<00:00:45.130> animated

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
here Barney you can see he's animated

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.210 
here Barney you can see he's animated
jumping<00:00:46.150> up<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:46.390> down<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:47.410> what<00:00:47.830> we<00:00:47.920> want<00:00:48.130> to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
jumping up and down and what we want to

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.580 
jumping up and down and what we want to
do<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.490> we<00:00:48.610> kind<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:48.910> want<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.090> make<00:00:49.240> his

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
do is we kind of want to make his

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.480 
do is we kind of want to make his
stomach<00:00:50.730> jiggle<00:00:51.730> when<00:00:52.390> he<00:00:52.540> jumps<00:00:52.930> so<00:00:53.310> let's<00:00:54.310> go

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
stomach jiggle when he jumps so let's go

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.400 
stomach jiggle when he jumps so let's go
up<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.060> window<00:00:55.330> here<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.840> bullet<00:00:56.230> physics

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
up to the window here to bullet physics

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.000 
up to the window here to bullet physics
controls<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.600> get<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:58.870> physics<00:00:59.590> pallet

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
controls and we get the physics pallet

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.820 
controls and we get the physics pallet
here<00:01:00.220> and<00:01:00.720> what<00:01:01.720> we<00:01:01.810> want<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.140> do<00:01:02.290> is<00:01:02.530> we<00:01:02.680> want

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
here and what we want to do is we want

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.480 
here and what we want to do is we want
to<00:01:02.860> kind<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.780> create<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.870> new<00:01:05.020> physics

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
to kind of create a new physics

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.090 
to kind of create a new physics
simulation<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.820> then<00:01:07.450> we're<00:01:08.320> gonna<00:01:08.440> make

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
simulation and then we're gonna make

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.060 
simulation and then we're gonna make
sure<00:01:09.280> we<00:01:09.430> have<00:01:09.670> our<00:01:10.500> certain<00:01:11.500> objects<00:01:11.860> in<00:01:11.979> the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
sure we have our certain objects in the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.980 
sure we have our certain objects in the
scene<00:01:12.250> set<00:01:12.550> up<00:01:12.670> correctly<00:01:12.910> so<00:01:13.360> in<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.720> case

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
scene set up correctly so in this case

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.750 
scene set up correctly so in this case
we<00:01:14.200> don't<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:14.619> need<00:01:14.770> anything<00:01:14.950> rigid<00:01:15.550> we

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
we don't really need anything rigid we

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.359 
we don't really need anything rigid we
got<00:01:15.940> Barney's<00:01:16.450> set<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:16.960> soft<00:01:17.290> body<00:01:17.619> it's

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
got Barney's set to a soft body it's

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.070 
got Barney's set to a soft body it's
perfect<00:01:18.850> it's<00:01:18.940> kind<00:01:19.119> of<00:01:19.150> already<00:01:19.330> set<00:01:19.479> up<00:01:19.720> for

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
perfect it's kind of already set up for

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.650 
perfect it's kind of already set up for
us<00:01:20.200> here<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:23.310> hit<00:01:24.310> live<00:01:24.610> simulation<00:01:25.420> here

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
us here so I hit live simulation here

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.050 
us here so I hit live simulation here
you<00:01:26.259> can<00:01:26.440> kind<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.710> see<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.280> already<00:01:27.700> kind

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
you can kind of see that it already kind

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.210 
you can kind of see that it already kind
of<00:01:29.310> already<00:01:30.310> kind<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:31.050> bounces<00:01:32.050> down<00:01:32.229> there<00:01:32.530> so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
of already kind of bounces down there so

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.800 
of already kind of bounces down there so
left<00:01:33.430> what<00:01:33.700> I'm<00:01:33.970> going<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.119> do<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.330> turn<00:01:34.540> live

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
left what I'm going to do is turn live

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.020 
left what I'm going to do is turn live
simulation<00:01:35.560> off<00:01:35.680> I<00:01:35.890> kind<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.220> just<00:01:36.910> hit

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
simulation off I kind of just hit

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.410 
simulation off I kind of just hit
calculate<00:01:37.720> here<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.860> this<00:01:39.850> is<00:01:40.030> going<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.270> go

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
calculate here so this is going to go

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.210 
calculate here so this is going to go
through<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.440> kind<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.680> calculate<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
through and kind of calculate the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.200 
through and kind of calculate the
simulation

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
simulation

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.170 
simulation
the<00:01:43.479> duration<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.710> him<00:01:44.890> jumping<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:45.970> now<00:01:46.119> you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
the duration of him jumping so now you

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.660 
the duration of him jumping so now you
can<00:01:46.420> see<00:01:46.659> his<00:01:47.020> his<00:01:47.740> stomach<00:01:48.130> bouncing<00:01:48.580> around

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
can see his his stomach bouncing around

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.640 
can see his his stomach bouncing around
there<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.299> little<00:01:49.780> bit<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.049> it's<00:01:50.200> hit<00:01:50.350> play<00:01:50.619> on

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
there a little bit so it's hit play on

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.640 
there a little bit so it's hit play on
that<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.060> can<00:01:52.210> see<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.650> bouncing

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
that and you can see that bouncing

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.480 
that and you can see that bouncing
around<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:56.020> we<00:01:56.229> want<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.530> edit<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:56.950> we<00:01:57.310> can

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
around so if we want to edit that we can

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.800 
around so if we want to edit that we can
come<00:01:57.670> into<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.970> constraints<00:01:58.570> there's<00:01:58.750> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
come into the constraints there's a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.149 
come into the constraints there's a
bunch<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.110> different<00:01:59.229> parameters<00:01:59.560> here<00:02:00.040> on

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
bunch of different parameters here on

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.300 
bunch of different parameters here on
the<00:02:00.250> properties<00:02:00.700> mass<00:02:01.090> internal<00:02:01.720> pressure

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the properties mass internal pressure

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.249 
the properties mass internal pressure
and<00:02:03.310> bounce<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.940> we<00:02:04.060> can<00:02:04.210> set<00:02:04.479> that'll<00:02:04.930> just

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
and bounce that we can set that'll just

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.210 
and bounce that we can set that'll just
how<00:02:06.250> how<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.500> how<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.560> area<00:02:08.979> that's

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
how how that how the area that's

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.500 
how how that how the area that's
affected<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.420> know<00:02:11.040> so<00:02:12.040> let's<00:02:13.000> check<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
affected you know so let's check the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
affected you know so let's check the
constraints<00:02:14.110> here<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.620> set<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:15.100> self

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
constraints here so we set up a self

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.630 
constraints here so we set up a self
constraint<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.950> right<00:02:17.950> basically<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:18.519> get

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
constraint and right basically we get

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.460 
constraint and right basically we get
this<00:02:18.760> other<00:02:18.970> other<00:02:19.450> window<00:02:19.900> palette<00:02:20.260> here

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
this other other window palette here

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.390 
this other other window palette here
about<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.220> dynamic<00:02:21.700> weights<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:24.130> is

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
about the dynamic weights and this is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.190 
about the dynamic weights and this is
what's<00:02:24.760> been<00:02:24.940> painted<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.510> here<00:02:25.840> are<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
what's been painted on here are the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.410 
what's been painted on here are the
constraints<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.489> right<00:02:27.790> now<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.209> set<00:02:28.390> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
constraints so right now it's set to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.810 
constraints so right now it's set to
paint<00:02:28.810> more<00:02:29.170> constraining<00:02:29.739> but<00:02:30.430> why<00:02:30.580> don't<00:02:30.640> we

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
paint more constraining but why don't we

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.390 
paint more constraining but why don't we
do<00:02:32.700> more<00:02:33.700> dynamic<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.930> let's<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:36.010> turn<00:02:36.220> on

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
do more dynamic and let's just turn on

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.430 
do more dynamic and let's just turn on
the<00:02:36.430> live<00:02:36.700> simulation<00:02:37.450> here<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.320> kind

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the live simulation here so you can kind

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.410 
the live simulation here so you can kind
of<00:02:38.560> see<00:02:38.800> what<00:02:39.190> will<00:02:39.430> potentially<00:02:39.970> happen<00:02:40.330> in

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
of see what will potentially happen in

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.660 
of see what will potentially happen in
these<00:02:40.540> areas<00:02:40.959> when<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.560> make<00:02:41.860> them<00:02:42.040> more

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
these areas when I make them more

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.479 
these areas when I make them more
dynamic<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.930> can<00:02:44.019> kind<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.290> see<00:02:44.560> these

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
dynamic so you can kind of see these

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.770 
dynamic so you can kind of see these
areas<00:02:45.910> here<00:02:46.390> sag<00:02:47.320> down<00:02:47.590> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
areas here sag down and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.630 
areas here sag down and
and<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.440> those<00:02:49.710> areas<00:02:50.100> are<00:02:50.310> going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.490> be

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and so those areas are going to be

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.940 
and so those areas are going to be
affected<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.480> see<00:02:52.020> I'm<00:02:52.140> painting<00:02:52.500> away<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
affected so see I'm painting away the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.300 
affected so see I'm painting away the
color<00:02:53.160> here<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:55.650> affecting<00:02:56.100> him<00:02:56.280> a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
color here and it's affecting him a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.120 
color here and it's affecting him a
little<00:02:56.850> bit<00:02:56.910> more<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:57.570> now<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.860> say<00:02:58.980> hey

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
little bit more so now I can say hey

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.890 
little bit more so now I can say hey
that's<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.760> perfect<00:03:00.300> those<00:03:00.660> are<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
that's that's perfect those are the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.320 
that's that's perfect those are the
areas<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.530> wanted<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.490> wanted<00:03:03.270> to

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
areas that I wanted to I wanted to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
areas that I wanted to I wanted to
affect<00:03:05.750> excellent<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.050> let's<00:03:07.410> go<00:03:07.560> back<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:08.100> just

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
affect excellent so let's go back I just

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.640 
affect excellent so let's go back I just
turn<00:03:08.459> off<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.820> live<00:03:09.030> simulation<00:03:09.660> calculated

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
turn off that live simulation calculated

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.710 
turn off that live simulation calculated
to<00:03:10.709> begin<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:12.030> we're<00:03:12.209> gonna<00:03:12.300> see<00:03:12.570> his

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
to begin and now we're gonna see his

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.059 
to begin and now we're gonna see his
arms<00:03:13.140> kind<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.530> affected<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.070> little<00:03:14.160> bit

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.250 

physics<00:03:17.999> simulation<00:03:18.569> as<00:03:18.659> well

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.350 

so<00:03:21.410> that's<00:03:21.620> that's<00:03:22.340> kind<00:03:22.550> of<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.210> quick

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
so that's that's kind of a just a quick

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:31.260 
so that's that's kind of a just a quick
soft<00:03:23.750> body<00:03:23.960> dynamics<00:03:24.610> in<00:03:25.610> opposing<00:03:26.210> Pro<00:03:26.510> 2014
