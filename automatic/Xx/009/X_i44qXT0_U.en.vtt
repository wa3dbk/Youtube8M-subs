myself<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.299> learned<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.780> jazz<00:01:22.049> player<00:01:22.290> back

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
myself I learned from a jazz player back

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.090 
myself I learned from a jazz player back
in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.979> 70s<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.270> he<00:01:25.229> played<00:01:25.409> his<00:01:25.530> guitar<00:01:25.650> very

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
in the 70s and he played his guitar very

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
in the 70s and he played his guitar very
high<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.729> therefore<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> learned<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
high so therefore I learned to do the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.039 
high so therefore I learned to do the
same<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.630> comfortable

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
same thing and so it was not comfortable

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.260 
same thing and so it was not comfortable
for<00:01:31.320> me<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> rock<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.920> pit<00:01:32.130> down<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.579> way<00:01:32.759> it
