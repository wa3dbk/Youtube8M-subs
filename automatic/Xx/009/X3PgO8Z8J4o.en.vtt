00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.639
 when the temperature increases and the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.160
 Improvement time is a pleasure to go on 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.800
 bicycle through the city but what to do 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.800
 when we want to take someone we have 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.480
 impossible with the folding bike but 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.369
 there are other possibilities for example the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.239
 up of volkswagen now with four 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:34.629
 doors despite their length of only three 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:37.690
 54 meters offers a lot of space in the 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.110
 251-liter trunk can fit one 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 bicycle at least one folding to 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.920
 climb the 3 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.700
 the two back doors allow 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.890
 ascend comfortably in such a way that 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.950
 we can quickly start with four 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.470
 passengers the two rear doors do not 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.600
 they make the car longer the four 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.050
 doors is as short as that of two 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.869
 yes the front doors are twenty 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.020
 In addition , the shorter centimeters of 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.970
 four doors weighs 17 kilos plus those 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.310
 are all differences except the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.840
 price for the four-door you have to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.460
 pay 475 euros more in the lap of four 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.740
 doors should be able to take someone 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.440
 back for that the decisive question 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.660
 stefan more comfortable the car looks very 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.190
 small but back the space reaches 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.440
 for four persons 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.060
 clear for long trips is not suitable 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.060
 the legs have little place 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.080
 the result was expected but the app 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.000
 it's mostly a car for the city and 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.890
 there he works very well with his 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.890
 compact measures and their practicality 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.130
 small cars are considered 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.659
 unsafe this is not the app received 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.709
 five stars in the crash test 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.810
 of the enee it looks very useful is your system 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.060
 emergency brake that activates 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 automatically at lower speeds of 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 30 kilometers per hour is optional and 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.000
 costs in Germany - 590 euros extra 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.079
 the four doors change a bit the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.540
 design the window line in the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.989
 pillar climbs us but it remains 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.989
 horizontal 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.180
 the front of the app too 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.700
 is marked by elegant lines 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.620
 horizontal 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.410
 the tailgate is a successful one 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.959
 combination of glass and metal if 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:00.260
 fold the rear seats the volume 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:02.239
 load increases from 251 to 951 liters on 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.610
 light inside is solid and tidy 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.519
 the portable module with mobile screen 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.440
 maps and move is a browser and a 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.590
 media player in addition to

 provide data about the vehicle 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.489
 unfortunately it does not come as standard 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.790
 the app comes with a gasoline engine from 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.730
 three cylinders optionally with 44 or 55 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.760
 kilowatts of power our car's 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.240
 test is the 55-kilowatt version the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.000
 consumption according to volkswagen 4.2 liters each 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.570
 100 kilometers an acceptable value for 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.570
 a small car 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.310
 this app four doors good 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.430
 equipped costs in germany 13 thousand 450 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.430
 euros 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.560
 of lava although it has four doors 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.280
 It's a limo for long trips with 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.760

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.720
 recommendable
