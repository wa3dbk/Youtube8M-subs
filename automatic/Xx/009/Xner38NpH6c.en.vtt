problem I have to see here I guess I
could<00:01:38.329> pull<00:01:38.600> up<00:01:38.749> those<00:01:38.899> two<00:01:39.289> in<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:40.759> front<00:01:40.939> one

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
could pull up those two in the front one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.580 
could pull up those two in the front one
I<00:01:41.179> could<00:01:41.359> maybe<00:01:41.479> use<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.689> bucket<00:01:41.960> zombie<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.439> eat

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
I could maybe use a bucket zombie to eat

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.399 
I could maybe use a bucket zombie to eat
through<00:01:42.889> it<00:01:43.659> no<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.810> bucket<00:01:45.049> tom<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.259> gonna

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
through it no the bucket tom is gonna

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.289 
through it no the bucket tom is gonna
lose<00:01:45.530> his<00:01:45.679> helmet<00:01:46.009> right<00:01:46.159> away<00:01:46.340> isn't<00:01:46.670> he<00:01:46.729> so

that's<00:01:47.749> gonna<00:01:47.869> be<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.049> problem<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:48.409> I<00:01:48.439> really

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
that's gonna be a problem so I really

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.289 
that's gonna be a problem so I really
need<00:01:48.889> to<00:01:48.920> pull<00:01:49.130> these<00:01:49.249> things<00:01:49.429> out<00:01:49.700> don't<00:01:50.090> I

this one as well I'm not sure that's the

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.199 
this one as well I'm not sure that's the
smartest<00:01:57.709> way<00:01:57.859> of<00:01:57.979> doing<00:01:58.219> it<00:01:58.369> but<00:01:58.579> that'll

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
going like that now I can use probably

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.969 
going like that now I can use probably
just<00:02:04.219> a<00:02:04.369> straight-up<00:02:05.350> bucket<00:02:06.350> zombie<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.740> eat

through here he should I think he'll

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.550 
through here he should I think he'll
make<00:02:09.319> it

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
make it

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.199 
make it
oh<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:10.069> challenging<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.759> don't<00:02:10.910> know<00:02:11.000> there's

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
oh it's challenging I don't know there's

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.080 
oh it's challenging I don't know there's
a<00:02:11.270> walnut<00:02:12.069> why<00:02:13.069> do<00:02:13.129> you<00:02:13.370> think<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.580> bucket<00:02:13.849> sonmi

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
a walnut why do you think a bucket sonmi

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
through or not I'll give it a try CV can

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.550 
through or not I'll give it a try CV can
now<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.299> there's<00:02:21.540> stuff<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.409> back

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560

here I can go ahead and use a digger one
here<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.569> think<00:02:24.750> will<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.049> best<00:02:25.200> route

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
here I think will be the best route

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.619 
here I think will be the best route
he'll<00:02:26.159> go<00:02:26.340> past<00:02:26.640> all<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.849> stuff<00:02:26.970> come<00:02:27.450> back

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
and eat all the way through we'll see if

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.670 
and eat all the way through we'll see if
that<00:02:30.599> bucket<00:02:30.930> zombie<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.290> make<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.530> through

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
that bucket zombie can make it through

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.380

enough<00:03:35.459> time<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.879> I<00:03:35.910> think<00:03:36.180> my<00:03:36.359> second<00:03:36.750> cone

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870

enough time that I think my second cone
head<00:03:37.049> zombie<00:03:37.379> will<00:03:37.560> make<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.919> through<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:38.760> I

head zombie will make it through so I

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.789 
head zombie will make it through so I
did<00:03:39.180> maybe<00:03:39.419> use<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.900> most<00:03:40.049> efficient<00:03:40.560> sense

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
did maybe use the most efficient sense

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.199 
did maybe use the most efficient sense
of<00:03:40.950> plants<00:03:41.310> there<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:41.669> it<00:03:41.760> did<00:03:41.879> work<00:03:42.030> out

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
of plants there but it did work out

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.990 
of plants there but it did work out
nonetheless<00:03:42.590> now<00:03:43.590> here's<00:03:44.579> going<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.849> be<00:03:44.910> an

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
nonetheless now here's going to be an

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.789 
nonetheless now here's going to be an
issue<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.359> could<00:03:45.660> maybe<00:03:45.810> Buckethead<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.560> top

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
issue I could maybe Buckethead this top

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.360 
issue I could maybe Buckethead this top
row<00:03:47.069> right<00:03:47.280> here<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.650> then<00:03:49.650> maybe<00:03:49.889> send<00:03:50.160> him<00:03:50.250> I

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
row right here and then maybe send him I

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.289 
row right here and then maybe send him I
don't<00:03:50.430> know<00:03:50.549> if<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.669> bucket<00:03:50.879> hood<00:03:51.000> guy<00:03:51.120> can

this guy from the way back just for fun

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.990 
this guy from the way back just for fun
because<00:04:23.350> he's<00:04:23.500> very<00:04:23.560> fast<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.670> don't<00:04:24.760> want

because he's very fast and I don't want

him getting hit actually I guess it

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.930 
him getting hit actually I guess it
doesn't<00:04:26.170> really<00:04:26.260> matter<00:04:26.440> who<00:04:26.620> gets<00:04:26.740> hit<00:04:26.980> but

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
doesn't really matter who gets hit but

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
another challenging one because I

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.930 
another challenging one because I
couldn't<00:05:02.710> use<00:05:02.830> my<00:05:02.980> digger<00:05:03.190> guy<00:05:03.430> right<00:05:03.670> away<00:05:03.700> I

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
had to really pick those guys out and I

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.470 
had to really pick those guys out and I
didn't<00:05:06.130> use<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.430> ladder<00:05:06.730> zombie<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.210> maybe

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
didn't use the ladder zombie I maybe

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.940

could<00:05:07.690> have<00:05:07.750> done<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.140> after<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.470> taken<00:05:08.800> care

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
could have done that after I taken care

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.950 
could have done that after I taken care
of<00:05:09.010> those<00:05:09.100> two<00:05:09.280> guys<00:05:09.430> as<00:05:10.270> opposed<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.720> using

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
of those two guys as opposed to using

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.510 
of those two guys as opposed to using
the<00:05:11.050> bucket<00:05:11.200> had<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.620> very<00:05:11.770> bottom<00:05:12.130> lane

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
the bucket had that very bottom lane

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.430 
the bucket had that very bottom lane
I<00:05:12.550> could<00:05:13.060> have<00:05:13.150> set<00:05:13.300> up<00:05:13.390> that<00:05:13.510> ladder<00:05:13.780> then<00:05:14.350> I

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
I could have set up that ladder then I

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.080 
I could have set up that ladder then I
probably<00:05:14.740> could<00:05:15.010> use<00:05:15.040> just<00:05:15.310> one<00:05:15.490> cone<00:05:15.700> head<00:05:15.940> as

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
probably could use just one cone head as

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.610 
probably could use just one cone head as
opposed<00:05:16.390> to<00:05:16.510> using<00:05:16.690> two<00:05:16.990> cone<00:05:17.230> heads<00:05:17.500> that

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
opposed to using two cone heads that

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.200 
opposed to using two cone heads that
would<00:05:17.740> have<00:05:17.860> saved<00:05:18.040> me<00:05:18.160> some<00:05:18.310> Sun<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:18.820> way<00:05:19.000> I

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
would have saved me some Sun that way I

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.909 
would have saved me some Sun that way I
got<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:20.020> think<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.200> little<00:05:20.350> bit<00:05:20.440> more<00:05:20.590> next<00:05:20.800> time
