cooling system the big news for us here
is<00:00:17.110> actually<00:00:17.440> the<00:00:17.920> place<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:19.420> we've

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
is actually the place that we've

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.669 
is actually the place that we've
invented<00:00:20.470> and<00:00:21.070> developed<00:00:21.599> is<00:00:22.599> in<00:00:23.050> fact<00:00:23.289> on<00:00:23.529> the

invented and developed is in fact on the

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.320 
invented and developed is in fact on the
exciting<00:00:24.310> part<00:00:24.490> of<00:00:24.550> its<00:00:24.699> on<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.939> other<00:00:25.060> side

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.580 
exciting part of its on the other side
obviously<00:00:25.509> where<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.080> water<00:00:26.289> is<00:00:26.410> going

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
obviously where the water is going

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.040 
obviously where the water is going
through<00:00:26.920> it<00:00:27.009> it's<00:00:27.759> actually<00:00:28.150> what<00:00:28.720> we<00:00:28.810> call<00:00:28.839> a

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
through it it's actually what we call a

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.620 
through it it's actually what we call a
center<00:00:29.529> feet<00:00:29.769> or<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.009> split<00:00:30.460> flow<00:00:30.789> design<00:00:30.970> it

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.690 
center feet or a split flow design it
allows<00:00:31.900> us<00:00:31.929> to<00:00:32.380> actually<00:00:32.529> put<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.070> cool<00:00:33.340> water

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
allows us to actually put the cool water

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.610 
allows us to actually put the cool water
straight<00:00:34.210> down<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.930> center<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.440> see

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
straight down on to the center to see

performance<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:46.590> actually<00:02:46.950> illustrated<00:02:47.430> here

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
performance is actually illustrated here

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.259

for<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> CPU<00:02:49.320> now<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.489> mean<00:02:50.970> aside<00:02:51.209> from

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
for for the CPU now I mean aside from

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.640 
for for the CPU now I mean aside from
all<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> lines<00:02:52.019> what<00:02:52.380> was<00:02:52.470> actually

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
all the lines what was actually

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.770 
all the lines what was actually
represented<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.880> actually<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.420> thermal

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
represented here is actually the thermal

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.660 
represented here is actually the thermal
resistance<00:02:55.320> which<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.829> metric<00:02:56.370> for

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
resistance which is a metric for

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.530 
resistance which is a metric for
performance<00:02:57.200> in<00:02:58.200> degrees<00:02:58.769> c<00:02:59.040> per<00:02:59.280> watt<00:02:59.579> so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
performance in degrees c per watt so

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.960 
performance in degrees c per watt so
what<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.320> really<00:03:01.680> translates<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.820> i

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
what that really translates to is if i

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.830 
what that really translates to is if i

we move down with the the new eco to 120
here<00:03:41.290> down<00:03:42.290> here<00:03:42.319> also<00:03:43.099> what<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
here down here also what so the the

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.869 
here down here also what so the the
light<00:03:45.200> blue<00:03:45.410> line<00:03:45.680> was<00:03:46.280> actually<00:03:46.700> the

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
light blue line was actually the

light blue line was actually the
push-pull<00:03:47.510> configuration<00:03:48.069> so<00:03:49.069> two<00:03:49.489> fans<00:03:49.790> on

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180

the<00:03:50.480> eco<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:51.080> now<00:03:51.590> equalled<00:03:52.099> with<00:03:52.670> one<00:03:52.940> films

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
the eco is now equalled with one films

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.380 
the eco is now equalled with one films
on<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.750> Eco<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.160> now<00:03:55.160> if<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.580> actually<00:03:55.730> go<00:03:55.940> do

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
on the Eco to now if you actually go do

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.470 
on the Eco to now if you actually go do
a<00:03:56.420> push<00:03:56.959> pull<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:58.040> eco<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.580> then<00:03:59.299> we're

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
a push pull on the eco to then we're

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.380 
a push pull on the eco to then we're
actually<00:03:59.920> really<00:04:00.920> an<00:04:01.250> honest<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:02.180> nice

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
actually really an honest in a nice

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.140 
actually really an honest in a nice

cpu cooler air or liquid as a
self-contained<00:04:11.299> solution<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:12.860> we're<00:04:13.010> really

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
self-contained solution so we're really

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.979 
self-contained solution so we're really
excited<00:04:13.280> about<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.420> seeing<00:04:14.780> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
excited about that and seeing the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.000 
excited about that and seeing the
another<00:04:15.739> reviewer<00:04:16.220> response<00:04:16.639> to<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.709> we

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
another reviewer response to that so we

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.710 
another reviewer response to that so we
get<00:04:19.220> into<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.549> more<00:04:19.729> extreme<00:04:20.120> stuff<00:04:20.479> with<00:04:20.690> a

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
get into the more extreme stuff with a

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.219 
get into the more extreme stuff with a
140<00:04:21.380> Brad<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.580> green<00:04:22.910> line<00:04:23.180> here<00:04:23.210> then<00:04:24.020> we
