00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that we just set up right behind us now

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.090 
that we just set up right behind us now
some<00:00:19.960> of<00:00:19.990> these<00:00:20.110> trail<00:00:20.410> cameras<00:00:20.770> come<00:00:20.920> with<00:00:20.950> a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
some of these trail cameras come with a

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.050 
some of these trail cameras come with a
base<00:00:21.810> where<00:00:22.810> you<00:00:23.020> can<00:00:23.490> screw<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.760> like<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.510> big<00:00:26.020> my

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
base where you can screw a like a big my

base where you can screw a like a big my
thick<00:00:28.060> screw<00:00:28.360> into<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.990> tree<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:30.100> this<00:00:30.280> is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
thick screw into the tree and this is

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.580 
thick screw into the tree and this is
set<00:00:30.670> on<00:00:30.760> top<00:00:30.940> of<00:00:31.000> it<00:00:31.330> I<00:00:31.449> don't<00:00:31.630> like<00:00:31.690> to<00:00:31.900> do<00:00:32.050> that

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
set on top of it I don't like to do that

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.920 
set on top of it I don't like to do that
I<00:00:32.619> don't<00:00:33.550> want<00:00:33.730> to<00:00:34.530> damage<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:36.570> tree<00:00:37.570> as

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
I don't want to damage the tree as

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.619 
I don't want to damage the tree as
little<00:00:38.320> as<00:00:38.410> possible<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:39.699> looks<00:00:40.480> like

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
little as possible when it looks like

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.140 
little as possible when it looks like
it's<00:00:40.809> too<00:00:40.930> big

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.130 

instead<00:00:47.220> use<00:00:48.220> these<00:00:48.400> bungee<00:00:48.760> cords<00:00:49.150> wrap

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
instead use these bungee cords wrap

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.350 
instead use these bungee cords wrap
around<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.559> tree<00:00:50.769> like<00:00:50.949> that<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:55.030> not<00:00:55.180> going

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
around the tree like that it's not going

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.079 
around the tree like that it's not going
to<00:00:55.420> hold<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.659> camera<00:00:56.080> steady<00:00:56.729> but<00:00:57.729> whenever<00:00:57.940> I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
to hold the camera steady but whenever I

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.719 
to hold the camera steady but whenever I
take<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:58.420> camera<00:00:58.780> off<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.049> tree<00:00:59.400> the<00:01:00.400> trees

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
take the camera off the tree the trees

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.020 
take the camera off the tree the trees
not<00:01:00.879> going<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.120> have<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.239> big<00:01:01.360> hole<00:01:01.540> in<00:01:01.570> it<00:01:06.030> these

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
not going to have a big hole in it these

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.450 
not going to have a big hole in it these
holes<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.850> this<00:01:10.000> camera<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:12.220> sure<00:01:12.340> this

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
and once again this is a rechargeable

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.100 
and once again this is a rechargeable
battery<00:01:53.730> now<00:01:54.730> I<00:01:54.760> like<00:01:55.030> rechargeables<00:01:55.840> because

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
battery now I like rechargeables because

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.030 
battery now I like rechargeables because
I<00:01:56.230> think<00:01:56.470> they're<00:01:56.590> better<00:01:56.710> on<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
I think they're better on the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.130 
I think they're better on the
environment<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:58.420> way<00:01:58.540> whenever<00:01:58.780> I'm

on this memory card right now out of a
possible<00:02:42.340> 30<00:02:42.780> 560<00:02:43.780> more<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.940> wrapped<00:02:46.240> up

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
possible 30 560 more we wrapped up

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.760 
possible 30 560 more we wrapped up
bungee<00:02:49.180> cords<00:02:49.480> around<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.750> tree<00:02:50.050> so<00:02:50.260> there's

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
bungee cords around the tree so there's

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.310 
bungee cords around the tree so there's
no<00:02:50.920> damage<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.670> unlike<00:02:52.540> some<00:02:53.080> trail

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
no damage to it unlike some trail

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.850 
no damage to it unlike some trail
cameras<00:02:53.740> where<00:02:54.490> people<00:02:54.760> screw<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.620> into<00:02:56.620> the

tree whenever you they aren't whenever

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.190 
tree whenever you they aren't whenever
they<00:02:58.420> take<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.340> screw<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.870> there's<00:03:02.020> just

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
they take the screw out and there's just
