00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.710 

I'll<00:01:26.280> tell<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> takes

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
think once people get a kind of a Lynch

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.550 
think once people get a kind of a Lynch
mentality<00:01:32.399> where<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.350> presented<00:01:34.350> all<00:01:34.439> this

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
mentality where they presented all this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
mentality where they presented all this
evidence<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.250> wow<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
evidence and they go wow now we have to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.050 
evidence and they go wow now we have to
impeach<00:01:37.350> his<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.220> well<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> know

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060

Adele<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:39.960> totally<00:01:40.170> correct<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
Adele you are totally correct and the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.539 
Adele you are totally correct and the
problem<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.179> is<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:43.070> people<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
problem here is that people have this

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
problem here is that people have this
belief<00:01:44.789> that<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> government<00:01:45.810> goes<00:01:46.470> out

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
belief that if the government goes out

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
belief that if the government goes out
and<00:01:46.920> arrest<00:01:47.189> someone<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and arrest someone that there's got to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.359 
and arrest someone that there's got to
be<00:01:48.990> something<00:01:49.350> wrong<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.979> isn't

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
be something wrong that isn't

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
be something wrong that isn't
necessarily<00:01:50.850> true<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.479> particularly<00:01:52.439> those

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
