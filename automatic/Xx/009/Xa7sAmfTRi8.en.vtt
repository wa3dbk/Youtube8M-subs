 frame my hands silently and today we tell you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.929
 tell about the book 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.300
 which ranked second in our 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
 voting with which we immediately have a group 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 VKontakte and it's called fight 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.890
 the club that wrote chuck palanik chuck 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.890
 palanic 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.010
 so dear friends this books came out in 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.380
 1996 despite the fact that it was 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.140
 written 2 on how much we know in chuck 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.270
 palanika first was the book of invisibility she 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.520
 The first reason came out because when 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.830
 you palanik tried to promote their 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.379
 invisible to the publishers to tell you that there 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.390
 too much violence and other things 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.670
 that you can not publish so you 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.040
 Palahniuk has added took an even tougher 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.989
 the book is evil to them and strangely enough it 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.300
 turned out to say that this 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.760
 the book was translated by ast 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.519
 we in Russia and I perelle and Carmen 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 who does not know is the person who wrote 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.390
 texts for the nautilus pompilius group this 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.549
 was the first whale who ordered on ozone 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.170
 long ago in 2000 second year first 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.030
 once ordered something from the internet was 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.890
 terribly scary she came I was at all in 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.409
 shocked that there are such books in general 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.270
 the essence of this book is what exactly breaks 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.340
 brain that makes you think and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.490
 look at the world in a different way chuck palix 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.250
 he showed the world consumerism in such 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.860
 the form in which it is that is what 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.049
 modern people turned into what what 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.049
 turns us from society where she us 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.299
 delays things replace the meaning of life 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.609
 that is, in fact for many people of course 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.409
 the same with the words chuck palanika we are no longer 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.609
 already turning into buying a new sofa 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.399

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.240
 You will tell the purchase of a bed to Vanechka 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.520
 about chuck palanika because it is very 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.729
 colorful character as far as I know how 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.890
 difficult he had a fate he grew up in 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.520
 some tula trailer but very some 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.979
 such and houses on wheels and on wheels with 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.759
 parents who crashed when chuck 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.799
 was 14 years old that they often left 4 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.289
 children that is chuck and 3 his brothers with 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.140
 grandparents of course baby 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.090
 it was very difficult to worry about this discord 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.910
 fight club about the game the moment that 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.260
 that's the lack of a father made men like 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.760
 would have lost lost manhood 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 men lost because very often 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.400
 the man leaves the family and brings up 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.560
 baby mother and another interesting fact 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.620
 which surprised me how much chuck

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.269
 there is in fact 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.640
 which combined work such physical 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.920
 mechanical work with hands 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.769

 he wrote later he caught his finished 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.829
 journalistic career after visiting 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.079
 how is he a workshop so we are not there 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.269
 liked it and he decided to do something 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.549
 more of your life than just working 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.859
 he started on a voluntary basis 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.310
 a meeting of people's groups 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.599
 who are incurably sick 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.340
 light saw the eyes of the colorfulness describes 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.079
 his novels because he is all with 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.680
 this faced and here to write about 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.569
 what did you see much easier information 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.849
 which he found this also stopped 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.829
 engage after allure one of 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.049
 his beloved patients whom he is very 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.940
 got attached 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.010
 In general, you know, this again intersects 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.349
 with this topic here how much why exactly 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.299
 the idea came from chuck palanika 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.620
 what about fight club 700 what 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.230
 that someone had a fight 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.329
 and then he went somewhere with colleagues 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.880
 he was all beaten and he had everything in his face 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.470
 bruised and bruised but nobody 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.079
 paid attention everyone pretended that 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.000
 nothing terrible happened 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.840
 accordingly, it hooked him 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.340
 tasting was described as 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.349
 Of course, of course, initially 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.329
 fight club was a 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.129
 quite a short story which 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.099
 by then already chuck palanik paradise 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.079
 expanded to a whole novel with chapter 6 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.579
 just a new novel and represents 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.769
 yourself that tells me a little bit 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.329
 now about the book itself will tell him 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.150
 such know the cost that place who is not 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.829
 read wanted to read and who read more 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.109
 wanted to reread then we have the main 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.780
 a hero who talks about what 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.340
 comes with it and accordingly from 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.320
 he is going to pester the main character 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.539
 gorge on consumer society on from 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.620
 he starts to feel sick and all that 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.660
 to the extent that he appears 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.220
 insomnia he realizes that he is 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.260
 like a squirrel in a wheel that is, he buys 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
 one thing is another thing and and you and starts 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.419
 enrage he saw an internal going on 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.610
 conflict 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.380
 his psychiatrist trying to help him 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.100
 advises to go to a group meeting 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.250
 support to show that he 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.040
 people actually learn so here 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.590
 they say you donâ€™t suffer from it 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.300
 goes see what's really his life 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.730
 compared to people who 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.740
 really problems in fact a fairy tale and 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.510
 he starts to sleep he has everything 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.640
 ok u go there for him like 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.380
 entertainment but in the end he runs up 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.120
 a woman named marla singer 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.800
 this woman goes to a support group by 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.930
 another reason she is terribly afraid of death 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.420
 and the only way for her is somehow 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.190
 muffle this fear of death look it 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.710
 people who really die from the radio 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.900
 week for all further 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.390
 developing very very unexpected 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.450
 way in the book there are at least 3 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.250
 and 4 translations why as far as I understood 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.960
 illa breadwinner which is 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.150
 official translator is not so 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.250
 well it turned out many things he translated 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.590
 not exactly the way I wanted to get my message across 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.210
 the author therefore if you would even read 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.480
 I highly recommend the official book 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.650
 search this without problems you will find how 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.540
 at least two or three others 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.700
 translators and poprad read in their 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.860
 translates you completely from the other side 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.690
 You see many things, and so very much 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.400
 I have already said a lot of hope 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.370
 something interesting we said 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.020
 and while we say goodbye we want 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.970
 say that we have a website you 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.770

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.000
 not bookmark and already look there because 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.070
 that everything is duplicated there and there 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.750
