00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.310 

that's<00:01:47.799> what<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:47.979> looks<00:01:48.159> like<00:01:49.320> other

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
that's what it looks like other

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.600

salespeople<00:01:50.619> are<00:01:50.860> looking<00:01:51.040> at<00:01:51.130> me<00:01:51.220> funny<00:01:51.369> but

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
salespeople are looking at me funny but

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.999 
salespeople are looking at me funny but
so<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.630> blue<00:01:52.900> one<00:01:53.110> actually<00:01:53.590> had<00:01:53.680> some<00:01:53.830> sort

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
so that blue one actually had some sort

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.380 
so that blue one actually had some sort
of<00:01:54.070> package<00:01:54.280> on<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:54.700> made<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.060> can't

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
of package on it it made it so you can't

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.600
