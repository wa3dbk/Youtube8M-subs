there's<00:02:27.140> pink<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.380> then<00:02:28.560> there's<00:02:28.739> also<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
there's pink and then there's also a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
there's pink and then there's also a
little<00:02:29.580> bit<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.880> white<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.390> there<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> gives

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
little bit of white in there that gives

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.830 
little bit of white in there that gives
it<00:02:31.019> some<00:02:31.230> added<00:02:31.380> interest<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:33.420> how<00:02:33.780> we

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
it some added interest and that's how we

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.110 
it some added interest and that's how we
do<00:02:34.140> two<00:02:34.739> sponge<00:02:35.370> techniques<00:02:35.849> on<00:02:36.030> the
