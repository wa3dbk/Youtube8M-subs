 it's going to be March, the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.380
 spring and then it's like doing some 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.119
 flowers to make flower arrangements are 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.890
 paper flowers very different from 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.260
 typical that are made with crepe paper or 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.879
 those things then you can use them for 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.830
 decorate your bedroom put them in a 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.629
 florerito and these flowers are not going to 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.180
 wither and you will not have to 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.590
 start from nowhere and you will not have 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.150
 to spend money on buying some 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.580
 artificial flowers are you going to make 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.890
 same with paper and super easy they look 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.790
 beautiful and very very different from those 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.710
 we are used to it 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.870
 remember that greetings were appearing 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.370

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.409
 to start we mark in the width of your 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.920
 leaf two points at 7 and 14 centimeters 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.630
 two strips 7 centimeters wide by 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.290
 the length of your sheet now what we will do 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.330

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.950
 making the cut as well as like a 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.820
 centimeter before the sheet ends 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.820
