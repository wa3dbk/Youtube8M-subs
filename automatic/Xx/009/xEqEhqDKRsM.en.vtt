take one where I eat some sales berries

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.280

own-brand<00:00:08.370> add<00:00:09.349> 500<00:00:10.349> grams<00:00:11.120> so<00:00:12.120> there's<00:00:12.750> 89

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
own-brand add 500 grams so there's 89

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099 
own-brand add 500 grams so there's 89
calories<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.280> that's<00:00:15.120> per<00:00:15.360> 10<00:00:15.630> gram<00:00:15.929> serving
