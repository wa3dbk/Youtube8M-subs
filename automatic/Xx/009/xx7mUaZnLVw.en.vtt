 in the shape of Chinese motorcycles sacrificed on 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.380

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.480
 his clebs tried to tell him that 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.830

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.600
 sir verdi does not speak german 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.600
 so naturally it has ended badly 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.770
 cheverny he also knows how to make fakir 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.780

 what next to such a good moment of 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.180
 relaxation 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.560

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.650
 a woman grid that is what she 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.240
 a lot more group at verdi the wall of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 death he discovered it in england 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.280
 during a tour with his century 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.140
 since the idea of the most cowardly is there 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.630
 it's with his own hands and he has it 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.270
 built in one year to the day with 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.860
 a mobile series are hotchkiss and his 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.510
 gower penis to fetch the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.690
 larches in the dots and that's the wall 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.970
 in the here built of in a dish and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.860
 after the first jeans for the climb the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.430
 last bolt and the redheads and at 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.430
 millimeter 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.829
 I'm greening it to the fury of the bike on 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.140
 his motorcycle usually without rollers 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.420
 hold the handlebars and with humor they 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.489
 tell how they eat golden voice 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.489
 wash motorcycle life 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.340
 bill bah is a goldfish that makes the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.340
 even 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.980
 poxel turns a little in circles if a little 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.330
 but it's still comfortable and I have 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.220
 still, it's pretty impressive 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.660
 once it's gone first place you 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.760
 you do not want to go wrong it's true 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.270
 it's true i'm fine lolo tried me 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.840
 on the other hand to see if that's it and then 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.850
 what now 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.930
 I gave up the show to go 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:25.160
 have a drink or a tenth 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.560
 red fish story 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.460
 thank you sir verdi me what I 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.040
 just wanted to say is that necessarily 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.650
 a jump into inner hell or risking 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.030
 nothing if you break your mouth no 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.960
 no it's not that plays that's to say 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.550
 what you mean is that you 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.400
 10 round range in a circle 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.700
 closed it knows you have your hands 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.700
 see if 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.650
 I have a lot of strength of character 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.370
 but still less than that of a 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.499
 cicada Breton mix of the coup I was 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.389
 obliged to execute me and try the wall 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:04.099
 of death because I quickly understood as 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.099
 Monsieur Verdine, you do not disappoint him 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.320
 power and the crafty do not 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.320
 take like that sir verdine 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.690
 it's true that maybe it's not so 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.100
 simple that's the fish life I'm 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.539
 two little tips to give me 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.880
 you have to know how to swim well it's true here 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:48.240
 otherwise it will be necessary that you do not give 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.160
 too much gas and that you raise his 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.789
 brain go back ok that's all 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.289
 to know 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.940
 that's why it's called the wall of 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.360
 death because there are many who 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.360
 have died in 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.589
 red stuck and I have to 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.340
 recognize that the farm is not simple 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:08.650
 at all look there 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.419
 look inwards 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.860
 wet is better there first because he 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.570
 must have been rocked in the drum 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.850
 a washing machine from its most tender 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.160
 childhood not to know nausea 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.320
 then because all the benchmarks are 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.120
 lose and mix strength 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.009
 centrifuge you plate the head down 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.169
 when it should be raised for 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.850
 to understand the space 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.180
 finally rolls horizontally is to 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:36.460
 the opposite of natural reflexes 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:37.770
 I want to stack and you turn 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.039
 how long in there 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:45.180
 20h20 all without vomiting with four beers 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.180
 to the four singles 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.560
 In short, I did not arrive until the moment 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.229
 I remembered something that made me 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.580
 well unlock in the movies I had seen 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:56.139
 that there was a pretty girl who 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.120
 was waiting at the top of the wall of death 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.560
 that you come to seize a rose that she 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.560
 was holding delicate shows his teeth 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.430
 and here I can say that I got 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.409
 I climbed a lot of times in the wall 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.439
 of death and I really took the 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:09.439
 height 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.249
 I had just forgotten a little detail oh 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:17.889
 Well, that was the daughter of Monsieur Verdoux 

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:19.210
 and the jonah hill guys have not really 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.930
 the right to joke with the family 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.930
 and among gypsies 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.490
 who is already going 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.020
 you
