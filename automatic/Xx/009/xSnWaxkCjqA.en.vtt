00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello people, welcome back. 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.230
 here in this class we will be applying the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 texture of our model here in the case in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.410
 our island 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.080
 obviously I want to apply on earth 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.590
 we are putting into practice what in itself 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.020
 even the theory of previous classes 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.439
 because in the material comes the panel 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.000
 texture in mexico 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.960
 is selected 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 click on it I put the name logically 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.610
 land type ii but opt and open 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.260
 my texture and the directory you have there 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.020
 in your computer 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.030
 this texture is from a collection that you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.989
 is there in the tone of the site which is the total 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.649
 image you have there on the screen the collection 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.410
 more than 1500 textures are all 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.719
 in high resolution where much of it is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.210
 you will notice that in the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.940
 video that tested dockable facilitate 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.090
 well the work and it is the tip for who 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.619
 want resources to use work 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.960
 personal or business 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.390
 there is the tip well open the texture I 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.479
 I'll set up for the v mode 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 and come here text mode to see how it 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.150
 it's just seeming nothing because 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.540
 nothing is appearing because 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.250
 set ov still hear it here 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.270
 view pictures and editor 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.100
 I'll open there again and now I will 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.700
 only select the earth selection and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.170
 close to unwrap squeeze smarttv 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.149
 project he does he kind of does the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.390
 my ver 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.720
 automatically it sort of analyzes the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.549
 shape and think ah I think if he 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.950
 Could not stay legal 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.229
 it kind of cuts the tide of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.930
 smart way was getting easier 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.600
 apply the texture logically has that 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.219
 process and cutting the mesh that I 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.459
 I taught previously 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.979
 I'm here ismael sees project is a hand 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.620
 on the wheel practically for whom to whom 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.849
 Do you want to do something fast? 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.400
 let me come here open textures tackle 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.950
 mote just left and now I will select 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.510
 everything is fine 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.280
 so that's why the textures are 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.709
 can not see 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.760
 regardless of how much it 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.970
 decrease 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.159
 they fit together side by side if they 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.980
 texture did not fit the web 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.599
 look like it's cut out to friend texture 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.120
 here on the surface 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.340
 The correct thing is that I want this 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.250
 texture gets a little more yellowish 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.829
 how I do it here in color system 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.989
 here rgb multiply increase 1.2 knowing 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.560
 that she is becoming one more like 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:03.629
 the moment there was also 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.680
 more yellow 1,500.00 baby looks good 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.390
 hopscotch 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.209
 what is known is that how do you know 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.849
 daniel is for you to learn how to 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.560
 manipulating values based on the color with 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.090
 this is playing with these values ​​is 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.819
 for sale for example 60 ôôôô blue and together 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.130
 green and red turns yellow 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.049
 That's why I know if you increase the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.290
 red and green I know she gets more 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.349
 tomorrow yellowish your tone 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.510
 that deal gets here is where you 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.919
 choose the color of the model and stay 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.389
 playing with values in a way 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:42.569
 you learn well is just that. 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.879
 not only is this not because because I want 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.180
 kind of leave color hype here in 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.980
 my bag and break out I'll kind of let 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.209
 around her I want to leave the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:00.389
 Brown 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:04:03.410
 let's leave here in normal mode middle 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.410
 brown and surrounding 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.169
 it's just to give a dark tint 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:17.489
 around the one from my model for sale 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:20.760
 it's nothing much just basic detail only 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.440
 for my model not get as key 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.160
 so expensive, that speaks 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.600
 is so uniform so regular to texture 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.220
 surface 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.850
 Let me be here, the tacin is 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.920
 looking more like the role with something more 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.870
 some correct customization now I'm going 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.980
 apply on grass in the grass make 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.810
 same thing 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:58.080
 add image new image in the middle to 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:05:02.710
 mow the lawn here have O les textures 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.750
 I'm ready to leave it in the way it sees 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.910
 ov 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.600
 also this texture also adopted catoe 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:18.970
 But you see she's pretty big, too. 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:22.300
 fit select touch that select 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:26.110
 did you select only the area where the 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:30.850
 here in text mode because it is already the 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:34.830
 enough and fly gives a fan ismael sees 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.830
 project ready 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.570
 independent of texture is open here 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.350
 or do not look already handle handle see 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.010
 correct rock that stays so 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.720
 interesting let's check it out 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.200
 internet see only 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.460
 only decided to take this speculate that not 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.160
 right here 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.160
 I can not afford to speculate very lightly 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.169
 It's so light and interesting. 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.330
 enjoying that I'm here I go 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:10.720
 set up this lighting 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:12.460
 I came here interestingly the way 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:18.790
 blog address is thing of what is what 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:22.230
 I have set the illumination in time 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.230
 real in a very simple way 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.770
 Jose was very careful to 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.660
 set the rotation of the sun because 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.450
 anything 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.630
 He is there, now there is more illumination. 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.390
 cool but have to do here I go 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:45.130
 make this light softer 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:51.280
 let me see a 15 Itabom rain here O 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.280
 b a control was cool 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:04.180
 there was interesting right there to our 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.740
 our texture she did not give a realistic 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.570
 to our model 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.639
 What was the purpose of applying texture 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.340
 that fleeing texture was either me 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:15.220
 apply an irregularity to the surface 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.970
 kind of let it count differently from a 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.550
 different side of the other to compose 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.470
 some artistic in the let model 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.510
 that solid color 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.310
 're seeing that gives a slight pressure 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:32.430
 our role model 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:35.710
 so this was part of the 1 in the style of 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:39.220
 work and the texture of good air 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.389
 so in our personal model I'm going 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.639
 End here 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:44.740
 this lesson was intended to show the 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:49.620
 application in texture in practice 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.620
 It's not until the next class.
