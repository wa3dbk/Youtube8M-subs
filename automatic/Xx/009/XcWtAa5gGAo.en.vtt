sound<00:01:17.560> turbocharged<00:01:18.159> because<00:01:18.399> you<00:01:18.490> get<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
sound turbocharged because you get the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.330

little hiss and the wide from the
turbines<00:01:21.729> results<00:01:22.149> but<00:01:22.270> they've<00:01:22.420> got<00:01:22.600> rid<00:01:22.930> of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
turbines results but they've got rid of

turbines results but they've got rid of
the<00:01:23.350> any<00:01:24.250> suggestion<00:01:24.939> of<00:01:25.000> wastegate<00:01:25.600> noise<00:01:25.840> so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
the any suggestion of wastegate noise so

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.950 
the any suggestion of wastegate noise so
the<00:01:26.200> son<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.560> tube<00:01:26.950> that<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.340> get<00:01:27.579> from

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the son of that tube that you get from

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.500 
the son of that tube that you get from
Subaru<00:01:29.039> Impreza's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:02:02.200 

right

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.610 

so<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.750> all<00:02:03.840> about<00:02:03.900> really

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
so this is what it's all about really

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.260 
so this is what it's all about really
this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> first<00:02:05.340> turbocharged

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this is the first turbocharged

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.169 
this is the first turbocharged
mid-engine<00:02:07.110> v8<00:02:07.620> Ferrari<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.850> compared<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
mid-engine v8 Ferrari so compared with

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.370 
mid-engine v8 Ferrari so compared with
the<00:02:09.270> four<00:02:09.450> five<00:02:09.630> eight<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.020> actually

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
the four five eight it's actually

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.920 
the four five eight it's actually
smaller<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.190> around<00:02:11.400> 600<00:02:12.030> CC<00:02:12.480> down<00:02:12.720> on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
smaller it's around 600 CC down on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.570 
smaller it's around 600 CC down on
capacity<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> hundred<00:02:14.100> horsepower

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
capacity but it's a hundred horsepower

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.520 
capacity but it's a hundred horsepower
up<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.030> power<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.380> thing<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.590> don't<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.980> is

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
up on power the thing I don't like is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.750 
up on power the thing I don't like is
when<00:02:19.530> you're<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.740> 12<00:02:19.920> year<00:02:20.190> old<00:02:20.340> boy<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.700> you

and you go and look through the glass at

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.710 
and you go and look through the glass at
the<00:02:25.050> engine<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.670> looks<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.150> bit<00:02:27.180> feeble

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the engine that looks a bit feeble

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.310 
the engine that looks a bit feeble

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.250 
loveliness in which I think on the whole
it<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:42.300> be<00:02:42.420> honest<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> only<00:02:42.840> thing<00:02:43.140> I'm

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
it is to be honest the only thing I'm

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.580 
it is to be honest the only thing I'm
not<00:02:43.410> quite<00:02:43.680> sure<00:02:43.709> about<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.780> door<00:02:46.050> handle

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
not quite sure about is the door handle

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.260 
not quite sure about is the door handle
and<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.890> wasn't<00:02:47.100> listening<00:02:47.459> closely<00:02:48.120> enough

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
and I wasn't listening closely enough

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.120 
and I wasn't listening closely enough
last<00:02:48.540> night<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.930> could<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.620> has<00:02:49.890> a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
last night it could be that this has a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.190 
last night it could be that this has a
very<00:02:50.430> specific<00:02:50.910> aerodynamic<00:02:51.750> function<00:02:52.080> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
very specific aerodynamic function it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.960 
very specific aerodynamic function it
looks<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.860> does<00:02:53.070> because<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> shape

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
looks like it does because of the shape

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
looks like it does because of the shape
there<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.600> its<00:02:55.200> position<00:02:55.410> there<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.980> may<00:02:56.100> be

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
there and its position there it may be

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.310 
there and its position there it may be
something<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.850> do<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.150> guiding<00:02:57.720> air<00:02:58.050> or

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
something to do with guiding air or

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.890 
something to do with guiding air or
dividing<00:02:58.950> air<00:02:59.160> as<00:02:59.340> it<00:03:00.120> goes<00:03:00.300> through<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.630> bit

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
dividing air as it goes through this bit

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.860 
dividing air as it goes through this bit
but<00:03:01.170> looking<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:02.330> sort<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.360> want<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.750> to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
but looking at it I sort of want it to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.039 
but looking at it I sort of want it to
be<00:03:03.989> there<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.500> flush<00:03:04.860> with<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.820> there<00:03:06.239> it

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
be there and flush with it there it

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.640 
be there and flush with it there it
looks<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.590> little<00:03:07.739> bit<00:03:08.510> added<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:10.320> looks<00:03:10.530> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
looks a little bit added on it looks a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.110 
looks a little bit added on it looks a
little<00:03:10.799> bit<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.280> someone's<00:03:11.670> done<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.880> small
