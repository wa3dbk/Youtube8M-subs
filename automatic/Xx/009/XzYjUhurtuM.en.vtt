all the way to the bottom of the mold

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.109 
all the way to the bottom of the mold
and<00:00:30.650> it'll<00:00:30.859> harden<00:00:31.279> in<00:00:31.430> there<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:31.940> when<00:00:32.090> I

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
and it'll harden in there and when I

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.029 
and it'll harden in there and when I
take<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.570> mold<00:00:32.780> off<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.260> have<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.739> piece<00:00:34.010> of

take the mold off I have a piece of

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.639 
take the mold off I have a piece of
sacks<00:00:34.430> with<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.420> rod<00:00:35.629> on<00:00:35.839> the<00:00:35.870> inside<00:00:36.319> of<00:00:36.350> it

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
sacks with the rod on the inside of it

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.369 
sacks with the rod on the inside of it
that<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.339> main<00:00:37.729> sprue<00:00:38.239> rod<00:00:38.539> and<00:00:39.140> i<00:00:39.170> will

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
that is the main sprue rod and i will

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.520 
that is the main sprue rod and i will
start<00:00:39.589> welding<00:00:39.829> on<00:00:40.159> different<00:00:40.789> sizes<00:00:41.300> of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
start welding on different sizes of

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.469 
start welding on different sizes of
another<00:00:42.530> color<00:00:42.859> wax<00:00:43.159> which<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.579> red<00:00:43.909> it

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
another color wax which is red it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.869 
another color wax which is red it
actually<00:00:44.690> melts<00:00:45.050> faster<00:00:45.889> than<00:00:46.429> the<00:00:46.699> brown

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
actually melts faster than the brown

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.599 
actually melts faster than the brown
melts<00:00:47.359> they<00:00:47.600> will<00:00:47.749> become<00:00:48.109> pouring<00:00:48.679> spouts

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
melts they will become pouring spouts

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.539 
melts they will become pouring spouts
and<00:00:49.969> they<00:00:50.239> will<00:00:50.389> become<00:00:51.280> inventing<00:00:52.280> and

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
and they will become inventing and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.389 
and they will become inventing and
gating<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.899> release<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.350> gases<00:00:54.829> in<00:00:54.979> the<00:00:55.100> metal

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
gating to release the gases in the metal

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.119 
gating to release the gases in the metal
when<00:00:55.909> I<00:00:55.940> pour<00:00:56.269> it<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.600> that's<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.559> science<00:00:58.039> of

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
when I pour it and that's the science of

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.860 
when I pour it and that's the science of
it's<00:00:58.280> all<00:00:58.429> you<00:00:58.639> have<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:58.969> really<00:00:59.149> do<00:00:59.839> that

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
it's all you have to really do that

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.319 
it's all you have to really do that
correctly<00:01:00.229> or<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:00.979> won't<00:01:01.190> work<00:01:01.280> you'll<00:01:02.149> have

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
correctly or it won't work you'll have

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.240 
correctly or it won't work you'll have
places<00:01:02.959> that<00:01:03.079> won't<00:01:03.229> cast<00:01:03.530> in<00:01:03.799> places<00:01:04.220> that

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
places that won't cast in places that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.850 
places that won't cast in places that
will<00:01:04.489> cast<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.119> you'll<00:01:05.239> have<00:01:05.390> holes<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:06.680> have

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
will cast and you'll have holes you have

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.620 
will cast and you'll have holes you have
all<00:01:07.040> kinds<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.400> problems<00:01:07.610> if<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.090> don't<00:01:08.270> sprue

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
all kinds of problems if you don't sprue

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.070 
all kinds of problems if you don't sprue
it<00:01:08.750> correctly<00:01:09.640> let's<00:01:10.640> put<00:01:10.910> on<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.030> main<00:01:11.300> rod<00:01:11.660> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
it correctly let's put on a main rod and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.960 
it correctly let's put on a main rod and
then<00:01:12.500> we<00:01:12.680> have<00:01:12.800> feeders<00:01:13.190> that<00:01:13.220> come<00:01:13.580> off<00:01:13.610> all

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
then we have feeders that come off all

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.790 
then we have feeders that come off all
over<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.990> different<00:01:15.350> parts<00:01:15.620> of<00:01:15.740> the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
over to the different parts of the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.740 
over to the different parts of the
sculpture<00:01:16.400> that's<00:01:16.520> going<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.880> be<00:01:16.970> going<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.660> be

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
sculpture that's going to be going to be

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.260 
sculpture that's going to be going to be
cast<00:01:18.200> when<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.070> pour<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.310> metal<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.090> has

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
cast when you pour the metal and it has

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.970 
cast when you pour the metal and it has
to<00:01:20.300> run<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.780> all<00:01:20.870> those<00:01:21.050> different<00:01:21.290> places<00:01:21.620> as

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
to run to all those different places as

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.760 
to run to all those different places as
fast<00:01:22.340> as<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:22.700> can<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.930> want<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.260> all<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.530> flow

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
fast as you can you want to all the flow

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.610 
fast as you can you want to all the flow
to<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.100> same<00:01:25.340> points<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.380> start<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.500> harden

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
to the same points and start to harden

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.760 
to the same points and start to harden
after<00:01:28.490> that's<00:01:28.850> completed<00:01:29.360> we'll<00:01:29.990> take<00:01:30.290> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
after that's completed we'll take the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.040 
after that's completed we'll take the
wax<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.670> sprue<00:01:31.940> rod<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.510> we<00:01:32.660> will<00:01:32.840> dip

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
wax and the sprue rod and we will dip

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.200 
wax and the sprue rod and we will dip
that<00:01:33.260> into<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.620> tank<00:01:34.040> of<00:01:34.310> ceramic<00:01:34.850> slurry

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
they bond together they fuse and we

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.670 
they bond together they fuse and we
throw<00:01:44.060> those<00:01:44.270> in<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.630> tank<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.080> continuously

throw those in a tank that continuously

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.250 
throw those in a tank that continuously
stirs<00:01:46.040> because<00:01:46.460> if<00:01:46.700> we<00:01:47.480> don't<00:01:47.630> stir<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.110> all

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
stirs because if we don't stir it all

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.550 
stirs because if we don't stir it all
the<00:01:48.440> time

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the time

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.140

and the bottom it will become hard we
dip<00:01:54.940> nine<00:01:55.300> times<00:01:55.810> at<00:01:56.530> about<00:01:56.920> four<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.400> five

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
dip nine times at about four to five

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.210 
dip nine times at about four to five
hour<00:01:57.820> intervals<00:01:58.390> then<00:01:58.840> at<00:01:59.080> each<00:01:59.350> one<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.950> those

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
hour intervals then at each one of those

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.640 
hour intervals then at each one of those
dipping<00:02:00.820> we<00:02:01.330> will<00:02:01.570> start<00:02:01.869> off<00:02:02.080> with<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.409> sign

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
dipping we will start off with a sign

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.340 
dipping we will start off with a sign
saying<00:02:02.680> lost<00:02:03.670> white<00:02:04.090> silica<00:02:04.570> sand<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.200> know

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
saying lost white silica sand you know

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.080 
saying lost white silica sand you know
about<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.710> second<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.130> third<00:02:06.160> will<00:02:06.729> go<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.940> a

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
about the second the third will go to a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.050 
about the second the third will go to a
coarser<00:02:07.690> sand<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.890> each<00:02:09.220> one<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.610> dips<00:02:09.820> is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
coarser sand and each one of the dips is

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.790 
coarser sand and each one of the dips is
why<00:02:10.209> it's<00:02:10.390> wet<00:02:10.600> we'll<00:02:10.869> put<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.230> over<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
why it's wet we'll put it over to the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.920 
why it's wet we'll put it over to the
San<00:02:12.040> barrels<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.030> then<00:02:13.240> we<00:02:13.330> will<00:02:13.510> spread<00:02:13.750> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
San barrels and then we will spread the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.050 
San barrels and then we will spread the
sand<00:02:14.110> all<00:02:14.350> over<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.709> wet<00:02:14.860> slurry<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:15.910> we'll

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
sand all over the wet slurry then we'll

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.970 
sand all over the wet slurry then we'll
hang<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.330> up<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.570> dry<00:02:16.600> cluster<00:02:17.500> for<00:02:17.680> five<00:02:17.950> hours

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
hang it up to dry cluster for five hours

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.920 
hang it up to dry cluster for five hours
and<00:02:18.489> then<00:02:18.580> we'll<00:02:18.730> dip<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.060> again<00:02:19.330> we<00:02:19.720> usually

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
and then we'll dip it again we usually

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.900 
and then we'll dip it again we usually
keep<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.470> going<00:02:20.680> through<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> day<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
keep that going through the day and the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.610 
keep that going through the day and the
night<00:02:21.940> as<00:02:22.270> long<00:02:22.480> as<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.170> used<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.500> get

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
night as long as we can we used to get

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
night as long as we can we used to get
three<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.190> four<00:02:24.400> dips<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.790> day<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.239> let<00:02:25.420> them

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
three to four dips a day and let them

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.120 
three to four dips a day and let them
dry<00:02:25.690> overnight<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.500> then<00:02:26.590> start<00:02:26.920> up<00:02:27.040> again

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
dry overnight and then start up again

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.190 
dry overnight and then start up again
the<00:02:27.400> next<00:02:27.519> day<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.570> we<00:02:28.690> want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> go<00:02:29.019> between

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the next day and we want to go between

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.530 
the next day and we want to go between
nine<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.650> twelve<00:02:30.130> dips<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:31.000> according<00:02:31.450> to

nine and twelve dips it's according to
what<00:02:31.750> size<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.650> how<00:02:33.310> much<00:02:33.519> hydraulic

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
