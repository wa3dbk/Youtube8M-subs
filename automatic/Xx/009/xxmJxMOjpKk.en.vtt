00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 megan mamute seven years be part of this 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.030
 story 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.060
 is 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:47.130
 thailand is a right shit 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.990
 Ok, I'm almost sure that the neighborhood in 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 which surely must have left this 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 I start in black and white only with my 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.560
 face but anyway 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.420
 the drawing this time is made the game or 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.620
 I had promised that I would 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
 do and this is the drawing he got a lot 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.840
 cool 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.710
 I particularly enjoyed doing 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.990
 that's how it is and has all this issue of them 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.730
 of the deck so I decided to actually do 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:18.180
 a card that I tell you 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.670
 very characteristic and hence I subjected her 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.410
 that they forming others that will be type 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.100
 most rare blood without money without 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.630
 logical nexus but the most interesting was 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.730
 really do and I think it went well 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.560
 cool, I really liked drawing and I liked it 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.990
 very small is very expressive then it is 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.820
 very cool because his house there are 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.650
 less favored of life then 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.080
 nobody buy no problem keep 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:47.910
 We stayed with him for me. 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:50.070
 Ai beats nokia sees the towel but it's serious and 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.530
 he was wonderful and one of my 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.220
 favorites even then you can see him 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:03.390
 This way you can see that way. 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.770
 namesake of zinho because it is a house then 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.540
 there are two sides 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.850
 I had when I went to look for it. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.459
 I saw what kind the card from the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.860
 joker is not always he is twice he 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.550
 it's like a picture of this design knows what 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.600
 do 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:25.800
 in 2006 it's the same thing I always 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.950
 I do is the color she only drew to find 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.540
 him as at first and then I tried 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.380
 with phage watercolor and lots of paint and this 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.269
 the next drawing I will make of 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.370
 There was a guy who asked but there I 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.620
 I thought 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.290
 will give a great drawing and studying 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.909
 here's the singer and it's fantastic then 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.799
 I 'm going to make her 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.709
 you can leave comments that 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.349
 You want the next idea to be me. 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.349
 I'll read and then I'll do 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.269
 as it is prevented and that is it 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.239
 and to buy it is logical that if you 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.780
 want to buy this game is wonderful 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.159

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:17.810
 AndrÃ© remembers the first bought stayed and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.109
