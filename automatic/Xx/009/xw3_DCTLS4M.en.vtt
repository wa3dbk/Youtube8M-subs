into motorsport and we can be quite
flexible<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.870> come<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.370> incredible

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
flexible we can come to incredible

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.940 
flexible we can come to incredible
venues<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:35.880> hockenheim<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.620> build<00:02:37.770> our

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
venues like hockenheim we can build our

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.120 
venues like hockenheim we can build our
circuit<00:02:38.430> within<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.760> stadium<00:02:39.270> there<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:41.040> we

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
circuit within the stadium there and we

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.920 
circuit within the stadium there and we
can<00:02:41.250> deliver<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.640> great<00:02:41.880> show<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.570> think<00:02:42.720> it's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
can deliver a great show so I think it's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.810 
can deliver a great show so I think it's
it's<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.770> great<00:02:43.950> step<00:02:44.220> forward<00:02:46.670> among<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
it's a great step forward among the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.850 
it's a great step forward among the

the<00:02:58.310> pair<00:02:58.580> had<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> busy<00:02:59.240> schedule<00:02:59.300> as<00:03:00.050> they

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
the pair had a busy schedule as they

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.050

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.400 
and the audi sport TT cup over the
weekend<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:07.030> think<00:03:08.030> it's<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.750> tricky<00:03:09.050> part<00:03:09.260> is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
weekend I think it's the tricky part is

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.930 
weekend I think it's the tricky part is
to<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:11.530> reset<00:03:12.530> your<00:03:12.740> brain<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.190> because<00:03:13.820> you

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
to just reset your brain and because you

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.000 
to just reset your brain and because you
have<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.180> think<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.630> two<00:03:14.840> totally<00:03:15.650> different

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
have to think in two totally different

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.570 
have to think in two totally different
ways<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.480> TT<00:03:17.840> cop<00:03:18.050> car<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.250> really<00:03:19.430> be

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
ways so TT cop car you have to really be

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.880 
ways so TT cop car you have to really be
precise<00:03:20.120> over<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.840> long<00:03:21.080> time<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.380> really

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
precise over so a long time and really

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.270 
precise over so a long time and really
push<00:03:22.100> hard<00:03:22.400> for<00:03:22.610> 30<00:03:23.120> minutes<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
push hard for 30 minutes and in the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.100 
push hard for 30 minutes and in the
rallycross<00:03:25.550> you<00:03:25.940> have<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.300> just<00:03:26.570> be<00:03:26.750> able<00:03:26.900> to

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
rallycross you have to just be able to

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.620 
rallycross you have to just be able to
go<00:03:27.320> out<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.470> explode<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:28.760> do<00:03:29.240> four

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
go out and explode and just to do four

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.860 
go out and explode and just to do four
laps<00:03:29.840> which<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.470> absolutely<00:03:30.739> perfectly<00:03:31.870> the

OD s 1 Quattro the tires on a rallycross
car<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:47.060> really<00:03:47.420> soft<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:48.560> would<00:03:48.800> say<00:03:48.980> if

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
car is really soft and I would say if

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.830 
car is really soft and I would say if
you<00:03:49.160> put<00:03:49.370> them<00:03:49.520> on<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> TT<00:03:50.060> Cup<00:03:50.239> car<00:03:50.510> they<00:03:50.660> will

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
you put them on a TT Cup car they will

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.770 
you put them on a TT Cup car they will
be<00:03:51.650> overheated<00:03:52.250> already<00:03:52.640> after<00:03:53.209> one<00:03:53.540> lap

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
be overheated already after one lap

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.470 
be overheated already after one lap
probably<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:54.500> that's<00:03:55.459> just<00:03:55.790> because<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
probably and that's just because the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.210 
probably and that's just because the
tracks<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.900> really<00:03:57.260> short<00:03:57.470> in<00:03:57.650> rallycross<00:03:57.950> you

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
tracks is really short in rallycross you

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.830 
tracks is really short in rallycross you
have<00:03:58.340> four<00:03:58.610> laps<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.270> have<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.570> be<00:03:59.690> on

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
have four laps and you have to be on

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.750 
have four laps and you have to be on
pace<00:04:00.080> from<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.470> first<00:04:00.739> corner<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:01.610> they're

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
pace from the first corner so they're

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.640 
pace from the first corner so they're
really<00:04:02.090> soft<00:04:02.299> to<00:04:02.510> get<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.750> temperature<00:04:02.930> up<00:04:03.320> so

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
really soft to get the temperature up so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.520 
really soft to get the temperature up so
we<00:04:03.769> have<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.010> grid<00:04:04.600> immediately<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:06.080> cockpit

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
we have the grid immediately the cockpit

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.810 
we have the grid immediately the cockpit
is<00:04:06.860> quite<00:04:07.220> different<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.910> have<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:09.140> handbrake<00:04:10.070> to

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
is quite different I have a handbrake to

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.610 
is quite different I have a handbrake to
get<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.150> car<00:04:11.360> around<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:12.170> here's<00:04:12.410> the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
get the car around so here's the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.800 
get the car around so here's the
handbrake<00:04:13.040> in<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.880> hair<00:04:14.090> pins<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.450> need<00:04:14.630> to

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
handbrake in the hair pins you need to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.539 
handbrake in the hair pins you need to
use<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:14.989> handbrake<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.650> get<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.890> rotation<00:04:16.459> of

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
use the handbrake to get the rotation of

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.490 
use the handbrake to get the rotation of
the<00:04:16.580> car<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.299> we<00:04:17.450> don't<00:04:17.570> have<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.989> TT<00:04:18.320> cup

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
the car that we don't have in a TT cup

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.370 
the car that we don't have in a TT cup
car<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.280> this<00:04:19.459> is<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.669> exhaust<00:04:20.600> system<00:04:20.989> which

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
car so this is the exhaust system which

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.370 
car so this is the exhaust system which
is<00:04:21.620> fitting<00:04:22.100> fire<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.870> doing<00:04:23.870> those<00:04:24.020> loud

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
is fitting fire and doing those loud

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.250 
is fitting fire and doing those loud
Bam's<00:04:24.830> when<00:04:25.490> we<00:04:25.610> use<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.790> ALS<00:04:26.390> system<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.050> a
