00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.829
 but 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.829
 osn 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.449
 a 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.269
 4 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.499
 I'd say it myself 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.310
 where are the buses 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.390
 That is not just a trade show that is the new Fiat Doblo 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.919
 and if necessary and so on 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.399
 real looking for space 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.399
 most women on the road 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.570
 save 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.350
 horst 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.010
 the goal is to make a lot wiser than they already knew how to make it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.480
 especially high you can never answer more than I can not only watch 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.420
 And moreover, those have woken up his customers almost completely 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.010
 a large square box on the inside of a home 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.110
 thereby space 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.870
 then you also watch something 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.330
 so those dolores also feature beautiful beautiful modern headlights and a 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.820
 very big role in a new logo 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.270
 but keep an eye on the courage 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.050
 is doing 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 it doesn't 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 8 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.810
 the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.000
 what you say he what about two sliding doors 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.650
 that is still easy 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.840
 it is you have been so very happy with it 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.890
 that I as adults 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.680
 also here in the back 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 continue great 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.650
 of course I prefer to be here 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.310
 but what strikes me when you're behind the wheel 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.600
 9 finally just in the modern passenger car of course this is a role 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.379
 actually developed as a company car as a club there are only delivery vans 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.190
 then you do not notice anything of you have no idea at all 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.649
 the yellow sweater would pick up on in other countries 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:17.650
 there is more 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.650
 but have been spending more and more time in public spaces for this 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.339
 a 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.339
 of the death of a loved one 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.109
 announced on Thursday 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.569
 this doblò almost 800 liters of luggage space 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.150
 want you better 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.810
 that's the we want from hearts normally in one 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.810
 community center work 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.639
 the 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.959
 in other words all over the world for a few days 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.349
 about a temporary living space 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.730
 m and partly over for because I have to say he swears very fine I'm sitting here 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.869
 sent are often hardly anything to complain about 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.579
 only objection 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.999
 and in particular land did this copy 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.629
 and that it is provided 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.319
 of the only gasoline engine in the series that claims another gasoline engine and the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.709
 car that weighs fourteen 100 kilos 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.019
 and wherever you go with a number of proposals and be in which 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.119
 on the road is actually just too little 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:37.149
 there are already three stronger engines and there will also be a strong gasoline engine 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.239
 then the absolute bubbles would wait this it is really empty 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.149
 if a car really needs a lot of space and then more than for example in the 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.549
 middle class the idea 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.629
 because he 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.430
 a children's bike rbs has a cool box and public transport because animals are going 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.180
 make every weekend at the flea market and what the fiat doblò has to offer 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.059
 become an excellent car 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:15.019
 if it is economical and responsible, then it is one of the changes 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.889
 Wait until a stronger demand for gas has been nice
