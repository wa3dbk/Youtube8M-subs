this is dotted dotted quarter name
equals<00:00:18.779> 60

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.430 

so<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.059> first<00:01:05.269> thing<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:05.509> do<00:01:05.720> in<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.170> piece

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
so the first thing to do in this piece

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.980 
so the first thing to do in this piece
is<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:06.830> we<00:01:06.890> want<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.280> make<00:01:07.430> sure<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.990> when

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
is that we want to make sure that when

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.080 
is that we want to make sure that when
we<00:01:09.110> counted<00:01:09.619> or<00:01:09.920> counting<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.790> an<00:01:10.909> eighth

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
we counted or counting it that an eighth

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.999 
we counted or counting it that an eighth
note<00:01:11.330> gets<00:01:11.360> a<00:01:11.630> beat<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.020> practicing<00:01:12.649> it

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
note gets a beat so practicing it

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.889 
note gets a beat so practicing it
I<00:01:13.040> would<00:01:13.460> suggest<00:01:13.640> practicing<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.690> pretty

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
I would suggest practicing it pretty

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.020 
I would suggest practicing it pretty
slowly<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.259> have<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.619> metronome<00:01:19.070> now<00:01:19.220> on

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
slowly so I have the metronome now on

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.510 
slowly so I have the metronome now on
about<00:01:20.330> 80<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:20.810> by<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.320> way<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.710> suggest<00:01:21.920> using

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
about 80 and by the way I suggest using

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.280 
about 80 and by the way I suggest using
a<00:01:22.700> metronome<00:01:23.000> always<00:01:23.479> have<00:01:23.659> a<00:01:23.690> metronome<00:01:24.049> on

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
a metronome always have a metronome on

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.380 
a metronome always have a metronome on
when<00:01:24.770> you're<00:01:24.890> practicing<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:25.610> then<00:01:25.729> go<00:01:26.270> away

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
when you're practicing and then go away

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.450 
when you're practicing and then go away
from<00:01:26.690> it<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> lot<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.619> practicing<00:01:28.250> with

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
from it but do a lot of practicing with

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.020 
from it but do a lot of practicing with
a<00:01:28.759> steady<00:01:29.060> pulse<00:01:30.009> so<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.130> first<00:01:31.369> couple<00:01:31.880> of

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
a steady pulse so the first couple of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:47.130 
a steady pulse so the first couple of
bars<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.509> I've<00:01:32.630> count<00:01:33.070> 1<00:01:34.070> &amp;<00:01:34.340> 2<00:01:34.670> &amp;<00:01:35.030> 3<00:01:35.289> 1<00:01:36.289> &amp;<00:01:36.560> 2

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.710 

okay<00:01:48.140> it's<00:01:48.319> Sarah<00:01:49.060> let's<00:01:50.060> talk<00:01:50.300> about<00:01:50.420> some

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
okay it's Sarah let's talk about some

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.800 
okay it's Sarah let's talk about some
fingerings<00:01:51.970> 1<00:01:52.970> 2<00:01:53.240> 3<00:01:53.509> 4<00:01:53.929> v<00:01:54.830> bar<00:01:55.190> we<00:01:56.149> have<00:01:56.330> some<00:01:56.599> 8

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
fingerings 1 2 3 4 v bar we have some 8

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.490 
fingerings 1 2 3 4 v bar we have some 8
sharps<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:58.369> what<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.060> do<00:01:59.239> is<00:01:59.720> coming<00:02:00.380> into

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
sharps and so what I do is coming into

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.249 
sharps and so what I do is coming into
that<00:02:00.709> G<00:02:00.979> into<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.789> v<00:02:02.000> bar<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.509> G<00:02:02.810> sharp<00:02:02.840> and

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
that G into the v bar the G sharp and

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.589 
that G into the v bar the G sharp and
the<00:02:03.319> be<00:02:03.470> like<00:02:03.739> this<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.220> use<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.729> side<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.149> sharp

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
the be like this I use a side a sharp

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.499 
the be like this I use a side a sharp
like<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.770> there<00:02:06.979> are<00:02:07.069> 3<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.399> sharps<00:02:08.270> or<00:02:08.390> B

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
like this so there are 3 a sharps or B

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.540 
like this so there are 3 a sharps or B
flats<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.959> saxophone<00:02:09.349> this<00:02:09.530> one<00:02:09.739> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
flats in the saxophone this one the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.839 
flats in the saxophone this one the
Biscay<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.239> this<00:02:11.510> where<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:12.349> B<00:02:13.010> key<00:02:13.280> and

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
Biscay like this where I have B key and

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.119 
Biscay like this where I have B key and
this<00:02:14.450> little<00:02:14.780> circular<00:02:15.440> key<00:02:15.800> here<00:02:16.099> that

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
this little circular key here that

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.270 
this little circular key here that
Biscay<00:02:16.840> covered<00:02:17.840> with<00:02:17.959> first<00:02:18.200> finger<00:02:18.530> or<00:02:18.860> 1

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
Biscay covered with first finger or 1

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.860 
Biscay covered with first finger or 1
and<00:02:19.430> 1<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.030> side<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:22.120> or<00:02:23.120> 1<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.660> 1

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and 1 so the side like that is or 1 in 1

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.460 
and 1 so the side like that is or 1 in 1
so<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.680> case<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.190> go<00:02:25.520> first<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.780> side<00:02:27.440> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
so in this case I go first to the side a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.100 
so in this case I go first to the side a
sharp<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.580> my<00:02:28.819> F<00:02:29.060> double<00:02:29.510> sharp<00:02:29.780> which<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:29.989> a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
sharp then my F double sharp which is a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.089 
sharp then my F double sharp which is a
G<00:02:30.440> okay<00:02:30.790> D<00:02:31.790> sharp<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.360> then<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.260> come<00:02:33.530> back<00:02:33.739> up

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
G okay D sharp and then I come back up

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.890 
G okay D sharp and then I come back up
don't<00:02:34.489> forget<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:35.000> accidentals<00:02:35.629> carry

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
don't forget that the accidentals carry

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.080 
don't forget that the accidentals carry
through<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.230> bar<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.830> F<00:02:37.069> double<00:02:37.790> sharp

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
through the bar so that F double sharp

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.390 
through the bar so that F double sharp
is<00:02:38.300> still<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.569> G<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.110> bar<00:02:39.290> v<00:02:39.650> bar<00:02:39.890> now<00:02:40.069> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
is still a G in that bar v bar now and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.479 
is still a G in that bar v bar now and
then<00:02:40.940> back<00:02:41.269> up<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.599> my<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> sharp<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.010> again<00:02:43.280> that

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
then back up to my a sharp so again that

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.250 
then back up to my a sharp so again that
carries<00:02:43.849> through<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> bar<00:02:44.330> but<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.140> I'm

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
carries through the bar but now I'm

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.050 
carries through the bar but now I'm
going<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.560> use<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.680> Biscay<00:02:46.190> so

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.090 

so<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.090> switched<00:02:53.600> over<00:02:53.900> from<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.470> side<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.710> shock

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
so I switched over from the side a shock

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.140 
so I switched over from the side a shock
to<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.640> Biscay<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:57.620> bar<00:02:57.800> after<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.400> we<00:02:58.940> have

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
to the Biscay the bar after that we have

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.720 
to the Biscay the bar after that we have
G<00:02:59.420> sharp<00:02:59.690> e<00:02:59.959> sharp<00:03:00.230> which<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.160> same<00:03:01.370> as<00:03:01.520> F

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
G sharp e sharp which is the same as F

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
more dots and I'd like to kind of keep

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.360 
more dots and I'd like to kind of keep
that<00:03:56.810> moving<00:03:57.530> forward<00:03:58.040> rather<00:03:58.190> than

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that moving forward rather than

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.729 
that moving forward rather than
shortening<00:03:59.269> those<00:03:59.390> DS<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.110> that<00:04:00.260> we<00:04:00.350> feel<00:04:00.530> like

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
shortening those DS so that we feel like

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:08.140 
shortening those DS so that we feel like
there's<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.010> line<00:04:01.220> moving<00:04:01.519> forward<00:04:02.030> okay<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
there's a line moving forward okay and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.949 
there's a line moving forward okay and
then<00:04:09.579> at<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.730> end<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.180> line<00:04:11.360> we<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.720> v

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
then at the end of that line we have a v

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:22.920 
then at the end of that line we have a v
sharp

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.350 

and<00:04:23.199> so<00:04:23.560> I'd<00:04:24.009> like<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.250> put<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:24.850> little<00:04:25.060> too<00:04:25.240> new

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
and so I'd like to put a little too new

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.640 
and so I'd like to put a little too new
too<00:04:25.509> over<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.750> beginning<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.169> each<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.530> those

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
too over the beginning of each of those

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.700 
too over the beginning of each of those
bars<00:04:26.919> because<00:04:27.250> we're<00:04:27.460> going<00:04:27.699> around<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:28.710> cycle

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
bars because we're going around a cycle

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.379 
bars because we're going around a cycle
of<00:04:29.919> fifths<00:04:30.100> there<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.639> we<00:04:30.759> want<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.000> have<00:04:31.120> a

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
of fifths there and we want to have a

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.620 
of fifths there and we want to have a
nice<00:04:31.780> little<00:04:32.520> feeling<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.669> we<00:04:33.789> know<00:04:34.030> we're

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
nice little feeling that we know we're

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.760 
nice little feeling that we know we're
expressing<00:04:34.870> what<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.259> Harmony<00:04:35.650> is

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
expressing what the Harmony is

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:49.230 
expressing what the Harmony is
underlying<00:04:47.550> now<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.699> was<00:04:48.820> kind<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.060> out<00:04:49.210> of

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
underlying now that was kind of out of

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.730 
underlying now that was kind of out of
tempo<00:04:49.660> just<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:50.139> give<00:04:50.259> you<00:04:50.350> a<00:04:50.410> really

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
tempo just to give you a really

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.650 
tempo just to give you a really
exaggerated<00:04:51.370> idea<00:04:51.580> but<00:04:52.240> really<00:04:52.270> in

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
exaggerated idea but really in

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.390 
exaggerated idea but really in
performance<00:04:53.440> what<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.650> might<00:04:53.889> do<00:04:54.009> is<00:04:54.130> something

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
performance what I might do is something

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:10.610 
performance what I might do is something
a<00:04:54.430> little<00:04:54.639> more<00:04:54.729> subtle

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.379 

let's<00:05:11.620> talk<00:05:11.770> about<00:05:11.889> those<00:05:12.099> C<00:05:12.340> sharps<00:05:12.699> so<00:05:12.879> now

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
let's talk about those C sharps so now

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.869 
let's talk about those C sharps so now
they<00:05:13.569> want<00:05:13.750> us<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.960> come<00:05:14.139> down<00:05:14.169> and<00:05:14.879> probably

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 
they want us to come down and probably

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.279 
they want us to come down and probably
the<00:05:18.090> when<00:05:19.090> you're<00:05:19.210> going<00:05:19.389> from<00:05:19.629> A<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.870> C<00:05:20.110> sharp

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
the when you're going from A to C sharp

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.249 
the when you're going from A to C sharp
if<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:21.129> play<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.400> low<00:05:21.819> note<00:05:22.300> like<00:05:22.479> a<00:05:22.539> C<00:05:22.780> sharp<00:05:22.810> a

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
if you play a low note like a C sharp a

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.760 
if you play a low note like a C sharp a
C<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.710> B<00:05:23.979> or<00:05:24.340> B<00:05:24.550> flat<00:05:24.729> if<00:05:25.120> you<00:05:25.479> pop<00:05:25.810> this<00:05:26.110> F<00:05:26.379> key<00:05:26.620> at

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
C a B or B flat if you pop this F key at

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.200 
C a B or B flat if you pop this F key at
the<00:05:26.889> same<00:05:26.919> time<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:27.729> you're<00:05:27.849> blowing<00:05:28.180> your

the same time that you're blowing your

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
air you're going to get the note to

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.700

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
the same moment popping my F key so if

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.959 
the same moment popping my F key so if
we<00:05:40.569> were<00:05:40.690> to<00:05:40.870> hit<00:05:41.409> our<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.740> there<00:05:42.039> and<00:05:42.250> then<00:05:42.610> pop

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
we were to hit our a there and then pop
