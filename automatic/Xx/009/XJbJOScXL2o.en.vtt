00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
it's massively chromatic it's very

it's massively chromatic it's very
complicated<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.480> all<00:03:36.720> over<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.200> place<00:03:37.410> it's

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920

not<00:03:38.160> easy<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.670> keep<00:03:39.660> up<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:39.930> it's<00:03:40.080> doing<00:03:40.320> so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
not easy to keep up what it's doing so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.140 
not easy to keep up what it's doing so
good<00:03:41.100> at<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:41.700> when<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.880> comes<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
good at that but when it comes to the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.490 
good at that but when it comes to the
big<00:03:42.269> two<00:03:42.480> knees<00:03:42.660> right<00:03:42.900> on<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.110> money<00:03:43.200> with<00:03:43.320> it

you<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:44.310> i<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.360> tried<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:45.720> my<00:03:45.780> own

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
you know so I i have tried on my own

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.819 
you know so I i have tried on my own
small<00:03:46.019> way<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:47.959> do<00:03:48.959> something<00:03:49.410> like<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.590> and

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
small way to do something like that and

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:50.840 
small way to do something like that and
i'd<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.100> think<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.519> sounds<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> bit

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
i'd like to think that it sounds a bit

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.100 
i'd like to think that it sounds a bit
different<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.150> other<00:03:51.239> people's<00:03:51.510> games<00:03:51.660> I've

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
different to other people's games I've

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.509 
different to other people's games I've
tried<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.530> be<00:03:52.620> different<00:03:52.799> without<00:03:52.920> go<00:03:53.220> it's

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
tried to be different without go it's

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.910 
tried to be different without go it's
very<00:03:53.760> dark<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.900> there's<00:03:55.079> lots<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.350> big

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
very dark that there's lots of big

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.620 
very dark that there's lots of big
sequences<00:03:56.370> are<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.700> complete<00:03:57.030> minor<00:03:57.329> chord

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
sequences are just complete minor chord

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.850

after minor chords to minor chord

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.759 
after minor chords to minor chord
doesn't<00:03:59.280> change<00:03:59.489> there's<00:03:59.730> very<00:03:59.910> little<00:04:00.769> major

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
doesn't change there's very little major

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.170 
doesn't change there's very little major

it's<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:05.970> major<00:04:06.180> chord<00:04:06.510> strung<00:04:06.780> together

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
it's just major chord strung together

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.319 
it's just major chord strung together
major<00:04:07.350> triads<00:04:07.739> or<00:04:07.829> that's<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:09.150> make<00:04:09.299> it

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
major triads or that's just to make it

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.960 
major triads or that's just to make it
sound<00:04:09.600> different

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:38.940 

you

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.320 

alright<00:04:39.950> music<00:04:40.040> like<00:04:40.400> very<00:04:40.760> sort<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.120> like

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
alright music like very sort of like

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.150 
alright music like very sort of like
that<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.900> then<00:04:42.140> like<00:04:42.320> that<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.680> don't<00:04:42.890> go<00:04:43.010> like

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
that and then like that I don't go like

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.440 
that and then like that I don't go like
a<00:04:43.220> long<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.670> sketch<00:04:43.850> it<00:04:44.030> out<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.210> then<00:04:44.240> fill

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
a long and sketch it out and then fill

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.120 
a long and sketch it out and then fill
it<00:04:44.540> in<00:04:44.660> I'm<00:04:44.840> kind<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.170> very<00:04:45.380> like<00:04:45.590> this<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:45.950> four

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
it in I'm kind of very like this is four

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.800 
it in I'm kind of very like this is four
bars<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.640> that's<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:47.300> complete<00:04:47.660> that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
bars and that's and then complete that

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.420 
bars and that's and then complete that
full<00:04:48.020> bars<00:04:48.200> in<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.440> next<00:04:48.680> four<00:04:48.860> bars<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.310> I

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
full bars in the next four bars and I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.500 
full bars in the next four bars and I
think<00:04:49.670> that's<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:49.880> right<00:04:50.030> way<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.210> want<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.390> do

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
think that's the right way I want to do

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.210 
think that's the right way I want to do
it<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:51.050> might<00:04:51.080> be<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.320> don't<00:04:51.560> know<00:04:51.740> every

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
it it might be I don't know every

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.500 
it it might be I don't know every

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
terrible I played a noxious from the age

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.830 
terrible I played a noxious from the age
of<00:04:57.290> 11<00:04:58.220> on<00:04:58.460> trumpet<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.180> do<00:04:59.270> know<00:04:59.510> how<00:04:59.720> this

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
of 11 on trumpet so I do know how this

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.090 
of 11 on trumpet so I do know how this
sounds<00:04:59.990> that's<00:05:00.200> why<00:05:00.350> i<00:05:00.380> think<00:05:00.620> when<00:05:00.740> i<00:05:00.770> came<00:05:00.980> to

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
sounds that's why i think when i came to

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.200 
sounds that's why i think when i came to
write<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.400> coast<00:05:01.670> road<00:05:01.790> you<00:05:01.910> find<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.150> very

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
write for coast road you find it very

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.850 
write for coast road you find it very
difficult<00:05:02.360> but<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.230> never<00:05:03.440> get<00:05:03.560> used<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.770> that

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
difficult but you never get used to that

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.250 
difficult but you never get used to that
kind<00:05:03.980> of<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.750> wealth<00:05:05.930> of<00:05:06.110> it

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
kind of just that the wealth of it

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.720 
kind of just that the wealth of it
sounds<00:05:06.740> so<00:05:06.950> it's<00:05:07.310> such<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.490> different

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730
