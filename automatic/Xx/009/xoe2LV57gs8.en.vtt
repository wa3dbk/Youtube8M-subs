00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.630
 let's work a small course for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.889
 that we start with a 4 chain arito 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.560
 we raise 123 and we make 2 points 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.030
 whole 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:23.990
 1 and 2 in total we have 3 integers 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.450
 a chain today we are going to make 3 integers 1 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.980
 two 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.809
 and 3 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.410
 we make 123 chains and again 3 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.160
 whole 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.090
 one 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.840
 two 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.720
 and 3 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.980
 a chain and finally we do 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.480
 again 3 integers 1 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.910
 2 and 3 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.690
 to close let's make a chain and 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.059
 a whole point where our 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.850
 perfect whole first and we already saw the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.089
 scope ok the second single row 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.700
 we raise three chains equal and we do 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.520
 three integers joining the first 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.070
 chains in the space of the chain 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.330
 a separation chain we leave the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.720
 first and we do 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.020
 an integer in the second whole other in 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.530
 the third and an integer in the space of 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.490
 the chain 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.159
 okay 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.680
 a separation chain and we go back to 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.610
 start in the space of the chain one 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.760
 and one more in the two integers that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:44.700
 continuous we have three again 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.299
 a chain and here we do 1 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.299
 two 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.810
 one two three chains and we make one 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.710
 two 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.340
 and three in the same space 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.530
 a chain we will leave the first 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.460
 unused and we start from 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.290
 second 1 2 and whole in space 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.860
 a chain 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.860
 one 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.980
 two 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.080
 and the third avant the second whole 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.200
 chain and we do 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.670
 one 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.830
 two 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.520
 and we close with 123 chains we make a 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.370
 passed where we finished the first whole 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.870
 and we closed there while this was a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.959
 small 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.959
 simple enjoy weaving
