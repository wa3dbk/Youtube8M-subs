00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.589

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.229
 none of them can delude themselves that he would have left me those are 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.109
 really so 3 days before the Japanese took your grandfather's island 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.029
 he asked an artilleryman assigned to the military direction of nominees 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.329
 I've never seen him before in his life 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.729

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.499
 at the end of the war. to visit your grandmother 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.959
 to deliver your dad's gold watch to your father 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.699
 this approach 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.669
 I still had your father on his wrist when he was knocked over 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.639
 he was captured by the messenger in a Vietnamese prison camp 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.669
 he knew that they had seen them watch that they would confiscate him 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.159
 taken away 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.749
 as your father saw it, this clock was a law 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.849
 that he was damned if that yellow snout put his possessions on 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.569
 son so the pineapple cost 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.519
 in the only place where I knew I could sit for 5 long years 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.519
 held the seat in his ass 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.939
 he died of dysentery he gave me their kiss 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.939
 I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal in the bottom opening 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.350
 finally I was sent home by my family 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.650
