this<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.449> we'll<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.870> Qualcomm<00:00:55.289> Snapdragon

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this time we'll have Qualcomm Snapdragon

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.650 
this time we'll have Qualcomm Snapdragon
chips<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.890> others<00:00:58.890> who<00:00:59.100> had<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> 2<00:00:59.940> matchup<00:01:00.180> as

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
chips so others who had the 2 matchup as

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.369 
chips so others who had the 2 matchup as
you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.260> obviously<00:01:01.590> size-wise<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
you can see obviously size-wise the

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.000 
you can see obviously size-wise the
galaxy<00:01:04.379> s2<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:06.860> sensation<00:01:07.860> there

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
galaxy s2 and the sensation there

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
galaxy s2 and the sensation there
roughly<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> same<00:01:09.000> length<00:01:09.360> actually<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.320> think

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
roughly the same length actually I think

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630 
roughly the same length actually I think
in<00:01:10.560> terms<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:12.409> exact<00:01:13.409> length<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
in terms of exact length the the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.010 
in terms of exact length the the
sensation<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.420> supposed<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.720> ever

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
sensation actually supposed to be ever

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
sensation actually supposed to be ever
so<00:01:16.290> slightly<00:01:16.530> longer<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
so slightly longer but because of the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
so slightly longer but because of the
tapered<00:01:18.240> edges<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.320> we're<00:01:19.439> on

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
tapered edges as you can see we're on

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.399 
tapered edges as you can see we're on
this<00:01:19.710> blunt<00:01:20.250> edges<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> Samsung<00:01:21.659> does

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
this blunt edges of the Samsung does

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.370 
this blunt edges of the Samsung does
actually<00:01:22.530> look<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.400> shorter<00:01:24.380> it's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
actually look like it's shorter it's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.510 
actually look like it's shorter it's
slightly<00:01:26.070> narrower<00:01:26.549> again<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.840> short<00:01:28.520> curved

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
slightly narrower again the short curved

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.929 
slightly narrower again the short curved
edges<00:01:29.880> help<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.619> thicker<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
edges help on that but it is thicker the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
edges help on that but it is thicker the
galaxy<00:01:33.420> s2<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> thinnest

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.219 
galaxy s2 is one of the thinnest
handsets<00:01:35.850> around<00:01:36.060> at<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.210> moment<00:01:36.240> 8.4<00:01:37.020> nine

handsets around at the moment 8.4 nine
millimeters<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.540> sensation<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.600> about

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
millimeters and the sensation is about

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.039 
millimeters and the sensation is about
11<00:01:40.920> millimeters<00:01:41.430> thick<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.869> are

11 millimeters thick so you know you are

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
11 millimeters thick so you know you are
