 be you is to download the file rar

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070
 you give click the green button and a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.890
 Once downloaded, the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.460
 next rap point file 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.740
 what will it be this that is here as they see very 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.590
 well the next thing we have to do 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.170
 is to right click and extract here 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.829
 and we hope that the process of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.369
 extraction finish as you see here 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.380
 appears at a speed and is not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.659
 necessary that the video pause as it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.870
 quickly extracted very well we can already 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.300
 delete this rar file 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.090
 if you like and will show us the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.890
 following elements now is what 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.140
 we have to do the following 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.950
 we have to do is go open 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.200
 simply the exe file that is the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.500
 application as you see has the image of 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.790
 crash bandicoot 3 then what 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 we have to do is give it right click 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.530
 run as administrator or from a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 double click we open 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.780
 we wait for the game to load 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.229
 eye this is very important if you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.600
 this error appears by chance 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.440
 it's simply because they lack the 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.200
 file point l l ok I'll leave them at 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.300
 the description sorry in the description 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.380
 I will leave this file to download 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.690
 then we give it where it says accept and 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.340
 we download the file that are in the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.340
 next in the following link 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.579
 attention that the second link will be this

 next thing we have to do is give it 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.250
 click to download this file only 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.500
 will weigh 2.19 megs 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.220
 then weighed nothing this if I'm going to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.400
 give download since this one I do not have the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.689
 file recently in a folder 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.639
 then we wait for it to 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.190
 Download as you see it does not take nothing 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.290
 discharge 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.380

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.440
 right and copy and we're going to go to the 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.010
 next address which is what kind 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.950
 disco localize 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.709

 the windows folder if it is the folder 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.620
 windows and let's go to the folder that 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.379
 it's called system 32 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.560
 here we are going to paste the file point of l 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.890
 l 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.739
 in a part where you let us copy it to 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.860
 see I will maximize and we will give 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.570
 paste very well once stuck 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.450
 the point file dl we can already open what 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.440
 what is the game going on then 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.570
 to open it by double clicking 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.320
 we wait for the application to load and 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.410
 correctly 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.240
 [Music] 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.620
 and as you can see, the 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.459
 window 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.480
 ok I'm going to change the volume so that 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.740
 be a little more 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.590
 as very well 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.609
 As you can see, the game will appear 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.840
 you can maximize it but this way they 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.840
 will appear by default 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.730
 as you can see 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.770
 is the crash bandicoot game number 3 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.880
 in its third version 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.880
 [Music] 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.870
 very well what is it that I am going to teach you 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.120
 I'm going to show you what is next 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.850
 configuration of the emulator since this 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.430
 game comes exactly integrated with the 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.320
 emulator two in one then let's 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.170
 go files file tab and here 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.220
 we will give you where it says configuration 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.520
 Here we will see the following 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.470
 window that is the controls menu or 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.810
 sound graphics memory cards 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.800
 etcetera but what matters most to us 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.810
 we are the control option here 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.460
 we click here and here we can change the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.690
 controls or in this case I'm going to put the 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.680
 controls that are by default in my 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:21.259
 keyboard to see that so 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.259
 very well I will apply accept 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.819
 very good as you see 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.819
 this is the start of the game 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.320
 and we're going to start a game just for 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.850
 check that the game is good 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.850
 let's remove this 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:49.210
 and we're just going to see how it is 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.160
 perfect as you can see, it runs well and if you see 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.289
 some slowness is because I'm recording 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.330
 with him he sings if I study but everything goes 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.729
 perfect they 're going to start from the 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.650
 beginning 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.650
 what is the world number one 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.699
 then this is the world number one 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.949
 very well attention that before 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.270
 start this part let's go where 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.969
 wish 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.219
 know how the game is saved then 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.009
 let's give a click where it says 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.069
 set up sorry where it says to load 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.900
 state and save state but in the 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.240
 first option where we will give if 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.580
 you want to keep heading is where 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.520
 says save state we give save state 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:37.110
 and we put the name we want to 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:41.370
 our save me in this case karen 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:44.660
 in my case it will be an old ps x state 6 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.670
 what will be the file that will be saved 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:53.169
 our departure we save 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:56.050
 and whenever we want this 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.699
 every time we want again 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.069
 will charge to the starting point that 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.740
 we were we give the file and load 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:05.370
 state let's find the file that 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.350
 we keep this psv load here 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:11.590
 [Music] 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:14.560
 and how they see exactly I get to the point 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.520
 that I saved as you see the file ps x 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.740
 that you keep on the desk here is 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.220
 and so they will keep every time 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:26.840
 advance very well 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:30.980
 You see this is the game runs well is 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:33.710
 for PC as much as for 64 bits 32 bits 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.940
 so I hope you liked the 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.860
