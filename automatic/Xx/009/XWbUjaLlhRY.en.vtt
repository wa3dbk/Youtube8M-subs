separated public and private but they

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.930 
separated public and private but they
use<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.480> landscaper<00:00:42.930> used<00:00:43.489> different<00:00:44.489> plants

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
use the landscaper used different plants

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.440 
use the landscaper used different plants
to<00:00:45.149> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.930> buffer<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.410> wall<00:00:46.620> yeah<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:48.329> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
to kind of buffer that wall yeah what we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
to kind of buffer that wall yeah what we
have<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.079> number<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.340> different

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
grasses this one right here is is little

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.139 
grasses this one right here is is little
bluestem<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> native<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.399> us<00:00:56.550> here

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
bluestem and it's a native for us here

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
bluestem and it's a native for us here
in<00:00:57.180> Minnesota<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.559> quite<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> few<00:00:58.980> native

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
in Minnesota we have quite a few native

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.330 
in Minnesota we have quite a few native
plants<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.239> native<00:01:00.570> type<00:01:00.780> species<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.739> reason

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
plants or native type species the reason

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
plants or native type species the reason
why<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.609> tried<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> lot<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> native

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
why we tried to use a lot of the native

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.260 
why we tried to use a lot of the native
plants<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.860> generally<00:01:05.519> their<00:01:05.820> appearance

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
plants is is generally their appearance

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.020 
plants is is generally their appearance
is<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.250> more<00:01:08.250> loose<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.820> really

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
is a little bit more loose you really

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
is a little bit more loose you really
just<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> let<00:01:09.570> him<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.770> one

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
just kind of let him go and that was one

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.350 
just kind of let him go and that was one
of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> important<00:01:11.490> things<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.909> Nick<00:01:12.119> was

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
of the important things for Nick was

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
of the important things for Nick was
just<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> was<00:01:12.990> minimal<00:01:13.409> maintenance<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
just that it was minimal maintenance and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.429 
just that it was minimal maintenance and
there<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> whole<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.900> work<00:01:16.140> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
there was not a whole lot of work with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
there was not a whole lot of work with
dealing<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> shrubs<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.240> broadleaf

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
dealing with the shrubs the broadleaf

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.020 
dealing with the shrubs the broadleaf
rhododendrons<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.950> real<00:01:20.159> nice<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
rhododendrons are real nice because you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
rhododendrons are real nice because you
know<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> has<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.659> real<00:01:22.380> coarse<00:01:22.979> texture

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
know it has this real coarse texture

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
know it has this real coarse texture
really<00:01:24.060> Hardy<00:01:24.479> yeah<00:01:24.810> which<00:01:25.080> should<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> nice

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
really Hardy yeah which should be a nice

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.789 
really Hardy yeah which should be a nice
contrast<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.970> light<00:01:27.150> blue<00:01:27.799> texture

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
contrast to the the light blue texture

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.280 
contrast to the the light blue texture
of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> fescues<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
of the of the fescues this was kind of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870 
of the of the fescues this was kind of
an<00:01:31.409> interesting<00:01:31.619> lot<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.369> started<00:01:32.759> out

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
an interesting lot when we started out

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
an interesting lot when we started out
due<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> fact<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.860> along<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:35.100> whole

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
due to the fact that along one whole

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
due to the fact that along one whole
side<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.670> property<00:01:36.329> actually<00:01:36.869> along<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> back

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
side of property actually along the back

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.039 
side of property actually along the back
side<00:01:37.650> too<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> lot<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.700> buckthorn<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.450> we

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
side too is a lot of buckthorn and we

really<00:02:13.340> does<00:02:13.489> they<00:02:13.700> complement<00:02:14.209> one<00:02:14.330> another

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
really does they complement one another

really does they complement one another
i<00:02:14.599> think<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.470> know<00:02:15.500> there's<00:02:15.830> not<00:02:16.099> really<00:02:16.580> a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
i think you know there's not really a

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.670 
i think you know there's not really a
lot<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.739> grass<00:02:18.739> sod<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:20.480> mow<00:02:20.720> there<00:02:21.440> will<00:02:21.650> be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
lot of grass sod to mow there will be

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.660 
lot of grass sod to mow there will be
some<00:02:22.129> but<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.200> percentage<00:02:24.680> basis<00:02:25.400> it's

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
some but on a percentage basis it's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.320 
some but on a percentage basis it's
pretty<00:02:25.940> low<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:27.220> indeed<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.489> is<00:02:28.519> kind<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> low

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
pretty low so indeed it is kind of a low

pretty low so indeed it is kind of a low
maintenance<00:02:29.799> landscape<00:02:30.799> I'd<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.420> lot<00:02:32.420> of
