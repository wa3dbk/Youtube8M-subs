 It's not your chance for two 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.090
 there are many times that you send messages of 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.920
 symphony how can I grow as can 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.840
 let me know but doing spam such 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.509
 which spam you never do that are 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.829
 very bad but good thing is that this 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.960
 is one of your opportunity to vouchers 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.640

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.679
 participate that room that will be a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.360
 kind of place where you enter this is

 of time and people can open and in 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.810
 direct apart from that then it will be formed 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.789
 a video that software will explain it a 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.429
 little bit later the thing is that if 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.929
 you have more than a thousand subscribers you can 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.909
 participate by sending a video of a 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.890
 maximum of five minutes doing what 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.060
 usually does that be a if I played 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.950
 with the kind of a gameplay with the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.990
 tickets of maximum five minutes assembly 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.610
 while you are speaking, you are heard 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.619
 well or know a trolley or a gameplay of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.299
 minecraft that lasts more than 50 things and 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.159
 the things that do not have to be trailer 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.530
 ok because I explain this video you have 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.610
 than doing it also using the material 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.500
 that you have on the web that comes to the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.670
 description that you will have a link that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.380
 it puts download here support material 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.840
 are you download them so you will have images of 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.680
 gamers and transparent watermarks 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.989
 to put on top of the video 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.189
 a trailer the things that you have to that 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.420
 material in your video for example 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.069
 you can just put a video 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.750
 yours and put a watermark that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.730
 come out and the gamer and the gamer logo and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.709
 in the video no or in the thumbnail or that 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 you will put the trailer at the beginning bolt 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.060
 area at the end whatever the thing is that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.000
 some of that material has to come out in 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.859
 the video but and sorry and you have to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.139
 send it on twitter or by facebook or 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.680
 by both with the hashtag the room or 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.000
 no and mentioning gamer and it's worth this 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.250
 I already tell you that you will have the link 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.540
 much more detailed description the thing 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.310
 is that you are watching the videos that are 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.159
 giving people the room of or not in 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.109
 the hashtag and I see you are wrong 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.340
 because what he's sending are mounts 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.739
 of videos a plan as if it were a 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.270
 trailer of the gamer yi or making a 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.730
 assembly with the trailer that comes in it 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.900
 the support material or if that's not what 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.640
 they want guys what they want 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.050
 is to see how you are like u2 see 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.850
 what is the work you do in your 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.020
 channel I do not know if you are a trolley channel or 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.250
 then you have to send a video of what 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.140
 that you normally do what is 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.150
 trolling not an event trailer or anything 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.050
 so if six minecraft players then 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.600
 make a five minute video 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.250
 explaining a mode whatever videos 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.660
 original gracious but that is 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.910
 your to be heard that is created 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.190
 like u2 verbal job survey is 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.070
 of course once you know that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.500
 you command and from among those who participate 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.660
 it will choose 10 or 10 will be 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.250
 you better have to have the video 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.860
 practically done because the last day 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.350
 to participate is day 16 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.020
 so put the batteries guys put the 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.860
 batteries because you have possibilities are you 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.660
 watching the videos that are in the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.100
 room and most are videos 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.170
 I wrong as I say that from the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.070
 trailer and so on and it's not what they're looking for 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.050
 is what they wanted they want 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.370
 know them as youtube to take you 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.320
 then the room because as I say of 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.840
 everyone who participates will be erected 10 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.760
 that will be part of the room that 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.920
 is the room the room is a 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.870
 place where 10 youtube is let's say the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.490
 chosen and from youtube is known among 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.210
 I'm özil that there are some 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.650
 others more than not 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.090
 because I prefer you have the day 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.040
 surprise but it sure knows the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.910
 he already knows many of them because more 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.080

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.440

 quarters of an hour and you will be watching here 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.010

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.570
 the fact that they see you there live 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.520
 see how you comment as games and so on 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.690

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.040

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.870
 you would take the entrance you would not have to 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.360
 pay neither the entrance or is it already look neither you 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.330
 story 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.620
 but what is the curious thing about the event this 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.810
 of the room or it's like a 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.520
 kind of inexperience you remember in the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.430
 that the youtubers play and they see you in 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.169
 direct and such but it seems better to me 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.389
 the following seems to me better because I 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.520
 dismiss you just played and you had the 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.740
 slight chance to play with them and 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.360
 marathón to zetas but this you have the 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.669
 possibility to grow as youtuber 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.680
 because because a kind of opportunity 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.979
 in which new talent let's say 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.259
 youtube is a hole inside youtube 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.479
 not in themselves and that they can also collaborate 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.520
 with youtuber great we say what 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.229
 we promote in part you are playing 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.710
 with them how to promote the part that 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.560
 we'll talk to them and things like that, not 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.629
 more of all the youtubers that 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.340
 we are there elected let's say it has not 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.719
 chosen not the guests say why because 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.270
 we elected would be those who read 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:56.370
 of the videos we are going to do informing 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.520
 a jury and that jury will choose from 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.169
 the 10 that get there and it was in his 34 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.449
 of those who will have to play there in the 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.750
 room we will choose the best and the 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.889
 better will get a pretty prize 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.720
 important is that we can not say that 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.850
 is 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.550
 it will be a fantastic prize sure 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.040
 I assure you, go also you can be 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.260
 sponsored by a member of the jury or 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.880
 that I do not even tell you anymore, I think that 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.440
 yes i am youtuber and you have more than a thousand 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.330
 subscribers and more than a thousand subscribers 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.080
 it does not mean having a thousand or two thousand or three 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.660
 thousand euros 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.210
 if you have 50,000 60,000 70,000 of 80,000 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.740
 and 200,000 you can participate too but 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.270
 the majority with 100 thousand or 200 thousand no longer 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.210
 is needed with promotions hardly 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.980
 but if you are weaker so are the 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.870
 who are and want to participate then 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.520
 participate and you will be there in the event 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.870
 and you can see the people live and 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.270
 will be interested in your channel and will enter 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.380
 but you already know how to make a video with what 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.610
 I tell you a video of you but 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.190
 simply that it has therefore the mark of 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.440
 water be the logo of gamer I put it 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.820
 gamer jim the miniature whatever it is me 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.260
 so you have an example in this video 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.970
 I'll put the logo in Beijing 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.860
 video and in the thumbnail you can 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.300
 do as you want but always 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.620
 that the video shows something that yes 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.930
 you want for the trailer at the beginning 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.270
 make up the trailer or a piece or whatever 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.190
 that is okay but it has to be that 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.770
 video and by your own in a trailer 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.570
 of not a weird montage you do not have a video 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.730
 of you playing live let's say 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.139
 so then when we're in the 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.669
 room so you are the same why 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.249
 You send a trailer and I choose you I do not know 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:22.219
 how are you then commenting live a 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:24.680
 your video that is heard and that 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:27.050
 be funny another reading what is said 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.219
 whatever you want so nothing guys 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.259
 I hope you liked the video already 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:31.759

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.460
