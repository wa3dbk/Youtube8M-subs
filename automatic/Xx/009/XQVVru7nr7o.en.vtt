00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
image your muscle cars generally I think

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.190 
image your muscle cars generally I think
people<00:02:17.850> expect<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.299> lot<00:02:18.420> out<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.660> them<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.959> then

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
people expect a lot out of them and then

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.319 
people expect a lot out of them and then
you<00:02:19.829> do<00:02:19.950> get<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> lot<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.340> them<00:02:20.639> you<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.880> you

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
you do get a lot of them you get a you

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.879 
you do get a lot of them you get a you
get<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> lot<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.630> fun<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.019> German<00:02:22.350> driving<00:02:22.769> them

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
get a lot of fun and German driving them

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.770 
get a lot of fun and German driving them
and<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.340> think<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.730> crowd<00:02:23.940> pleasers<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.600> make

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and I think the crowd pleasers they make

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.319 
and I think the crowd pleasers they make
a<00:02:24.810> lot<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.019> noise<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.700> they<00:02:26.849> do<00:02:26.910> look<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
a lot of noise and and they do look the

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.729 
a lot of noise and and they do look the
part<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.989> in<00:02:28.079> Australia<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> course

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
part here in Australia of course

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.330 
part here in Australia of course
everything<00:02:29.430> had<00:02:29.609> to<00:02:29.639> be<00:02:29.790> home<00:02:30.420> grown<00:02:30.780> home

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
everything had to be home grown home

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.770 
everything had to be home grown home
assembled<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.880> there<00:02:33.450> was<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.569> big

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
assembled and there was a big

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.300 
assembled and there was a big
manufacturing<00:02:34.440> industry<00:02:34.829> obviously<00:02:34.950> in

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
manufacturing industry obviously in

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.400 
manufacturing industry obviously in
Australia<00:02:35.790> with<00:02:36.000> General<00:02:36.900> Motors<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.230> Ford

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
Australia with General Motors and Ford

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.620 
Australia with General Motors and Ford
competing<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.880> machine<00:02:39.030> was<00:02:39.329> a<00:02:39.389> little

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
competing so the machine was a little

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.030 
competing so the machine was a little
bit<00:02:39.720> ly

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
bit ly

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.979

grunt<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.489> think<00:02:47.060> that's<00:02:47.209> that's<00:02:47.450> probably<00:02:47.780> one

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
grunt I think that's that's probably one

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.420 
grunt I think that's that's probably one
of<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.049> misunderstood<00:02:48.650> things<00:02:48.950> about<00:02:49.189> some

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
of the misunderstood things about some

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.610 
of the misunderstood things about some
of<00:02:49.549> these<00:02:49.640> cars<00:02:49.969> here<00:02:50.329> they<00:02:50.540> they<00:02:50.930> depended<00:02:51.469> on

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
of these cars here they they depended on

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.599 
of these cars here they they depended on

Mustang<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.209> we've<00:02:56.329> got<00:02:56.480> here<00:02:56.689> we<00:02:57.079> probably

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
Mustang that we've got here we probably

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.920 
Mustang that we've got here we probably
never<00:02:57.560> had<00:02:57.799> more<00:02:58.010> than<00:02:58.069> 350<00:02:59.060> or<00:02:59.150> 360

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
never had more than 350 or 360

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.990 
never had more than 350 or 360
horsepower<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.650> if<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.370> compared<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.849> with

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
horsepower and if you compared that with

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.819 
horsepower and if you compared that with
say<00:03:02.329> even<00:03:02.689> the<00:03:02.750> new<00:03:02.870> zealand<00:03:03.200> v<00:03:03.319> 8<00:03:03.439> touring

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
horsepower possibly yeah not even on the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.709 
horsepower possibly yeah not even on the
money<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:10.099> they<00:03:10.250> were<00:03:10.310> very<00:03:10.639> nimble<00:03:10.939> cars<00:03:11.359> had

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
money but they were very nimble cars had

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.059 
money but they were very nimble cars had
it<00:03:11.810> had<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> bit<00:03:12.079> more<00:03:12.230> horsepower<00:03:12.680> on<00:03:12.769> its<00:03:12.889> day

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
it had a bit more horsepower on its day

it had a bit more horsepower on its day
who<00:03:13.549> knows<00:03:13.670> could<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.269> been<00:03:14.359> right<00:03:14.510> up<00:03:14.659> there

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
who knows could have been right up there

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.500 
who knows could have been right up there
that's<00:03:15.230> that's<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.829> great<00:03:16.189> thing<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
that's that's a great thing that the

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.000 
that's that's a great thing that the
australian<00:03:18.169> classes<00:03:18.590> have<00:03:18.680> put<00:03:18.859> together

australian classes have put together

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.710 
australian classes have put together
they've<00:03:19.549> had<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.819> numbers<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.239> cars<00:03:20.419> but

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
they've had the numbers of cars but

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.119 
they've had the numbers of cars but
they've<00:03:20.870> done<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.049> lot<00:03:21.379> to<00:03:21.560> preserve<00:03:21.919> those

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.360 
and doesn't matter you can just keep
going<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:17.290> testtree<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.709> suppose<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.250> know

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
going the testtree I suppose you know

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.650 
going the testtree I suppose you know
that's<00:04:18.579> one<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.910> reasons<00:04:19.209> why<00:04:19.329> i<00:04:19.359> erase

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
that's one of the reasons why i erase
