over<00:00:14.000> five<00:00:14.210> poly<00:00:15.050> meter<00:00:15.380> so<00:00:16.039> before<00:00:16.340> we<00:00:16.430> get

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
over five poly meter so before we get

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.740 
over five poly meter so before we get
into<00:00:16.580> that<00:00:16.880> let<00:00:17.150> me<00:00:17.240> play<00:00:17.480> you<00:00:17.539> the

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
performance of the example and then

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:52.240 
performance of the example and then
we'll<00:00:19.310> come<00:00:19.460> back<00:00:19.609> we'll<00:00:19.820> break<00:00:20.029> it<00:00:20.150> down

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.730 

as<00:00:52.670> many<00:00:53.360> you've<00:00:53.600> probably<00:00:53.750> seen<00:00:54.080> the<00:00:54.560> first

as many you've probably seen the first

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.260 
as many you've probably seen the first
lesson<00:00:55.130> that<00:00:55.160> we<00:00:55.310> did<00:00:55.520> we<00:00:55.640> were<00:00:55.730> gonna<00:00:55.850> do<00:00:56.090> like

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
lesson that we did we were gonna do like

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.350 
lesson that we did we were gonna do like
a<00:00:56.300> Jen<00:00:56.660> Clinic<00:00:57.050> series<00:00:57.680> but<00:00:58.060> we<00:00:59.060> didn't<00:00:59.239> really

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
a Jen Clinic series but we didn't really

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.790 
a Jen Clinic series but we didn't really
want<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.660> do<00:00:59.780> that<00:00:59.810> it<00:01:00.110> was<00:01:00.200> kind<00:01:00.440> of<00:01:00.500> can't<00:01:00.680> be

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
want to do that it was kind of can't be

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.870 
want to do that it was kind of can't be
we<00:01:00.950> didn't<00:01:01.130> want<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.400> pigeonhole<00:01:01.610> ourselves

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
we didn't want to pigeonhole ourselves

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.240 
we didn't want to pigeonhole ourselves
and<00:01:02.690> we<00:01:03.140> actually<00:01:03.290> started<00:01:03.650> taking<00:01:03.890> all<00:01:04.129> these

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
and we actually started taking all these

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.660 
and we actually started taking all these
lesson<00:01:04.670> ideas<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.800> started<00:01:06.800> writing<00:01:07.010> music

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
lesson ideas and started writing music

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.460 
lesson ideas and started writing music
with<00:01:07.820> them<00:01:07.970> actual<00:01:08.330> songs<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.020> what<00:01:09.380> we're

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
with them actual songs and what we're

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.410 
with them actual songs and what we're
gonna<00:01:09.560> do<00:01:09.800> is<00:01:10.010> we're<00:01:10.130> gonna<00:01:10.190> take<00:01:11.000> those<00:01:11.150> songs

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
gonna do is we're gonna take those songs

gonna do is we're gonna take those songs
or<00:01:11.600> snippets<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.050> those<00:01:12.170> songs<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.740> show<00:01:12.950> you

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
the musical concepts that went behind

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.140 
the musical concepts that went behind
our<00:01:15.350> writing<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.430> like<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:16.670> said<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.970> first

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
our writing so like I said the first

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.719 
our writing so like I said the first
example<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:17.840> seven<00:01:18.800> over<00:01:18.979> five<00:01:19.130> poly<00:01:19.460> meter

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
example is seven over five poly meter

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.090 
example is seven over five poly meter
and<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.150> all<00:01:20.300> started<00:01:20.690> out<00:01:20.869> with<00:01:21.500> Addison's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
and it all started out with Addison's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.010 
and it all started out with Addison's
drum<00:01:22.340> beat<00:01:22.490> he<00:01:22.729> brought<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.060> me<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.750> drum

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
drum beat he brought to me this drum

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.270 
drum beat he brought to me this drum
beat<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.290> he<00:01:24.380> was<00:01:24.500> playing<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:25.009> was<00:01:25.130> in

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
beat that he was playing and that was in

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.910 
beat that he was playing and that was in
7/16<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:26.360> don't<00:01:27.259> let<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.470> sound<00:01:27.770> is

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
7/16 and don't let that sound is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.249 
7/16 and don't let that sound is
daunting<00:01:28.190> just<00:01:28.700> think<00:01:28.880> about<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:29.330> as<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.899> quick

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
daunting just think about it as a quick

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.800 
daunting just think about it as a quick
seven<00:01:30.649> count<00:01:33.700> I'm<00:01:34.700> like<00:01:34.880> alright<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.390> then

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
seven count I'm like alright and then

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.600 
seven count I'm like alright and then
underneath<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.470> he<00:01:36.860> was<00:01:37.009> doing<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.340> kick

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
underneath that he was doing a kick

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.999 
underneath that he was doing a kick
pattern<00:01:38.149> in<00:01:38.300> five<00:01:38.840> underneath<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:39.890> get

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
pattern in five underneath it so you get

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.130 
pattern in five underneath it so you get
this<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.200> he<00:01:42.470> was<00:01:42.619> putting<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:43.210> kicks<00:01:44.210> on<00:01:44.539> if

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
this and he was putting the kicks on if

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.960 
this and he was putting the kicks on if
you're<00:01:45.259> counting<00:01:45.440> through<00:01:45.860> five<00:01:46.130> one<00:01:46.670> three

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
you're counting through five one three

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.660 
you're counting through five one three
and<00:01:47.180> four<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:47.750> basically<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.710> turns<00:01:48.950> out<00:01:49.130> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.190 

so<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.729> have<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:53.149> repeating<00:01:53.750> pattern

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
so you have that repeating pattern

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.310 
so you have that repeating pattern
underneath<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:55.039> 7c<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.180> what<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.689> did<00:01:56.810> with<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.170> to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
underneath a 7c so what I did with it to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.710 
underneath a 7c so what I did with it to
get<00:01:57.470> into<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.799> section<00:01:58.180> we<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.390> opened<00:01:59.689> up

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
get into the section we just opened up

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.750 
get into the section we just opened up
in<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.960> nice<00:02:00.290> little<00:02:00.320> four<00:02:00.740> chord<00:02:01.040> break<00:02:01.369> and

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
in a nice little four chord break and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.240 
in a nice little four chord break and
I'm<00:02:02.090> using<00:02:02.299> power<00:02:03.229> chords<00:02:03.590> for<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.799> most<00:02:03.979> part

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
I'm using power chords for the most part

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.800 
I'm using power chords for the most part
just<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.580> keep<00:02:04.760> it<00:02:04.909> simple<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.360> way<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.510> can

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
just to keep it simple this way I can

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.259 
just to keep it simple this way I can
build<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.530> harmony<00:02:07.040> on<00:02:07.159> top<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.640> if<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.030> so

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
build the harmony on top of that if I so

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:08.650 
build the harmony on top of that if I so
choose

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
choose

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.520 
choose
so<00:02:09.380> basically<00:02:09.820> seven<00:02:10.820> string<00:02:11.060> drop<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.500> I

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so basically seven string drop a so I

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.410 
so basically seven string drop a so I
have<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.950> first<00:02:13.130> board<00:02:13.400> third<00:02:13.610> fret

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
have this first board third fret

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.150 
have this first board third fret
and<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.080> open

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
and then open

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.699 
and then open
and<00:02:18.430> then<00:02:18.850> eight<00:02:19.120> eight<00:02:19.360> seven

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
and then eight eight seven

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.260 
and then eight eight seven
it's<00:02:22.219> actually<00:02:22.519> an<00:02:22.579> F<00:02:22.730> major<00:02:22.939> 7<00:02:23.359> chord<00:02:23.390> love<00:02:23.959> it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
it's actually an F major 7 chord love it

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.600 
it's actually an F major 7 chord love it
and<00:02:25.720> then<00:02:26.170> uh<00:02:26.200> down<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.040> first<00:02:27.250> Friday<00:02:27.520> of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
and then uh down on the first Friday of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.080 
and then uh down on the first Friday of
one<00:02:28.030> one<00:02:28.210> three

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.510 

think<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.840> as<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.020> b-flat<00:02:32.590> sauce<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.280> type

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
think of that as a b-flat sauce to type

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.250 
think of that as a b-flat sauce to type
corn<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.150> that's<00:02:34.330> how<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.569> open<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.110> get

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
corn so that's how we open up and get

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
corn so that's how we open up and get
into<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.830> part

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.250 

and<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> choke<00:02:42.390> pattern<00:02:42.720> starts<00:02:43.080> and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
and then the choke pattern starts and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.960 
and then the choke pattern starts and
for<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> truck<00:02:43.980> pattern<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.490> didn't<00:02:44.700> want<00:02:44.880> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
for the truck pattern I didn't want to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.810 
for the truck pattern I didn't want to
do<00:02:45.120> some<00:02:45.480> super<00:02:45.900> contemporary<00:02:46.820> avant-garde

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
do some super contemporary avant-garde

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.520 
do some super contemporary avant-garde
type<00:02:48.300> core<00:02:48.510> progression<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.930> wanted<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> give

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
type core progression I wanted to give

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.510 
type core progression I wanted to give
it<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:50.120> hard<00:02:51.120> rock<00:02:51.450> type<00:02:52.170> feel<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.310> course

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
it a hard rock type feel so the course

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.250 
it a hard rock type feel so the course
I'm<00:02:53.700> using<00:02:53.850> basically<00:02:54.090> outline<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> pentatonic

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
I'm using basically outline a pentatonic

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.860 
I'm using basically outline a pentatonic
for<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.830> most<00:02:56.010> part<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.400> five<00:02:57.170> open<00:02:58.459> five

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
for the most part it's five open five

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.560 
for the most part it's five open five
eight<00:03:01.820> three<00:03:02.820> five<00:03:03.090> seven<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:06.209> I'm<00:03:06.360> going<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
eight three five seven so I'm going to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.240 
eight three five seven so I'm going to
start<00:03:06.750> chugging<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.680> opens<00:03:11.390> five<00:03:13.250> eight

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
start chugging on the opens five eight

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:28.200 
start chugging on the opens five eight
three<00:03:14.550> oh<00:03:15.020> three<00:03:16.940> three<00:03:17.940> five<00:03:18.180> seven

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.410 

and<00:03:29.210> notice<00:03:29.450> how<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.570> lift<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.290> paw<00:03:30.500> mute<00:03:30.800> up<00:03:31.420> as

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
and notice how I lift the paw mute up as

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.570 
and notice how I lift the paw mute up as
I<00:03:32.540> slide<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.930> seven<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.650> helps<00:03:34.070> bring<00:03:34.430> up

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
I slide the seven that helps bring up

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.790 
I slide the seven that helps bring up
the<00:03:34.790> dynamics<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.630> go<00:03:35.930> back<00:03:36.230> into<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.590> core

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
the dynamics and go back into the core

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.440 
the dynamics and go back into the core
part<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.160> I'll<00:03:37.220> play<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.520> twice<00:03:38.030> for<00:03:38.360> you

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
part and I'll play that twice for you

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:53.890 
part and I'll play that twice for you
right<00:03:38.660> now<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.350> can<00:03:39.440> hear<00:03:39.620> that

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.050 

so<00:03:54.560> as<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.769> lift<00:03:54.980> up<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.159> palm<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.879> kind

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
so as you lift up the palm you that kind

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.970 
so as you lift up the palm you that kind
of<00:03:56.150> just<00:03:56.330> helps<00:03:56.659> transition<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.470> bring<00:03:57.860> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
of just helps transition and bring the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.759 
of just helps transition and bring the
energy<00:03:58.340> back<00:03:58.549> up<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.780> on<00:03:59.989> top<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.530> chug

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
energy back up so on top of the chug

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.890 
energy back up so on top of the chug
pattern<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:02.060> wanted<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.569> write<00:04:02.870> something

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
pattern is I wanted to write something

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.559 
pattern is I wanted to write something
that<00:04:03.590> would<00:04:04.099> play<00:04:04.310> along<00:04:04.459> with<00:04:04.700> Addison<00:04:05.120> 7

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
that would play along with Addison 7

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.570 
that would play along with Addison 7
pattern<00:04:05.959> not<00:04:06.379> just<00:04:06.590> chug<00:04:06.830> along<00:04:06.860> with<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.370> 5

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
pattern not just chug along with the 5

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.390 
pattern not just chug along with the 5
underneath<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:08.900> in<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.530> actual<00:04:09.920> song<00:04:10.099> that

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
underneath it so in the actual song that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.059 
underneath it so in the actual song that
we're<00:04:10.519> kind<00:04:10.730> of<00:04:10.790> writing<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.319> have<00:04:12.319> this<00:04:12.470> fill<00:04:13.040> I

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
we're kind of writing I have this fill I

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.520 
we're kind of writing I have this fill I
feel<00:04:13.819> that<00:04:14.030> goes<00:04:14.180> like<00:04:14.269> this<00:04:14.390> so<00:04:17.320> I<00:04:18.320> thought

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
feel that goes like this so I thought

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.289 
feel that goes like this so I thought
it'd<00:04:18.680> be<00:04:18.709> interesting<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.280> experiment<00:04:20.030> take

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
it'd be interesting to experiment take

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.330 
it'd be interesting to experiment take
the<00:04:20.449> first<00:04:20.720> seven<00:04:21.109> notes<00:04:21.320> of<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.859> just

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
the first seven notes of that and just

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.650 
the first seven notes of that and just
repeat<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:28.850> actually<00:04:29.150> sounded<00:04:29.510> pretty

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
repeat it it actually sounded pretty

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.140 
repeat it it actually sounded pretty
cool<00:04:29.900> we<00:04:30.110> actually<00:04:30.440> really<00:04:30.650> liked<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:31.729> what

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
cool we actually really liked it so what

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.390 
cool we actually really liked it so what
I<00:04:32.180> did<00:04:32.270> as<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:33.139> play<00:04:33.350> that<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.740> play<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.160> four

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
I did as I play that I play that four

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.430 
I did as I play that I play that four
times<00:04:34.639> let<00:04:35.630> me<00:04:35.690> show<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:35.930> what<00:04:36.050> I'm<00:04:36.139> going<00:04:36.169> on

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.890 
times let me show you what I'm going on
tapping<00:04:36.979> it's<00:04:37.100> kind<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.400> based<00:04:37.580> around<00:04:37.910> a

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
tapping it's kind of based around a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.500 
tapping it's kind of based around a
blues<00:04:39.289> in<00:04:42.220> fifth<00:04:43.220> position<00:04:43.669> so<00:04:44.090> I'm<00:04:44.240> tapping

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510

the<00:04:51.020> g<00:04:51.260> string<00:04:51.289> of<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:51.860> D<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:55.210> then<00:04:56.210> almost

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
the g string of this D and then almost

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.460 
the g string of this D and then almost
