00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:10.680
 [music] 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.670
 hello everyone with you fil and this is 60th 79 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.520
 part of the mangrove mechanisms as you remember 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 I sat for the last hour such a thing she 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.170
 I still have a label for me to see 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 this is what we did in the last series in this 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 series, I promised you that I will show another 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:40.890
 scheme here it is and here it is so we 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.770
 need for this here this clear 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 cool even I would say to her 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.500
 well, cool mechanism to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 that we need for this mechanism and in the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.039
 first put well let's start the same 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.430
 as here here we put the sticky block 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.260
 piston sticky piston flexible piston 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.450
 there is a block behind them you can see here a torch 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.580
 delay by 4 which will be when we 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.119
 will turn off this faker'a we will 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:19.500
 turn on the piston then my stop here 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 broke the seal here torch block then here 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.829
 so here are three peter seems yes damn me 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.090
 that respecting would even say 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.259
 so here we do here so here here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.240
 so there is now see now yes then 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.689
 have we burn the torch here this one 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.930
 a piece of redstone that turns off this 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.930
 torch 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.140
 and here and so here it is 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.320
 maher so here is a piece of redstone and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.360
 here 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:08.280
 whether Peter that's all now we are right here 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:14.610
 we put a piece of redstone here a block here 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.470
 Peter 4 delay and see something but 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.030
 here we put a block above the torch 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.650
 all right now turn off this double 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.970
 double 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:32.130
 vertical double vertical porsche a 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:35.660
 I accidentally knocked him all well 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.660
 let's put the unit 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:46.030
 so it will be in general, then yes then everything 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.459
 this fix means so what's next 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.519
 next we just take lift here 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:58.239
 just such a thing , but then 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:02.209
 add blocks here and set brigitta 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.569
 a delay of 4 and so here is all 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:15.440
 then here so here we lower the diet 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:18.829
 here here 1 2 block stone in total 2 and 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.750
 Peter and block redstone which will from 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.549
 block powered another jupiter all 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.849
 repeaters 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.349
 absolutely put on the fourth contains 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.470
 then we put a torch here 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:37.000
 type double version one sense version i 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:42.520
 here stone then comes two times three and 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.050
 and all three blocks here and so block 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.790
 then another jupiter delay 4 and block 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.850
 on it we set restore torch here 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.260
 add a block on the left and right on the right and 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.950
 left then 2 lats 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.950
 torch and 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.720
 in general, then we put everything now 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.150
 what 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:11.870
 used deport here and so two pistons 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.390
 these pistons will move in general we 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.900
 now you will understand everything here 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.900
 let's say 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.580
 steps steps there i'm steps 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.440
 they will move like this 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.290
 generally let's finish it first so 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.660
 Now here we put 3 pistons 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.890
 so here and so here now 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.630
 ignite lights put a tutor here 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:46.320
 without delay block torch block party 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:51.890
 the torch block now seems supposed 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.890
 work and clean not sure because 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.560
 here you need to make a delay of 3 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:11.070
 It seems the same maincraft 1 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:11.070
 for here is a blog 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.480
 So 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.480
 [music] 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.169
 I have something wrong 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.930
 your error delay is not necessary here 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.729
 change and here here here 4 and here 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.500
 all alone i'm a fool 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:49.460
 sorry so activate everything is ready 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.669
 now it means turning on the ladder 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.759
 on the sides of the staircase le monti with exit 1 and 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:05.789
 3 of course the stairs were not put 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:07.800
 very cool so in general that's all so 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:12.659
 here we do here so here so 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.460
 so here so here so here and even 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:20.610
 you know, you can not put this thing 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.289
 because we have a descent here even 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.380
 look with us even from this side 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:30.330
 cooked descent already with a mechanism in 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:37.940
 general so now that we have sex here 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:37.940
 you can cover everything 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.169
 all general scheme is ready here it is full 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.990
 so beautiful 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.909
 option and general thanks to all 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.699
 view subscribe to the channel put 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:57.029
 fingers top with you was as always I teach
