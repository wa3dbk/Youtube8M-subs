 power to buy all players from this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.589

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.809
 unbeatable bava suractif home of 5 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.240
 % deducted with the code jorc ap 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.769
 the link is in the purple description 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.570
 dias and joe I hope you're fine 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.070
 me sahara at the top of my form 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
 we find ourselves today for a small 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.340
 little football it was a long time and so 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.529
 today little squat builder of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.789
 talent and a team quoted as I you 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.710
 I said this is the best team 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 in any case with which I would not say 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.619
 I took more pleasure I would say more 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.220
 the team with whom I still have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.230
 not lost 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.149
 I would say an amazing team I 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.170
 would say a team does not need to 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.930
 necessarily a lot of attackers for 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.760
 to mark is an incredible tool so 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.780
 you will tell me 5 2 1 2 I will you 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 tell it's a whore team 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 you are not shocked that's for me 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.320
 it's a dirty team of duty that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.829
 when I see shit and when I'm raging and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.629
 so 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.280
 so you guys are going to see what that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.890
 will give the player's trech resadia 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 transferred and so it's to the caretaker I 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 put a heart choice if a team 100% 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.590
 French is besides a steve genius 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.030
 mandanda the choice of the heart is not a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.379
 team that is very expensive and you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 to do at home and you will see that it is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.430
 very very dirty so here's steve 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 mandanda good guardian that I preferred 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.290
 lloris points simon best goalkeepers 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.909
 French 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.159
 it may be my original heart that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.500
 makes the difference but I do not know 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.200
 central defense I chose to put 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.330
 for sale directly choose france ira 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 much faster in central defense 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.780
 so I have him in central defense 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 mangala because it's the one who has the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
 best stats in the lead he is 85 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.470
 physical at 87 m as the big ones 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.939
 physical but it's less fast and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.560
 real-time varane who is my other 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.150
 defender on the side by year a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.590
 defender that I like a lot puts him 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.240
 any french defender and me 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.369
 it's my top 3 French defender 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.869
 is then to you kaboul you who I love 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.670
 at most a stool I really like this 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.350
 player for me this is the guy we will say 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.250
 the central defender the fastest and this 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.259
 with a lot of people told me to do 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.880
 like that yeah I'll do like this 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.200
 you're right it's much better but 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.320
 way less the order of the defenders 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.060
 for me it changes between nothing and nothing 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.250
 then left side defender this 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.930
 once a single segal and clichy that's for 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.520
 I'm the only side defender 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 left that is valid in France 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.149
 the only case of the level after you would have 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.770
 Due to it there is casino etc 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.320
 they are still too light kurzawa 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.149
 so here and then defender 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.590
 right side concots which is a real 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.660
 nugget concots so here you have a 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.920
 defense against you 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.570
 which is one of my favorite defenses on 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.070
 football and especially what is interesting 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.420
 that's where you see it right now 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.310
 the defense you know her you 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.870
 know the majority of players and I 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.940
 can you make sure it's safe and certain 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.260
 that this defense there is impassable she 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.820
 is impassable it's a defense it's 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.890
 a wall says you're defending it 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.330
 really very very hard to pass especially 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.550
 with big physics like varane 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.930
 kabul and mangala that are fast by 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.550
 on everything and what is practical with 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.260
 this component is for example one can 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.970
 defend at four with a player in 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.130
 retreat me I mowed lectio noah the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.540
 central player kaboul mangala and c is 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.010
 in May one all behind and that you 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.140
 just to anticipate everything 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.370
 who is lby without losing a defender 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.810
 blood to be had on one of a two 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 we already defensively it is 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.070
 extremely interesting but after that it's 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.750
 clear that we have to start thinking about 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.950
 everything that is offensive think about everything 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.510
 what is offensive sector because 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.530
 you see what 's not a lot of 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.120
 offensive players for now in 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.860
 this team and you will see that the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.200
 offensive players that I chose it's 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.880
 an offensive joy of great talent already 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.780
 we will go by day the most defensive 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.490
 of this team 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.500
 it's not about pogba but it 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.950
 this is blaise matuidi that's blaise 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.990
 Matuidi 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.610
 I hesitated a long time with you 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.220
 saw him waiting to get back into a 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.630
 injured with moussa sissoko but 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.190
 finally I choose please play this 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.480
 which is much better for my taste moussa 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.280
 sissoko that very good when I play 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.720
 with three backgrounds when I still see 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.940
 in a position with four defenders 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.709
 i loved moussa sissoko unfortunately 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.330
 I unfortunately prefer for him a 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.709
 play brother blaise matuidi who is well 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.540
 best spa you present blaise 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.040
 matuidi rice the very familiar themes not 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.140
 started representing players 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.390
 known and so I associated with paul pogba 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.190
 paul pogba kind a very big nugget 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.600
 it's amazing this player me 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.950
 I love this player whose record is not 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.930
 not my balance sheet is still balance sheets 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.380
 bathe but in any case that's a very 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.090
 great player 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.440
 I do not have a diversion a man of the form 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.700
 match et cetera I think like you 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.560
 you do not have a lot of credit 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.580
 like me finally even if I'm not going to 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.020
 Complain not further in my club 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.330
 I still have good players but 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.190
 but here I am, anyway 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.739
 not in touch version could have to 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.410
 kill said todd payet tots clichy second 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.550
 inform mans in the head but that does not 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.140
 I'm not interested because I really 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.270
 tried to play this team at 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.170
 the economy and especially talent so 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.270
 that's why there is still going to be 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.950
 a player in a word is if they see 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.350
 a little bit expensive guys this is 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.180
 dimitri payet version toth you see it 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.340
 he is present the dimitri payet toth 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.060
 this is dimitri payet is a player 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.710
 really amazing cool 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.300
 I tell you there is incredible I in it 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.160
 first holder I am very happy 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.080
 and clearly I never thought even 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.090
 only once resell it is right 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.010
 perfect it's a bit of a maestro like we 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.180
 often calls it maestro dimitri 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.950
 payet it's really a player who is 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.260
 in the heart of the game that is really present 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.540
 in attack which is technical 91 in 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.000
 dribble good in pulls 90 they put some 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.650
 free kicks come to your world 92 years 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.930
 pass they open as soon as he opens 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.220
 positions that are really 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.660
 interesting for our two scorers who 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.600
 seemed lost deep wrestlers 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.580
 then 68 in physics for a day of 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.440
 May 75 it's really not too much and his 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 little speed 86 that's still 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.630
 well there 10 20 it was still one of 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.910
 these defects to appear at the beginning the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.410
 speed and the a86 will follow very very 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.050
 honorable it even allows him to 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.979
 maybe to play almost scorer you the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.080
 say well since I see people who 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.520
 put fekir but I do not see why 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.530
 a dimitri payet could not be drunk 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.270
 because seen and what talent he has he has 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.560
 nothing to him deserved a fake shot he is 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.900
 even better than actually saying that I have 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.370
 tested I can assure you and then 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.100
 we went to the two goal scorer 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.660
 transfer the first he is French he 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.220
 play online 1 and what's weird 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.280
 is that the two players the Olympic 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.950
 lyonnais so here it is therefore about 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.060
 lacazette unique lacazette is that that 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.220
 worth to present it I do not know 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.100
 not and claudio beauvue the recent 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.260
 transferred player claudio review play them 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.600
 than two games with him he is quoted 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.610
 here are my liters a little too shit 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.650
 and for me is good I do not hide you 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.630
 the gg guys i often spend with this 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.560
 anthem because the trophy was just 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.760
 because it's not great I feel 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.200
 not good crosstalk septime I will you 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.520
 say clearly so it's true that 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.810
 usually I'm not going well but 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.940
 know that it can be avoided 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.650
 if you take in this team there 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.060
 a lot less 10 and sometimes at goal in 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.350
 this team there it's just amazing 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.389
 I'm sorry beauvue takes the 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.110
 92 depth of speed this is 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.760
 irretrievable 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.740
 and then with a smuggler like payet 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.539
 I assure you that I am going there are you 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.530
 race is over at butten us what 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.669
 does not happen to play maybe it's 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.500
 the composition is not made for 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.539
 claudio beauvue especially not scorer in 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.430
 anyway it's an exceptional player 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.870
 me it's true that I'm more style 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.520
 to play it and play the game 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.740
 little so I had a player 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.510
 I had antoine griezmann second there 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.980
 shape that is for me much better in 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.690
 three matches 8 goals 2 assists 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.310
 what is doing a lot more diff 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.850
 that claudio beauvue so that's my 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.620
 team 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.270
 after that it is not the most cited team 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.440
 but I would even give you the 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.260
 little claudio beauvue who is for me 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.730
 still of unity that even griezmann 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.340
 if it stays low it's very good so here's the 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.530
 incredible act box here I am not 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.530
 sure to have played the 75 games with him 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.280
 although I say well although really 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.960
 a very good scorer 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.550
 really I 'm going a lot of bearings 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.630
 with him it's weird to have gone to 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.890
 side of him there are days as seen 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.270
 players like the yes man who are 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.320
 very very soft but in any case know 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.510
 that this team there is unthinkable 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.670
 here is you prefer to say it live she 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.630
 is unthinkable and especially I think that 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.210
 beyond the team 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.830
 beyond all that I think it's the 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.280
 device that is very very good I 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.410
 explains 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.750
 our composition if you put three 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.710
 ultra-strong defenders two wingers 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.800
 really fast 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.480
 a defensive midfielder like matuidi is a 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.490
 middle builder techniques like 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.020
 pogba that you put an excellent 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.210
 very offensive passer 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.310
 in a nutshell it's two scorers with more 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.960
 90 speed you can make sure 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.250
 that any player to any 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.200
 what position would it make me a team 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.000
 incredible so here it was a 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.660
 presentation of more teams except at 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.640
 account ends 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.890
 a composition presentation the 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.690
 presentation of 5 2 1 2 know that it is 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.910
 an incredible team and I invite you 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.680
 all to test test the soaps not very 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.960
 expensive even if you can take a 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.770
 payet for example a step and regulated who 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.180
 will be very good too 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.850
 you have to take a pop press 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.170
 1 mc makes that cissokho will not be 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.560
 sissoko not like this is not the same 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.850
 profile 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.200
 you may have a little more trouble 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.770
 but in any case this team there she 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.260
 is perfect 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:00.090
 here we are djak sata more apt at +11 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.090
 like by everyone
