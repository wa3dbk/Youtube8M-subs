00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.309
 aton solar hours of sunshine for the weekend 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.019
 and in 15 days trend welcome to the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.049
 kind and should therefore an hour for kita 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.960
 visit and parted for the 15 days 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.240
 behind switzerland on saturday it is 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.910
 not like termite son he is 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.250
 mostly gray everywhere if they are 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.590
 First any northwestern Switzerland 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 jura barcelona called the as 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 probably for the right hour 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 big her legally but more if 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.260
 taken to or for and partly too 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 of china and the same place west swiss 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.379
 picture tvo the numbers presented this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.809
 services lacked all day wore detail 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.770
 how to book weather stations point 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 meteomedia point ch detail for all the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.190
 four more stations moritz / switzerland 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:58.430
 hand and I see a better less 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.620
 thus landing partly metal 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.930
 high nebula volume on falls like this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.869
 that at mesut hour, however, there is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.210
 but between looking at Germany on 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.860
 Saturday is not so convenient here 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.780
 if you love the sun all the time 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.580
 north or very south to live the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.420
 Great rest in between is easy 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.759
 prefers 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 this principle is still on sunday 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.960
 The case is the principle again 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 the golden middle 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.210
 however, the north is not 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.549
 more as much as the Saturday in the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.049
 South of Bavaria especially along Danube 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.189
 also the danger that the fog and 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.960
 low stratus fields 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.869
 because of the advanced season 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.170
 ever be a bit longer and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.119
 a little bit about the country the aton 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.829
 solar sunshine question is how 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.619
 the temperature develops on monday 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.439
 Keeps track of temperatures so quickly 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.070
 just under 20 degrees the highest of the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.380
 emotions 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 You see, we walk and slowly 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.689
 but certainly a bit in the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.520
 cut along 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.380
 from the fifth october but then 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.450
 completely herb and turnips 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.270
 then is between record heat and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.220
 record cold everything possible so that means 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.780
 we can call it the fifth october we are 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.990
 so close to the average with the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.000
 Temperatures, however, not afterwards 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.940
 Exactly you do not know everything after 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.040
 the 5 oktober forecast it is in 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.660
 moment due to this situation 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.550
 Of course we will keep it up 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.670
 ongoing for all details 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.710
 weather stations point meteomedia de for 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.230
 germany and point at for austria 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.210
 ch for switzerland with station 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.400
 specific predictions and of course 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.290
 also continue to run on facebook and 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.930
 on twitter at the known addresses 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.680
 nice weekend make ski like that 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.680
 titles or launches
