00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
we're going to think about protein and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.190 
we're going to think about protein and
it's<00:00:32.099> super<00:00:32.399> hot<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.820> travel<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> AC<00:00:33.930> because

protein okay and one thing I kind of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.280 
protein okay and one thing I kind of
want<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> point<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> be

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
focusing far too much on the protein

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.630 
focusing far too much on the protein
number<00:01:01.620> well<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.370> trying<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
number well that's what we're trying to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
number well that's what we're trying to
figure<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:04.199> still<00:01:04.439> need<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
figure out right now we still need to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.770 
figure out right now we still need to
understand<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.240> knowledge<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.720> the

eat a ton of protein and then magically

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
eat a ton of protein and then magically
put<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.890> mass<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> combination<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.210> your

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
put on mass it's a combination of your

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080 
put on mass it's a combination of your
diet<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> whole<00:01:34.409> that's<00:01:34.799> why<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.880> at

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
diet as a whole that's why we look at

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.539 
diet as a whole that's why we look at
everything<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.250> coming<00:01:38.369> videos

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
everything so in the coming videos

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
everything so in the coming videos
you're<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.270> me<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.630> talking<00:01:40.140> about

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you're going to see me be talking about

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
you're going to see me be talking about
the<00:01:40.590> amount<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.070> carbohydrates<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.030> need

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the amount of carbohydrates you need

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.080 
the amount of carbohydrates you need
amount<00:01:42.570> facts<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.590> need<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.820> then

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
amount facts that you need and then

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.520 
amount facts that you need and then
we'll<00:01:45.329> probably<00:01:45.600> even<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> little<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
we'll probably even do a little bit of a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
we'll probably even do a little bit of a
video<00:01:46.770> series<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.399> those<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> based

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
video series because those will be based

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.550 
video series because those will be based
on<00:01:48.240> generics<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.079> will<00:01:49.229> talk<00:01:49.409> about

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
on generics and they will talk about

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950 
on generics and they will talk about
well<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.579> bulking<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.840> you're

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
well if you're bulking do this if you're

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
well if you're bulking do this if you're
cutting<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.250> seem<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.579> a

cutting do this they all seem to do a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
cutting do this they all seem to do a
little<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:53.850> specific<00:01:54.060> videos<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:55.020> people

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
little more specific videos for people

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.480 
little more specific videos for people
who<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.530> trying<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.829> put<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:55.979> sighs<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
who are trying to put out sighs and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
who are trying to put out sighs and
people<00:01:56.700> who<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:56.939> trying<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.360> cut<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.200> today

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
people who are trying to cut but today

people who are trying to cut but today
let's<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.579> kind<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.909> past<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.299> just

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
let's just kind of get past that just

know that we will be covering that right
now<00:02:03.659> let's<00:02:04.140> speak<00:02:04.439> specifically<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
now let's speak specifically on the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.999 
now let's speak specifically on the
amount<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.909> protein<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.110> need<00:02:07.290> first

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
amount of protein that you need first

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
amount of protein that you need first
things<00:02:08.220> first<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> lot<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.849> information<00:02:09.330> out

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
things first is a lot of information out

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.100 
things first is a lot of information out
there

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
there

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
there
if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.350> do<00:02:10.560> your<00:02:10.710> research<00:02:11.039> everybody's<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
if you do your research everybody's and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.830 
if you do your research everybody's and
recommend<00:02:12.060> different<00:02:12.270> stuff<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.660> truth

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
recommend different stuff but the truth

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.050 
recommend different stuff but the truth
is<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.110> research<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.680> kind<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.040> its<00:02:14.820> kind<00:02:14.880> of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
is the research is kind of its kind of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.120 
is the research is kind of its kind of
iffy<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.540> actual<00:02:15.780> research<00:02:16.110> done<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.650> people

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
iffy the actual research done on people

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.440 
iffy the actual research done on people
that<00:02:17.160> are<00:02:17.400> relevant<00:02:17.640> meaning<00:02:18.030> people<00:02:18.210> who

bit<00:02:31.380> more<00:02:31.560> than<00:02:31.830> say<00:02:32.070> an<00:02:32.280> endurance<00:02:32.640> athlete

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
bit more than say an endurance athlete

are going to have different protein

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.890 
are going to have different protein
requirements<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:42.000> targeting<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.600> people

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
requirements so I'm targeting the people

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.199 
requirements so I'm targeting the people
who<00:02:43.050> use<00:02:43.230> resistance<00:02:43.709> training<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.220> dominant

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
who use resistance training as dominant

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.540 
who use resistance training as dominant
style<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.110> form<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.709> training<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.400> got

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
style and form of training so we got

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.310 
style and form of training so we got
that<00:02:47.700> down<00:02:47.850> okay<00:02:48.239> there's<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.110> ton<00:02:49.290> of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
that down okay there's a ton of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.660 
that down okay there's a ton of
different<00:02:49.470> information<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.489> see

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
different information you can see

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.290 
different information you can see
everything<00:02:51.090> from<00:02:51.860> low<00:02:52.860> protein<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:54.060> saying

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
everything from low protein like saying

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.150 
everything from low protein like saying
you<00:02:54.630> don't<00:02:54.750> need<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:54.959> much<00:02:55.170> your<00:02:55.770> body<00:02:55.950> only

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
you don't need this much your body only

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.190 
you don't need this much your body only
simulate<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.120> much<00:02:57.270> protein<00:02:57.600> at<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.989> certain

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
simulate so much protein at a certain

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.560 
simulate so much protein at a certain
time<00:02:58.380> which<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.580> you<00:03:00.420> know<00:03:00.510> you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
time which is but you know you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.690 
time which is but you know you
can<00:03:00.930> go<00:03:01.020> as<00:03:01.170> low<00:03:01.350> as<00:03:01.380> some<00:03:01.650> people<00:03:01.890> saying<00:03:02.370> half

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700

you<00:03:15.120> my<00:03:15.239> opinion<00:03:15.360> my<00:03:15.750> rule<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.019> thumb<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.560> I'm<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
you my opinion my rule of thumb I I'm a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.979 
you my opinion my rule of thumb I I'm a
protein<00:03:17.670> guy<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.150> protein<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.570> think<00:03:18.870> it's

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
protein guy I like protein I think it's

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.150 
protein guy I like protein I think it's
important<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> make<00:03:19.650> sure<00:03:19.680> you're<00:03:19.920> getting<00:03:19.980> a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
important to make sure you're getting a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.039 
important to make sure you're getting a
certain<00:03:20.400> amount<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.790> think<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.299> good<00:03:21.330> ballpark

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
certain amount I think a good ballpark

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.479 
certain amount I think a good ballpark
would<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.320> see<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.590> lot<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.830> places<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.400> I'm

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
would you see a lot of places and I'm

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.130 
would you see a lot of places and I'm
going<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.670> kind<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.000> reiterate<00:03:24.480> here<00:03:24.959> is

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
going to kind of reiterate here is

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.539 
going to kind of reiterate here is
getting<00:03:25.440> at<00:03:25.530> least<00:03:25.560> one<00:03:25.890> gram<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:27.200> protein<00:03:28.200> per

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
getting at least one gram of protein per

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.120 
getting at least one gram of protein per
body<00:03:29.549> weight<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.420> if<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.959> wait<00:03:31.080> 250<00:03:31.769> pounds

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
body weight so if you wait 250 pounds

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.100 
body weight so if you wait 250 pounds
you're<00:03:32.670> going<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.850> eat<00:03:32.880> 250<00:03:33.750> pounds<00:03:34.019> of

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
you're going to eat 250 pounds of

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.740 
you're going to eat 250 pounds of
protein<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.890> think<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.120> where<00:03:36.299> we<00:03:36.480> try

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
protein but I think this is where we try

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.850 
protein but I think this is where we try
to<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.500> where<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.680> going<00:03:37.799> to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
to get and this is where you going to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.170 
to get and this is where you going to
sing<00:03:38.010> talk<00:03:38.190> about<00:03:38.370> carbohydrates<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.090> go

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
sing talk about carbohydrates and go

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.850 
sing talk about carbohydrates and go
into<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.660> might<00:03:39.780> do<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> video<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.320> protein

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
into it I might do a video on protein

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.350 
into it I might do a video on protein
and<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.130> sensitivity<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.730> carbohydrates

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
and your sensitivity to carbohydrates

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.470 
and your sensitivity to carbohydrates
and<00:03:42.680> manipulating<00:03:43.680> your<00:03:43.769> requirements<00:03:44.310> but

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
and manipulating your requirements but

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.759 
and manipulating your requirements but
if<00:03:45.480> you're<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.750> type<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:45.989> person<00:03:46.110> who<00:03:46.440> can

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
if you're the type of person who can

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:47.930 
if you're the type of person who can
seem<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> get<00:03:47.280> away<00:03:47.400> with<00:03:47.700> lower

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
seem to get away with lower

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.300 
seem to get away with lower
carbohydrates<00:03:48.660> okay<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.799> tend<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.100> operate

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
carbohydrates okay you tend to operate

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.000 
carbohydrates okay you tend to operate
well<00:03:50.880> energies<00:03:51.870> good<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.410> everything<00:03:52.860> in

between you know some people when you
lower<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.900> carbs<00:03:55.200> their<00:03:55.470> energy<00:03:55.769> sucks<00:03:56.010> no<00:03:56.190> my

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
lower the carbs their energy sucks no my

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.140 
lower the carbs their energy sucks no my
kind<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.549> stuff<00:03:56.670> but<00:03:56.760> if<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.060> those

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
kind of stuff but if you one of those

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.400 
kind of stuff but if you one of those
people<00:03:57.209> where<00:03:57.600> your<00:03:57.720> carbohydrates<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.260> be<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
people where your carbohydrates to be a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.590 
people where your carbohydrates to be a
little<00:03:58.590> bit<00:03:58.709> lower<00:03:59.060> those<00:04:00.060> are<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.269> people<00:04:00.390> I

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
little bit lower those are the people I

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.970 
little bit lower those are the people I
like<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.900> increase<00:04:01.200> their<00:04:01.440> protein<00:04:01.799> up<00:04:01.890> a

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
like to increase their protein up a

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.680 
like to increase their protein up a
little<00:04:02.190> bit<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:02.970> pretty<00:04:03.120> well<00:04:03.360> more

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
little bit I can do pretty well more

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.199 
little bit I can do pretty well more
carbohydrates<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.280> have<00:04:05.489> my<00:04:05.640> protein<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:06.060> try

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
carbohydrates so I have my protein I try

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.199 
carbohydrates so I have my protein I try
to<00:04:06.239> get<00:04:06.390> about<00:04:06.510> 1.5<00:04:07.320> 2<00:04:07.590> 1.75<00:04:08.040> grams<00:04:08.790> per<00:04:09.030> pound

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
to get about 1.5 2 1.75 grams per pound

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.600 
to get about 1.5 2 1.75 grams per pound
of<00:04:10.700> protein<00:04:11.700> per<00:04:11.910> gram<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.470> there<00:04:14.040> are<00:04:14.070> times

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
of protein per gram so there are times

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.009 
of protein per gram so there are times
where<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:14.910> like<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.360> protein<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.780> little

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
where I like to have protein a little

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.979 
where I like to have protein a little
bit<00:04:16.140> higher<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:17.190> understand<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.750> don't

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
bit higher just understand you don't

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.960 
bit higher just understand you don't
just<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.470> high<00:04:19.919> protein<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.459> then<00:04:20.640> also<00:04:20.789> new

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
just have high protein and then also new

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.550 
just have high protein and then also new
build<00:04:21.150> muscle<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.570> know<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:22.020> lot<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.169> people<00:04:22.260> who

build muscle I know a lot of people who

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.990 
build muscle I know a lot of people who
still<00:04:23.310> hit<00:04:23.460> their<00:04:23.580> calorie

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
still hit their calorie

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 
still hit their calorie

carbs<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:35.940> little<00:04:36.210> bit<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.330> fat<00:04:36.570> he's<00:04:36.780> like

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
carbs and a little bit of fat he's like

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.300 
carbs and a little bit of fat he's like
yeah<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.230> then<00:04:37.320> I'm<00:04:37.410> not<00:04:37.560> getting<00:04:37.800> any<00:04:37.950> carbs

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
yeah and then I'm not getting any carbs

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.700 
yeah and then I'm not getting any carbs
well<00:04:38.460> he's<00:04:39.060> not<00:04:39.270> understanding<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:40.080> your

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
well he's not understanding that your

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.770 
well he's not understanding that your
body<00:04:40.920> will<00:04:41.130> go<00:04:41.280> through<00:04:41.610> i<00:04:42.030> believe<00:04:42.630> it's

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
body will go through i believe it's

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.140 
body will go through i believe it's
pronounced<00:04:43.170> gluconeogenesis<00:04:44.060> where<00:04:45.060> your

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
pronounced gluconeogenesis where your

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.700 
pronounced gluconeogenesis where your
body<00:04:45.300> actually<00:04:45.480> converts<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.410> one<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
body actually converts and one of the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.750 
body actually converts and one of the
things<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.950> they<00:04:47.130> can<00:04:47.160> be<00:04:47.430> conferred<00:04:47.730> to

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
things that they can be conferred to

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.640 
things that they can be conferred to
convert<00:04:48.120> several<00:04:48.450> things<00:04:48.660> into<00:04:48.990> glucose<00:04:49.410> or

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
convert several things into glucose or

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.220 
convert several things into glucose or
basically<00:04:50.190> think<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.700> as<00:04:50.850> carbs<00:04:51.300> you

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
basically think of that as carbs you

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.810 
basically think of that as carbs you
know<00:04:52.350> sugar<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.710> ready<00:04:52.890> for<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.070> body<00:04:53.220> it'll

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
know sugar is ready for the body it'll

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.730 
know sugar is ready for the body it'll
actually<00:04:53.940> convert<00:04:54.480> amino<00:04:54.840> acids<00:04:55.290> or<00:04:55.590> your

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
actually convert amino acids or your

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.790 
actually convert amino acids or your
protein<00:04:56.300> into<00:04:57.300> usable<00:04:57.660> glucose<00:04:57.960> so<00:04:58.620> it's<00:04:58.770> like

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
protein into usable glucose so it's like

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.870 
protein into usable glucose so it's like
man<00:04:59.040> you<00:04:59.190> may<00:04:59.310> not<00:04:59.430> think<00:04:59.490> you're<00:04:59.730> eating

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
man you may not think you're eating

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.640 
man you may not think you're eating
carbs<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.419> actually<00:05:00.570> are<00:05:01.140> getting<00:05:01.560> in

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
carbs but you actually are getting in

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.560 
carbs but you actually are getting in
glucose<00:05:02.040> because<00:05:02.220> your<00:05:02.669> body<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.120> inefficient

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
glucose because your body is inefficient

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.000 
glucose because your body is inefficient
it's<00:05:04.050> going<00:05:04.290> through<00:05:04.500> in<00:05:04.620> my<00:05:04.650> opinion

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
it's going through in my opinion

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.310 
it's going through in my opinion
inefficient<00:05:05.640> process<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.690> create<00:05:06.840> glucose

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
inefficient process to create glucose

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.610 
inefficient process to create glucose
for<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.250> body<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.520> use<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.990> have<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.410> have

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
for the body to use so you have to have

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.230 
for the body to use so you have to have
a<00:05:10.650> balance<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.160> as<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.520> whole<00:05:11.760> that's<00:05:11.910> kind<00:05:12.210> of

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
a balance that as a whole that's kind of

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.420 
a balance that as a whole that's kind of
what<00:05:12.390> I'm<00:05:12.480> getting<00:05:12.780> at<00:05:12.900> get<00:05:13.860> yourself<00:05:14.220> at

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
what I'm getting at get yourself at

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.150 
what I'm getting at get yourself at
least<00:05:14.640> one<00:05:14.880> gram<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.450> I<00:05:15.590> will<00:05:16.590> go<00:05:16.680> out<00:05:16.800> there<00:05:17.040> and

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
least one gram I I will go out there and

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.500 
least one gram I I will go out there and
say<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.550> do<00:05:17.640> like<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.000> little<00:05:18.240> bit<00:05:18.360> higher

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
say that I do like a little bit higher

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.800 
say that I do like a little bit higher
1.25<00:05:19.410> maybe<00:05:19.980> to<00:05:20.100> 1.5<00:05:20.580> grams<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:21.000> protein<00:05:21.120> what

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
1.25 maybe to 1.5 grams of protein what

the next to it put how many grams of

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.600 
the next to it put how many grams of
protein<00:05:34.169> you<00:05:34.440> hit<00:05:34.590> per<00:05:34.740> day<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:35.130> then<00:05:35.490> any

protein you hit per day and then any

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.670 
protein you hit per day and then any
little<00:05:35.910> opinions<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.330> got<00:05:36.479> on<00:05:36.630> there<00:05:36.750> right

around 300 to 320 grams of protein per
day<00:05:43.710> that's<00:05:44.340> what<00:05:44.520> i<00:05:44.550> do<00:05:44.640> i<00:05:45.000> keep<00:05:45.120> my

that's<00:05:53.040> how<00:05:53.669> you<00:05:53.729> get<00:05:53.910> results<00:05:54.090> okay<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.290> in

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
that's how you get results okay so in

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.990 
that's how you get results okay so in
future<00:05:55.770> videos<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.430> guys<00:05:56.520> are<00:05:56.669> going<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:56.850> see

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
future videos you guys are going to see

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.219 
future videos you guys are going to see
me<00:05:57.060> talk<00:05:57.300> about<00:05:57.330> this<00:05:57.630> some<00:05:57.780> relevance<00:05:58.110> to

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
me talk about this some relevance to

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.780 
me talk about this some relevance to
carbs<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:58.680> fats<00:05:58.860> because<00:05:59.040> it<00:05:59.340> can<00:05:59.550> get<00:05:59.729> a

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
carbs and fats because it can get a

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.490 
carbs and fats because it can get a
little<00:06:00.000> bit<00:06:00.180> more<00:06:00.330> detail<00:06:00.720> on<00:06:00.900> when<00:06:01.470> to

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
little bit more detail on when to
