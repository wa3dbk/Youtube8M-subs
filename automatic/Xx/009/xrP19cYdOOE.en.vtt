00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 they ignore this fight here they are a novelty hall 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.580
 so that's when the key that wins the key league goes

 We can put 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
 music ahead of the game 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.210

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.309

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.929
 the cheek pieces 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.059
 but what I think we can not choose the color is this moment of 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.429
 relaxation 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.419
