00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
character so I'm gonna kind of go that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.810 
character so I'm gonna kind of go that
same<00:01:23.549> route<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.090> making<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.630> huge<00:01:25.170> mouth

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.750 
so I'm gonna put that vertice at the
corner<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.970> mouth<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.800> you'll<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.610> that

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
corner of the mouth and you'll see that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.240 
corner of the mouth and you'll see that
these<00:02:59.970> are<00:03:00.150> all<00:03:00.300> quat<00:03:02.900> I'll<00:03:03.900> slip<00:03:04.230> switch<00:03:05.040> it

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
these are all quat I'll slip switch it

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:17.490 
these are all quat I'll slip switch it
to<00:03:05.280> faces<00:03:07.760> get<00:03:08.760> rid<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.940> all<00:03:09.180> these<00:03:09.330> faces<00:03:09.930> here

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.780 

X<00:03:18.130> faces<00:03:19.560> now<00:03:20.560> as<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:20.860> wanted<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.280> opening<00:03:21.670> of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
X faces now as I wanted the opening of

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.970 
X faces now as I wanted the opening of
the<00:03:21.880> mouth<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.450> go<00:03:22.720> into<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.290> character<00:03:23.740> more

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
the mouth to go into the character more

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.190 
the mouth to go into the character more
I<00:03:24.190> could<00:03:24.580> do<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.910> by<00:03:25.180> going<00:03:25.420> into<00:03:25.660> edges

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:39.660 

holding<00:03:29.200> alt<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.770> shift<00:03:35.490> ctrl<00:03:36.490> E<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:38.670> then

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
holding alt and shift ctrl E and then

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.390 
holding alt and shift ctrl E and then
just<00:03:39.970> go<00:03:40.270> back<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.780> now<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> lot<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.250> times

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
just go back with it now a lot of times

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.080 
just go back with it now a lot of times
I<00:03:42.670> like<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.880> hit<00:03:43.180> right-click<00:03:44.080> here<00:03:45.090> switch

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
I like to hit right-click here switch

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:56.449 
I like to hit right-click here switch
back<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:47.010> global<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.250> just<00:03:49.060> push<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.420> back<00:03:55.080> and

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
back to global and just push it back and

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.710 
back to global and just push it back and
then<00:03:57.459> if<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.940> hit<00:03:58.150> R<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.720> keyboard<00:03:58.750> I<00:04:00.720> can

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
then if I hit R on the keyboard I can

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.839 
then if I hit R on the keyboard I can
stretch<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.200> out<00:04:02.380> some

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.059 

a<00:04:09.750> couple<00:04:10.620> times<00:04:10.890> with<00:04:11.189> the<00:04:11.280> old<00:04:11.430> smooth<00:04:11.879> vert

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
a couple times with the old smooth vert

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.229 
a couple times with the old smooth vert
will<00:04:14.069> yield<00:04:14.519> some<00:04:14.790> really<00:04:15.000> good<00:04:15.120> results<00:04:15.329> too

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
will yield some really good results too

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.879 
will yield some really good results too
but<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.359> got<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.660> careful<00:04:19.049> because<00:04:19.199> what

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
but you got to be careful because what

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.890 
but you got to be careful because what
you<00:04:20.009> don't<00:04:20.220> want<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> do<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.850> ruin<00:04:21.630> this

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
you don't want to do is ruin this

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.170 
you don't want to do is ruin this
midline<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:26.190> if<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.340> go<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.550> seven<00:04:26.970> on<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
midline so if I go to seven on the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.159 
midline so if I go to seven on the
keyboard<00:04:29.150> you'll<00:04:30.150> see<00:04:30.389> that<00:04:30.539> this<00:04:30.810> one<00:04:31.020> right

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
keyboard you'll see that this one right

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.379 
keyboard you'll see that this one right
here<00:04:31.669> needs<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.880> go<00:04:33.060> over<00:04:33.270> further<00:04:34.699> or<00:04:35.699> when<00:04:36.360> I

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
here needs to go over further or when I

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.120 
here needs to go over further or when I
go<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.750> mirror<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.740> will<00:04:38.250> not<00:04:38.460> connect

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
go to mirror it it will not connect

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.300 
go to mirror it it will not connect
there<00:04:41.130> we<00:04:41.250> go<00:04:41.430> perfect<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.919> there's<00:04:44.099> my

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
there we go perfect so there's my

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.879 
there we go perfect so there's my
opening<00:04:44.729> that<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.000> need<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:46.440> all<00:04:46.530> depends

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
opening that I need and it all depends

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.070 
opening that I need and it all depends
how<00:04:46.979> far<00:04:47.190> back<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.639> needed<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.030> go<00:04:48.240> or<00:04:48.660> how

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
how far back you needed to go or how

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.820 
how far back you needed to go or how
open<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.830> want<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.940> know<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.150> can

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
open you want it you know you can

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.200 
open you want it you know you can
manipulate<00:04:52.830> these<00:04:53.280> vertices<00:04:53.610> all<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.000> want

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
manipulate these vertices all you want

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.540 
manipulate these vertices all you want
all<00:04:55.139> right<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.770> let's<00:04:56.009> put<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.250> all<00:04:56.370> back

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
all right so let's put it all back

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.270 
all right so let's put it all back
together<00:04:57.949> get<00:04:58.949> into<00:04:59.539> object<00:05:00.539> mode<00:05:00.830> add<00:05:01.830> a

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
together get into object mode add a

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.020 
together get into object mode add a
modifier<00:05:05.150> Muir<00:05:06.889> what<00:05:07.889> I<00:05:07.919> like<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.340> do<00:05:08.460> here<00:05:08.880> is

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
modifier Muir what I like to do here is

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.820 
modifier Muir what I like to do here is
hit<00:05:09.449> tab<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.310> then<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:12.110> move<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.380> just<00:05:13.710> a

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
hit tab and then a move this just a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.480 
hit tab and then a move this just a
skosh<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.880> mean<00:05:15.570> an<00:05:15.750> absolute<00:05:16.020> skosh<00:05:16.830> not<00:05:17.190> just

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
skosh I mean an absolute skosh not just

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.689 
skosh I mean an absolute skosh not just
a<00:05:17.610> skosh<00:05:17.880> but<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:19.530> closest<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.220> can<00:05:20.280> get<00:05:20.610> to

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.610 

away<00:05:23.699> from<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:24.060> character<00:05:24.360> so<00:05:24.930> I'm<00:05:25.289> making

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
away from the character so I'm making

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.490 
away from the character so I'm making
this<00:05:25.940> little<00:05:26.940> tiny<00:05:27.210> gap<00:05:27.659> between<00:05:28.169> the

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
this little tiny gap between the

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.379 
this little tiny gap between the
character<00:05:28.919> and<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.190> other<00:05:29.250> character<00:05:29.729> the

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
character and the other character the

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.570 
character and the other character the
reason<00:05:30.720> I<00:05:30.810> do<00:05:30.870> this<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.260> when<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.039> go<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.280> merge

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
reason I do this is when I go to merge

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.350 
reason I do this is when I go to merge
limit<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.210> up<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.659> number<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.520> could<00:05:35.520> see<00:05:35.789> 100%

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
limit and up the number I could see 100%

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:44.420 
limit and up the number I could see 100%
that<00:05:36.810> they<00:05:36.960> they<00:05:37.470> in<00:05:37.620> fact<00:05:37.830> merged<00:05:43.159> okay

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
that they they in fact merged okay

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.000 
that they they in fact merged okay
hit<00:05:45.030> tab<00:05:45.390> again<00:05:45.420> to<00:05:45.930> get<00:05:46.080> an<00:05:46.170> object<00:05:46.590> mode<00:05:46.740> and

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
hit tab again to get an object mode and

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.670 
hit tab again to get an object mode and
just<00:05:47.850> study<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.660> topology<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.350> make<00:05:49.500> sure

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
just study the topology to make sure

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:58.670 
just study the topology to make sure
it's<00:05:49.830> okay<00:05:53.270> very<00:05:54.270> very<00:05:54.720> cool<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:57.080> just<00:05:58.080> make

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
it's okay very very cool and just make

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.680 
it's okay very very cool and just make
sure<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:59.010> the<00:06:00.440> under<00:06:01.440> sculpt<00:06:01.830> mode<00:06:02.690> that

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
sure that the under sculpt mode that

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.560 
sure that the under sculpt mode that
vertices<00:06:04.320> line<00:06:04.620> up<00:06:04.860> tit<00:06:05.130> for<00:06:05.310> tat<00:06:05.550> in<00:06:06.420> other

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
vertices line up tit for tat in other

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.950 
vertices line up tit for tat in other
words<00:06:06.750> if<00:06:06.900> I<00:06:07.020> go<00:06:07.230> into<00:06:07.440> F<00:06:08.130> grab<00:06:08.940> I<00:06:09.210> should<00:06:09.840> be

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
have to grab this that non-mirrored side

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.090 
have to grab this that non-mirrored side
and<00:06:35.910> so<00:06:36.060> besides<00:06:36.510> my<00:06:36.690> mirrored<00:06:37.020> side<00:06:37.230> besides

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
and so besides my mirrored side besides

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.790 
and so besides my mirrored side besides
mine<00:06:38.280> on<00:06:38.430> your<00:06:38.700> set<00:06:38.970> and<00:06:39.240> sure<00:06:39.900> enough<00:06:40.170> what

mine on your set and sure enough what
I'll<00:06:40.920> do<00:06:41.070> is<00:06:41.250> just<00:06:41.790> generally<00:06:42.240> make<00:06:42.390> my<00:06:42.570> brush

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
I'll do is just generally make my brush

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.380 
I'll do is just generally make my brush
really<00:06:43.260> really<00:06:43.530> really<00:06:43.800> small<00:06:44.300> using<00:06:45.300> the

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
really really really small using the

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.150 
really really really small using the
bracket<00:06:45.780> keys<00:06:45.810> just<00:06:46.590> to<00:06:46.680> make<00:06:46.830> sure<00:06:46.980> my

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
bracket keys just to make sure my

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.090 
bracket keys just to make sure my
symmetry<00:06:47.700> points<00:06:48.150> are<00:06:48.270> on<00:06:51.860> yeah<00:06:52.860> that's

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
symmetry points are on yeah that's

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:00.090 
symmetry points are on yeah that's
really<00:06:53.340> good

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.740 

perfect

all<00:07:01.900> right<00:07:02.050> happy<00:07:02.620> with<00:07:02.770> the<00:07:02.860> cemetry<00:07:03.310> good

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
all right happy with the cemetry good

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.440 
all right happy with the cemetry good
topology<00:07:05.670> already<00:07:06.670> for<00:07:06.880> the<00:07:07.000> next<00:07:07.240> stage

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
topology already for the next stage

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.450 
topology already for the next stage
which<00:07:07.780> is<00:07:07.960> just<00:07:08.170> kind<00:07:08.350> of<00:07:08.440> generally<00:07:09.100> pushing

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
which is just kind of generally pushing

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.010 
which is just kind of generally pushing
this<00:07:09.580> vertices<00:07:09.970> around<00:07:10.240> but<00:07:10.660> that's<00:07:10.840> how<00:07:10.990> you

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
this vertices around but that's how you

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.400 
this vertices around but that's how you
handle<00:07:11.790> the<00:07:12.790> character's<00:07:13.270> mouth<00:07:13.630> if<00:07:14.080> you

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
handle the character's mouth if you

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.100 
handle the character's mouth if you
started<00:07:14.860> off<00:07:15.070> from<00:07:15.520> some<00:07:16.000> kind<00:07:16.210> of<00:07:16.270> like<00:07:16.450> weird

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110
