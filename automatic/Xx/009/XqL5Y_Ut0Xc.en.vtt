the jack socket in the LEDs come on what

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.160 
the jack socket in the LEDs come on what
happens<00:00:33.940> now<00:00:34.149> is<00:00:34.390> when<00:00:34.600> you're<00:00:34.750> in<00:00:34.870> read<00:00:35.140> mode

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
you've got this coil is lime is false

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.529 
you've got this coil is lime is false
then<00:00:38.110> this<00:00:38.379> girl's<00:00:38.680> life<00:00:38.980> is<00:00:39.010> full<00:00:39.520> then<00:00:39.910> same

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
with the bridge pickup with the pan box

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.910 
with the bridge pickup with the pan box
and<00:00:42.489> what<00:00:42.579> we<00:00:42.760> have<00:00:42.910> here<00:00:43.180> in<00:00:43.660> effect<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.230> 2p

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
and what we have here in effect of 2p

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.430 
and what we have here in effect of 2p
bases<00:00:45.430> now<00:00:46.090> when<00:00:46.360> we<00:00:46.510> move<00:00:46.720> over<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:47.170> green

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
bases now when we move over to green

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.610 
bases now when we move over to green
this<00:00:48.040> pickup<00:00:48.430> now<00:00:48.610> ships<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.600> back<00:00:49.810> same

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
this pickup now ships to the back same

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.220 
this pickup now ships to the back same
here<00:00:50.920> we<00:00:51.130> now<00:00:51.310> have<00:00:51.550> two<00:00:51.790> single<00:00:52.540> coil<00:00:52.780> pickups

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
here we now have two single coil pickups

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.130 
here we now have two single coil pickups
moving<00:00:54.100> on<00:00:54.220> from<00:00:54.430> that<00:00:54.520> we<00:00:55.239> now<00:00:55.390> have<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.690> full

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
moving on from that we now have a full

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.889 
moving on from that we now have a full
humbucker<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.670> what<00:00:57.820> this<00:00:57.970> in<00:00:58.149> effect<00:00:58.480> does<00:00:58.690> is

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
humbucker so what this in effect does is

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.740 
humbucker so what this in effect does is
actually<00:00:59.320> give<00:00:59.500> us

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
actually give us

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.050 
actually give us
fifteen<00:01:01.650> if<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.310> those<00:01:02.520> different

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
fifteen if you can see those different

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.080 
fifteen if you can see those different
pickup<00:01:03.420> configurations<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.640> great

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pickup configurations and the great

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
pickup configurations and the great
thing<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.840> super<00:01:07.140> quad<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> no<00:01:07.680> matter

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
thing about the super quad is no matter

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.820 
thing about the super quad is no matter
what<00:01:08.130> mode<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.790> choose<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.720> DB<00:01:10.170> level<00:01:10.380> stays

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
what mode you choose the DB level stays

what mode you choose the DB level stays
the<00:01:11.010> same<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.330> mix<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.780> match<00:01:12.840> any<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the same so you can mix and match any of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740 
the same so you can mix and match any of
those<00:01:13.650> great<00:01:14.100> traditional<00:01:14.760> pickup<00:01:15.210> sounds

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
contemporary ones like a humbucker in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070 
contemporary ones like a humbucker in
the<00:01:26.490> bridge<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.030> split<00:01:27.360> coil<00:01:27.630> I'm

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the bridge and a split coil I'm

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
the bridge and a split coil I'm
buttering<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> neck<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> split<00:01:29.220> coil<00:01:29.520> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
buttering the neck and a split coil in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
buttering the neck and a split coil in
the<00:01:30.210> bridge<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.590> start

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the bridge so you can really start

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
the bridge so you can really start
experimenting<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.940> opening<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.390> using<00:01:33.990> the

experimenting and opening up using the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.469 
experimenting and opening up using the
pickups<00:01:34.649> now<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.220> tone<00:01:35.460> generator<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
pickups now as your tone generator and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
not just running over the preamp the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.580 
not just running over the preamp the
pickups<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.720> fitted<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> our<00:01:40.290> very<00:01:40.500> own

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
pickups here are fitted to our very own

bass<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.160> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> our<00:01:41.930> Enfield

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
bass as well this is our Enfield

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.400 
bass as well this is our Enfield
Lionheart<00:01:43.590> bass<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:45.240> bass<00:01:46.050> that<00:01:46.229> we've

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
Lionheart bass this is a bass that we've

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.800 
Lionheart bass this is a bass that we've
developed<00:01:46.590> two<00:01:47.430> years<00:01:47.729> ago<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.690> we

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
developed two years ago now so that we

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.779 
developed two years ago now so that we
could<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.170> show<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> pickups<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.700> what

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
could really show the pickups and what

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.180 
could really show the pickups and what
the<00:01:50.910> pickups<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.160> are

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
the pickups do and with this we are

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.910 
the pickups do and with this we are
bidding<00:01:53.789> with<00:01:53.940> our<00:01:54.090> two<00:01:54.270> band<00:01:54.509> EQ<00:01:55.380> block<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
bidding with our two band EQ block and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.380 
bidding with our two band EQ block and
clang<00:01:56.130> hand<00:01:56.759> pot<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.390> volume<00:01:58.110> port<00:01:58.380> also

clang hand pot and volume port also

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.370 
clang hand pot and volume port also
traditionally<00:02:00.390> we've<00:02:00.539> always<00:02:00.720> been<00:02:00.930> involved

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
traditionally we've always been involved

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.740 
traditionally we've always been involved
with<00:02:01.410> LEDs<00:02:01.920> before<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.600> we've

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
with LEDs before so in this one we've

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.749 
with LEDs before so in this one we've
also<00:02:03.899> created<00:02:04.440> our

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
also created our

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
also created our
which<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> retrofit<00:02:07.020> system<00:02:07.530> which<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.160> can

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
which is a retrofit system which we can

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.400 
which is a retrofit system which we can
