00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
on the sand casted pieces they have a

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.700 
on the sand casted pieces they have a
surface<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> very<00:00:54.899> granular<00:00:55.229> which<00:00:55.589> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
surface which is very granular which is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.700 
surface which is very granular which is
the<00:00:55.829> surface<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> sand<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.409> make<00:00:58.409> sure<00:00:58.559> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the surface of the sand I make sure that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.609 
the surface of the sand I make sure that
the<00:00:58.890> forms<00:00:59.309> themselves<00:00:59.549> are<00:01:00.239> emphasized<00:01:01.199> are

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:01.619 
the forms themselves are emphasized are

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:03.560 
the forms themselves are emphasized are
finished<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.580> way<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.729> want<00:01:03.089> them<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:03.540> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
finished the way I want them and then I

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.109 
finished the way I want them and then I
give<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> piece<00:01:04.259> to<00:01:04.530> him<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.880> way

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
give the piece to him and then this way

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.230 
give the piece to him and then this way
we<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> final<00:01:07.020> polish<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:08.119> for<00:01:09.119> the

big pieces is tremendous help
I<00:01:14.810> don't<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:16.080> preliminary<00:01:16.650> sketches<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.400> my

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
I don't do preliminary sketches for my

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.149 
I don't do preliminary sketches for my
sculptures<00:01:18.270> their<00:01:19.229> drawings<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> sake

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
sculptures their drawings for the sake

sculptures their drawings for the sake
of<00:01:20.189> drawing<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:34.789> draw<00:01:35.789> very<00:01:36.710> quietly<00:01:37.710> very

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of drawing I draw very quietly very

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.309 
of drawing I draw very quietly very
meticulously<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.240> may<00:01:39.450> take<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.869> three<00:01:40.170> or

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
meticulously it may take me three or

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.889 
meticulously it may take me three or
four<00:01:40.590> five<00:01:40.829> days<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> drawing<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.689> with

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
four five days to do a drawing but with

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.569 
four five days to do a drawing but with
the<00:01:43.079> sculpture<00:01:43.469> I'm<00:01:43.619> much<00:01:43.799> more<00:01:44.039> in<00:01:44.159> patient<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the sculpture I'm much more in patient I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.099 
the sculpture I'm much more in patient I
want<00:01:44.789> to<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:44.999> it<00:01:45.090> right<00:01:45.210> away<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.929> see

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
want to see it right away I want to see

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.489 
want to see it right away I want to see
it<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.409> want<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.249> at<00:01:47.340> least<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.759> basic<00:01:48.119> form

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
it I want to see at least the basic form

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.270 
it I want to see at least the basic form
very<00:01:49.499> quickly

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
very quickly

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.300 
very quickly
I<00:01:52.789> enjoyed<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:54.329> physical<00:01:54.810> labor<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.350> making

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
I enjoyed the physical labor of making

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.359 
I enjoyed the physical labor of making
sculptures<00:01:56.759> much<00:01:56.999> more<00:01:57.299> than<00:01:57.810> working<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
sculptures much more than working in a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.559 
sculptures much more than working in a
work<00:01:59.939> table<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.649> first<00:02:01.950> step<00:02:02.819> is<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.359> make<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
work table the first step is to make the

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.169 
work table the first step is to make the
sheets<00:02:03.959> of<00:02:04.139> wax<00:02:04.289> which<00:02:04.709> I<00:02:04.889> die<00:02:04.950> stack<00:02:05.429> up<00:02:05.700> until

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
sheets of wax which I die stack up until

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.900 
sheets of wax which I die stack up until
I<00:02:06.209> have<00:02:06.450> four<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:06.929> five<00:02:07.139> or<00:02:07.380> six<00:02:07.580> large<00:02:08.580> sheets

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
I have four or five or six large sheets

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
I have four or five or six large sheets
and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.330> start<00:02:09.660> cutting<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.350> working<00:02:10.860> in

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and then I start cutting and working in

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.520 
and then I start cutting and working in
bending<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.850> use<00:02:12.090> heat<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.690> hot

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
bending and I use heat and hot

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280 
bending and I use heat and hot
instruments<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.640> cut<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.450> weld<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
instruments to cut and to weld the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.400 
instruments to cut and to weld the
pieces<00:02:16.500> together<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.270> way<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.870> build

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
pieces together and in this way I build

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.910 
pieces together and in this way I build
up<00:02:19.560> slowly<00:02:19.819> by<00:02:20.819> adding

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
up slowly by adding

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.220 
up slowly by adding
pieces<00:02:22.280> were<00:02:22.310> subtracting<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.780> basic

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
pieces were subtracting and the basic

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.309 
pieces were subtracting and the basic
shape<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.740> sculpture<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.630> last<00:02:26.870> few

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
shape of the sculpture the last few

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.420 
shape of the sculpture the last few
sculptures<00:02:27.739> happen<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:29.319> relief<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.680> think<00:02:31.280> it's

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
sculptures happen in relief I think it's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.270 
sculptures happen in relief I think it's
because<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:31.819> mean<00:02:32.180> I'm<00:02:32.360> combining<00:02:33.020> these<00:02:33.280> these

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
because I mean I'm combining these these

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.000 
because I mean I'm combining these these
sculptures<00:02:34.700> with<00:02:35.630> another<00:02:36.230> material<00:02:36.440> which

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
sculptures with another material which

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.030 
sculptures with another material which
is<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> silk<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:38.000> wall<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.620> seems<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.800> lend

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
is a silk or wall and seems to lend

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.420 
is a silk or wall and seems to lend
itself<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> sort<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.120> flat<00:02:41.890> relief<00:02:42.890> surface

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
itself to a sort of flat relief surface

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.720 
itself to a sort of flat relief surface
rather<00:02:43.610> than<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.940> three-dimensional<00:02:44.870> one

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
rather than a three-dimensional one

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.979 
rather than a three-dimensional one
taking<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.819> hard<00:02:47.090> material<00:02:47.270> in<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.720> soft

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
taking a hard material in a soft

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.509 
taking a hard material in a soft
material<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.650> making<00:02:48.860> them<00:02:49.100> work<00:02:49.280> together

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
material and making them work together

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.770 
material and making them work together
this<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.690> my<00:02:51.319> way<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.769> trying<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.780> relate

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
this is my way of trying to relate

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.770 
this is my way of trying to relate
African<00:02:54.500> sculpture<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:55.550> my<00:02:56.209> way<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.569> working

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
African sculpture to my way of working

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.530 
African sculpture to my way of working
because<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:58.220> am<00:02:58.640> NOT<00:02:59.180> African<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.110> my<00:03:01.540> cultural

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
because I am NOT African and my cultural

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.170 
because I am NOT African and my cultural
background<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:03.230> something<00:03:03.620> not<00:03:03.980> African<00:03:04.549> but
