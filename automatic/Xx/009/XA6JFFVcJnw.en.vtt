what I ended up doing was I just went
ahead<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.489> went<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:59.000> ebay<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.750> i<00:01:00.530> purchased

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.550 
ahead and went to ebay and i purchased

her for 1799 and chipping was 7 35 but

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.290 
her for 1799 and chipping was 7 35 but
it<00:01:06.680> was<00:01:06.770> because<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.369> person<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.030> had

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
it was because of the person that had

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.109 
it was because of the person that had
advertised<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.289> guess<00:01:09.890> that's<00:01:10.160> kind<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:11.000> how

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
advertised I guess that's kind of how

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.250 
advertised I guess that's kind of how
much<00:01:11.210> she<00:01:11.390> wanted<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.690> charge<00:01:11.899> for<00:01:12.080> shipping

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
much she wanted to charge for shipping

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.260 
much she wanted to charge for shipping
but<00:01:13.210> this<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.479> her<00:01:15.049> she<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.220> gorgeous<00:01:16.700> I'm

it's<00:01:49.070> simple<00:01:49.460> if<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:49.759> gets<00:01:49.909> quick<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:51.110> anywho

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
it's simple if it gets quick but anywho

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.850 
it's simple if it gets quick but anywho
so<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.520> can<00:01:52.640> see<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:52.820> have<00:01:52.880> my<00:01:53.030> cap<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.600> them

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
and I pushed it back because I wasn't

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.260 
and I pushed it back because I wasn't
sure<00:01:56.810> how<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.829> front<00:01:58.310> was<00:01:58.520> going<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.790> look<00:01:58.970> but

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
sure how the front was going to look but

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.330 
sure how the front was going to look but
if<00:01:59.509> you<00:01:59.630> can<00:01:59.780> see<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.200> has<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:01.390> comb<00:02:02.470> in<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
if you can see it has a comb in the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.530 
if you can see it has a comb in the
front<00:02:04.610> here<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:06.049> then<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:07.040> has<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.670> very<00:02:07.939> small

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
front here and then it has a very small

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.630 
front here and then it has a very small
home<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.019> back<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:10.040> we'll<00:02:10.220> see<00:02:10.459> how<00:02:10.489> this

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
home in the back so we'll see how this
