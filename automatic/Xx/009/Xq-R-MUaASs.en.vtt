point<00:00:14.340> four<00:00:14.700> point<00:00:14.730> six<00:00:15.030> whatever<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.450> is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
point four point six whatever it is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.000 
point four point six whatever it is
right<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:19.140> took<00:00:19.260> me<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.439> lot<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.740> find

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
right now so it took me a lot of find

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.859 
right now so it took me a lot of find
all<00:00:20.160> these<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.210> actually<00:00:21.390> relatively

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
all these but it's actually relatively

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.710 
all these but it's actually relatively
simple<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.650> install<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.660> you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
simple to install and it's just so you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.859 
simple to install and it's just so you
can<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> little<00:00:25.470> mo<00:00:25.710> creatures<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.869> drop

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
coins when you kill them it works at one

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.990 
coins when you kill them it works at one
point<00:00:31.470> four<00:00:31.800> point<00:00:31.830> five<00:00:32.369> still<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> don't

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
point four point five still I don't

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.040 
point four point five still I don't
think<00:00:33.120> they've<00:00:33.360> done<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.719> point<00:00:33.899> four<00:00:34.020> point

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
think they've done one point four point

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
think they've done one point four point
six<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.739> time<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.489> probably<00:00:35.700> about

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
six at this time but they probably about

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.869 
six at this time but they probably about
time<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.300> guys<00:00:36.420> watch<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.530> uh<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:38.010> thing

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
time you guys watch this but uh I thing

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
time you guys watch this but uh I thing
is<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.120> haven't<00:00:39.329> connected<00:00:39.719> mo<00:00:40.050> creatures

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
is they haven't connected mo creatures

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260 
is they haven't connected mo creatures
and<00:00:40.710> tale<00:00:40.920> Kingdom<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> thought<00:00:41.969> I'd<00:00:42.120> make

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and tale Kingdom so I thought I'd make

ok once you've done that you can

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990 
ok once you've done that you can
minimize<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.200> run<00:01:22.409> minecraft<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
minimize that just run minecraft so you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.320
