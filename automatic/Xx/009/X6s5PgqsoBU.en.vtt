perfect for all of my summer tops and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.619 
perfect for all of my summer tops and
everything<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:28.980> kind<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.310> hangs<00:03:29.970> down<00:03:30.239> lower

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
everything that kind of hangs down lower
