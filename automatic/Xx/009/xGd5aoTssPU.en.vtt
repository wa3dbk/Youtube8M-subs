00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello friends and welcome to another tuto 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.519
 Tuesday, today I'm going to draw you a picture 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.070
 3d 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.609
 start tracing what is going to be a 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.340
 hole to the depth of the earth is 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.500
 important to give the effect of 3d that 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.369
 all the lines that I'm going to put in 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.890
 of the hole go to match the point 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.469
 from where you will see then 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.289
 subject a rule that will be fixed in 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.870
 the base of the camera and the other end the 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.180
 I move like a compass so that all 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.670
 lines are going to match the same point 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.190
 to trace a post he cited that he will be 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.989
 coming out I use the same technique but with 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.880
 a stick a little longer because the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.860
 rule was not enough 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.810
 then he put a ball to help me 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.239
 make a sphere in perspective I put 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.610
 points on the base on the sides and up 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.220
 up and up by the perspective 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.940
 I would stay here 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.510
 and one of the points forming an ellipse 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.150
 this ellipse 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.970
 seen from the camera that has our 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.220
 main point of view will appear 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.860
 as if it were a circle 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.340
 and now after just that it's going to be a leaf 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340
 of paper 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.479
 in this part I'm going to draw an eye that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.479
 is spying on us from the depth 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.330
 I continually peek through the camera 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.600
 to see what is going on like 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.600
 I want 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.050
 I start to shade I'll do as if 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 the light came from above to the left 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.740
 you always have to choose a point of light 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.740
 and be consistent in everything we do 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.500
 I give a tone to the background leaving in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.770
 white the sheet of paper that has the today 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.670
 chairs of all this is very surreal 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.590
 also darken the back and 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.980
 then he faded with the brush to be 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.980
 stop 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.230
 I give some shade to my sheet 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 fictitious and with an eraser I erase the tone 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.120
 what's in the little corner so 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.310
 it seems that installing light then and it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.890
 he noticed but when he blurs the background with 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.650
 the brush passes me over the leaf 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.500
 to give it a tone I repeat the same 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.570
 effect on this shore so that like that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 he gets up and with the brush I give him a 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.740
 tone there together to darken luisa range 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.020
 you live after some shadow to the post 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.320
 that blew with the brush to make it 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.320
 softer 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.460
 very well now we have to give volume to 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.460
 eye 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.140
 to make the pupil I use a prism 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.680
 black because I want it to be 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.940
 good black black and the graphite does not reach 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800
 that tone 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.040
 instead the iris I do it with a prism 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.750
 blue color this is how you are seeing if 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.290
 you do not look at it from the point of view 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.290
 Right 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.439
 instead seen from here already begins to 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:31.689
 take the volume of the third dimension 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:34.140
 of some tabs and more lights and 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.140
 shades 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.299
 I'm going to erase this part because I think that 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.299
 it would look better with the more open eye 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.870
 A) Yes 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.090
 I review the edges of the tube so that 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.090
 stand out more 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.600
 already with the reflections with the eraser and 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.600
 some capillaries with the color prism 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.030
 the last master touches and ready by 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.030
 please tell me what did you think 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.850
 if you liked it please give it a like and 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.650
 subscribe to the channel you know where 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.889
 you can follow me where the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.889
