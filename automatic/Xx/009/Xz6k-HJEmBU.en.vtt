00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
running across the pond to run into gas

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.949 
running across the pond to run into gas
and<00:01:35.520> you'll<00:01:35.969> eventually<00:01:36.209> they<00:01:36.539> will<00:01:36.689> stop

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
and you'll eventually they will stop

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.929 
and you'll eventually they will stop
spawning<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.529> and<00:01:37.709> they'll<00:01:38.189> stop<00:01:38.520> running

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
spawning there and they'll stop running

spawning there and they'll stop running
to<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.749> then<00:01:39.959> what<00:01:40.289> I<00:01:40.319> like<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
you'll see me do this in the gameplay is

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.749 
you'll see me do this in the gameplay is
I<00:01:42.299> will<00:01:42.450> push<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.929> into<00:01:43.229> gas<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> normally

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I will push up into gas and I normally

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.889 
I will push up into gas and I normally
will<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.969> one<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.209> two<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.539> there<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.810> then

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
will be one or two in there and then

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
will be one or two in there and then
I'll<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.020> basically<00:01:46.469> run<00:01:46.709> a<00:01:46.740> circle<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.249> go

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
I'll just basically run a circle and go

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
I'll just basically run a circle and go
back<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> diner<00:01:47.969> do<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.389> same<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:48.659> all

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
back to diner do that same thing all

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.519 
back to diner do that same thing all
over<00:01:49.049> again<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.279> um<00:01:50.549> hopefully<00:01:51.109> you<00:01:52.109> guys<00:01:52.259> get

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:52.529 
over again so um hopefully you guys get

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.480 
over again so um hopefully you guys get
the<00:01:52.649> fuel<00:01:52.859> for<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.310> it's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the fuel for this because it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.949 
the fuel for this because it's
definitely<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:53.999> just<00:01:54.270> watch<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> video<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
definitely not just watch the video and

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.480 
definitely not just watch the video and
go<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> perfectly<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.099> to<00:01:56.310> get<00:01:56.459> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
go and do it perfectly you have to get a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.889 
go and do it perfectly you have to get a
feel<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.999> it<00:01:57.029> you<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.389> understand

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
feel for it you have to understand

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.749 
feel for it you have to understand
what's<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.139> on<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> another<00:01:59.340> thing<00:01:59.609> is

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
what's going on and another thing is

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.370 
what's going on and another thing is
watch<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.209> game<00:02:00.389> play<00:02:00.599> and<00:02:00.630> watch<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:01.289> I'm

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
watch the game play and watch what I'm

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.769 
watch the game play and watch what I'm
doing<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.919> of<00:02:02.039> learn<00:02:02.249> from<00:02:02.279> it<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.539> it

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:03.779 
doing kind of learn from it because it

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:05.330 
doing kind of learn from it because it
essentially<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.619> same<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.950> playing<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
essentially is the same as playing you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
essentially is the same as playing you
know<00:02:05.429> you<00:02:05.490> learn<00:02:05.849> you<00:02:06.359> can<00:02:06.509> watch<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.990> do

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
know you learn you can watch what I do

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.630 
know you learn you can watch what I do
you<00:02:07.289> can<00:02:07.409> kind<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.619> take<00:02:07.770> mental<00:02:08.099> notes<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you can kind of take mental notes on it

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.550 
you can kind of take mental notes on it
to<00:02:09.539> help<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.750> guys<00:02:09.869> run<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> spawn<00:02:10.349> trap

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
to help you guys run the spawn trap

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.960 
to help you guys run the spawn trap
better<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.069> about<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.579> that<00:02:11.790> side

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
better so that is about it for that side

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.759 
better so that is about it for that side
let's<00:02:12.150> jump<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.959> next<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.620> this

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
let's jump on to the next one so this

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.170 
let's jump on to the next one so this
one<00:02:13.829> is<00:02:14.099> when<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> are<00:02:14.489> on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.670> ghost<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.150> your

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
one is when you are on the ghost in your

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.850 
one is when you are on the ghost in your
attacking<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.750> Federation<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:16.620> this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
attacking the Federation now this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.520 
attacking the Federation now this
red<00:02:17.220> area<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> much<00:02:18.000> smaller<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.750> it's

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
red area is much smaller and it's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.440 
red area is much smaller and it's
definitely<00:02:20.010> easier<00:02:20.580> spawn<00:02:20.850> trap<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.210> do<00:02:21.300> than

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
definitely easier spawn trap to do than

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.820 
definitely easier spawn trap to do than
the<00:02:21.480> other<00:02:21.630> side<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.020> you're<00:02:22.200> basically<00:02:22.320> going

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the other side so you're basically going

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.860 
the other side so you're basically going
to<00:02:22.920> want<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.160> position<00:02:23.430> yourself<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.060> strip

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
to want to position yourself in strip

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.330 
to want to position yourself in strip
and<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.440> you'll<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.890> there<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.070> two

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and now you'll see that there are two

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.980 
and now you'll see that there are two
main<00:02:26.490> spawn<00:02:26.820> points<00:02:27.150> there's<00:02:27.300> behind<00:02:27.660> strip

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
main spawn points there's behind strip

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.930 
main spawn points there's behind strip
and<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.350> there's<00:02:28.530> by<00:02:28.770> their<00:02:29.070> originals<00:02:29.730> fun

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and then there's by their originals fun

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.160 
and then there's by their originals fun
with<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> baseball<00:02:30.330> diamond<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.840> right<00:02:31.050> next

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
with the baseball diamond is right next

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.350 
with the baseball diamond is right next
to<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> portal<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.640> order<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.090> them<00:02:33.330> to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
to the portal now in order for them to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.510 
to the portal now in order for them to
kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.870> cancel<00:02:34.380> out<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.770> spawn<00:02:35.250> where<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
kind of cancel out that spawn where the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.410 
kind of cancel out that spawn where the
portal<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.850> you're<00:02:35.970> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> want<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.330> have

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
portal is you're going to want to have

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.720 
portal is you're going to want to have
some<00:02:36.600> teammates<00:02:36.900> push<00:02:37.170> up<00:02:37.320> into<00:02:37.500> motel<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.130> um

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
some teammates push up into motel and um

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.400 
some teammates push up into motel and um
even<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.210> if<00:02:39.390> they're<00:02:39.690> still<00:02:39.870> spotting<00:02:40.230> there

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
even it if they're still spotting there

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.870 
even it if they're still spotting there
you<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.650> want<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.890> set<00:02:41.070> some<00:02:41.280> teammates<00:02:41.610> up

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
you don't want to set some teammates up
