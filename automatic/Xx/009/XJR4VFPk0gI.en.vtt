00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.660
 hello today I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.930
 nice cake with truffle decoration 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.500
 white chocolate and colored steban 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.909
 I hope you like the video we started 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.269
 making the drawing of our number 6 or 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.710
 9 I will prepare the number 6 or 9 as 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.829
 this number gives a lot of play 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.850
 I start so you can see the method of 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.850
 all the numbers 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.630
 and to make our white take 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 we need half a liter of cream or cream 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.730
 to beat we also need 250 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.020
 grams of white chocolate 50 grams of 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.840
 unsalted butter and 50 grams more than 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.290
 sugar in the cazuelita let's go 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:50.050
 adding cream or milk cream 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.050
 we will also add the sugar 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.140
 I'll settle for ice cream, we'll dissolve 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.520
 sugar together with chocolate and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.520
 then the butter 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.370
 and once they have dissolved all 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.040
 ingredients we will reserve in the fridge 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.880
 until you take the right point to 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.700
 ride it 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.580
 and that happens in two or three hours 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.630
 the processor we have put the cream of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.450
 beat with chocolate and now cool 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.340
 we are going to try to mount it with a lot 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.269
 Be careful not to be cut 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.269
 ah 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.700
 Well, we already have our cream 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.630
 now it's just filling the cake and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.180
 colored we will divide the cream into three or 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.210
 four balls that will depend if you want 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.310
 make many colors or less I 'm going to 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.010
 distribute for the moment in three and I'll 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.240
 coloring with brand dye 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.000
 vuitton 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.290
 these are gel and they are very good 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.050
 you can find in stores 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.890
 baking or online sale search in 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.620
 Google 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.620
 winston brand and you will appear 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.490
 why 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.010
 ah 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.230
 do not 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.580
 in a pastry bag and with a 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.190
 star nozzle let's try 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.370
 make a kind of flower garden 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.310
 so as I only have it is first 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.940
 I'll do the pink color and then the 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.940
 others all 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.919
 i 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.690
 that would be the totality of our number 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.450
 what could the number 6 do that 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.970
 the number 9 I hope you liked it and 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.170
 I wait for you in my next video a little kiss 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.680
 and until next time 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.680
 bye
