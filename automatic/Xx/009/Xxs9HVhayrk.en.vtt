00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
so I'm gonna remove this thing off the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.319 
so I'm gonna remove this thing off the
top<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.629> screen<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.200> saw<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.329> put

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
top of the screen that you saw and put

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.339 
top of the screen that you saw and put
this<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.690> here

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.360 

yeah<00:03:29.349> it<00:03:29.470> may<00:03:29.560> look<00:03:29.739> small<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.280> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
yeah it may look small but it is a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.039 
yeah it may look small but it is a
little<00:03:30.670> heavy<00:03:30.879> but<00:03:31.090> it's<00:03:31.299> lighter<00:03:31.629> than<00:03:31.870> most

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
little heavy but it's lighter than most

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.259

computers<00:03:32.500> at<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.590> time<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:33.040> find<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.879> is<00:03:34.060> to

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
computers at the time I find that is to

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.080 
computers at the time I find that is to
have<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.660> set<00:03:34.870> behind<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.920> hub<00:03:36.130> or<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.910> hub

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
have it set behind the hub or the hub

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.170 
have it set behind the hub or the hub
behind<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.739> can<00:03:38.859> just<00:03:38.980> move<00:03:39.160> this<00:03:39.430> back

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
behind this you can just move this back

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.650 
behind this you can just move this back
it's<00:03:41.639> it's<00:03:42.639> a<00:03:42.730> little<00:03:42.940> bit<00:03:43.090> bigger<00:03:43.329> than<00:03:43.510> I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
it's it's a little bit bigger than I

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:53.250 
it's it's a little bit bigger than I
imagined

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.449 

it<00:03:54.260> only<00:03:54.379> cool<00:03:54.620> wants<00:03:54.829> to<00:03:54.890> set<00:03:55.129> up<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.400> I'll
