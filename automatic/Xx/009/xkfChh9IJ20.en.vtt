comb<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:27.900> begin<00:00:28.289> our<00:00:28.439> process<00:00:28.650> we're<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
comb to begin our process we're going to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.240 
comb to begin our process we're going to
take<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.420> end<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.779> our<00:00:30.840> dreadlock<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.980> first

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
take the end of our dreadlock the first

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
take the end of our dreadlock the first
thing<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.660> are

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
thing that we're going to do is we are

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.459 
thing that we're going to do is we are
going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> fluff<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.190> end<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:36.469> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
going to fluff up this end a bit and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:46.450 
going to fluff up this end a bit and
make<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.629> has<00:00:39.930> some<00:00:39.960> bulk<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.330 

okay<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.910> next<00:00:48.180> step<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.410> take<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.039> fiber

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
okay the next step is to take this fiber

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000 
okay the next step is to take this fiber
and<00:00:50.670> insert<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:52.079> into<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> leg<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> our

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and insert it back into the leg of our

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.200 
and insert it back into the leg of our
dread<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.510> we're<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.440> use<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
dread so for that we're going to use a

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
dread so for that we're going to use a
micro<00:00:57.210> needle<00:00:57.770> we're<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> work<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
micro needle we're going to work in

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.349 
micro needle we're going to work in
small<00:00:59.670> sections

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
small sections

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.880 
small sections
going<00:01:00.840> into<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.620> dreadlock<00:01:02.809> out<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:04.769> we

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
going into the dreadlock out where we

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:18.460 
going into the dreadlock out where we
need<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> suck<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.060> fiber<00:01:06.330> back<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.960> inside

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.080 

okay<00:01:19.070> we're<00:01:19.250> going<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.400> keep<00:01:19.610> pulling<00:01:19.940> that

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
okay we're going to keep pulling that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.870 
okay we're going to keep pulling that
down<00:01:20.480> until<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.320> see<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:22.040> go<00:01:22.370> right<00:01:22.670> back

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
down until we see that go right back

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.180 
down until we see that go right back
inside

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.240 

okay<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.180> we've<00:01:30.330> created<00:01:30.540> our<00:01:30.810> end<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.070> rest

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
okay now we've created our end the rest

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.040 
okay now we've created our end the rest
of<00:01:32.370> this<00:01:32.490> fiber<00:01:32.760> needs<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.570> pulled<00:01:33.810> into

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
of this fiber needs to get pulled into

00:01:34.050 --> 00:02:04.520 
of this fiber needs to get pulled into
the<00:01:34.320> sender<00:01:34.620> core

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.580 

okay<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.030> end<00:02:06.270> pulled<00:02:06.780> inside<00:02:06.930> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
okay with that end pulled inside it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
okay with that end pulled inside it
looks<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.160> little<00:02:08.280> bulky<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.240> it's<00:02:09.360> definitely

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
looks a little bulky but it's definitely

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.900 
looks a little bulky but it's definitely
creating<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.410> blunted<00:02:10.800> end<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:14.340> next<00:02:14.670> step

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
creating that blunted end the next step

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
creating that blunted end the next step
is<00:02:15.210> we're<00:02:15.720> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.900> smash<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.440> down<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> little

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
is we're going to smash it down a little

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.430 
is we're going to smash it down a little
bit<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.820> help<00:02:21.410> give<00:02:22.410> us

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
bit that's just going to help give us

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.949 
bit that's just going to help give us
some<00:02:22.620> fiber<00:02:23.220> where<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:23.820> want<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.870> when

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
some fiber where we want it so that when

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.900 
some fiber where we want it so that when
we<00:02:25.080> pull<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.950> still<00:02:26.340> maintains<00:02:26.730> that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
we pull it in it still maintains that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.930 
we pull it in it still maintains that
shape<00:02:27.860> you're<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.040> switch<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.610> your

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
shape you're going to switch to your

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.620 
shape you're going to switch to your
crochet<00:02:30.150> hook<00:02:31.490> you're<00:02:32.490> going<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
crochet hook you're going to go in to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.040 
crochet hook you're going to go in to
the<00:02:33.959> dreadlock<00:02:35.030> pull<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.270> little<00:02:36.570> bit<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.780> fiber

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the dreadlock pull a little bit of fiber

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.810 
the dreadlock pull a little bit of fiber
away<00:02:38.900> wrap<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.110> around<00:02:40.260> your<00:02:41.160> hook<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.640> couple

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
away wrap it around your hook a couple

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.170 
away wrap it around your hook a couple
times<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.160> pull<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.280> through<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> other

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
times and pull it through to the other

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.360 
times and pull it through to the other
side<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.320> process<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:47.040> will<00:02:47.130> probably

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
side in the process it will probably

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.130 
side in the process it will probably
grab<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.090> couple<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.480> internal<00:02:48.930> hairs

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
grab a couple of the internal hairs

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.000 
grab a couple of the internal hairs
that's<00:02:49.500> okay

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
that's okay

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.070 
that's okay
just<00:02:50.430> keep<00:02:50.610> pulling<00:02:50.850> until<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.750> hear<00:02:51.959> that

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
just keep pulling until you hear that

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.790 
just keep pulling until you hear that
rip<00:02:53.390> we're<00:02:54.390> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.570> repeat<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:54.959> process<00:02:55.320> a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
rip we're going to repeat that process a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:10.690 
rip we're going to repeat that process a
