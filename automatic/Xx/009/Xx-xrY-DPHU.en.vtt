00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.780
 by means of such different 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.159
 all sorts of cocktails and today we are preparing 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.009
 one of these cocktails which 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.280

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.990

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.320
 combine traditional 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.900
 Cuban cuisine and your love and respect 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.970
 to the first havana club that's what 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.380
 we cooked in the kitchen we unfortunately 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.090
 in the kitchen and cook it 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.460
 I could not do it all by myself 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.810
 tell it very easy you 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.900
 take 30 milliliters of lemon juice 10 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.040
 milliliters almond syrup cut 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.380
 here and so bananchiki 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.490
 and fry everything in the pan 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 Alcohol is not included here we already 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.750
 proceeded to the preparation of a cocktail 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.590
 now we come up with it all you 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.080
 talk about ap non alcoholic us 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.770
 need rum havana club as easy 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.580
 to guess 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:20.080
 well we take well we take reserve we take and 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.610
 they do not know 40 milliliters 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.380
 is it worth talking about it or not but 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:30.040
 frankly frankly they 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.790
 their 3a news uz thoughts are not in vain as there 300 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.680
 steam steam expander and news is needed here and how 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.860
 would actually for i was preparing for sure 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.840
 knew that the galaxy was the whole line 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.360
 galana but for some reason me today 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.269
 it turned out apparently the bartender just drank 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.519
 but I think that as if rinat will forgive us 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.380
 such loosening in his recipe and how 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.510
 nothing terrible happened and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.510
 peach liquor 20 milliliters 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.590
 up 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.850
 add people to and beat the whole thing 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.420
 and knock down I think it should be 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.270
 good because he live and fried 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.270
 the board was a tass board and los platos 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.080
 and now pour the main thing to us 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.580
 this mixture was enough 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.270
 I think the strainer will be superfluous 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.270
 thick with us 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:50.040
 well that their count taste great honor and 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.000
 I haven't even tried it yet yes no I don't 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:00.450
 tried it literally smells rich i 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.970
 tried the banana on expert opinion on 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.240
 Actually not bad dayan not as we 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.060
 Che thought well, there is not enough 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.040
 he is a good return now we will say what 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.020
 it lacks acid that 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.700
 or sugar in numbers you always lack 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:20.940
 you have no money only not always 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:24.350
 said man so quietly us kids here 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.400
 between truth mode you again have a patient 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.410
 but try not just a banana 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.780
 children bangnet he smells shorter like oatmeal 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.320
 court 1 banana and here is the same that such a whole 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.320
 like oatmeal 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.190
 brightness what's missing something 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.000
 like everything is that is and there is a banana 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.800
 which seems to be separate when onca yes 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.230
 Yes, the unity of what we certainly do not 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.830
 have the right to judge the top of the best cocktails 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.230
 who entered the book and by the way eyes 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.370
 the glaze survived we 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.870
 they took this reserve echo as it were necessary 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.540
 three-year-olds why konert is completely different 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.520

 enough you think it seems to me here we are 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.250
 the end can understand that there is something like that 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.050
 which is not all tortured by alcohol 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.660
