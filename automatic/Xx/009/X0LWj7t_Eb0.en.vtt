long<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.959> pats<00:03:57.260> lat<00:03:57.560> first<00:03:57.890> time<00:03:58.100> i<00:03:58.130> played<00:03:58.250> it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
long the pats lat first time i played it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.380 
long the pats lat first time i played it
again<00:04:00.549> not<00:04:01.549> really<00:04:01.850> one<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.150> better

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
again not really one of the better

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.430 
again not really one of the better
things<00:04:03.140> made<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.920> this<00:04:04.010> game<00:04:04.250> but<00:04:04.579> a<00:04:04.880> words<00:04:05.720> so

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
things made in this game but a words so

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.020 
things made in this game but a words so
then<00:04:06.620> there<00:04:06.739> will<00:04:06.799> be<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.950> couple<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.489> skeletons

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
then there will be a couple of skeletons

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.750 
then there will be a couple of skeletons
that<00:04:08.120> will<00:04:08.390> try<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.810> kill<00:04:09.079> you<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.260> then<00:04:09.950> use

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
that will try to kill you and then use

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.599 
that will try to kill you and then use
the<00:04:11.030> wizard<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.750> move<00:04:12.019> this<00:04:12.170> down<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.340> want

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
the wizard to move this down if you want

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.880 
the wizard to move this down if you want
or<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.359> can<00:04:14.390> make<00:04:14.630> two<00:04:14.840> boxes<00:04:15.380> if<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:15.769> have

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
or you can make two boxes if you have

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.890 
or you can make two boxes if you have
one<00:04:16.039> hold<00:04:16.220> up<00:04:16.310> already<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:19.299> then<00:04:20.299> just<00:04:20.690> kill

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
one hold up already and then just kill

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.840 
one hold up already and then just kill
these<00:04:21.079> scallops<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.799> lows<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.370> took<00:04:22.669> me

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
these scallops and the lows to took me

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.969 
these scallops and the lows to took me
completely<00:04:23.000> by<00:04:23.570> surprise<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:24.410> was<00:04:24.530> not<00:04:24.770> paying

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
completely by surprise I was not paying

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.430 
completely by surprise I was not paying
attention<00:04:25.100> not<00:04:25.970> notice<00:04:26.419> them<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.020> i<00:04:27.050> got<00:04:27.410> a

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
attention not notice them so i got a

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.930 
attention not notice them so i got a
components<00:04:28.100> there<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.550> could<00:04:28.729> have<00:04:28.850> been

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
components there that could have been

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
components there that could have been
easily<00:04:29.210> avoided<00:04:29.479> and<00:04:30.610> i<00:04:31.610> don't<00:04:32.419> think<00:04:32.510> there

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
easily avoided and i don't think there

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.460 
easily avoided and i don't think there
are<00:04:33.050> achievements<00:04:33.650> for<00:04:35.200> completing<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.260> whole

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
are achievements for completing a whole

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.960 
are achievements for completing a whole
level<00:04:36.650> without<00:04:36.890> getting<00:04:37.250> hit<00:04:37.460> there<00:04:37.610> might<00:04:37.940> be

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
level without getting hit there might be

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.250 
level without getting hit there might be
I<00:04:38.419> guess<00:04:38.780> are<00:04:38.900> not<00:04:39.050> achievements<00:04:39.560> it's<00:04:39.710> so

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
I guess are not achievements it's so

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260 
I guess are not achievements it's so
which<00:04:40.590> people<00:04:41.250> are<00:04:41.310> gonna<00:04:41.490> yell<00:04:41.790> out<00:04:41.910> before<00:04:42.030> I

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
which people are gonna yell out before I

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.330 
which people are gonna yell out before I
just<00:04:42.570> know<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:43.620> don't<00:04:44.040> know<00:04:44.130> if<00:04:44.190> there's
