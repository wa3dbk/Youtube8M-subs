00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 I want to learn maths sign up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.580
 come with me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.190
 the strike happens in Scotland where the coast is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.180
 very rich in all shapes and colors 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.160
 that owns is dense it 's beautiful it's magic 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.080
 the art director wanted to see what the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.029
 real on the screen I was going to stay there at brooklin 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.880
 where he wanted to see a good game. 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.649
 the rocks and this was the main 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.200
 challenge for this movie got 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.380
 show this in organic field on the big screen 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.600
 we did all this using math 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.879
 most people think of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 math with something annoying and mechanical 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.500
 but this is not the way we face the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.000
 math on pizza for us math 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.240
 is a tool to create an image 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.010
 less richness of detail and fun 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.780
 mainly a computer generating a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.180
 movement is really a series of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.630
 pictures a lot of one frame after the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 other 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.430
 all these images are made of pixels 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.380
 the one to two million pixels per 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.660
 image of each of these pixels and 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.759
 written by three different numbers and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.009
 specifying the colors red green 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.899
 and blue for this peak then all 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.939
 colors in each pixel are formed by 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.429
 these three numbers for us to make a 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.859
 movie only that handle about 200 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.960
 billion picasso and that's a lot of 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.329
 mathematics one of the places that you see 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 mathematics in this film in a jet 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.350
 where we think about the design of the movie 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.719
 we decided that we would have a lot of musicians and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.880
 all places affirmed 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.649
 So we took several photos of Scotland. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.139
 as a reference and we began to analyze 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.539
 how is the musician's appearance like him 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:38.729
 grows on the rocks in the trees as much did 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.429
 and we try to recreate it all using 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.200
 mathematics in numbers was made 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.299
 follows we started with 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.450
 some simple formulas that would create a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.100
 single version best five brothers 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.349
 so the first thing we did was 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.369
 colored all a very uniform musician 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.590
 wands 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.689
 We want to see variations on the musician. 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.359
 as today's variations the creation of 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.740
 formats of madness and thickness of 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.049
 people do not realize that we should 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.569
 put more math on your computer 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.690
 for example we have a formula that 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.240
 of the thickness of the musician another formula that 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 other colors for movement 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.120
 are also made with the use of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.819
 math mathematics 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.760
 When we put it all together it seems 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.230
 a great form a great monster 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.590
 However, none of these spaces is very 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.900
 common 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.700
 ex of each of these formulas are very 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 simple to actually make a 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.950
 Scottish forest we do not just need 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 music but also tree shrubs 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.459
 and we decided to do the same. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.420
 procedure then we use math 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.550
 for all of this 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 so we have mathematical values ​​trees 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.049
 mathematics and formulas everywhere 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.690
 basically we use math as 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.200
 a brush an artistic tool what 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.200
 it is very cool
