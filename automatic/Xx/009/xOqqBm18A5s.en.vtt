we<00:02:30.630> start<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:30.930> our<00:02:30.990> jalopy<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:31.770> kind<00:02:31.890> of

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
we start with our jalopy it's kind of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.890 
we start with our jalopy it's kind of
cool<00:02:32.190> whatever<00:02:32.460> we<00:02:33.270> can<00:02:33.420> paint<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.750> whatever

color we want let's make it purple with
the<00:02:37.590> purple<00:02:37.920> jalopy<00:02:38.250> that's<00:02:38.550> cool<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:39.210> I

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
the purple jalopy that's cool and then I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.750 
the purple jalopy that's cool and then I
can<00:02:39.390> apply<00:02:39.630> whatever<00:02:39.840> patterns<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.500> want<00:02:40.770> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
can apply whatever patterns I want and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.990 
can apply whatever patterns I want and
kind<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.240> like<00:02:42.650> hard<00:02:43.650> night<00:02:44.000> little

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
kind of that like hard night little

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240 
kind of that like hard night little
eyeball<00:02:45.390> pattern<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.470> we<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.100> of

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
eyeball pattern and then we can kind of

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
eyeball pattern and then we can kind of
scale<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.820> how<00:02:47.970> every<00:02:48.120> move<00:02:48.270> on<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.660> make

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
scale this how every move on we can make

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.360 
scale this how every move on we can make

machine<00:03:04.140> gun<00:03:04.560> bullets<00:03:04.950> should<00:03:05.160> probably<00:03:05.730> be

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
machine gun bullets should probably be

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.340 
machine gun bullets should probably be
golf<00:03:06.060> balls<00:03:06.360> all<00:03:06.750> right<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.020> when<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.200> is

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
golf balls all right so when this is

alive<00:03:07.590> we're<00:03:07.709> gonna<00:03:07.830> make<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.040> hover<00:03:08.310> rash

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
alive we're gonna make it hover rash

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.479 
alive we're gonna make it hover rash
gonna<00:03:09.420> make<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.750> move<00:03:10.020> really<00:03:10.320> fast<00:03:10.350> do<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.459> a

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
gonna make it move really fast do like a

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.870 
gonna make it move really fast do like a
40<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.180> then<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:14.340> wanted<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:16.760> how<00:03:17.760> about

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.220 
40 and then you wanted it to how about
we<00:03:18.000> shoot<00:03:18.150> exploding<00:03:18.660> bullets<00:03:18.810> cuz<00:03:19.080> that's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
we shoot exploding bullets cuz that's

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.980 
we shoot exploding bullets cuz that's
way<00:03:19.350> cooler

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
way cooler

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.140 
way cooler
keep<00:03:21.620> doing<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.660> golf<00:03:23.660> ball<00:03:24.910> about<00:03:25.910> wings

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
keep doing this golf ball about wings

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.840 
keep doing this golf ball about wings
I'm<00:03:26.330> so<00:03:27.200> what<00:03:27.380> are<00:03:27.500> those<00:03:27.590> explosion<00:03:28.190> types<00:03:28.460> oh

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
I'm so what are those explosion types oh

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.670 
I'm so what are those explosion types oh
man<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:29.990> we<00:03:30.080> got<00:03:30.200> lots<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.410> different

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
man so we got lots of different

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.220 
man so we got lots of different
explosion<00:03:31.100> types<00:03:31.340> we've<00:03:32.300> got<00:03:32.480> normal<00:03:32.900> we've

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
explosion types we've got normal we've

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.380 
explosion types we've got normal we've
got<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.380> large<00:03:33.590> got<00:03:33.950> nucular<00:03:34.310> nuclear<00:03:35.300> is

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
got a large got nucular nuclear is

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.850 
got a large got nucular nuclear is
probably<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.750> one<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:35.960> want<00:03:36.080> okay<00:03:36.440> let's

probably the one we want okay let's

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.110 
probably the one we want okay let's
check<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.040> out<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.580> then<00:03:37.610> what<00:03:37.820> else<00:03:37.970> do<00:03:38.060> we

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
check that out and then what else do we

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.010 
check that out and then what else do we
want<00:03:38.390> wings<00:03:39.080> we<00:03:39.500> wanted<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.770> fly<00:03:40.180> fly<00:03:41.180> oh<00:03:41.570> it's

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
want wings we wanted to fly fly oh it's

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.600 
want wings we wanted to fly fly oh it's
set<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.200> fly<00:03:42.470> we<00:03:42.710> got<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.040> when<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.400> alive

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
set to fly we got this when it's alive

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.970 
set to fly we got this when it's alive
it's<00:03:43.850> gonna<00:03:43.970> fly<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.210> tougher<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:45.140> then<00:03:45.710> it's

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
it's gonna fly a tougher and then it's

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.320 
it's gonna fly a tougher and then it's
getting<00:03:46.160> pretty<00:03:46.250> fast<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.880> let's<00:03:47.150> do

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
getting pretty fast and let's do

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.960 
getting pretty fast and let's do
something<00:03:47.750> like<00:03:48.490> when<00:03:49.490> it<00:03:50.260> destroys<00:03:51.970> we're
