00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.139
 Irrigation technology The finder of irrigation technology exists since 1998 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.439
 We sell high quality products from around the world for the 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.550
 Professional agriculture in Germany belong to our customers 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.460
 well-known German farms whose products are certainly 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.449
 also in your fridge 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.579
 We have our products of irrigation technology in question for them in question of the KEF 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.280
 Sam put high quality so they use them in their garden 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.410
 can 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.030
 Gundermann was called because they did not feel like every day their garden 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.030
 to water for several hours 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.749
 if you forget to improve if you go on vacation 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.240
 the garden is dry 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.120
 Many customers have already been using other systems as well 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.240
 which unfortunately way too complicated and strengthen a madness 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.400
 In addition, the quality is a problem on pain 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.830
 For this we have thought of DJ and professional sets for 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.220
 they put together 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.550
 relax and enjoy your garden or vacation 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.549
 how it works 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.220
 I'll show you that now 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.200
 Since her garden usually consists of many different areas 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.300
 but of course also different sentences 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.980
 no matter if Beijing 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.440
 why rows 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.220
 the rock garden 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.200
 or a small picture 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.340
 For all these areas our Trophy Castle is predestined 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 Look at Loch itself 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330
 100 meters before clear 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.850
 a filter 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.700
 two pieces at the beginning 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.690
 two connectors 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.360
 a four piece 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.070
 ten clips to close the ZOB tube 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 and two tails 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.830
 they can be small beds 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.060
 or rock gardens also with our mini computer page Rondo irrigate 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.380
 you can find yourself in our menu sprinklers

 Elves Minieri CNOOC with 360 degrees release 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.580
 Helps solve 480 degrees 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.000
 a filter 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.610
 one punched Sanger 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.230
 an initial piece 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.960
 two angle pieces 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.249
 and two in pieces 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.579
 for flower pots and boxes 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.279
 We can also use pressurized Paris wears 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.639
 in our head are located 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.699

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.119
 100-meter Nico hose 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.779
 two lows pieces 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.399
 and an initial piece 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.019
 for lawns or other large areas 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.439
 we can use our submerged Knesset 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.289
 in our sunk calculator itself are included 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.449
 100 meters 4:25 a filter 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:47.889
 sunk here with connection a mist two drained valves 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.409
 here arises 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.959
 a cross piece 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.220
 an initial piece of an angle and a coup succeeded 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.709
 Of course, we can combine our own finished, so should you 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.579
 benefit because the garden has different areas of art 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.409
 They are also happy to put together their own individual 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.509
 For this you will find all the products in our online shop 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.739
 The basic requirement is of course that they have enough water and pressure to 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.979
 Have available 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:17.129
 they can easily test this by looking at the end of the drip 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.259
 or sprinkler pipe still enough water outlet 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:24.049
 Remember also that on a Saturday afternoon less water 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.369
 her Hanaus comes 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.629
 but the whole street seems to be washing her car or watering the lawn 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.889
 our products are easy to install the commercial opponent 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.889
 and profit of the connections used 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.829
 so they can have a garden hose 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.829
 also use as a supply line 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.489
 thanks to the profit parts you can still install a second exit 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.489
 and also the filter for the head station of the irrigation system 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.309
 this quickly assembled 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.779
 now only the connection to the drip leek or that Peru is missing 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.529
 the Wars also already the head station 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.590
 For every irrigation system you need a fisherman 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.600
 so that no dirt in the Truth injury plant comes 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.739
 This filter it is very easy to clean open the card 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.050
 remove the candle and leave it and a tap off 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.759
 then simply reinstall the candle 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.759
 and look at the lid 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.330
 if they have installed different irrigation systems in their garden 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.210
 You can do this easily 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.210
 turn on and off individually 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.849
 thanks to valves from a time control unit 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.149
 They can also control the individual lines over time 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.249
 the controller finds the animals with him only 2 9 volts on batteries 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.360
 Of course we also have a timer with which you only have one 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.779
 Head of taxes can 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.499
 also the cleaning and care of the compressors its location is very simple 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.529
 Just open the mains supply 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.900
 so that the dirt is played out 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.390
 Just before winter, empty the pipes and close them 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.990
 then again with the final score 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.240
 so far so good 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.830
 look at the next videos we show them like the sets 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.419
 work and how easy the installation is 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.740
 You can also see them without much prior knowledge and without installation operation 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.819
 You can easily install your irrigation system yourself 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.080
 Give them more time for the really important things in life
