00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
sand is also a really good soil

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.270 
sand is also a really good soil
amendment<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> has<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.900> decent<00:01:52.650> source<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
amendment it has a decent source of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.210 
amendment it has a decent source of
potassium<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.390> also<00:01:54.510> has<00:01:54.720> lots<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
potassium and it also has lots of

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.830 
potassium and it also has lots of
smaller<00:01:56.220> amounts<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.670> trace<00:01:56.909> minerals<00:01:57.150> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
smaller amounts of trace minerals so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.570 
smaller amounts of trace minerals so
you're<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.770> trace<00:01:58.979> minerals<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
you're gonna get the trace minerals that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.430 
you're gonna get the trace minerals that
you<00:01:59.700> would<00:01:59.820> with<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.030> azomite<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.320> not

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
you would with the azomite but just not

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.140 
you would with the azomite but just not
as<00:02:01.590> many<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.040> you're<00:02:02.190> also<00:02:02.340> gonna<00:02:02.549> save<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.940> lot

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
as many and you're also gonna save a lot

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.940 
as many and you're also gonna save a lot
of<00:02:03.180> money<00:02:03.330> as<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.590> beginning<00:02:04.830> their

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of money as well so for beginning their

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.380 
of money as well so for beginning their
growers<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.430> want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.820> those<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.240> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
growers that want to get those because I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.700 
growers that want to get those because I
think<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.750> definitely<00:02:07.020> important<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
think it's definitely important to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
think it's definitely important to
mineralize<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> soil<00:02:08.840> that's<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.989> great

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
mineralize the soil that's a great

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.649 
mineralize the soil that's a great
alternative<00:02:10.519> also<00:02:11.519> they<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.269> neem<00:02:12.629> seed

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
alternative also they have a neem seed

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.039 
alternative also they have a neem seed
and<00:02:13.170> they<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.940> granular<00:02:14.940> humic<00:02:15.299> acid<00:02:15.750> now

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
and they have granular humic acid now

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.539 
and they have granular humic acid now
humic<00:02:16.409> acid<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.799> something<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.159> I<00:02:17.190> probably

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
humic acid is something that I probably

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.789 
humic acid is something that I probably
will<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.849> picking<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.209> today<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.799> humic

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
will be picking up today because humic

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.000 
will be picking up today because humic
acid<00:02:20.219> is<00:02:20.999> so<00:02:21.540> important<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.409> add<00:02:22.529> to<00:02:22.680> your<00:02:22.769> soil

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
acid is so important to add to your soil

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.699 
acid is so important to add to your soil
because<00:02:23.639> humic<00:02:23.969> acid<00:02:24.389> is<00:02:24.510> basically<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.529> left

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
because humic acid is basically the left

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.600 
because humic acid is basically the left
goal

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
goal

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.940

houmous<00:02:27.299> it's<00:02:27.540> leftover<00:02:27.989> houmous<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.830> when

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
houmous it's leftover houmous and when

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.979 
houmous it's leftover houmous and when
houmous<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.580> put<00:02:30.090> into<00:02:30.239> your<00:02:30.329> soil<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.750> adds<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
houmous is put into your soil it adds a

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.289 
houmous is put into your soil it adds a
ton<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.260> fertility<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.370> allows<00:02:32.610> lots<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
ton of fertility and it allows lots of

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.600 
ton of fertility and it allows lots of
microbial<00:02:33.870> life<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.260> come<00:02:34.439> in<00:02:34.620> not<00:02:35.069> only<00:02:35.129> that

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
microbial life to come in not only that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.420 
microbial life to come in not only that
but<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.189> to<00:02:38.280> also

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
but it's going to be it's going to also

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.069 
but it's going to be it's going to also
help<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:38.819> your<00:02:38.909> plants<00:02:39.299> help<00:02:39.540> because<00:02:39.930> when

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
help with your plants help because when

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.380 
help with your plants help because when
you<00:02:40.170> add<00:02:40.319> humic<00:02:40.680> acid<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.610> helps<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.000> plants

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
you add humic acid it helps the plants

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.199 
you add humic acid it helps the plants
to<00:02:42.540> ward<00:02:43.349> off<00:02:43.470> diseases<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.549> blights<00:02:44.909> and

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
to ward off diseases like blights and

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.809 
to ward off diseases like blights and
funguses<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:47.099> makes<00:02:47.340> their<00:02:47.549> leaves

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
funguses so it makes their leaves

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.360 
funguses so it makes their leaves
actually<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.659> lot<00:02:48.870> stronger<00:02:49.349> because<00:02:49.829> they

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
actually a lot stronger because they

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.789 
actually a lot stronger because they
actually<00:02:50.549> will<00:02:50.909> form<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.239> biofilm<00:02:51.650> over<00:02:52.650> their

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
actually will form a biofilm over their

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.640 
actually will form a biofilm over their
leaf<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.640> use<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.790> humic<00:02:54.209> acids<00:02:54.659> now

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
leaf with the use of humic acids now

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.430 
leaf with the use of humic acids now
Rose<00:02:56.579> they<00:02:57.000> also<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.390> rose<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:57.900> flour<00:02:58.079> mix

also have the extreme gardening so if
you<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.319> tried<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.889> extreme<00:03:29.220> gardening

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
you all have tried the extreme gardening

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.580 
you all have tried the extreme gardening
like<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.819> rise<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.389> mykos<00:03:30.810> they<00:03:31.319> have

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
like a rise of the mykos they have

right then we also got this girl more we

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.649 
right then we also got this girl more we
found<00:05:14.340> this<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.639> is<00:05:14.849> spectacular

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
found this this is spectacular

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.300 
found this this is spectacular
spectacular<00:05:15.900> stuff<00:05:16.409> there's<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.860> label<00:05:17.009> for

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
spectacular stuff there's a label for

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.210 
spectacular stuff there's a label for
him<00:05:17.490> it's<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.210> 5<00:05:18.630> 5<00:05:18.930> 5<00:05:18.990> so<00:05:19.470> it's<00:05:19.590> really<00:05:20.009> gentle

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
him it's a 5 5 5 so it's really gentle

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.649 
him it's a 5 5 5 so it's really gentle
its<00:05:20.550> all-purpose<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.150> we<00:05:21.300> actually<00:05:21.449> picked

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
its all-purpose and we actually picked

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.330 
its all-purpose and we actually picked
this<00:05:21.870> because<00:05:22.139> it<00:05:22.560> was<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.830> only<00:05:22.979> thing<00:05:23.190> that

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
this because it was the only thing that

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.850 
this because it was the only thing that
was<00:05:23.430> really<00:05:23.639> high<00:05:24.000> in<00:05:24.330> potassium<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:25.199> so<00:05:25.770> we

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
was really high in potassium and so we

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.200 
was really high in potassium and so we
got<00:05:26.009> this<00:05:26.130> but<00:05:26.370> not<00:05:26.490> only<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.849> it<00:05:26.970> high<00:05:27.090> in

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
got this but not only is it high in

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.999 
got this but not only is it high in
potassium<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:27.690> beautiful<00:05:28.470> because<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.860> has

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
potassium it's beautiful because it has

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.070 
potassium it's beautiful because it has
endo<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.169> octo<00:05:31.250> mica<00:05:32.250> Raisa<00:05:32.550> it's<00:05:33.419> got<00:05:33.690> endo

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
endo and octo mica Raisa it's got endo

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.839 
endo and octo mica Raisa it's got endo
and<00:05:34.259> I<00:05:34.289> CRO<00:05:34.440> micro<00:05:34.680> eyes<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:34.830> plus<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.430> also<00:05:35.550> has

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
and I CRO micro eyes a plus it also has

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.770 
and I CRO micro eyes a plus it also has
1%<00:05:36.449> humic<00:05:37.289> acid<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:39.030> humic<00:05:39.330> acid<00:05:39.599> that<00:05:39.659> we

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
1% humic acid so the humic acid that we

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.360 
1% humic acid so the humic acid that we
got<00:05:39.930> is<00:05:40.110> also<00:05:40.289> just<00:05:40.560> going<00:05:40.650> to<00:05:40.740> be<00:05:40.830> more<00:05:41.099> humic

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
got is also just going to be more humic

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.570 
got is also just going to be more humic
acid<00:05:41.699> which<00:05:41.849> is<00:05:41.969> great<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.419> it<00:05:42.960> also<00:05:43.080> has

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
acid which is great and it also has

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.480 
acid which is great and it also has
bacillus<00:05:45.710> bacteria<00:05:46.710> so<00:05:47.190> it's<00:05:47.280> basically

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
bacillus bacteria so it's basically

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.219 
bacillus bacteria so it's basically
beneficial<00:05:48.060> bacteria<00:05:48.150> it's<00:05:48.539> loaded<00:05:49.110> with

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
beneficial bacteria it's loaded with

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.649 
beneficial bacteria it's loaded with
beneficial<00:05:49.770> bacteria<00:05:49.830> endo<00:05:50.759> and<00:05:50.909> act<00:05:51.419> oh<00:05:51.539> my

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
beneficial bacteria endo and act oh my

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.749 
beneficial bacteria endo and act oh my
coryza<00:05:51.960> plus<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.800> five<00:05:52.949> five<00:05:53.159> five<00:05:53.310> so<00:05:53.520> it's<00:05:53.669> a

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
coryza plus the five five five so it's a

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.379 
coryza plus the five five five so it's a
really<00:05:54.389> really<00:05:54.659> good<00:05:54.990> mix<00:05:55.169> and<00:05:55.409> this<00:05:55.949> is<00:05:56.389> $7

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
really really good mix and this is $7

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.899 
really really good mix and this is $7

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
and it's a four pound box so we picked

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.279 
and it's a four pound box so we picked
up<00:06:00.000> two<00:06:00.270> of<00:06:00.360> those<00:06:00.509> because<00:06:00.870> that's<00:06:01.169> a

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
up two of those because that's a

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
and then we've picked up a box of the

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.559 
and then we've picked up a box of the
fishbone<00:06:07.529> meal<00:06:08.130> right<00:06:08.490> here<00:06:08.729> this<00:06:09.090> fish<00:06:09.360> bone

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
fishbone meal right here this fish bone

tomatoes and not only that it's gonna
give<00:06:17.819> a<00:06:17.849> little<00:06:18.029> bit<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.300> nitrogen<00:06:18.630> as<00:06:18.840> well

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
give a little bit of nitrogen as well

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.559 
give a little bit of nitrogen as well
which<00:06:19.289> is<00:06:19.319> also<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.770> plus<00:06:20.029> then<00:06:21.029> we<00:06:21.419> also

which is also a plus then we also
decided<00:06:22.080> to<00:06:22.319> get<00:06:22.440> the<00:06:22.680> pelletized<00:06:23.370> seabird

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
decided to get the pelletized seabird

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.290 
decided to get the pelletized seabird
guano<00:06:24.090> here<00:06:24.779> this<00:06:25.050> is<00:06:25.199> a<00:06:25.349> 12<00:06:25.680> 12<00:06:26.099> to<00:06:26.580> really

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
guano here this is a 12 12 to really

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.399 
guano here this is a 12 12 to really
high<00:06:27.419> in<00:06:27.539> nitrogen<00:06:27.810> really<00:06:28.229> high<00:06:28.349> in

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
high in nitrogen really high in

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.409 
high in nitrogen really high in
phosphorous<00:06:28.979> and<00:06:29.400> it<00:06:29.789> even<00:06:29.969> has<00:06:30.060> a<00:06:30.090> little<00:06:30.180> bit

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
phosphorous and it even has a little bit

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.559 
phosphorous and it even has a little bit
of<00:06:30.479> potassium<00:06:30.719> so<00:06:31.229> you're<00:06:31.680> gonna<00:06:31.770> get<00:06:31.979> a<00:06:32.569> lot

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
of potassium so you're gonna get a lot

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:34.820 
of potassium so you're gonna get a lot
of<00:06:33.690> bang<00:06:33.810> for<00:06:33.840> your<00:06:34.050> buck<00:06:34.199> for<00:06:34.259> this<00:06:34.529> and<00:06:34.740> this

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
of bang for your buck for this and this

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.920 
of bang for your buck for this and this
was<00:06:35.130> twenty<00:06:35.610> dollars<00:06:36.060> or<00:06:36.300> nineteen

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
was twenty dollars or nineteen

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.279 
was twenty dollars or nineteen
ninety-five<00:06:37.289> and<00:06:38.180> then<00:06:39.180> last<00:06:39.900> but<00:06:39.960> not<00:06:40.050> least

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
ninety-five and then last but not least

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.240 
ninety-five and then last but not least
we<00:06:40.500> got<00:06:40.620> two<00:06:41.130> boxes<00:06:41.639> of<00:06:42.110> the<00:06:43.110> humic<00:06:43.529> acid<00:06:44.009> here

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
we got two boxes of the humic acid here

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.120 
we got two boxes of the humic acid here
and<00:06:44.400> that<00:06:45.090> is<00:06:45.300> humic<00:06:45.899> acid<00:06:46.259> that<00:06:46.680> is<00:06:46.860> derived

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
and that is humic acid that is derived

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.540 
and that is humic acid that is derived
from<00:06:47.389> leonardite<00:06:48.389> and

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
from leonardite and

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.820 
from leonardite and
that's<00:06:49.819> a<00:06:49.970> really<00:06:50.360> good<00:06:50.509> source<00:06:50.810> of<00:06:51.080> humic

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
that's a really good source of humic

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.830 
that's a really good source of humic
acid<00:06:52.250> and<00:06:52.430> that's<00:06:53.210> gonna<00:06:53.360> help<00:06:53.569> out<00:06:53.690> the

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
acid and that's gonna help out the

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.779 
acid and that's gonna help out the
beneficial<00:06:54.349> microbes<00:06:54.379> and<00:06:54.949> bacteria<00:06:55.129> the

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
beneficial microbes and bacteria the

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.520 
beneficial microbes and bacteria the
plants<00:06:56.180> it's<00:06:56.539> gonna<00:06:56.660> really<00:06:57.020> bring<00:06:57.289> together

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
plants it's gonna really bring together
