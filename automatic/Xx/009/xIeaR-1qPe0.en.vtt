00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
he did lose a lot of units in the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
he did lose a lot of units in the
process<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:46.020> ceased<00:00:46.200> to

carriers and actually does a lot of lot
of<00:01:48.780> damage<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> day

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
of damage and I think one was on the day

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.270 
of damage and I think one was on the day
9<00:01:52.079> daily<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.500> well<00:01:52.649> actually<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
9 daily as well actually now that I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.090 
9 daily as well actually now that I
think<00:01:53.310> about<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:53.909> yes<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.420> many<00:01:54.689> anyway<00:01:55.560> my

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
think about it but yes so many anyway my

end does have this observer of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.389 
end does have this observer of
positioned<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> nice<00:01:58.560> position<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.100> just

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
positioned in a nice position here just

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.649 
positioned in a nice position here just
out<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> range<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.060> missile<00:02:00.360> turret

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
out of range with that missile turret

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
out of range with that missile turret
although<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.409> being<00:02:01.590> said<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:02.070> pretty<00:02:02.310> sure

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
although that being said I'm pretty sure

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.639 
although that being said I'm pretty sure
you<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.700> actually<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.750> need<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you can actually see that I need to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.850 
you can actually see that I need to
check<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:06.020> goodies<00:02:07.020> vision<00:02:07.380> yes<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.740> can

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
check this goodies vision yes you can

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.410 
check this goodies vision yes you can
actually<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.520> observer<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.270> they

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
actually see that observer because they

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.350 
actually see that observer because they
have<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> longer

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
have a longer

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.900 
have a longer
detection<00:02:10.810> range<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.830> we<00:02:12.040> do<00:02:12.220> see<00:02:12.250> now<00:02:12.550> that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
detection range so we do see now that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.730 
detection range so we do see now that
there<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.210> lot<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.480> there<00:02:13.810> was<00:02:13.900> oh<00:02:14.080> my<00:02:14.500> god<00:02:14.710> I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
because I was talking about an observer

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.090 
because I was talking about an observer
let's<00:02:19.960> have<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.200> look<00:02:20.410> let's<00:02:20.710> have<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.920> look
