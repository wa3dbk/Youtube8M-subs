because rapid fire allows you to kill

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
because rapid fire allows you to kill

you it will kill people in a single

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.990 
you it will kill people in a single
verse<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.950> effectively<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.460> allow<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.880> to

put more shots down when needed silencer

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
put more shots down when needed silencer
is<00:00:38.460> also<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:38.969> pairing<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.660> because

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
is also a good pairing with it because

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.600 
is also a good pairing with it because
it<00:00:40.170> allows<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> stay<00:00:40.770> off<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> radar<00:00:41.190> and
