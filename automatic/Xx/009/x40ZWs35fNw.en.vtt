00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection High Grade Universal Century 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.170
 Jim Couell 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.180
 The high-grade Universal Century affordable by using the latest technology of Bandai 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.250
 It is a plastic model series developed at 1/144 scale 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:25.160
 In addition to the renewal of the old kit, even a phantom item that has not been commercialized until now 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:29.810
 Ambitious series of Nodaaa being lineup 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.410
 Jim Kuel and original video animation Mobile Suit Gundam 00 a day 3 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.670
 The black system that appeared a little bit in the last scene of stardust memory 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.900
 The aircraft color is bright 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 It is the main production model mobile suit of Titans's beginning 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:47.650
 It was an aircraft developed based on the Jim Custom, but it was obtained from the Zeon Army after the one- year war . 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:51.550
 It is an aircraft that was developed with only the technology of the Earth Federation Army excluding any technology . 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.440
 This was because it was decided to be operated by Titans, who had raised the principle of supremacy on earth 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.920
 As the meaning of the name can eat 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:03.379
 It has been used for operational actions such as the suppression of a mob and security lone hunting 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:08.090
 And there are many costumes that lead to Gundam mark 2 after the Ne place fuselage'm 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:11.680
 It can be said that it is an expectation that leads to Gundam mark 2 from the design which distributes the technology of the dione system thoroughly 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.680
 Mobile Suits of Nodaaa 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.409
 When it was a foot when the storm at the end of the century blew up 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:29.460
 It goes back to the time when master grade Jim Kuel was released from Bandai. 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.280
 It is good that Jim Kuuel was released at the meeting , but the setting from Gundam nt 1 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.340
 I wonder if the design line is unsightly and unsightly 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 I we Maruichi mold of that one o'clock familiar went to where 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.080
 Brother this kit is that taunt the gym Kuueru is so Omowanka 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.680
 The matter of the system is a positive theory, but the setting is more than the original drawing, and the setting is grate and it is a wonderful airframe 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.299
 From 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.690
 Just I'm will place such as cooking easy food preferences Bandai, but I 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.310
 I wonder if this bumpy leg and the body of the aircraft are in one week 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.300
 This is an office building, but I always thought that I could not support double without such people 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.250
 Give me a bonus 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.870
 Gar consent is regrettable is that the stick is Nina purple ton 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.340
 The heart of Bandai that after Keep talking to the gym cut Chong it neck of that Baita 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.390
 It will be difficult production 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.530
 It is because that woman is disproportionate to the aircraft that has experienced the principle of supremacy on earth 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.730
 And 7 years of the day is a high-grade universal Century edition Jim Kuuel flow problems 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.110
 I am sorry because it was released 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.500
 074 RGM-79Q GM Quel is in the first 74 series of high-grade Universal Century in 2007 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.569
 It is a kit that has been released. The price of the kit is probably 1200 yen. 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.959
 ame 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.959
 I 'm sure you look at the package and there is something wrong 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.170
 I will dislike is by package new fraud That is right 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.830
 In fact, this kit is not the kit of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 at 3 person's name but the advance of 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.569
 Zetas 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:55.350
 Was released so far in such things it's the name of the kit to the original flag of the Titans 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.340
 It has been developed by diverting a series of Gundam tr 1 haze Le-related kit 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.270
 And the character of Gundam Heizuru that lucky to variations specific surely Dosu example runner tag 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.800
 But it is too dainty 0 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:09.300
 This I'm Fujioka construction equipment Vanden rather than the plate when he 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.990
 It is set that it is developed based on Jim Kuuel , but surely it is Hayes conversely 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.760
 The nozzle of the ankyote and backpack is a kit based on 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.590
 It's become thanks to the late-night gym custom and the proportions, especially of the legs 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.190
 The balance is completely different 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.790
 I did not know-the elbow pad is abs why painting is difficult 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.210
 The fault that the polo polo falls off is also closed 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.070
 I'm not with the usual fist'm EMPRESS This 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:38.870
 If you want to paint , wipe the surfacer lightly briefly and dry the coating completely. 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:41.150
 It is recommended to spray little by little and repeat impressions, with people who make a lot of plums 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.620
 There is also a direction that uses the base material of criticism 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.620
 Do yourself at your own risk 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:52.870
 Of course there are good things in this kit too 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.170
 It is a rare must-have with a clumsy left-handed handle 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.510
 If you use this, it will be possible to hold the rifle with both hands 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.400
 Hey there is no path 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.770
 Two rifle has a light-emitting part of the also clear pink But I not about only one beam saber 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.100
 It is advantageous and is advantageous with j j 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:12.570
 Hey but the base of the beam saber is not about only one 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.490
 The biggest surprise is the head of Hazel 2 and Gundam Mark 2 Titans 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.700
 If you use weapons and backpacks 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.700
 It is a point that can reproduce the next-generation mass-production type prototype and four crawling animals by pachi group 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.350
 It is different from the illustration of the super hobby magazine 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.460
 If you have some brain , then add gp zero 1 to the game Giren's ambition 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.180
 Appeared in 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:37.160
 頑駄 Oh I would be able to make even non-MaA屈 prototype zero Unit 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.160
 But it's not the most aftermath of this kit
