00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
environment has been terrible for a very

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.410 
environment has been terrible for a very
long<00:01:02.160> time<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.760> about<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.270> we

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
long time and it's about time that we

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.539 
long time and it's about time that we
did<00:01:03.660> something<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
did something about it but is that the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.250 
did something about it but is that the
government's<00:01:06.090> job<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.659> mean<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> government

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
government's job I mean the government

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
government's job I mean the government
is<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:07.799> playing<00:01:08.070> nanny<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.729> guess<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.240> as

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
is now playing nanny that I guess we as

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
is now playing nanny that I guess we as
parents<00:01:09.689> can't<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> job<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> maybe<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
parents can't do the job so maybe the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.940 
parents can't do the job so maybe the
government<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
government can I don't think the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
government can I don't think the
government<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.490> being<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.880> nanny<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
mean if you think about it I think that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.469 
mean if you think about it I think that
what's<00:01:17.400> happening<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.030> we're<00:01:18.299> just

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
could argue that adding broccolis out to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.060 
could argue that adding broccolis out to
a<00:02:52.180> salad<00:02:52.390> bar<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.380> school<00:02:53.650> as<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.830> matter<00:02:53.980> of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
a salad bar in a school as a matter of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.800 
a salad bar in a school as a matter of
national<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.730> what<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.030> they<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.450> canned

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
national so what if they have canned

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.840 
national so what if they have canned
peaches<00:02:56.110> at<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> salad<00:02:56.800> bar<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.550> wouldn't<00:02:57.790> be
