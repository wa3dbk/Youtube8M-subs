00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.260

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.260
 and we are going to go up the third floor 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.900
 here says 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.320
 quarter of war as you can see 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.840
 here if someone gets you 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.560
 they can take weapons with swords to throw 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.040

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.850
 where every good let's continue here there 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.170
 the first car and clothes 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.940
 or armors as you want to call the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.940
 second of weapons 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.340
 and the third one we're going 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.290
 well now we are going to go up the 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.670
 last floor 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.040
 well this floor is not so 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.040
 how do you think it is 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.870
 have a view but if I do not have far 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.330
 but if you put it up close 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.299
 this I did so in case you 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.970
 They want to remove my problem and they want it 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.740
 turn into something 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.640
 Hahaha 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.580
 and good 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.660
 here is you if you want to break this 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.549
 crystal and so they put stairs here or not 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.680
 this must be done because the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.750
 stairs can not be converted that 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.969
 this is taken from you and they make another floor like 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.839
 want to announce them 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.839
 let's see 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.770
 I will announce that they have to be 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.900
 subscribed for because I'm going to make a top 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.540
 they have to be subscribed to see 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.520
 the houses that are going to win and the winner 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.910
 that is going to take that is going to take 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:57.400
 that is going to take that is going to take 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:59.449

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.919

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.419

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.950
 is and I will upload everything that you 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.380
 they ask 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.380
 that's why they have to be subscribed 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.450
