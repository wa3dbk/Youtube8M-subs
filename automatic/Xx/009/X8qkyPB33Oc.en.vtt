this<00:00:44.940> robotics<00:00:45.480> project<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.110> previously<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this robotics project was previously in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
this robotics project was previously in
charge<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> Android<00:00:47.760> he<00:00:48.300> called<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
charge of Android he called it a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.900 
charge of Android he called it a
moonshot<00:00:49.469> vision<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.760> take<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
moonshot vision and it could take a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.389 
moonshot vision and it could take a
decade<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> build<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.860> week<00:00:53.129> we

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
decade to build out so this week we

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.670 
decade to build out so this week we
learned<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.820> Amazon<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.750> working<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.289> flying

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
learned that Amazon is working on flying

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
learned that Amazon is working on flying
drones<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.460> Google<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.390> building<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.989> fleet<00:00:58.289> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
drones and Google is building a fleet of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.189 
drones and Google is building a fleet of
humanoid<00:00:58.980> robots<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.300> guess<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.780> won't<00:01:00.960> have

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
humanoid robots so I guess we won't have

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.810 
humanoid robots so I guess we won't have
to<00:01:01.350> wait<00:01:01.530> too<00:01:01.559> long<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.489> machine

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to wait too long for the machine

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210 
to wait too long for the machine

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.530 
uprising against mankind if you're
getting<00:01:05.400> bored<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.820> today's<00:01:06.180> smartphones

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
