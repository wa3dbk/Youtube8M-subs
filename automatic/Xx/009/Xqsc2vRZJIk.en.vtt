you<00:00:06.150> know<00:00:06.240> at<00:00:06.359> first<00:00:07.010> there<00:00:08.010> was<00:00:08.099> just<00:00:08.280> a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
you know at first there was just a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.400 
you know at first there was just a
little<00:00:08.460> bit<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.700> lightning<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.870> few<00:00:10.230> drops

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
little bit of lightning and a few drops

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.630 
little bit of lightning and a few drops
of<00:00:10.590> rain<00:00:14.269> but<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.540> kept<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:16.369> it<00:00:17.369> kept

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of rain but as we kept going it kept

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:34.930 
of rain but as we kept going it kept
getting<00:00:17.760> worse

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.150 

there<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> worst

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
there I was in one of the worst

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.760 
there I was in one of the worst
torrential<00:00:38.790> downpours<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.410> ever

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
torrential downpours that I have ever

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.850 
torrential downpours that I have ever
driven<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.750> could<00:00:43.350> tell<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
driven in and I could tell where the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.939 
driven in and I could tell where the
lanes<00:00:44.070> were<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.570> traction<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.410> perfect

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
lanes were the the traction was perfect

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.060 
lanes were the the traction was perfect
the<00:00:47.519> wipers<00:00:48.059> adjusted<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.050> however<00:00:49.350> much<00:00:49.769> rain

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the wipers adjusted to however much rain

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.280 
the wipers adjusted to however much rain
there<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.720> was<00:00:51.780> incredibly

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
there was it was it was incredibly

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
there was it was it was incredibly
impressive

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 

you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.329> I<00:01:27.360> guess<00:01:27.509> there's<00:01:27.630> part<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.110> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you know I guess there's part of me that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.069 
you know I guess there's part of me that
thinks<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.149> car<00:01:30.450> shouldn't<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
thinks that that a car shouldn't have a

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.859 
thinks that that a car shouldn't have a
lot<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> electronics<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.670> still<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
lot of electronics and I still like the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.830 
lot of electronics and I still like the
older<00:01:34.200> cars<00:01:34.469> they<00:01:35.189> feel<00:01:35.429> solid<00:01:35.969> they<00:01:36.179> feel<00:01:36.539> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
older cars they feel solid they feel I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.529 
older cars they feel solid they feel I
don't<00:01:37.469> know<00:01:37.560> there's<00:01:37.799> something<00:01:38.240> basic<00:01:39.240> about

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
don't know there's something basic about

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.590 
don't know there's something basic about
them<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.549> say<00:01:41.789> that<00:01:42.119> after

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
them but but I have to say that after

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.309 
them but but I have to say that after
after<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> experience<00:01:44.069> in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.319> thunderstorm

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
after the experience in the thunderstorm

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.899 
after the experience in the thunderstorm
that<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:48.020> really<00:01:49.020> came<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.319> appreciate<00:01:49.909> how

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that I really came to appreciate how

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
that I really came to appreciate how
these<00:01:51.149> electronics<00:01:51.929> can<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.009> much<00:01:53.219> for

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
these electronics can can do so much for

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.410 
these electronics can can do so much for
you<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:55.020> ignore<00:01:55.950> them<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.850> world<00:01:57.149> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
you that to ignore them in a world of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
you that to ignore them in a world of
where<00:01:57.840> everything's<00:01:58.319> computerized<00:01:58.619> today

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
where everything's computerized today

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.779 
where everything's computerized today

we took the car on on a 2,000 mile

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.930 
we took the car on on a 2,000 mile
journey<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.470> fact<00:02:48.740> when<00:02:49.010> we<00:02:49.040> when<00:02:49.370> we<00:02:49.490> got<00:02:49.700> back

from the trip we were right at 2,000
miles<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.750> might<00:02:53.930> have<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.170> drive<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.440> a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
miles I might have to drive just a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.780 
miles I might have to drive just a
little<00:02:55.400> bit<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.700> finish<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.120> off
