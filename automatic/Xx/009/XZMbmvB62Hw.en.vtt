we I use it all the time and I ventured
out<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:33.930> opening<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> box

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
out actually opening this out of the box

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
out actually opening this out of the box
and<00:01:35.250> releasing<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.060> was<00:01:36.240> thoroughly

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and releasing it and I was thoroughly

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.359 
and releasing it and I was thoroughly
impressed<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> results<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.740> let<00:01:38.310> me

show<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> first<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> electric<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.630> here

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
show you first the electric right here

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.510 
show you first the electric right here
real<00:01:39.930> quick<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.590> I'll<00:01:40.710> show<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.890> pen

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
grinder basically the electric grinder

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.819 
grinder basically the electric grinder
it's<00:01:44.070> pretty<00:01:44.280> foolproof<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.470> turn

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's pretty foolproof you just you turn

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's pretty foolproof you just you turn
it<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.009> before<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.460> fill<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> there's<00:01:48.299> three

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it on before you fill it there's three

as<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.840> basically<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.800> just<00:02:16.830> made

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
as you can see basically that just made

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.310 
as you can see basically that just made
a<00:02:17.400> flower<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.970> there's<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.600> lot<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.020> different

here<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:37.560> next<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.160> want<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.370> show<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.610> so

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
here the next one I want to show you so

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.060 
here the next one I want to show you so
under<00:02:39.060> jr.<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> said<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.830> don't<00:02:40.920> need

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
under jr. and like I said you don't need

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.470 
under jr. and like I said you don't need
power<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:41.820> clamped<00:02:42.030> onto<00:02:42.270> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
power for this it's clamped onto the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.080 
power for this it's clamped onto the
counter<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.709> pour<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> grain<00:02:44.250> into<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
counter you pour the grain into the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.270 
counter you pour the grain into the
hopper<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.870> or<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.040> of

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
hopper and then you or you get one of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:01.600 
hopper and then you or you get one of
your<00:02:50.400> kids<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.600> drink<00:02:51.900> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.740 

now<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.940> can<00:03:03.030> see<00:03:03.210> it's<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.480> little<00:03:03.600> bit

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
now as you can see it's a little bit

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.210 
now as you can see it's a little bit
slower<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.560> wouldn't<00:03:04.740> do<00:03:04.860> this

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
slower and you wouldn't do this

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.730 
slower and you wouldn't do this
day-to-day<00:03:05.580> if<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.060> had<00:03:06.270> power<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> still

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
day-to-day if you had power but it still

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.470 
day-to-day if you had power but it still
makes<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.100> really<00:03:08.370> nice<00:03:09.050> fine<00:03:10.050> flower<00:03:11.480> so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
makes a really nice fine flower so

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.750 
makes a really nice fine flower so
basically<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.560> would<00:03:13.800> suggest<00:03:13.950> analyze<00:03:14.580> your

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
basically I would suggest analyze your

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.220 
basically I would suggest analyze your
needs<00:03:14.940> analyze<00:03:15.420> why<00:03:15.690> you're<00:03:15.930> eating<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
grinder what it's for is to use to

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.460 
grinder what it's for is to use to
storage<00:03:18.450> every<00:03:18.690> day<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:18.959> order<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.260> actually

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
storage every day in order to actually

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.020 
storage every day in order to actually
use<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.040> definitely<00:03:20.520> recommend<00:03:20.790> the
