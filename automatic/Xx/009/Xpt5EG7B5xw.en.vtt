check of the bishop so the another way
another<00:02:46.260> way<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> think<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.100> what<00:02:47.610> black<00:02:48.060> is

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
another way to think is what black is

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.510 
another way to think is what black is
just<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.600> very<00:02:48.990> mu<00:02:49.230> which<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:49.920> hoping<00:02:50.459> that

white do some kind of mistakes and he

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.020 
white do some kind of mistakes and he
can<00:02:52.650> jump<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:55.610> here<00:02:56.610> wife<00:02:56.850> will

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
can jump on on it and here wife will

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.699 
can jump on on it and here wife will
continue<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> d3<00:02:58.260> Bishop<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.830> d3<00:02:58.980> and<00:03:00.709> if

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.850 
from the Black is just kick this knife
what<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.860> actually<00:03:20.160> doing<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.580> well<00:03:21.330> maybe

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
what is actually doing here well maybe

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.259 
what is actually doing here well maybe
as<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.920> black<00:03:23.220> bear<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.519> think<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.000> while

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
as a black bear you think that while

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.390 
as a black bear you think that while
white<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.810> after<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.230> edges<00:03:25.920> haven't<00:03:26.190> born

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
white is after that edges haven't born

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.020 
white is after that edges haven't born
so<00:03:27.150> why<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.840> kick<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.170> Knight<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.760> if<00:03:29.760> they

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
so why not kick this Knight and if they

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.640 
so why not kick this Knight and if they
play<00:03:30.269> move<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:30.930> at<00:03:31.170> 6<00:03:31.680> or<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.330> f6<00:03:33.410> they<00:03:34.410> will

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
play move like at 6 or the f6 they will

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.810 
play move like at 6 or the f6 they will
come<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.190> blunder<00:03:35.519> house<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.560> here<00:03:37.560> our

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
come to a blunder house and here our

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.020 
come to a blunder house and here our
chest<00:03:38.820> strap<00:03:39.090> works<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.709> as<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.280> wide<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:41.880> will

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
chest strap works so as a wide you will

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.050 
chest strap works so as a wide you will
play<00:03:42.239> Queen<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.930> h5<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:44.090> now<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.570> see<00:03:46.140> that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
play Queen to h5 and now you see that

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.970 
play Queen to h5 and now you see that
that<00:03:48.060> pawn<00:03:48.420> cannot<00:03:49.049> take<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.410> knight<00:03:49.590> because

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
that pawn cannot take the knight because

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.420 
that pawn cannot take the knight because
it's<00:03:50.400> pin<00:03:50.900> because<00:03:51.900> for<00:03:52.440> example<00:03:53.070> let's<00:03:53.250> say<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it's pin because for example let's say a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.130 
it's pin because for example let's say a
black<00:03:53.760> take<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.090> Knight<00:03:54.269> then<00:03:54.570> we<00:03:54.840> can<00:03:54.989> catch

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
black take this Knight then we can catch

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.060 
black take this Knight then we can catch
the<00:03:55.350> rook<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.820> we<00:03:56.820> are<00:03:57.030> exchanged<00:03:57.480> up<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.070> not

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
the rook and we are exchanged up and not

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.460 
the rook and we are exchanged up and not
only<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.400> here<00:04:00.330> white<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.840> threatening<00:04:01.290> or

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
only that here white is threatening or

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.940 
only that here white is threatening or
f7<00:04:02.010> mate<00:04:02.810> now<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.200> two<00:04:04.470> ways<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:05.010> defend<00:04:05.549> this

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
f7 mate now that two ways to defend this

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.220 
f7 mate now that two ways to defend this
let's<00:04:07.950> take<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.640> first<00:04:08.820> option<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.420> which<00:04:10.110> is

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
let's take the first option is which is

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.770 
let's take the first option is which is
the<00:04:10.350> worst<00:04:10.560> option<00:04:10.769> is<00:04:11.580> like<00:04:11.820> moving<00:04:12.540> this

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
the worst option is like moving this

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.960 
the worst option is like moving this
point<00:04:13.019> further<00:04:13.170> well<00:04:14.130> here<00:04:14.430> white<00:04:14.760> can<00:04:14.940> simply

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
point further well here white can simply

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.469 
point further well here white can simply
take<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.540> pawn<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> bishop<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.609> if<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
take this pawn the bishop and if the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.449 
take this pawn the bishop and if the
like<00:04:19.109> let's<00:04:19.380> say<00:04:19.470> black<00:04:19.590> capture<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.190> Ruby

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
like let's say black capture this Ruby

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.700 
like let's say black capture this Ruby
shop<00:04:20.609> then<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.660> can<00:04:21.780> capture<00:04:22.020> do<00:04:22.200> capture<00:04:22.530> by

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
shop then we can capture do capture by

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.710 
shop then we can capture do capture by
