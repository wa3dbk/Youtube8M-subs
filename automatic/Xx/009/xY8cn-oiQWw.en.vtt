00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 damn guys really cool sleep 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.920
 such a beautiful place to friends we 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.349
 getting started 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.570
 and the fire has started fire and we start 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.230
 another review of mods so let's all 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.600
 extinguished 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.480
 and today we have a mod called here 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 body mod which adds two guns 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.099
 a gun that will shoot lava then 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.189
 what is yes what is why 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.320
 why everything is burning and the gun that will 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.989
 shoot water mod is actually very 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 small but cool well let's 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 I'll show you what these guns are for. 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 Naturally you probably guessed it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.559
 that with these guns you can shoot at 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.050
 mobs 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.120
 and it seems to me these guns will be very 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.340
 useful if you fight there 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 skeleton or witch so me 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 It seems a very cool mod and in crafting itself 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 gun very cheap craft it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.120
 thus only four stones 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.789
 Kraft button and bubble is very cheap to me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.770
 it seems for such a gun and the gun itself 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 It will be very useful well , let me 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.549
 I will highlight with gay fashion and show you myself 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.930
 the gun as it will look 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.780
 right in front of you shas craft and and so 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.960
 wonderful and here it is the edge of it already 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.509
 there is only 20 milliliters of water but 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.799
 you can actually see 20 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 liters of water is only 1 time 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.450
 shoot that is why you need to find 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.420
 some source of either water or 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.549
 lava and accordingly fill our 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.670
 let's start a gun 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.070
 shoot water oh damn I'm too much 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.710
 too much water took our endless 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.049
 the water source has disappeared so let me him 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.960
 restore sorry you can not do 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.750
 endless source Lovato would be 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.759
 a whole bunch of shells so let's 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 someone will attack defenseless and smoking 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.100
 you will bring a sheep about a pig as here 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.009
 look for and what not to eat me 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.610
 cool gun see guys i killed a pig 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.150
 somewhere having spent 240 milliliters of water but 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.950
 this pig is understandable and here 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.970
 soon we will check how it will work 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.120
 You see, the principle is somewhere like this. 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.210
 charges of water are enough to kill uh 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.230
 how many pigs are you from where are you 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.990
 I don't understand that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.600
 me one for one charge 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.970
 being one gun was enough for 4 pigs 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.160
 This principle is not bad, that is, damn even 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.580
 go to collect so here you can meat 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.130
 don't even carry a sword just walk 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 shoot at all of the water 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.330
 guns need and let's test 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.490
 now naturally lava cannon it 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.700
 certainly more fun and of course it is 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.980
 cooler because mom will clean up 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.440
 two times faster, well, that our pigs 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.370
 Submit here today we tortured pigs 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.740
 just do your piggy come on with vodka 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.780
 did not hit slightly so well she and it seems to me 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.430
 itself will burn and if we even burn 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.080
 it seems to me ready meat from it 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.910
 let the pig come out well let's die 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.910
 give myasma knit knit knit where myasko 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.459
 Well, are you hungry or something wonderful ? 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.650
 even fried meat right away it's just 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.360
 super, that is, can even go kill 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.910
 mobs you will have ready meat 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.459
 Immediately eat it but lava as you 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.230
 you get it will be harder because 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.500
 that endless source of lava is impossible 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.660
 make therefore charges for lava will 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.970
 limited amount so this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.760
 have to save well then we checked 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.850
 our new gun on pigs by the way 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.610
 how much I spent milliliters on a pig 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.650
 o see 80 milliliters of lava total 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.500
 spent on a pig with all that 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.890
 when i took the water cannon i spent 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.320
 250 is already noticeable well then friends 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.110
 now, accordingly, we have 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.459
 the battle to really show you all 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.130
 the power of the cannon I will sleep 4 creepers 4 witches 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:02.720
 and 4 endermen zaspavnim them right here 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:05.870
 here here and delirious rather run off and the devil 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.269
 what exactly is peace we have 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.220
 complexity as I forgot to remove 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.420
 let me naturally take 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.630
 all these creeper back and drove 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.940
 drove drove guys stand guys not 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.510
 you need to know why you are so fast 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.070
 blow up 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.320
 so so so so so so so so 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.080
 went gone went gone him 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.570

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.710
 guns of course because but see all 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.570
 equal at a distance it is more secure 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.990

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.970
