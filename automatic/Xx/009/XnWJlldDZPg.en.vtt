00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
then for people who don't have amia you

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.569 
then for people who don't have amia you
can<00:03:54.569> cut<00:03:54.780> out<00:03:54.900> villains<00:03:55.469> to<00:03:55.680> shoot<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.159> guess

that's<00:03:56.760> almost<00:03:57.000> as<00:03:57.180> good<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:57.900> for<00:03:58.200> older

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that's almost as good so for older

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.960 
that's almost as good so for older
people<00:03:58.859> probably<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.340> main<00:03:59.489> reason<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.819> get

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
people probably the main reason to get

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.670
