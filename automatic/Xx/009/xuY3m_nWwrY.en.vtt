00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.979
 no matter the name 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:30.640
 you open the program fire and 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.909
 this will stay here for the sake of going 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.420
 select bet of the circuit was created 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.929

 It is not too late now, and here it is. 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:55.270
 being here you 're going down here and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.799

 it does not take too long for a minute in the 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.110
 Minimum 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.060
