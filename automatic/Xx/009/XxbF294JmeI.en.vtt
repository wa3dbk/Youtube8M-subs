00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.480 
involved and so mace is backing up and
like<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.289> could<00:05:01.409> tell<00:05:01.680> mace<00:05:01.949> is<00:05:02.129> heating

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
like you could tell mace is heating

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.189

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
because mace is talking louder than he

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.230 
because mace is talking louder than he
probably<00:05:04.469> normally<00:05:05.190> would<00:05:05.400> but<00:05:05.849> he's<00:05:05.940> still

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
