 put your arms in your ears and came 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.890
 touch the wall pushes back and touch your 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 repulsed feet touched the wall that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.450
 was pushing your feet pushed back and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.579
 cetera does this exercise at least five 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.670
 It's going to do a lot of good for you 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 and most importantly warm up your back the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.109
 second exercise to warm up the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.770
 back you actually come to sleep on 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.570
 The belly 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 catch your shins with your tomorrow 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.530
 tried to stretch your legs 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.380
 this will shoot you in the back but that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.270
 also heats very well 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.820
 and then just put yourself in 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.299
 new back to the wall the length of a 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.479
 arm and you help the wall to get off 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.649
 in point the purpose of this exercise is 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.579
 also to unblock the shoulders so 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.810
 watch in the video how am I going 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.810
 try to do the same 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.780
 then you have to learn who 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.280
 so point for those ci and you from a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.289
 sofa 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.119
 put your hands in front of this one is 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.509
 put your foot on the couch 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.979
 is pushed back to return to France 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.409
 then you can again put yourself 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.409
 back to a wall and known places 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.580
 the purpose of this exercise and to learn the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.490
 the euro goes up so for this if you put 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.490
 your tomorrow at the same level against the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.979
 wall and you push back in order to come back 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.640
 standing you put your hands under and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:09.619
 least to so that you live and that 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.810
 you can succeed on the ground as soon as 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.190
 you feel ready you can try at 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.230
 floor but still on a mattress 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.790
 what may happen is that either 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.660
 you do not go up or wish you 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.700
 fall back on your knees 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.410
 then you will have to learn the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.650
 who to ride on both legs 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.260
 and then the team missed laughing on a 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.040
 single leg and slow down the second and then 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.720
 back on both legs and finally the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.730
 flexibility before always on the mattress 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.590
 for now as soon as we feel ready 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030
 you can try the ground but do not 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.549
 never passed your hands underneath 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.989
 as you just saw but remained 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.989
 always arms to ears 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.030
 I still have a little advice for you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.600
 for you to succeed 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.580
 flexibility 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.290
 before so it's actually always 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.330
 keep your legs apart and not 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.850
 never the series is it really going to you 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.350
 help especially to go back up is really 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.350
 much pushed back on the shoulders 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.970
