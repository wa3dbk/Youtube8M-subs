Pepsi<00:00:40.649> said<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.510> could<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:42.870> be

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
Pepsi said that this could not be

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200 
Pepsi said that this could not be
because<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> mouse<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.879> dissolved

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
because the mouse would have dissolved

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.200 
because the mouse would have dissolved
there<00:00:45.719> wouldn't<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.110> been<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.289> whole<00:00:46.710> mouse

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
there wouldn't have been a whole mouse

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.200 
there wouldn't have been a whole mouse

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.819 

experiment<00:00:54.210> time<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> perfect

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
experiment time this is the perfect

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.920 
experiment time this is the perfect
opportunity<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:57.120> some<00:00:57.539> kind<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
opportunity to do some kind of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.319 
opportunity to do some kind of
experiment<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> Mountain<00:00:59.010> Dew<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.520> must

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
experiment with the Mountain Dew I must

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
experiment with the Mountain Dew I must
admit<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
admit that I do have a little bit of a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.290 
admit that I do have a little bit of a
conflict<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.730> interest

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
conflict of interest

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.030 
conflict of interest
I<00:01:04.010> love<00:01:05.090> Mountain<00:01:06.090> Dew<00:01:06.330> does<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.439> new<00:01:07.619> really

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
I love Mountain Dew does not new really

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.899 
I love Mountain Dew does not new really
dissolve<00:01:08.430> mice<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.430> not<00:01:11.430> only<00:01:11.580> does

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
dissolve mice really and not only does

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
dissolve mice really and not only does
it<00:01:11.970> dissolve<00:01:12.420> mice<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.170> does<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> dissolve

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it dissolve mice but does it dissolve

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
it dissolve mice but does it dissolve
mice<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> different<00:01:15.390> from

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
mice in a way that is different from

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.530 
mice in a way that is different from
other<00:01:16.380> substances<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.580> plain<00:01:18.030> water<00:01:18.360> or

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
other substances like plain water or

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.170 
other substances like plain water or
lemon<00:01:19.200> juice<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:21.259> we<00:01:22.259> devised<00:01:22.560> an<00:01:22.799> experiment

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
lemon juice so we devised an experiment

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.850 
lemon juice so we devised an experiment
the<00:01:24.180> only<00:01:24.630> size<00:01:24.930> Mouse<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.740> could

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the only size Mouse that could

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
the only size Mouse that could
reasonably<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.670> poured<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
reasonably be poured out of a can of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600 
reasonably be poured out of a can of
Mountain<00:01:28.229> Dew<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> pinky<00:01:29.430> Mouse

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
Mountain Dew would be a pinky Mouse

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880 
Mountain Dew would be a pinky Mouse
which<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> little<00:01:30.570> baby<00:01:30.720> mouse<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.710> that's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
which is a little baby mouse so that's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.789 
which is a little baby mouse so that's
what<00:01:32.159> we've<00:01:32.340> got<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.479> see<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:34.500> mice

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
what we've got so you can see these mice

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.120 
what we've got so you can see these mice
can<00:01:35.220> fit<00:01:35.460> reasonably<00:01:36.180> well<00:01:36.470> into<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
can fit reasonably well into the can of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.580 
can fit reasonably well into the can of
Mountain<00:01:38.250> Dew<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.970> since<00:01:39.600> some<00:01:39.930> people<00:01:39.960> were

Mountain Dew and since some people were

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
Mountain Dew and since some people were
saying<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:42.030> bitty<00:01:42.150> mice<00:01:42.329> couldn't

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
saying that a little bitty mice couldn't

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.170 
have crawled into a mountain Dew can I
also<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.759> adult<00:01:45.000> mice<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.530> safe<00:01:47.180> here

what<00:02:11.140> we're<00:02:11.260> trying<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.620> do<00:02:11.920> with<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.849> sugar

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
what we're trying to do with the sugar

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.199 
what we're trying to do with the sugar
lemon<00:02:13.390> water<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:15.280> lemon<00:02:15.580> corn<00:02:16.000> syrup

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
lemon water and the lemon corn syrup

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.780 
lemon water and the lemon corn syrup
water<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:17.129> approximate<00:02:18.129> Mountain<00:02:18.640> Dew

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
water is approximate Mountain Dew

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.430 
water is approximate Mountain Dew
without<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.450> actually<00:02:19.569> being<00:02:19.810> Mountain<00:02:20.290> Dew

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
without it actually being Mountain Dew

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.430 
without it actually being Mountain Dew
so<00:02:20.709> as<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.730> can<00:02:21.849> see<00:02:22.060> our<00:02:22.269> mice<00:02:22.540> are<00:02:22.840> all<00:02:23.050> now

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
so as you can see our mice are all now

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.479 
so as you can see our mice are all now
in<00:02:24.430> their<00:02:24.940> respective<00:02:25.330> little<00:02:25.959> jars<00:02:26.430> okay<00:02:27.430> so

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
in their respective little jars okay so

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.300 
in their respective little jars okay so
I'm<00:02:27.790> going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.000> go<00:02:28.180> ahead<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.630> pour<00:02:28.980> might<00:02:29.980> do

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
I'm going to go ahead and pour might do

00:02:30.310 --> 00:03:00.450 
I'm going to go ahead and pour might do
in<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.970> ease<00:02:31.620> my<00:02:32.620> cups<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.519> then<00:02:34.030> seal<00:02:34.660> them<00:02:34.900> up

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.490 

36<00:03:01.460> grams<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.940> sugar<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:03.110> actually<00:03:03.230> measure

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
36 grams of sugar I can actually measure

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:23.440 
36 grams of sugar I can actually measure
that<00:03:09.430> 26<00:03:10.430> grams<00:03:16.840> grams<00:03:22.120> there's<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.270> much

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
that 26 grams grams there's this much

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.320 
that 26 grams grams there's this much
sugar<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:23.990> one<00:03:24.170> can<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:24.470> Mountain<00:03:24.710> Dew

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
sugar in one can of Mountain Dew

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.490 
sugar in one can of Mountain Dew
although<00:03:26.330> actually<00:03:26.720> we<00:03:26.840> don't<00:03:26.990> have<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> full

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
although actually we don't have a full

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.620 
although actually we don't have a full
pan<00:03:27.830> in<00:03:28.040> there<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.520> I'm<00:03:28.610> gonna<00:03:28.760> use<00:03:28.970> probably<00:03:29.600> a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
pan in there so I'm gonna use probably a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.970 
pan in there so I'm gonna use probably a
little<00:03:29.930> less<00:03:30.200> I'm<00:03:30.440> just<00:03:30.590> gonna<00:03:30.680> sort<00:03:30.950> of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
little less I'm just gonna sort of

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.110 
little less I'm just gonna sort of
approximate<00:03:31.900> like<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> third<00:03:33.230> or<00:03:33.410> something

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
approximate like a third or something

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.240 
approximate like a third or something
here<00:03:35.120> in<00:03:35.270> lemon<00:03:35.630> or<00:03:35.840> sugar<00:03:36.200> for<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:36.950> that's<00:03:37.160> a

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
here in lemon or sugar for you that's a

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.050 
here in lemon or sugar for you that's a
messy<00:03:37.760> oh<00:03:44.230> yeah

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
messy oh yeah

00:03:46.060 --> 00:04:03.350 
messy oh yeah

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
think actually the mice were probably in

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
you'll just have to stick around to see

you'll just have to stick around to see
what<00:05:24.690> happens

study has several limitations one this
is<00:05:39.330> clearly<00:05:39.600> on<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.840> blinded<00:05:40.320> study

is clearly on a blinded study
I<00:05:40.860> know<00:05:40.980> exactly<00:05:41.190> what<00:05:41.670> are<00:05:41.820> in<00:05:41.940> these<00:05:42.090> jars

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
I know exactly what are in these jars

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.710 
I know exactly what are in these jars
but<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.380> think<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:44.040> the<00:05:44.310> biological<00:05:44.850> effect

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
but I think that the biological effect

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.750 
but I think that the biological effect
will<00:05:45.870> be<00:05:45.900> clear<00:05:46.560> despite<00:05:47.250> my<00:05:47.490> lack<00:05:47.730> of
