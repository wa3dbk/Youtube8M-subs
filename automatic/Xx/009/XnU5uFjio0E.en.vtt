or messaging me because of yeah there

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.590 
or messaging me because of yeah there
probably<00:02:26.670> isn't<00:02:26.790> because<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.450> 10

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
probably isn't because they think of 10

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.970 
probably isn't because they think of 10
because<00:02:27.750> whenever<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.170> go<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.350> his<00:02:28.560> profile

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
because whenever you go to his profile

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.170 
because whenever you go to his profile
damn<00:02:30.440> damn<00:02:31.440> oh<00:02:32.160> because<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.000> pictures

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
damn damn oh because one of the pictures

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.270 
damn damn oh because one of the pictures
actually<00:02:33.420> had<00:02:33.900> 1v1<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.560> his<00:02:34.680> clan<00:02:34.920> tags<00:02:35.160> I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
actually had 1v1 in his clan tags I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.680 
actually had 1v1 in his clan tags I
guess<00:02:35.430> that's<00:02:35.580> why<00:02:35.640> I'm<00:02:35.730> eating<00:02:35.910> 1v1<00:02:36.180> messages

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
guess that's why I'm eating 1v1 messages

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.570 
guess that's why I'm eating 1v1 messages
but<00:02:37.110> they're<00:02:37.260> not<00:02:37.380> me<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.860> whenever<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.430> go

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
but they're not me and whenever you go

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.010 
but they're not me and whenever you go
to<00:02:38.640> his<00:02:38.880> profile<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.660> end<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.900> game

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
to his profile so if the end of the game

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.780 
to his profile so if the end of the game
with<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> fake<00:02:40.380> faze<00:02:40.620> rain<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.489> go<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.670> his

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
with a fake faze rain and you go to his
