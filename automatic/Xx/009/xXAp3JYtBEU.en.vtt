00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.660
 Hello my name is Dmitri 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.720
 Pobedinsky I welcome you to 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.820
 the attic you see the heading of the sciences survey 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.730
 since ancient times, people have inspired 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.650
 flights of birds and scientists of all eras tried 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.659
 create an ornithopter device 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.849
 allowing rise into the air waving 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.739
 wings but no matter how hard they tried 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.349
 attempts using only male 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.570
 wore a man were turned to failure 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.219
 it turns out the birds have a huge 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 number of cunning devices 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.809
 let's fly in them 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.059
 We will understand and understand whether they can be 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.829
 human start with the fact that the birds are 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.719
 phenomenally strong animals 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.940
 if you increase for example pigeons to 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.519
 the size of a man, then he is exactly 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.739
 will be stronger than any weightlifter in birds 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.289
 the mass of the pectoral muscles may be greater than 20 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.749
 percent by weight of the whole body and they have 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.699
 there is a type this is a special bone in the middle 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.190
 and the chest which fastens these strong 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.140
 muscles providing movement of the wings 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.270
 another factor allowing birds 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.910
 fly they are very light hollow bones 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.550
 missing teeth feather use 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.560
 instead of wool all this for the sake of diminishing 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.000
 weights and you just imagine 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.250
 there are no muscles 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.410
 there are only tendons that are like strings 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.230
 move your fingers can pay attention 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.510
 on the chicken in the store only eat meat 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.820
 lower leg and thigh and this is done as 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.040
 for ease and for more streamlined 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.440
 body shape because in flight birds need 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.540
 good aerodynamics pressing small 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.910
 paws to the body of the bird achieve very 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.710
 good streamlining and by the way precisely 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.020
 same reason, head them smoothly 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.550
 develops into the body and not something that we 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.960
 oh well as for these 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.540
 devices at least we can 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.820
 imagine that this can be done with 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.650
 man but it's not all on 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.170
 the flight actually requires huge 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.360
 effort and energy costs and birds 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.640
 to maintain it is very necessary 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.770
 lots of oxygen so breathing is in them 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.020
 brought to near perfection they 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.450
 use double breathing in which 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.400
 oxygen flows continuously and at 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.260
 inhaling and exhaling the matter is that for 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.509
 air circulation birds have 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.649
 special air bags which 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.230
 can take up to 20 percent and then 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.239
 ema body and if briefly while inhaling a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.519
 air enters the lungs and into these 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.420
 air bags and when you exhale out 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.670
 air bags 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.610
 he gets into the lungs in this way through 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.290
 they are constantly passing fresh air 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.689
 rich in oxygen besides birds 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.209
 huge heart she is over 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.310
 two percent body weight and beats 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.010
 it is much more often such as small 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.420
 feathered over 1000 times a minute and there are 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.939
 another curious fact 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.540
 the heaviest flying bird is 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.239
 bustard 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.180
 its weight is about 20 kilograms and nothing 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.129
 heavier does not fly ie there is 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.750
 some theoretical limit is logical 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.670
 that with increasing mass should 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.650
 increase lift and how 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.599
 consequence power only mass 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.970
 increases in proportion to the volume 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.680
 There are 3 degrees of size and power 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.170
 increases in proportion to the area 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.359
 cross-section of the muscle that is second 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.769
 degree size and even trite by building 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.629
 square and cube graphics 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.180
 can see that body weight is growing 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.920
 much faster than power that is 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.590
 it turns out all the same there is some kind of limit 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.139
 the weight of an animal that is capable of flying and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.060
 by most estimates it is no more than 40 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.250
 kilogram as for huge 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.079
 fossil birds and pterodactyles mass in 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.389
 200 kilograms they could hardly 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.430
 free to fly most likely they just 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.159
 planned from a great height and only 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.780
 occasionally at great cost could 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.669
 climb a few meters but 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.799
 back to the flight of the person you want 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.780
 note that some success 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.079
 still managed to achieve the truth 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.459
 using fixed wings and legs 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.069
 there is a huge number of aircraft 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.720
 on bicycle traction and eighty 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.669
 the eighth year was put the world 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.729
 a record in flight range on such 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.639
 115 kilometers in less than 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.359
 four hours in 2013 for men on 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.340
 by helicopter 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.709
 managed to hold sixty in the air 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.199
 four seconds and reach a height of three 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.959
 meters as for the devices waving 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.120
 there are no wings yet 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.739
 this all put likes subscribe to
