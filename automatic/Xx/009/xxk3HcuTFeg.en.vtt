00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.709
 what the boxing world represented to you before 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.599
 tpa always been a little bit the second family because it is 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.430
 juvenile mixture I lived found his eyes in the sun are akita your case 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.779
 he but also all the preparations the difficulties which met 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.630
 so it's black 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 who likes this 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.210
 I learned a lot because we have always shared a lot of it too 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.800
 regarding his work 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680
 so many on experience is 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.110
 but he told it how I lived some 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.970
 now the account now 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.970
 and this eventually also created a good foundation 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 to stay in this environment 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.940
 also what I did a year ago remained 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.330
 the environment 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.870
 a little still more importantly 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.600
 nick try to commit myself 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.710
 to give a turning point in the future to this discipline that really needs it and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 he especially deserves it 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.960
 then summer boxing tour in place. your future cubs of 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 boxing world 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.670
 absolutely yes very willingly 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.610
 I got too trivial 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.770
 now set it aside to maybe commit something else 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.510
 don't see me in the other 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.970
 so I would like to continue on this path - in these years we have 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.840
 always pressed me but youthful 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.500
 that we have seen again protagonist in the last year also in the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.400
 worldwide organizations to help friends who have brought this great one 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.620
 event in Milan what most left this experience 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.070
 let's make the state string a heart 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.360
 in people 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.200
 who have become friends 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.070
 with andrea locatelli paola taveggia 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.170
 narcon what the collaboration continues we have other projects in 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.229
 this world of boxing 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.229
 is one of which was to make people understand 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.689
 ah if you still feel like boxing 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.540
 evening with violence 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.630
 to change this idea because it is absolutely not so 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.189
 that violence 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.319
 in my opinion it is something else 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.779
 yet they are not 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:27.840
 me2 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.269
 criminals who take to the streets but are athletes 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.269
 fighting I am for victory 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:41.439
 alongside an arbitrator against judges with doctor ancona who in the case of 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.999
 necessary intervenes 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.979
 and this middle of the road doesn't happen right so tell me where the violence is 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.749
 chicks are also one 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.609
 an example of loyalty 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.319
 absolutely yes 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.689
 External boxing is a discipline that have important values ​​that help 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.779
 in training not only physical but also mental so much becomes much 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.779
 educational for young people as I am, on the other hand, many 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.839
 on the occasion of March 25th 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.339
 they expected 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:14.229
 the organization of a special attention event remember 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.549
 the anniversary of cyclists who made a choice of this is 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.649
 certainly more intimate but more familiar 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:23.479
 knowing you drink something in mind 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:24.659
 Street 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.509
 neoxene siena 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.509
 I was thinking a lot about what could be 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.969
 most suitable 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.679
 Dear 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.289
 commemorate John find him 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:38.789
 but every time it comes back to me it's March 25th 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.059
 sowing the terrible tattoo sensations was the extra day 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.049
 tragic of its novelty 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.679
 and painful of mine 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.989
 so I thought 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.439
 instead of remembering that date there 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.569
 to make people remember when I update so it was born 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.409
 that is that day I turned then that it could become the party that I was 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.730
 can do something that I would like 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.660
 something we can share with a smile to do a beautiful thing for us 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.280
 here instead of March 25 or I would like to do something beautiful sky festival thirsty in the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.869
 boxing world 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:14.949
 on December 2nd
