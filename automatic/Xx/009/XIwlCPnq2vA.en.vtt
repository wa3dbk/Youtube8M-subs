we<00:03:10.439> just<00:03:10.650> left<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.040> tunnel<00:03:11.280> area

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
we just left the tunnel area

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.259 
we just left the tunnel area
and<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.310> told<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:13.730> when<00:03:13.849> we<00:03:13.970> were<00:03:14.060> down<00:03:14.239> there

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
and I told you when we were down there

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.970 
and I told you when we were down there
at<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.689> far<00:03:14.930> end<00:03:15.200> we'll<00:03:15.409> be<00:03:15.439> entering<00:03:15.799> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
at the far end we'll be entering the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.220 
at the far end we'll be entering the
airside<00:03:16.280> matrix<00:03:16.819> that's<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.750> point<00:03:18.049> right

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
airside matrix that's this point right

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.830 
airside matrix that's this point right
here<00:03:18.400> once<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.579> bags<00:03:19.790> come<00:03:20.060> into<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.420> matrix

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
here once the bags come into the matrix

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.100 
here once the bags come into the matrix
we<00:03:21.409> need<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.769> identify<00:03:21.829> as<00:03:22.370> their<00:03:22.790> destination

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
we need to identify as their destination

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.809 
we need to identify as their destination
so<00:03:24.110> we<00:03:24.260> use<00:03:24.409> the<00:03:24.620> laser<00:03:24.799> arrays<00:03:25.220> again<00:03:25.640> the

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
so we use the laser arrays again the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.030 
so we use the laser arrays again the
tags<00:03:26.090> being<00:03:26.360> important<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.409> to<00:03:27.590> track<00:03:27.829> that

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
tags being important and to track that

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.550 
tags being important and to track that
back<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.519> that's<00:03:28.700> what<00:03:28.879> happens<00:03:29.239> right<00:03:29.450> here

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
back and that's what happens right here

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.910 
back and that's what happens right here
at<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.280> point<00:03:31.640> your<00:03:32.090> bag<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.630> traveled<00:03:33.350> about

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
at this point your bag is traveled about

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.559 
at this point your bag is traveled about
three-quarters<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.520> a<00:03:34.610> mile<00:03:35.200> okay<00:03:36.230> it's<00:03:36.590> tired

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
three-quarters of a mile okay it's tired

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.090 
three-quarters of a mile okay it's tired
but<00:03:38.569> it<00:03:38.690> just<00:03:38.840> wants<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.170> get<00:03:39.410> yes<00:03:39.830> I'm<00:03:39.980> in

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
but it just wants to get yes I'm in

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.820 
but it just wants to get yes I'm in
flight<00:03:40.340> coffee<00:03:40.700> or<00:03:41.000> something<00:03:41.420> yes

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
flight coffee or something yes

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.190 
flight coffee or something yes
those<00:03:43.070> lasers<00:03:43.640> there

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.350 

there<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.530> go<00:03:46.709> in<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.430> event<00:03:47.520> we<00:03:47.940> did<00:03:48.180> our

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
there you go in the event we did our

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.270 
there you go in the event we did our
automated<00:03:48.750> tag<00:03:49.110> Raiders<00:03:49.500> can't<00:03:49.770> see<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.099> bag

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
automated tag Raiders can't see the bag

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.820 
automated tag Raiders can't see the bag
the<00:03:51.180> barcodes<00:03:51.660> they<00:03:52.170> have<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.410> go<00:03:52.500> somewhere

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
the barcodes they have to go somewhere

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.140 
the barcodes they have to go somewhere
yeah<00:03:53.400> we<00:03:53.519> have<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.730> get<00:03:53.849> them<00:03:53.940> out<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
yeah we have to get them out of the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150 
yeah we have to get them out of the
system<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.500> only<00:03:55.620> time<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.129> have

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
system so this is the only time you have

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.920 
system so this is the only time you have
any<00:03:56.370> manual<00:03:56.849> intervention<00:03:56.910> people<00:03:57.810> get

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
any manual intervention people get

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.380 
any manual intervention people get
involved<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.920> tag<00:03:59.280> comes<00:03:59.790> down<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.269> this

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
involved that tag comes down to this

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.130 
involved that tag comes down to this
area<00:04:00.690> it'll<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.739> hand<00:04:02.040> scan<00:04:02.450> if<00:04:03.450> they<00:04:03.690> if<00:04:03.930> for

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
area it'll be hand scan if they if for

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.110 
area it'll be hand scan if they if for
some<00:04:04.170> reason<00:04:04.709> no<00:04:04.920> tag<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> bag<00:04:05.610> it's

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
some reason no tag on the bag it's

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.520 
some reason no tag on the bag it's
identified<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.050> then<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> flight

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
identified and then the flight

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.070 
identified and then the flight
information<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.519> put<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.120> dispatched<00:04:09.810> by

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
airside control room which happens to be

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.400 
airside control room which happens to be
where<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.580> brain<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.120> this<00:04:24.240> operation<00:04:24.750> lives

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
where the brain to this operation lives

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.440

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
things you know don't bother ok

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.000 
things you know don't bother ok
I'm<00:05:32.570> sure<00:05:32.780> there's<00:05:32.960> an<00:05:33.080> average<00:05:33.230> time<00:05:33.590> when

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
I'm sure there's an average time when

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.220 
I'm sure there's an average time when
you<00:05:34.220> show<00:05:34.490> up<00:05:34.520> in<00:05:35.000> your<00:05:35.360> bag<00:05:35.510> over<00:05:35.810> goes<00:05:36.050> behind

you show up in your bag over goes behind
the<00:05:36.470> magic<00:05:36.590> curtain<00:05:36.830> it's<00:05:37.400> playing

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
the magic curtain it's playing

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.000 
the magic curtain it's playing
the<00:05:39.210> closest<00:05:39.690> destination<00:05:40.440> would<00:05:40.590> be<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.740> nine

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
the closest destination would be a nine

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.130 
the closest destination would be a nine
minute<00:05:41.220> travel<00:05:41.520> on<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:41.850> conveyer<00:05:42.210> system<00:05:42.330> but

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
minute travel on a conveyer system but

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.990 
minute travel on a conveyer system but
as<00:05:43.290> we<00:05:43.500> go<00:05:43.680> off<00:05:43.920> the<00:05:44.160> length<00:05:44.370> of<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.640> arms

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
as we go off the length of the arms

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.330 
as we go off the length of the arms
we're<00:05:45.300> traveling<00:05:45.840> at<00:05:46.050> least<00:05:46.650> an<00:05:46.860> additional

thousand feet so you're looking at

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.440 
thousand feet so you're looking at
probably<00:05:49.650> 12<00:05:50.280> minutes<00:05:50.640> till<00:05:50.820> that<00:05:50.970> bag<00:05:51.150> gets

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
probably 12 minutes till that bag gets

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.050 
probably 12 minutes till that bag gets
