00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
welcome to NCIX tech tips today we're

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.340 
welcome to NCIX tech tips today we're
going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> be<00:00:03.210> covering<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.750> topic<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.259> I've

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
going to be covering a topic that I've

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.930 
going to be covering a topic that I've
been<00:00:04.529> meaning<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.950> do<00:00:05.069> for<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> very<00:00:05.430> long<00:00:05.879> time

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
been meaning to do for a very long time

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.350 
been meaning to do for a very long time
this<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.200> price<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.069> performance<00:00:08.220> ratio<00:00:08.910> in

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
this is price to performance ratio in

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.540 
this is price to performance ratio in
the<00:00:09.540> context<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.200> choosing<00:00:10.800> components<00:00:11.340> for

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
the context of choosing components for

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.970 
the context of choosing components for
your<00:00:11.790> system<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.870> we're<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.679> looking

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
your system so we're going to be looking

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.770 
your system so we're going to be looking
specifically<00:00:14.549> at<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.790> case<00:00:15.030> study<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.389> video

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
specifically at a case study on video

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050 
specifically at a case study on video
cards<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.100> applied<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> wide

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
cards but this can be applied to a wide

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.750 
cards but this can be applied to a wide
variety<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:19.109> different<00:00:19.590> system<00:00:20.160> components

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
variety of different system components

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.670 
variety of different system components
so<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.480> start<00:00:21.600> at<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> very<00:00:22.410> lowest

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
so I'm going to start at the very lowest

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.820 
so I'm going to start at the very lowest

gaming experience however we should

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
gaming experience however we should
really<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.340> looking<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.850> how<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> compares<00:01:22.200> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
really be looking at how it compares in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.429 
really be looking at how it compares in
terms<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.009> price<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.820> performance<00:01:24.000> ratio<00:01:24.840> if

value conscious computer purchaser so I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
value conscious computer purchaser so I
figured<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:36.810> better<00:01:36.869> way<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.560> benchmark<00:01:38.220> our

figured what better way to benchmark our

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
figured what better way to benchmark our
video<00:01:38.640> card<00:01:38.909> performance<00:01:39.479> than<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> use<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
run-through of this camp using fraps to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.350 
run-through of this camp using fraps to
record<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:57.960> average<00:01:58.200> frame<00:01:58.710> rate<00:01:59.090> three<00:02:00.090> times

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
record my average frame rate three times

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.880 
record my average frame rate three times
on<00:02:00.600> each<00:02:00.630> card<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.200> ensure<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.619> I'm<00:02:01.740> getting

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
on each card to ensure that I'm getting

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.249 
on each card to ensure that I'm getting
consistent<00:02:02.549> results<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.149> then<00:02:03.600> i<00:02:03.869> will<00:02:03.930> show

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
consistent results and then i will show

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
consistent results and then i will show
you<00:02:04.320> guys<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:05.040> kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.310> performance

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you guys what kind of performance

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
you guys what kind of performance
numbers<00:02:06.270> i<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.869> able<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.140> achieve<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.770> each<00:02:08.310> of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
numbers i was able to achieve on each of

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.850 
numbers i was able to achieve on each of
the<00:02:08.610> cards<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.690> we're<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> compare

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the cards then we're going to compare

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.260 
the cards then we're going to compare
that<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.209> price<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.810> those<00:02:12.930> car

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that to what the price for those car

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.030 
that to what the price for those car
Zyzz<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:14.080> will<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.350> able<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.740> determine

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
Zyzz and we will be able to determine

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.670 
Zyzz and we will be able to determine
what<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.790> best<00:02:15.970> value<00:02:16.270> because<00:02:17.140> value<00:02:17.530> is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
what is the best value because value is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.860 
what is the best value because value is
not<00:02:17.830> always<00:02:18.280> about<00:02:18.430> how<00:02:19.060> many<00:02:19.300> dollars<00:02:19.540> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
not always about how many dollars you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.950 
not always about how many dollars you
spend<00:02:20.070> more<00:02:21.070> often<00:02:21.490> than<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:22.150> about<00:02:22.330> how

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
spend more often than not it's about how

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.680 
spend more often than not it's about how
much<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.920> for<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:25.090> dollars<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.480> you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
much you get for the dollars that you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.790 
much you get for the dollars that you
spend<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> pretty<00:02:28.360> much<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.350> many<00:02:29.560> things

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
spend so pretty much like so many things

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.190 
spend so pretty much like so many things
I've<00:02:29.980> said<00:02:30.220> before<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:31.090> always<00:02:31.660> comes<00:02:31.690> down<00:02:32.020> to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
I've said before it always comes down to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.500 
I've said before it always comes down to
what<00:02:32.860> are<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> customers<00:02:33.520> actual<00:02:34.030> needs<00:02:34.240> now

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
what are the customers actual needs now

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.900 
what are the customers actual needs now
for<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.960> sake<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.470> video<00:02:35.680> today<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.400> am

for the sake of this video today I am

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.990 
for the sake of this video today I am
only<00:02:37.150> looking<00:02:37.690> at<00:02:38.020> price<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.800> 3d<00:02:39.490> graphics

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000

performance<00:02:40.210> in<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.780> specific<00:02:40.990> game<00:02:41.500> it's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
performance in a specific game it's

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.830 
performance in a specific game it's
usually<00:02:42.250> more<00:02:42.670> complicated<00:02:43.240> than<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.510> there

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
usually more complicated than that there

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.390 
usually more complicated than that there
are<00:02:44.020> features<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.500> will<00:02:44.770> matter<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.100> some

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
are features that will matter to some

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.090 
are features that will matter to some
people<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.150> not<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.390> others<00:02:46.570> as<00:02:47.080> well<00:02:47.770> as

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
people but not to others as well as

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.870 
people but not to others as well as
they're<00:02:49.090> being<00:02:49.360> factors<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:50.520> really<00:02:51.520> are

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
they're being factors that really are

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.960 
they're being factors that really are
not<00:02:52.270> performance<00:02:52.990> factors<00:02:53.230> such<00:02:53.710> as

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
not performance factors such as

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.250 
not performance factors such as
aftermarket<00:02:54.970> coolers<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.630> are<00:02:55.720> more<00:02:55.840> quiet

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
aftermarket coolers that are more quiet

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.310 
aftermarket coolers that are more quiet
or<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.860> keep<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.220> GPU<00:02:57.700> running<00:02:58.360> colder<00:02:58.870> so

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
or that keep the GPU running colder so

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.800 
or that keep the GPU running colder so
you<00:03:00.190> got<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.490> bear<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.000> mind<00:03:01.030> it's<00:03:01.540> not

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
you got to bear that in mind it's not

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.900 
you got to bear that in mind it's not
always<00:03:02.020> down<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.860> this<00:03:03.160> it's<00:03:03.670> not<00:03:03.760> a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
always down to just this it's not a

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.870 
always down to just this it's not a
cut-and-dried<00:03:04.570> formula<00:03:05.140> but<00:03:05.470> here<00:03:06.190> are<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
cut-and-dried formula but here are the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.560 
cut-and-dried formula but here are the
results<00:03:08.070> alright<00:03:09.070> guys<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.850> here's<00:03:10.300> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
results alright guys so here's the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.560 
results alright guys so here's the
results<00:03:11.080> as<00:03:11.200> well<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:12.390> explanation<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.450> a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
results as well as a explanation of a

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.090 
results as well as a explanation of a
couple<00:03:13.870> things<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.260> think<00:03:14.350> are<00:03:14.650> important

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
couple things that I think are important

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.120 
couple things that I think are important

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
so here with my GT to 10 i paid 30 bucks

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.590 
so here with my GT to 10 i paid 30 bucks
I<00:03:18.430> got<00:03:19.000> 2.7<00:03:19.900> FPS<00:03:20.350> 2.7<00:03:21.220> FPS<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:21.760> not<00:03:21.910> playable<00:03:22.300> I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
I got 2.7 FPS 2.7 FPS is not playable I

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.870 
I got 2.7 FPS 2.7 FPS is not playable I
didn't<00:03:22.840> even<00:03:22.900> get<00:03:23.140> past<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:24.100> truck<00:03:24.370> because<00:03:24.820> I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
didn't even get past the truck because I

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.310 
didn't even get past the truck because I
couldn't<00:03:25.209> even<00:03:25.300> control<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.900> was<00:03:26.050> doing<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
couldn't even control it I was doing the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.770 
couldn't even control it I was doing the
game<00:03:26.470> actually<00:03:26.680> slowed<00:03:27.610> down<00:03:28.090> things<00:03:28.600> weren't

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
game actually slowed down things weren't

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.870 
game actually slowed down things weren't
even<00:03:28.990> happening<00:03:29.410> in<00:03:29.530> real<00:03:29.680> time<00:03:29.740> anymore<00:03:30.280> so

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
even happening in real time anymore so

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.150 
even happening in real time anymore so
my<00:03:31.060> dollars<00:03:31.570> per<00:03:31.870> FPS<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.070> very

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
my dollars per FPS this is a very

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.370 
my dollars per FPS this is a very
expensive<00:03:33.880> card<00:03:34.450> if<00:03:34.630> I'm<00:03:34.750> going<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.020> game<00:03:35.200> on

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
expensive card if I'm going to game on

on a card like this but i needed to do
so<00:03:45.130> for<00:03:45.400> an<00:03:45.459> apples-to-apples<00:03:45.810> comparison

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810

out<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> almost<00:04:02.050> eight<00:04:02.320> bucks<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.640> I'm<00:04:03.760> paying

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
out to almost eight bucks so I'm paying

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.630 
out to almost eight bucks so I'm paying
about<00:04:04.150> eight<00:04:04.390> dollars<00:04:04.990> per<00:04:05.260> frame<00:04:05.890> per<00:04:06.160> second

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
about eight dollars per frame per second

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.070 
about eight dollars per frame per second
that<00:04:06.790> I'm<00:04:06.940> getting<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.330> this<00:04:07.480> game<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:07.900> that's

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
that I'm getting in this game so that's

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.380 
that I'm getting in this game so that's
my<00:04:08.320> that's<00:04:08.830> my<00:04:08.980> price<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.610> performance<00:04:09.760> ratio

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
my that's my price to performance ratio

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.580 
my that's my price to performance ratio
on<00:04:10.780> that<00:04:10.959> one<00:04:11.489> finally<00:04:12.489> here<00:04:13.390> we<00:04:13.840> have<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.140> gtx

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
on that one finally here we have the gtx

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.860 
on that one finally here we have the gtx
560ti<00:04:15.220> now<00:04:15.640> there's<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.880> very<00:04:16.239> specific<00:04:16.450> reason

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
560ti now there's a very specific reason

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.830 
560ti now there's a very specific reason
I<00:04:17.260> included<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:17.859> 560<00:04:18.459> TI<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:19.030> that's<00:04:19.480> because

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
I included the 560 TI and that's because

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.170 
I included the 560 TI and that's because
it<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.080> one<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.440> best<00:04:20.709> value<00:04:21.430> video<00:04:21.760> cards

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
it is one of the best value video cards

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.600 
it is one of the best value video cards
on<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.570> market<00:04:22.600> today<00:04:23.130> not<00:04:24.130> because<00:04:24.280> it's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
on the market today not because it's

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.280 
on the market today not because it's
cheap<00:04:24.910> it's<00:04:25.270> not<00:04:25.390> cheap<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:25.900> over<00:04:26.110> two

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
cheap it's not cheap it's over two

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.050 
cheap it's not cheap it's over two
hundred<00:04:26.470> dollars

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
hundred dollars

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.050 
hundred dollars
then<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.270> can<00:04:27.389> be<00:04:27.480> up<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.630> up<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.290> 250<00:04:29.190> up<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.490> 260

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
then it can be up to up to 250 up to 260

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.550 
then it can be up to up to 250 up to 260
for<00:04:30.210> some<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.540> overclocked<00:04:31.020> versions<00:04:31.410> but

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
for some of the overclocked versions but

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.879 
for some of the overclocked versions but
check<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:31.830> out<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.850> i<00:04:33.180> get<00:04:33.660> for<00:04:34.500> two<00:04:34.620> hundred

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
check this out so i get for two hundred

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.280 
check this out so i get for two hundred
and<00:04:34.919> ten<00:04:35.070> bucks<00:04:35.280> or<00:04:35.430> even<00:04:35.610> 250<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.300> get<00:04:36.840> almost

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
and ten bucks or even 250 I get almost

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.200 
and ten bucks or even 250 I get almost
50<00:04:37.770> frames<00:04:37.980> per<00:04:38.220> second<00:04:38.610> which<00:04:38.730> works<00:04:39.000> out<00:04:39.150> to

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
50 frames per second which works out to

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.659 
50 frames per second which works out to
somewhere<00:04:40.050> in<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.320> four<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.740> five<00:04:40.950> dollars

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
somewhere in the four to five dollars

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.409 
somewhere in the four to five dollars
per<00:04:42.060> FPS<00:04:42.810> as<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.860> price<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.400> performance<00:04:44.550> ratio

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
per FPS as a price to performance ratio

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.350 
per FPS as a price to performance ratio
so<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.139> is<00:04:46.440> clearly<00:04:46.950> since<00:04:47.730> lower<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.330> better

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
so that is clearly since lower is better

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.830 
so that is clearly since lower is better
the<00:04:49.169> best<00:04:49.410> value<00:04:50.100> card<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:50.730> my<00:04:51.090> comparison

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
the best value card in my comparison

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.159 
the best value card in my comparison
even<00:04:52.440> though<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.680> costs<00:04:53.250> six<00:04:54.000> times<00:04:54.360> what<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.810> GT

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
even though it costs six times what a GT

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.440 
even though it costs six times what a GT
210<00:04:55.680> does<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.340> o<00:04:56.430> performs<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.090> by<00:04:57.180> such<00:04:57.419> a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
210 does it o performs it by such a

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.070 
210 does it o performs it by such a
significant<00:04:58.410> ratio<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.639> doesn't<00:04:59.910> even

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
significant ratio that it doesn't even

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.870 
significant ratio that it doesn't even
matter<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.320> it<00:05:01.620> costs<00:05:02.040> more<00:05:02.280> because<00:05:02.490> you're

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
matter that it costs more because you're

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.340 
matter that it costs more because you're
just<00:05:03.060> getting<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:03.570> much<00:05:03.690> more<00:05:03.900> for<00:05:04.080> your<00:05:04.200> money

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
just getting so much more for your money

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.050 
just getting so much more for your money
so<00:05:05.010> down<00:05:05.130> here<00:05:05.190> I'm<00:05:05.550> going<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.760> show<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:05.970> a

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
so down here I'm going to show you a

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.760 
so down here I'm going to show you a
couple<00:05:06.240> things<00:05:06.570> this<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.810> performance<00:05:07.530> per

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
couple things this is performance per

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.830 
couple things this is performance per
dollar<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.639> right<00:05:09.060> around<00:05:09.300> here<00:05:09.600> at<00:05:09.720> the

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
dollar so right around here at the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.800 
dollar so right around here at the
bottom<00:05:10.020> we'd<00:05:10.410> have<00:05:10.590> our<00:05:10.620> 210<00:05:11.220> because<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.419> has

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
bottom we'd have our 210 because it has

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.469 
bottom we'd have our 210 because it has
horrible<00:05:13.440> performance<00:05:13.770> per<00:05:14.310> dollar<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:15.210> it's

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
horrible performance per dollar but it's

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.690 
horrible performance per dollar but it's
very<00:05:15.690> cheap<00:05:16.020> here<00:05:16.590> on<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.830> bottom<00:05:16.979> axis<00:05:17.280> I

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
very cheap here on the bottom axis I

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.230 
very cheap here on the bottom axis I
have<00:05:17.729> price<00:05:18.470> right<00:05:19.470> here<00:05:19.860> we<00:05:20.669> have<00:05:20.850> something

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
have price right here we have something

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.500 
have price right here we have something
like<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.630> 560<00:05:22.470> so<00:05:23.070> that<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.820> where<00:05:24.030> we<00:05:24.060> have<00:05:24.360> the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
like a 560 so that is where we have the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.670 
like a 560 so that is where we have the
best<00:05:24.720> performance<00:05:25.350> per<00:05:25.770> dollar<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:27.080> at<00:05:28.080> the

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
best performance per dollar and at the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.279 
best performance per dollar and at the
optimal<00:05:29.490> price<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.510> this<00:05:30.720> is<00:05:30.870> what's<00:05:31.080> known

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
optimal price so this is what's known

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.500 
optimal price so this is what's known
right<00:05:31.620> here<00:05:31.919> as<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.580> sweet<00:05:32.820> spot<00:05:33.090> there's

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
right here as the sweet spot there's

we<00:05:44.850> mentioned<00:05:45.180> before<00:05:45.210> now<00:05:46.110> here<00:05:47.030> we're<00:05:48.030> going

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
we mentioned before now here we're going

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.990 
we mentioned before now here we're going
to<00:05:48.210> have<00:05:48.390> something<00:05:48.810> like<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.289> GTX<00:05:49.770> 580<00:05:50.280> so<00:05:50.789> as

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
to have something like the GTX 580 so as

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.659 
to have something like the GTX 580 so as
you<00:05:51.330> get<00:05:51.510> past<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:52.080> sweet<00:05:52.320> spot<00:05:52.590> yes<00:05:53.039> you<00:05:53.520> do

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
you get past the sweet spot yes you do

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.060 
you get past the sweet spot yes you do
get<00:05:53.880> more<00:05:54.270> performance<00:05:54.560> but<00:05:55.560> your

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
get more performance but your

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.340 
get more performance but your
performance<00:05:56.520> per<00:05:56.940> dollar<00:05:57.210> starts<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:57.960> go<00:05:58.080> down

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
performance per dollar starts to go down

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.740 
performance per dollar starts to go down
so<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:58.889> is<00:05:59.220> why<00:05:59.370> something<00:05:59.820> like<00:05:59.940> a<00:05:59.970> 560<00:06:00.660> is

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
so that is why something like a 560 is

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.110 
so that is why something like a 560 is
more<00:06:00.900> popular<00:06:01.080> than<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.530> 580<00:06:02.010> although<00:06:02.550> there

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
more popular than a 580 although there

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.820 
more popular than a 580 although there
are<00:06:03.330> still<00:06:03.720> people<00:06:04.080> out<00:06:04.200> there<00:06:04.500> such<00:06:04.800> as
