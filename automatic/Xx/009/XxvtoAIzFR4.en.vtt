00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.970

 the mont ventoux the the ministry to in roermond has the top to toe that goal 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 wells 9 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.850
 justice has 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.590
 it is a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 you try then you choose your future 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.000
 a point this, however, does not mean that i see dutch television 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.850

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.880
 then cut 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.980
 that also means setting an example 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.800
 the utrecht website 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.070

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.090
 major problem constantly 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.410
 but my feet 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.410
 deny the debate 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 because it's a personality 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.220
 successfully how is that possible 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.740
 if it is not and it is not that that also happens that you will not be happy

 my feeling that I can't and can now 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.400
 How it should be 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.460
 anyway a competitor 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.020
 for orange 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.300

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.159
 3 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.140
 That is mandatory 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.930
 it is rather 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.640
 good governance 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.350
