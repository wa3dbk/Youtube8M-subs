amazing and these are only a dollar as
well<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.830> it's<00:01:04.830> kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.220> compared<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
well and it's kind of compared to the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.560 
well and it's kind of compared to the
steal<00:01:07.740> em<00:01:07.950> ones<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.180> look<00:01:09.390> pretty

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
steal em ones like they look pretty

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
steal em ones like they look pretty
similar<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.500> Stila<00:01:10.799> ones<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little

very<00:02:02.729> creamy<00:02:03.240> consistency<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
very creamy consistency and it's just I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.260 
very creamy consistency and it's just I
really<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> wintertime

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
really like this in the wintertime

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.980 
really like this in the wintertime
because<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> creamy<00:02:11.190> consistency<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
because of the creamy consistency in it

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.010 
because of the creamy consistency in it
tends<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.500> stay<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.160> more<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.540> winter<00:02:15.810> time

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
tends to stay on more in the winter time

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.440 
tends to stay on more in the winter time
than<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.440> summer<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.030> said<00:02:18.090> it's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
than the summer but like I said it's

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.120 
than the summer but like I said it's
just<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.780> creamy<00:02:19.080> kind<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.620> moose<00:02:19.830> like

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130

just a creamy kind of moose like
consistency<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:23.240> it's<00:02:24.240> not<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.720> wildly

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
consistency and it's not like wildly

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.880 
consistency and it's not like wildly
like<00:02:26.520> pigmented<00:02:27.420> or<00:02:27.570> whatever<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.590> can

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
like pigmented or whatever but you can

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.670 
like pigmented or whatever but you can
see<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.310> color<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.380> it
