and there is the main 75 millimeter

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.190 
and there is the main 75 millimeter
turret<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.470> mushroom<00:01:56.340> style<00:01:57.200> cupola

turret in the mushroom style cupola

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.389 
turret in the mushroom style cupola
hatch<00:01:59.000> then<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> back<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> second<00:02:01.200> turret

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
hatch then the back is a second turret

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.700 
hatch then the back is a second turret
which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.520> pretty<00:02:02.729> neat<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.170> little
