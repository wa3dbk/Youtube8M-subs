00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
it's obviously Optimus Prime but what's

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:42.860 
it's obviously Optimus Prime but what's
great<00:03:42.000> about<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.630> isn't<00:03:42.840> that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
great about it is that it isn't that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.720 
great about it is that it isn't that
similar<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.530> any<00:03:43.770> other<00:03:43.860> Optimus<00:03:44.340> I've<00:03:44.490> seen

it's an entirely new take on him and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.940 
it's an entirely new take on him and
tastefully<00:03:47.010> burly<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.490> is<00:03:47.640> too<00:03:48.560> now<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.620> red
