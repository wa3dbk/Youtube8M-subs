00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
now those of you that are curious about

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.010 
now those of you that are curious about
how<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.310> game<00:02:43.610> actually<00:02:43.849> plays<00:02:44.150> well<00:02:44.840> you

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
how the game actually plays well you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.260 
how the game actually plays well you
start<00:02:45.319> out<00:02:45.410> with<00:02:45.620> nothing<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:46.880> bit<00:02:47.150> of

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
start out with nothing so it is a bit of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.940 
start out with nothing so it is a bit of
a<00:02:47.330> grind<00:02:47.510> after<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.959> while<00:02:48.110> what<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.709> have

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
a grind after a while what I have

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.920 
a grind after a while what I have
noticed<00:02:49.190> from<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.730> alpha<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> current

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
noticed from the alpha to the current

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
noticed from the alpha to the current
beta<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:52.310> grinding<00:02:52.910> really<00:02:53.330> doesn't

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
beta is that grinding really doesn't

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.990 
beta is that grinding really doesn't
take<00:02:53.959> as<00:02:54.170> much<00:02:54.440> as<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:55.220> used<00:02:55.250> to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
take as much as it used to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.400 
take as much as it used to
I'll<00:02:56.300> give<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.540> an<00:02:56.630> example<00:02:56.720> when<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.260> was

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
I'll give you an example when I was

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.380 
I'll give you an example when I was
first<00:02:57.620> playing<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.160> game<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.700> would<00:02:59.180> be

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
first playing the game I would be

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.339 
first playing the game I would be
playing<00:02:59.959> for<00:03:00.500> several<00:03:00.950> days<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.550> hit<00:03:02.090> level<00:03:02.870> 13

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
playing for several days to hit level 13

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.610 
playing for several days to hit level 13
14<00:03:03.830> 15<00:03:04.040> etc<00:03:04.910> but<00:03:05.480> actually<00:03:06.230> playing<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.590> game

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
14 15 etc but actually playing the game

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.699 
14 15 etc but actually playing the game
today<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.430> getting<00:03:07.910> read<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.170> went

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
today and getting read it to it I went

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.090 
today and getting read it to it I went
from<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.400> level<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.450> level<00:03:11.480> 11<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:12.830> about

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
from a level one to level 11 in about

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.160 
from a level one to level 11 in about
two<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> half<00:03:13.700> hours<00:03:14.060> anyway<00:03:14.600> I've<00:03:14.810> noticed

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
two and a half hours anyway I've noticed

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.900 
two and a half hours anyway I've noticed
that<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.350> hit<00:03:15.500> detection<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:16.040> much<00:03:16.459> better

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that the hit detection is much better

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.420 
that the hit detection is much better
but<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.630> could<00:03:17.900> still<00:03:18.170> use<00:03:18.530> some<00:03:18.799> improvements

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
but it could still use some improvements

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.820 
but it could still use some improvements
because<00:03:20.269> when<00:03:20.900> you're<00:03:21.049> moving<00:03:21.530> into<00:03:21.680> the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
because when you're moving into the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.949 
because when you're moving into the
characters<00:03:22.250> are<00:03:22.489> doing<00:03:22.819> some<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.510> your<00:03:23.660> super

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
characters are doing some of your super

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.570 
characters are doing some of your super
moves<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:24.410> unlock<00:03:24.709> later<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
moves that you unlock later it's a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.520 
moves that you unlock later it's a
little<00:03:26.030> bit<00:03:26.150> difficult<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.750> actually<00:03:27.230> hit

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
little bit difficult to actually hit

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.990 
little bit difficult to actually hit
everybody<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.099> then<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.250> break<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.580> combo

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
everybody and then you break the combo

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000 
everybody and then you break the combo
and<00:03:29.360> it's<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.630> little<00:03:29.900> bit<00:03:29.989> annoying<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:30.620> it

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
and it's a little bit annoying but it

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.770 
and it's a little bit annoying but it
really<00:03:31.430> isn't<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.940> game's<00:03:32.180> fault<00:03:32.480> yet

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
really isn't the game's fault yet

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.509 
really isn't the game's fault yet
because<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.500> hasn't<00:03:33.560> really<00:03:33.950> officially

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
because it hasn't really officially

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.520 
because it hasn't really officially
released<00:03:34.880> yet<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.299> keep<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:35.959> mind<00:03:35.989> when<00:03:36.410> you're

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
released yet so keep in mind when you're

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.140 
released yet so keep in mind when you're

about<00:04:07.519> paying<00:04:07.940> for<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:08.750> want

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
about paying for is if you want

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.349 
about paying for is if you want
additional<00:04:09.200> crystals<00:04:09.889> or<00:04:10.370> if<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:10.880> want<00:04:11.090> more

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
additional crystals or if you want more

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.940 
additional crystals or if you want more
gold<00:04:11.660> but<00:04:11.959> you're<00:04:12.109> better<00:04:12.260> off<00:04:12.440> just<00:04:12.620> playing

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
gold but you're better off just playing

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.680 
gold but you're better off just playing
the<00:04:13.069> game<00:04:13.250> for<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.489> long<00:04:13.639> time<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.239> get<00:04:14.389> more

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690

gold
unfortunately<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.070> crystals<00:04:16.579> even<00:04:17.120> though

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
unfortunately the crystals even though

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.819 
unfortunately the crystals even though
you<00:04:17.269> start<00:04:17.630> with<00:04:17.780> twenty<00:04:18.109> once<00:04:18.350> they're<00:04:18.650> up

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
you start with twenty once they're up

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.490 
you start with twenty once they're up
well<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.310> have<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:19.820> pay<00:04:19.970> for<00:04:20.030> them<00:04:20.419> because<00:04:21.260> as
