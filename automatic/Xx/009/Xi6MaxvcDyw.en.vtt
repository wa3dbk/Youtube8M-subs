00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
iron through works for me now the reason

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.539 
iron through works for me now the reason
I<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.180> perfect<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.720> my

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
I like this is that it's perfect for my

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.460 
I like this is that it's perfect for my
lazy<00:01:41.549> days<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> sleep

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.440 
through all of my hair like I said I
don't<00:01:57.659> use<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.200> soaking<00:01:58.560> wet<00:01:58.649> hair<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.450> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
don't use it on soaking wet hair so I it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
don't use it on soaking wet hair so I it
would<00:02:00.719> probably<00:02:01.020> take<00:02:01.200> me<00:02:01.380> much<00:02:01.530> longer<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.950> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
would probably take me much longer if I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.719 
would probably take me much longer if I
did<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.799> about<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.549> i

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
did but what I like about this is that i

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.150 
did but what I like about this is that i
never<00:02:06.060> feel<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:07.020> hair<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.380> being<00:02:07.590> damaged

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
never feel like my hair is being damaged

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.949 
never feel like my hair is being damaged
after<00:02:08.459> i<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.239> or<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.750> looks

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
after i use this or that it looks

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.470 
after i use this or that it looks
damaged<00:02:10.440> after<00:02:10.679> i've<00:02:10.950> used<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.300> see

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
damaged after i've used this you do see

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.100 
damaged after i've used this you do see
the<00:02:12.599> steam

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the steam

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.170 
the steam
coming<00:02:13.440> out<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.070> are<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.400> actually<00:02:14.910> burning

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
coming out you are not actually burning

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270 
coming out you are not actually burning
your<00:02:15.390> hair<00:02:15.600> just<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.080> moisture<00:02:16.620> leaving<00:02:16.860> your

your hair just a moisture leaving your

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.420 
your hair just a moisture leaving your
hair<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.500> really<00:02:19.560> simple<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
hair and it's just really simple and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.190 
hair and it's just really simple and
easy<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.820> use<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.180> instead<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.480> using<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.020> blow

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
easy to use so instead of using a blow

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.110 
easy to use so instead of using a blow
dryer<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.710> then<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> flat<00:02:23.220> iron<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.940> just

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
dryer and then the flat iron I can just

00:02:24.120 --> 00:03:11.270 
dryer and then the flat iron I can just
use<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.140> good<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.350> go<00:03:09.500> um<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.100> only

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
use this and be good to go um the only

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.570 
use this and be good to go um the only
bad<00:03:11.850> side<00:03:12.270> about<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.340> can't

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
bad side about this is that you can't

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.460 
bad side about this is that you can't
actually<00:03:14.790> get<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.450> roots<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.110> your<00:03:16.290> route

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
actually get to your roots so your route

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.539 
actually get to your roots so your route
might<00:03:16.980> still<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.640> damp<00:03:18.590> um<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:20.130> that's<00:03:20.430> not

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
might still be damp um but that's not

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.490 
might still be damp um but that's not
really<00:03:20.850> an<00:03:21.060> issue<00:03:21.150> for<00:03:21.330> me<00:03:21.600> my<00:03:21.780> roots<00:03:22.019> usually

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
really an issue for me my roots usually

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.470 
really an issue for me my roots usually
drive<00:03:22.709> pretty<00:03:23.010> fast<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.850> because<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.000> has

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
drive pretty fast and and because it has

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.870 
drive pretty fast and and because it has
larger<00:03:28.110> plates<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.650> find<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.610> do

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
larger plates I find that I can do

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.620 
larger plates I find that I can do
larger<00:03:30.750> sections<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.290> hair<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.709> lot<00:03:31.980> faster<00:03:32.630> so

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
larger sections of hair a lot faster so

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.330 
larger sections of hair a lot faster so
yeah<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.290> wanted<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.739> share<00:03:34.890> this<00:03:35.070> little

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
yeah I just wanted to share this little

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.009 
yeah I just wanted to share this little
goodie<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.730> like<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.150> bought<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.420> at<00:03:36.540> Kmart

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
goodie that I like I bought it at Kmart

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.020 
goodie that I like I bought it at Kmart
I<00:03:37.230> think<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.130> was<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.370> twenty<00:03:38.910> to

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
I think it was like twenty to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.520 
I think it was like twenty to
twenty-five<00:03:39.480> dollars<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:40.019> wasn't<00:03:40.350> anything

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
twenty-five dollars it wasn't anything

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.009 
twenty-five dollars it wasn't anything
ridiculous<00:03:40.920> but<00:03:41.489> for<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.330> amount<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.780> I've

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
ridiculous but for the amount that I've

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.720 
ridiculous but for the amount that I've
actually<00:03:43.230> been<00:03:43.500> using<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.070> I'm<00:03:44.220> really

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730
