took a very long time to load and

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.940 
took a very long time to load and
Netflix<00:03:52.569> is<00:03:52.720> definitely<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.380> worst<00:03:53.650> case

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
scenario but there are a few channels

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.809 
scenario but there are a few channels
that<00:03:56.290> do<00:03:56.560> tend<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.069> take<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:57.459> bit<00:03:57.580> longer

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
that do tend to take a little bit longer

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.559 
that do tend to take a little bit longer
to<00:03:58.090> load<00:03:58.239> than<00:03:58.840> others<00:03:59.680> but<00:04:00.489> other<00:04:00.760> than<00:04:01.090> this

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569

works flawlessly during playback which

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.600 
works flawlessly during playback which
is<00:04:07.780> when<00:04:08.019> performance<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.800> most<00:04:09.069> important

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610
