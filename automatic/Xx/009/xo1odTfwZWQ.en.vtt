00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.639 
the packaging is easy to open one thing
about<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.360> packaging<00:05:09.809> because<00:05:09.899> it<00:05:10.229> is<00:05:10.319> a<00:05:10.349> dome

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:10.649

and I don't use the brushes that any
shadows<00:05:34.409> come<00:05:34.620> with<00:05:34.770> anyway<00:05:35.159> but<00:05:35.610> i<00:05:35.789> don't

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
shadows come with anyway but i don't

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.449 
shadows come with anyway but i don't
think<00:05:36.629> that<00:05:36.719> the<00:05:36.959> brush<00:05:37.349> is<00:05:37.560> ergonomically

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:38.459 
think that the brush is ergonomically

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.329 
think that the brush is ergonomically
designed<00:05:38.719> it's<00:05:39.719> a<00:05:39.870> curves<00:05:40.259> that<00:05:40.589> can<00:05:40.860> fit<00:05:41.189> in

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:41.339 
designed it's a curves that can fit in

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.730 
designed it's a curves that can fit in
and<00:05:41.580> mix<00:05:42.120> economically<00:05:42.810> with<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.139> packaging

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
and mix economically with the packaging

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.829 
and mix economically with the packaging
but<00:05:44.069> to<00:05:44.219> hold<00:05:44.490> this<00:05:44.759> brush<00:05:45.089> is<00:05:45.270> very

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
but to hold this brush is very

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.749 
but to hold this brush is very
uncomfortable<00:05:46.620> of<00:05:46.889> course<00:05:47.219> I<00:05:47.370> tried<00:05:47.610> all

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
uncomfortable of course I tried all

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.949 
uncomfortable of course I tried all
different<00:05:47.879> ways<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.360> did<00:05:48.599> want<00:05:48.779> to<00:05:48.870> give

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:48.959 
different ways and I did want to give

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:51.050 
different ways and I did want to give
the<00:05:49.050> brush<00:05:49.259> a<00:05:49.409> fair<00:05:49.740> shot<00:05:50.039> but<00:05:50.729> to<00:05:50.879> actually

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the brush a fair shot but to actually

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.629 
the brush a fair shot but to actually
put<00:05:51.599> the<00:05:51.719> brush<00:05:51.899> in<00:05:52.139> here<00:05:52.409> and<00:05:52.589> then<00:05:53.129> go<00:05:53.159> to<00:05:53.339> use

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
put the brush in here and then go to use

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.029

awkward I mean to even get it a certain
way<00:06:04.889> that<00:06:05.879> you<00:06:06.059> want<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.629> go<00:06:06.779> perfectly

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:09.959 
it's very awkward I did not notice any

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.719 
it's very awkward I did not notice any
creasing<00:06:10.499> when<00:06:10.620> I<00:06:10.649> wore<00:06:10.889> them<00:06:10.979> over<00:06:11.279> top<00:06:11.490> of<00:06:11.520> a

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
I'm trying something out I think that

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.949 
I'm trying something out I think that
this<00:06:17.399> is<00:06:17.459> the<00:06:17.669> best<00:06:17.879> primer<00:06:18.209> out<00:06:18.479> there<00:06:18.719> right

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:18.959 
this is the best primer out there right

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:21.260 
this is the best primer out there right
now<00:06:18.990> that<00:06:19.110> I've<00:06:19.469> ever<00:06:19.680> used<00:06:19.979> so<00:06:20.580> I<00:06:20.610> just<00:06:21.059> feel

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
now that I've ever used so I just feel

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.199 
now that I've ever used so I just feel
much<00:06:21.449> safer<00:06:21.779> trying<00:06:22.319> it<00:06:22.559> with<00:06:22.830> that<00:06:23.099> I<00:06:23.339> did<00:06:23.999> try

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:24.209 
much safer trying it with that I did try

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:26.179 
much safer trying it with that I did try
them<00:06:24.360> alone<00:06:24.629> and<00:06:24.899> you<00:06:25.199> know<00:06:25.319> I<00:06:25.349> can't<00:06:25.860> say

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
them alone and you know I can't say

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.699 
them alone and you know I can't say
fairly<00:06:26.699> if<00:06:27.029> they<00:06:27.689> crease<00:06:27.990> or<00:06:28.199> don't<00:06:28.439> crease

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:28.709 
fairly if they crease or don't crease

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.350 
fairly if they crease or don't crease
without<00:06:29.039> primer<00:06:29.279> because<00:06:29.490> my<00:06:29.729> eyelids<00:06:30.209> are

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
without primer because my eyelids are

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.230 
without primer because my eyelids are
excessively<00:06:31.110> oily<00:06:31.409> so<00:06:32.129> whether<00:06:32.639> or<00:06:32.879> not<00:06:32.969> it<00:06:33.209> is

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
that you can wear a neutral eye and then

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.420 
that you can wear a neutral eye and then
you<00:06:52.540> can<00:06:52.720> wear<00:06:52.900> a<00:06:52.930> bright<00:06:53.410> pop<00:06:53.740> of<00:06:53.770> color<00:06:54.160> as<00:06:54.310> an

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.550 
you can wear a bright pop of color as an
eyeliner<00:06:54.760> and<00:06:55.120> that's<00:06:55.480> exactly<00:06:55.690> what<00:06:56.230> Milani

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
eyeliner and that's exactly what Milani

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.870 
eyeliner and that's exactly what Milani
was<00:06:56.770> going<00:06:57.100> for<00:06:57.370> when<00:06:57.520> they<00:06:57.640> thought<00:06:57.820> about

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
was going for when they thought about

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.910 
was going for when they thought about
their<00:06:58.120> spring<00:06:58.540> collection<00:06:58.990> it<00:06:59.170> was<00:06:59.590> bright

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
their spring collection it was bright

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.210 
their spring collection it was bright
pops<00:07:00.250> of<00:07:00.460> color<00:07:00.820> among<00:07:01.660> softer<00:07:02.350> colors<00:07:02.710> and<00:07:03.010> I

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
pops of color among softer colors and I

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.660 
pops of color among softer colors and I
think<00:07:03.490> these<00:07:03.850> colors<00:07:04.360> can<00:07:04.660> really<00:07:05.110> be<00:07:05.260> so

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
think these colors can really be so

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.450 
think these colors can really be so
multifaceted<00:07:07.080> multi-use<00:07:08.080> they're<00:07:08.590> beautiful

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
multifaceted multi-use they're beautiful

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
any way you look at them and because

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.900 
any way you look at them and because
they<00:07:11.230> do<00:07:11.290> have<00:07:11.440> lots<00:07:11.770> of<00:07:11.950> sparkle<00:07:12.430> in<00:07:12.520> them<00:07:12.700> the
