 although with two bogeys 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.440
 it sounds to me out there and that is that they say that Don Kelly's name agrees because 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.030
 when they were going to make the arcades they said the name for 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.810
 phone but instead of listening to the bush and comment they gave donkey kong 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.340

 tomb raider is one of them 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.689
 the reason is very simple 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.199
 the creator trying to make the character a little more realistic played with the 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.559

 everyone who has played mario bros knows which mushroom I mean 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.550
 and if it's not because you never played mario bros or because you're blind and you could not

 see what pushed it will tell life 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:07.439
 good the case is that the red mushroom that we all remember for being the 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.889
 food that digested the most famous character of nintendo is actually a 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.069
 hallucinogenic mushroom that provides hallucinations to those who taste it 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.439
