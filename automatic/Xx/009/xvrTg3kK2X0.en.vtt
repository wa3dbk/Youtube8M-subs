 Good evening is a little bit surprised so I'm taking the right video this 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.169
 It is my page of youtube, but 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.919
 html file has become like this because of the plug-in 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:17.650
 is 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.650
 Please try to look at the future when you right-click 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:27.960
 I think the above one is good but it was also 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:31.980
 There is the Tteyuu output cut through the bottom airplay 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.160
 Actually, koreos is connected to TV apple tv 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 I can send youtube videos and watch them on TV 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.850
 And there is also a way to save this video. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.020
 Such use if it is downloaded 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 And say what you've put in but I was not an extension of at 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.770
 it's here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 Does it put together with say a click and a flash thing called Big body plug-in 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.320
 Though 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.440
 8 I think that I want to lighten the safari even a little 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:10.130
 I added a function to prevent loading plugins 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.130
 In the setting of each of these two functions 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.140
 player 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.869
 It's there is a place which is including the airplay by say s source selector 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 There is a place called output via airplay in kiss now- here 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.570
 Where clicked 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570
 Earlier 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.090
 This display comes out 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 It is possible to output via air play 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.300
 It is said that the download is protected by copyright 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 And that you can not download the video of the victory and such 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.480
 As it is targeted for punishment, one that can make a self-judgment well about there is used 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.820
 Please give me 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:58.460
 I did not think yesterday when I tried to put the extension in safari 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.060
 It was during that came with an addition to 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.899
 If there is this 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.990
 Chrome cast has not been released in Japan yet 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.640
 You can also be a little mother with that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:16.050
 When you usually look at youtube, you can directly display on you tb 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.050
 This is especially possible because you can fly with airplay from iphone or ipad 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:26.710
 In in what is his own but I'm such a place called convenient if, for example, 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:31.150
 Abandoned search with Internet Lati Find videos about it when throwing it down 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:37.030
 Kedomo I want to see the tee rather than Well look carefully Utte 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.040
 a 4 love no'm very convenient to cut Patty use the platform of that way with continued 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.219
 I thought it was not a markless 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.599
 Who is using safari What kind of person is safari on windows 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.739

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.280
