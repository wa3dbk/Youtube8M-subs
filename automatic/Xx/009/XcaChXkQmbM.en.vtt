00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.150 

nuclear<00:00:06.250> medicine<00:00:06.580> is<00:00:07.270> the<00:00:07.870> study<00:00:08.320> of<00:00:08.590> the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
nuclear medicine is the study of the

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.119 
nuclear medicine is the study of the
function<00:00:09.699> organs<00:00:10.240> what<00:00:10.900> we<00:00:11.080> do<00:00:11.289> is<00:00:11.440> we<00:00:11.590> inject

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
function organs what we do is we inject

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.490 
function organs what we do is we inject
a<00:00:12.250> radioactive<00:00:12.600> medicine<00:00:13.600> into<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.199> blood

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
a radioactive medicine into the blood

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.040 
a radioactive medicine into the blood
and<00:00:14.740> then<00:00:15.490> we're<00:00:15.670> able<00:00:15.820> to<00:00:16.090> image<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.660> organs

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
and then we're able to image the organs

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.480 
and then we're able to image the organs
and<00:00:17.170> how<00:00:17.470> they<00:00:17.650> work<00:00:17.860> and<00:00:17.980> how<00:00:18.100> they<00:00:18.280> function

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
and how they work and how they function

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.760 
and how they work and how they function
I<00:00:18.880> love<00:00:19.450> the<00:00:19.720> fact<00:00:19.960> that<00:00:20.080> I<00:00:20.200> work<00:00:20.410> with<00:00:20.440> people

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
I love the fact that I work with people

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.400 
I love the fact that I work with people
the<00:00:21.640> patient's<00:00:22.300> we<00:00:22.480> actually<00:00:22.840> get<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.140> spend

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
the patient's we actually get to spend

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.500 
the patient's we actually get to spend
time<00:00:23.710> with<00:00:23.770> whereas<00:00:24.760> when<00:00:25.030> you're<00:00:25.180> working

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
time with whereas when you're working

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.330 
time with whereas when you're working
with<00:00:25.539> x-ray<00:00:26.110> you<00:00:26.170> take<00:00:26.560> them<00:00:26.710> in<00:00:26.860> for<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.100> very

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
with x-ray you take them in for a very

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.540 
with x-ray you take them in for a very
quick<00:00:27.670> x-ray<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:29.140> hold<00:00:29.680> your<00:00:29.800> breath<00:00:29.949> okay

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
quick x-ray and hold your breath okay

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.120 
quick x-ray and hold your breath okay
breathe<00:00:30.820> you're<00:00:31.360> gone<00:00:31.570> this<00:00:32.500> way<00:00:32.829> our

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
procedures take time you get to talk to

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.840 
procedures take time you get to talk to
the<00:00:35.350> patients<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:35.920> get<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.220> teach<00:00:36.460> them<00:00:36.820> what

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
the patients you get to teach them what

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.000 
the patients you get to teach them what
you're<00:00:37.120> doing<00:00:37.150> you<00:00:37.750> can<00:00:37.810> tell<00:00:38.470> them<00:00:38.739> about

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
you're doing you can tell them about

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.470 
you're doing you can tell them about
their<00:00:39.579> procedure

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
their procedure

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.080 
their procedure
I<00:00:40.510> chose<00:00:41.500> nuclear<00:00:42.010> medicine<00:00:42.310> because<00:00:43.060> I

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
I chose nuclear medicine because I

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.000 
I chose nuclear medicine because I
really<00:00:43.600> enjoy<00:00:44.070> physics<00:00:46.050> imaging<00:00:47.050> diagnostics

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
really enjoy physics imaging diagnostics

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.610 
really enjoy physics imaging diagnostics
which<00:00:48.130> is<00:00:48.340> taking<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.700> pictures<00:00:49.120> as<00:00:50.110> well<00:00:50.470> as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
which is taking the pictures as well as

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.750 
which is taking the pictures as well as
working<00:00:50.800> with<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.070> patients<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.550> this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
working with the patients and this

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.610 
working with the patients and this
really<00:00:52.059> incorporates<00:00:52.750> all<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.230> those<00:00:53.380> things

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
really incorporates all of those things

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.310 
really incorporates all of those things
together<00:00:53.860> on<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.730> day<00:00:55.000> of<00:00:55.300> my<00:00:55.719> studies<00:00:56.140> I

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
together on the day of my studies I

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.250 
together on the day of my studies I
usually<00:00:56.649> do<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:57.000> quality<00:00:58.000> control<00:00:58.420> which<00:00:59.110> is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
usually do a quality control which is

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.110 
usually do a quality control which is
basically<00:00:59.680> going<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.370> our<00:01:00.460> machines<00:01:00.820> making

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
basically going to our machines making

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.580 
basically going to our machines making
sure<00:01:01.450> all<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.840> machines<00:01:02.140> are<00:01:02.320> working

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
sure all the machines are working

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.520 
sure all the machines are working
properly<00:01:03.010> then<00:01:03.730> I<00:01:03.969> go<00:01:04.180> with<00:01:04.360> my<00:01:04.600> usual<00:01:05.079> job

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
properly then I go with my usual job

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.059 
properly then I go with my usual job
interview<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.280> patients<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:08.439> their<00:01:08.619> history

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:09.069 
interview the patients get their history

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.410 
interview the patients get their history
and<00:01:10.649> perform<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:11.799> exams<00:01:12.159> at<00:01:12.819> the<00:01:13.030> end<00:01:13.179> of<00:01:13.299> the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
and perform the exams at the end of the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.209 
and perform the exams at the end of the
day<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.780> collect<00:01:14.200> all<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.499> information<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:15.159> do

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
day I collect all that information I do

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.660 
day I collect all that information I do
enter<00:01:16.209> it<00:01:16.329> in<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.509> computer<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.920> my<00:01:18.130> wipe<00:01:18.369> down

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
enter it in a computer do my wipe down

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.399 
enter it in a computer do my wipe down
make<00:01:18.909> sure<00:01:18.939> everything's<00:01:19.509> still<00:01:19.840> proper<00:01:20.170> no

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
make sure everything's still proper no

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.309 
make sure everything's still proper no
contamination<00:01:21.009> I<00:01:21.459> think<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.240> most<00:01:22.869> important

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
contamination I think the most important

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.779 
contamination I think the most important
thing<00:01:23.439> is<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.649> really<00:01:23.920> need<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.429> be<00:01:24.549> flexible

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
thing is you really need to be flexible

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.059 
thing is you really need to be flexible
and<00:01:25.329> quick<00:01:25.569> on<00:01:25.689> your<00:01:25.840> feet<00:01:25.899> there<00:01:26.709> are<00:01:26.740> many

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
and quick on your feet there are many

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.279 
and quick on your feet there are many
ways<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.639> do<00:01:27.759> different<00:01:27.789> scans<00:01:28.420> but<00:01:28.959> you<00:01:29.109> need

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
ways to do different scans but you need

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.339 
ways to do different scans but you need
to<00:01:29.469> be<00:01:29.590> able<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.920> work<00:01:30.279> and<00:01:31.139> assess<00:01:32.139> the

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:32.349 
to be able to work and assess the

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.289 
to be able to work and assess the
situation<00:01:32.969> communication<00:01:33.969> is<00:01:34.090> very

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
situation communication is very

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.690

is Adam we get to play with a lot of
technologies<00:02:01.389> right<00:02:02.289> now<00:02:02.499> we're<00:02:02.739> in<00:02:02.889> the

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
technologies right now we're in the

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.219 
technologies right now we're in the
forefront<00:02:03.429> of<00:02:03.789> fusion<00:02:04.479> imaging<00:02:04.929> which<00:02:05.079> is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
forefront of fusion imaging which is

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.620 
forefront of fusion imaging which is
combining

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
combining

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.730 
combining
Ct<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:08.280> nuclear<00:02:08.880> medicine<00:02:09.090> MRI<00:02:10.080> with

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
Ct with nuclear medicine MRI with

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.500 
Ct with nuclear medicine MRI with
nuclear<00:02:11.190> medicine<00:02:11.430> well<00:02:12.150> I've<00:02:12.300> always

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
nuclear medicine well I've always

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.720 
nuclear medicine well I've always
enjoyed<00:02:12.810> what<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> do<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.280> think<00:02:14.580> it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
enjoyed what I do and I think it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.090 
enjoyed what I do and I think it
probably<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.300> more<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
probably is more because of the the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.620 
probably is more because of the the
closeness<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.270> with<00:02:18.480> your

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
closeness that you can have with your

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.170 
closeness that you can have with your
patients<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.130> real<00:02:20.489> rapport<00:02:20.970> with

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
patients you have a real rapport with

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240 
patients you have a real rapport with
the<00:02:21.330> doctors<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.080> work<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.410> also<00:02:22.709> and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
the doctors that you work with also and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.600 
the doctors that you work with also and
again<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.630> work<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:25.459> cardiologists<00:02:26.459> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
again you work with cardiologists and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.030 
again you work with cardiologists and
oncologists<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.800> radiologists<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.950> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
oncologists and radiologists that you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.870 
oncologists and radiologists that you
work<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.459> real<00:02:29.760> gambit<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.330> people<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
work with a real gambit of people and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.570 
work with a real gambit of people and
you<00:02:32.880> deal<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.260> much<00:02:34.440> good<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you deal you do so much good for the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.330 
you deal you do so much good for the
patients<00:02:36.209> we<00:02:36.630> did<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> WBC<00:02:37.680> scan<00:02:38.010> that's<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
patients we did a WBC scan that's a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.330 
patients we did a WBC scan that's a
white<00:02:38.550> blood<00:02:38.790> cell<00:02:39.150> scan<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:40.410> tagged<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
white blood cell scan we tagged the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.059 
white blood cell scan we tagged the
blood<00:02:41.640> cells<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.660> patient<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.769> re

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
blood cells of the patient and we re

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.370 
blood cells of the patient and we re
inject<00:02:44.580> him<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:44.910> we're<00:02:45.060> able<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.360> see<00:02:45.510> where

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
inject him so we're able to see where

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.559 
inject him so we're able to see where
that<00:02:46.590> tracer<00:02:47.040> goes<00:02:47.280> they<00:02:47.730> did<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.209> know<00:02:48.420> what

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
that tracer goes they did not know what

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.600 
that tracer goes they did not know what
was<00:02:48.690> wrong<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.140> patient<00:02:49.350> his<00:02:50.190> patient

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
was wrong with this patient his patient

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.880 
was wrong with this patient his patient
had<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> fever<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.350> couldn't<00:02:52.350> figure<00:02:52.500> out<00:02:52.620> what

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
had a fever and couldn't figure out what

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
had a fever and couldn't figure out what
was<00:02:52.920> wrong<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.910> was<00:02:54.120> able<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.480> identify

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
was wrong and this was able to identify

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.380 
was wrong and this was able to identify
infection<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.430> they<00:02:56.550> were<00:02:56.610> unable<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.030> see

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
infection that they were unable to see

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.240 
infection that they were unable to see
with<00:02:57.540> other<00:02:57.660> Diagnostics<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.620> mean<00:02:58.799> really<00:02:58.950> it

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
with other Diagnostics I mean really it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.650 
with other Diagnostics I mean really it
could<00:02:59.519> have<00:02:59.610> saved<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.910> patient's<00:03:00.299> life<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
could have saved the patient's life and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.300 
could have saved the patient's life and
that<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:00.989> made<00:03:01.350> me<00:03:01.500> feel<00:03:01.650> good<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:01.920> we

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
that really made me feel good and we

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.039 
that really made me feel good and we
really<00:03:02.640> took<00:03:02.790> part<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.239> helped<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.900> know

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
really took part and helped you know

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.800 
really took part and helped you know
save<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.769> patient<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.370> think<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.600> we

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
save that patient I think because we

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.559 
save that patient I think because we
deal<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.769> many<00:03:08.040> oncology<00:03:08.910> patients

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
deal with so many oncology patients

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.800 
deal with so many oncology patients
cancer<00:03:10.500> patients<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.220> can<00:03:11.489> see<00:03:11.820> them<00:03:12.090> through

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
cancer patients you can see them through

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.710 
cancer patients you can see them through
different<00:03:13.260> stages<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:14.130> their<00:03:14.720> initial

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
different stages of their initial

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.170 
different stages of their initial
diagnosis<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.829> see<00:03:17.130> them<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:17.640> they're<00:03:17.910> going

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
diagnosis you see them as they're going

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.180 
diagnosis you see them as they're going
through<00:03:18.269> their<00:03:18.570> treatments<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.100> able

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
through their treatments and to be able

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.430 
through their treatments and to be able
to<00:03:20.370> see<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.730> person<00:03:21.239> who<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.570> knew<00:03:21.750> was<00:03:21.989> very

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
to see a person who you knew was very

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.069 
to see a person who you knew was very
ill<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.609> see<00:03:23.790> them<00:03:24.000> walking<00:03:24.450> around<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
ill and to see them walking around and

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.840 
ill and to see them walking around and
living<00:03:25.410> their<00:03:25.530> life<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.040> living<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.549> good<00:03:26.790> life

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
living their life and living a good life

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.020 
living their life and living a good life
after<00:03:27.450> their<00:03:28.230> treatment<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.760> feel<00:03:30.000> a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
after their treatment you really feel a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.819 
after their treatment you really feel a
part<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.810> well<00:03:31.079> for<00:03:31.320> people<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.680> are

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
part of that well for people that are

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.030 
part of that well for people that are
interested<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.910> technology<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.049> science<00:03:34.109> I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
interested in technology and science I

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.560 
interested in technology and science I
think<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.489> would<00:03:35.609> be<00:03:35.700> really<00:03:36.209> very

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
think it would be really very

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.960 
think it would be really very
interesting<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.410> them<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.950> pays<00:03:38.220> well<00:03:38.250> too<00:03:38.730> so

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
interesting for them it pays well too so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.080 
interesting for them it pays well too so
you<00:03:39.480> have<00:03:39.660> all<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.350> benefits<00:03:40.890> really<00:03:41.579> it's<00:03:42.000> a

you have all the benefits really it's a
great<00:03:42.269> field<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.600> be<00:03:42.720> in
