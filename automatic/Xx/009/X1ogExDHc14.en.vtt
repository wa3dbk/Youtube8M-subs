00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.729
 nokia has a new one in abu dhabi 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.769
 smartphone presented the 15 20 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.570
 pretty big device with 6 inch display 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.080
 This is best seen if it times 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.560
 compares to the previous one 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.730
 top riders at nokia the nokia lumia 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.410
 925 design is quite similar to dual led 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.210
 a preview camera with lens of 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.740
 Carl Zeiss 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.860
 So a bit of nokia imprinted here 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.300
 speakers up here microphones and 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.110
 top in the middle then the connection for 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 the headphones 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.430
 so here is the usb port round one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 little bit different the whole thing is in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.579
 Polycarbonate housing just like us 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.200
 already know about the lumia 920, however 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.489
 it is nokia managed this time the device 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.840
 a lot thinner if you have the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.430
 then put both times on each other can 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.790
 you see 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:58.590
 despite the size, the lumia is 15 20 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.280
 significantly thinner than the lumia 920 both 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.500
 to have 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.960
 built in wyler starting that's me 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.509
 This device may be different than the 925 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.909
 lay directly on his pillow and then 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.469
 what to charge wirelessly on this pillow 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.479
 You buy again strong had 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.859
 pretty big device that means you too 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.569
 It can not be that easy in my bag 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.639
 So put my jeans down 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.549
 in jeans pockets hides 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:24.869
 iphone 5 s you think that's wrong 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.740
 there you can see what that is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.090
 Size difference is around 15:20 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.619
 Do not just put a bag like that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.359
 that always looks up a bit 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.609
 and that will be for many people 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.579
 you can be decisive question 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.439
 live with it or not 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.829
 interesting is that this lumia than 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.569
 first of the top devices the possibility 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.599
 has a sd card to insert i have 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:52.200
 here at the side two openings once 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:54.990
 for the sd card and a second for the sd 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.579
 sim card that means here can be the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.159
 memory even with a windows phone 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.440
 Upgrade and I do not have to for devices 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.240
 with different 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.150
 Conclusion can choose more in advance but can 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.740
 make that later at runtime 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.360
 special advantage is the display what 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.610
 you can recognize it as soon as it is switched on 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.770
 we have the brightness here completely 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.520
 down regulated so that he the display 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.400
 the camera does not outshine that's it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.900
 so far actually in the outside 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.550
 best readable display in the sunshine 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.410
 what we saw has a hd 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.000
 Resolution 1920 lines in this direction 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.900
 here 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.700
 and that uses nokia around here another 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 column on windows phone display 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.540
 usually such a broad one is own 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.360
 runs all over the whole 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.670
 width one now than here we have 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.290
 another column of medium sized 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.540
 Tile now used by each 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.490
 Small body size was that you get up here 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.290
 the startup screen a lot of 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.050
 can accommodate these live tiles 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.290
 the whole thing is under the newest 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.520
 version of windows phone 8 that too 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.680
 the new processor generation 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.440
 supports this is a device that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.560
 with the snapdragon 800 running and one 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.560
 quadcore graphics processor 2 gb ram and 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.780
 This software is also delivered 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.110
 become windows for other windows 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.640
 phone preview devices so we too 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.440
 the new camera functions get like 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.150
 focus is already published 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.790
 focus is now running on the old version 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.709
 already that is a software in which one 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.800
 a photo can shoot and can later 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.269
 then specify which areas are sharp 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.650
 so it should be like this one 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.959
 background sharp and the foreground 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.220
 And here too, the foreground is shaaf 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.360
 in the background and sharp I can too 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.860
 So choose a color 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.840
 should be highlighted 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.989
 in which case now the money all 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.640
 others will be black and white or I can 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.090
 here somewhere in the middle of the focus 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.010
 put 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.739
 the device just makes a whole series 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.340
 This can be quite good here 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.560
 see 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.300
 here is the main reason in this 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.650
 corner and the background is out of focus 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.820
 I make the background out of focus then 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.190
 You can be such a small person here 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.490
 see who moves that is called 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.720
 between these two pictures 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.920
 it always seems to be back and forth 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.210
 run that is because the pictures 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.140
 simply at different times 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.360
 are included 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.270
 then press this button here you 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.770
 combines the phone background and 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.010
 foreground to a completely sharp 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:23.020
 picture is new here from the beginning to the end 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.260
 the story dish storyteller is one 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.850
 software to the photos also the place 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.360
 each time still added to the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.340
 has been 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.020
 that means I can also have a picture here 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.190
 we can go on this picture 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.380
 show 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.090
 and when i zoom out of the picture 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.620
 then he shows me here for example 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.750
 that picture taken or on 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.400
 frankfurt airport and me there 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.950
 Again, then I recognize here too 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.140
 The building above the train station at 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.870
 Frankfurt airport 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.210
 Nokia also wants this way 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.820
 Just put the pictures in one 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.130
 bring geographical context and 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.010
 offers a new software 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.640
 this software requires nokia break 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.610
 the new version with windows phone 8.0 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.580
 gddr3 will be in the first quarter then 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.120
 also played on other lumia devices 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.190
 So will be interesting smartphone 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.640
 special property a very 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.840
 brilliant great display but the device 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.360
 is also very big you have to 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.130
 you want to decide on windows phone 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.040
 have a smaller device like this one 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.690
 the 925 is about or wants to be one 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.520
 carry large device and then 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.530
 maybe a second tray yourself 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.330
 save what you catch 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.790
 is simply a device that is quite large 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.720
 and that one is not so easy in everyone 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.720
 bag can accommodate
