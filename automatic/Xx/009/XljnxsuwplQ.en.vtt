00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.830
 today will try to get a post 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.300
 garden element 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
 i like shifts 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.019
 dependence on this vice exists 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.150
 lats poverty of this element by putting 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.859
 myself 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.310
 dependence on setting new 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.970
 standing snow 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.470
 and together such 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.080
 passes for this item is 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.439
 big traffic jams 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.560
 owning a technique is easier 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.540
 For simplicity, the flow of the medium is divided. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750
 answer the first part of the stream 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.170
 anodine and the second part succeeded 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 consider every hour detailed water 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.410
 already after passing the lowest point 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090
 before staging a lot to do 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.050
 stop there ok 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.870
 fold and putin your body forward they 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.610
 love 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.410
 the status must be fast enough and 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.010
 so abruptly 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 don't have time to checkmate 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.620
 group oldies need to be as open as possible 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.810
 If you lack the crease experience 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 and stand in the woods 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.280
 the tournament gathered a full house 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.220
 it makes it a little easier 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 the Internet makes it clear th 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.400
 finally up to 100 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.490
 let you count all 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.339
 what you brought out so humble 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.359
 one tournament and pic 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:11.849
 naturally issued recall 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.299
 are in Moscow that is not immediately 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.349
 so I advise you to take a trial 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.349
 with much earlier 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.499
 for example, many people like icons in turn 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.439
 after a pass staging new lose it after 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.829
 what a few practically 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:46.679
 unreal 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.809
 also ask but in any case it is necessary 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:50.869
 either to others this indicates 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.149
 power 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.439
 all carried numbers by collecting 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.749
 Shushary needed pawns 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.749
 as established older investigators 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.619
 true ok 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.209
 in the same 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.459
 after passing 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.219
 recall once we 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.779
 why can't he 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.779
 it's big enough 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.099
 so many mistakes 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.899
 if you can't notice you can 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.919
 just dance under your feet like 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.559
 and the more eastern 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:44.809
 easier for viewers london
