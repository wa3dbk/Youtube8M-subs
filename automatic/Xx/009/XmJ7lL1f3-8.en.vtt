00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.270
 Highlights in Bonn as the German Armed Forces was allowed by their 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.930
 Chocolate side present and he is such solid basically downright 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.240
 ideal for fresh primary school location to Shanghai as it was said aloud 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.240
 Schaller was there for us 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.380
 we are one hundred times the volunteer service 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.900
 but football 100 facilities are a godsend that volunteers service 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.640
 would have to report 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.780
 there are fewer and fewer 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.600
 what makes al Qaeda better than the Bundeswehr 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 Harare 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.660
 - and then just about the interest and the enthusiasm are there and there 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.660
 People there 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.030
 and there you can not just step out because or expand 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.290
 with another seven points 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.640
 that they have to do better 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 because not all swiss ones are better or worse speakers of this 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.710
 So people who are fighting but already sure we have we have good ones 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 have been on their families frets where there are six seven people in the family 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.070
 it also meant 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.729
 in other words, if you deny a loan 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.869
 Hamilton continued and with them that's no different than we have to 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.670
 rather, to take over forward with the special model that one should 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 VG Red Bull through this 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 the result but they also have to for his new school 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.910
 Maybe it would help if the soldiers countries themselves 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.790
 I also think about the beautiful beaches of Thailand 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.710
 example 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.880
 if not in this now 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.360
 LN the most of the silent reserves so the talk and so 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.470
 the pledges will be once to visit which country for years 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.810
 No more the air raid on Friday made more active neither for the new one 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.750
 Features and you have to ThailÃ¤nder then actually the war 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.560
 explain so that you get there at all that it flares up soon 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 Man to man yes that's what 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.520
 These are suggestions for how to get and it will have the most comprehensive 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 For example, here we want to reassure the customer 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:29.499
 but not all cases already well then we still have percent feel 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.019
 on the known one 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.389
 around advertising slogan who invented the German 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.009
 We always ask for everything German companies 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.449
 For example, we wanted to fly in addition to inspiring early flyers 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:45.949
 darker than the relatively imposing but what the Bundeswehr is about course 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.220
 to recruit new members that is 6 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.929
 until 6 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.479
 the other proposal Merkel rejects ha 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.209
 1 no 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.849
 1 No. Henneberger 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.999
 as the hunter 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.999
 Harder 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.430
 upper
