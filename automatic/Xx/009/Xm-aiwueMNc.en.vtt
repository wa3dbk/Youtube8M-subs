was going out to really yeah so dies if
he's<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.560> Walton<00:02:26.400> right<00:02:26.610> into<00:02:26.970> base

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
he's going to Walton right into base

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.479 
he's going to Walton right into base
this<00:02:27.360> time<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.200> go<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> pool<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.370> we

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
this time and there we go to pool and we

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.460 
this time and there we go to pool and we
had<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:31.190> hatchery<00:02:32.190> first<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.780> did<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.170> a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
had the hatchery first so we did have a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.430 
had the hatchery first so we did have a
12<00:02:35.010> hatch<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:36.030> an<00:02:36.120> extractor<00:02:36.660> trick<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.170> now

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
12 hatch with an extractor trick and now

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440 
12 hatch with an extractor trick and now
the<00:02:37.500> spawning<00:02:37.920> pool<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.520> same<00:02:39.030> build<00:02:39.300> as

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the spawning pool so same build as

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.180 
the spawning pool so same build as
before<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.069> think<00:02:42.290> let's<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.410> assume<00:02:43.890> at

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
before and I think let's just assume at

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.130 
before and I think let's just assume at
is<00:02:44.370> doing<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.730> same<00:02:44.880> thing<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.750> drones

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
is doing the same thing so that drones

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.490 
is doing the same thing so that drones
gonna<00:02:46.350> scout<00:02:46.620> again<00:02:47.250> there<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.200> realizes<00:02:49.200> hey

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
gonna scout again there and realizes hey

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.710 
gonna scout again there and realizes hey
wait<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.459> he<00:02:50.580> came<00:02:50.940> from<00:02:51.239> up<00:02:51.450> there

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
wait that is if he came from up there

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.080 
wait that is if he came from up there
from<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.410> twelve<00:02:52.739> o'clock<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.400> maybe<00:02:53.820> is

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
from the twelve o'clock so maybe is

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.090 
from the twelve o'clock so maybe is
there<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.200> gonna<00:02:55.319> be<00:02:55.410> too<00:02:55.709> late<00:02:55.739> because

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
there but it's gonna be too late because

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.740 
there but it's gonna be too late because
that<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.790> Marines<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.569> that

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
that is it that Marines going to be that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.340 
that is it that Marines going to be that
we<00:02:57.989> have<00:02:58.140> quick<00:02:58.980> expansion<00:02:59.700> as<00:02:59.880> before<00:03:00.690> but

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
we have quick expansion as before but

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.309 
we have quick expansion as before but
now<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.650> don't<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.489> super<00:03:02.970> duper<00:03:03.420> hard<00:03:04.019> it

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
now we don't have a super duper hard it

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.840 
now we don't have a super duper hard it
wrong<00:03:04.560> gets<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:06.920> sticky<00:03:07.920> little<00:03:08.130> drone<00:03:08.400> it's

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
wrong gets in sticky little drone it's

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.449 
wrong gets in sticky little drone it's
got<00:03:09.000> asked<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.269> usually<00:03:10.190> scouting<00:03:11.190> drones

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
got asked out usually scouting drones

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
work is the same it's all bits of metal

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.520 
work is the same it's all bits of metal
building<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.470> hmm<00:03:22.470> well<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.049> see<00:03:25.230> at

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
building and hmm well if you can see at

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.650 
building and hmm well if you can see at
a<00:03:25.829> stage<00:03:26.160> where<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.610> factory<00:03:27.000> goes<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.480> then

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
a stage where the factory goes and then

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.170 
a stage where the factory goes and then
you<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:27.959> make<00:03:28.079> out<00:03:28.320> always<00:03:28.530> got<00:03:28.890> 15<00:03:29.670> barracks

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
you can make out always got 15 barracks

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.810 
you can make out always got 15 barracks
instead<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.630> two<00:03:31.010> maybe<00:03:32.010> he's<00:03:32.310> going<00:03:32.579> through

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820

instead of two maybe he's going through
some<00:03:33.060> kind<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.299> marine<00:03:33.540> rush<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.200> can

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
some kind of marine rush then you can

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380 
some kind of marine rush then you can
say<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.829> but<00:03:35.070> there<00:03:35.459> we<00:03:35.549> go<00:03:35.640> second<00:03:36.030> baratz<00:03:36.269> are

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
say it but there we go second baratz are

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.430 
say it but there we go second baratz are

time<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.070> just<00:03:41.519> gonna<00:03:41.700> build<00:03:42.060> two<00:03:42.209> Marines

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
time so just gonna build two Marines

time so just gonna build two Marines
there<00:03:42.720> let's<00:03:43.049> see<00:03:43.230> how<00:03:43.380> he<00:03:43.920> responds<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
there let's see how he responds a

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.660 
there let's see how he responds a
malleus<00:03:45.359> responds<00:03:45.930> here<00:03:46.109> his<00:03:46.680> girl<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.370> got

his extractor up let's see what he does
with<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.190> going<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.850> ignore<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.390> fact<00:03:51.630> that

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
with is going to ignore the fact that

he's got 100 gas and going to do nothing
with<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.180> which<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.709> course<00:03:55.769> something<00:03:56.640> to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
with it which is of course something to

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.780 
with it which is of course something to
do<00:03:56.989> but<00:03:57.989> what<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.320> he<00:03:58.500> doing<00:03:58.950> with<00:03:59.370> all<00:03:59.430> this

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
do but what is he doing with all this

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.990 
do but what is he doing with all this
minerals<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.450> these<00:04:00.930> minerals<00:04:01.530> even<00:04:02.000> building

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
minerals is these minerals even building

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.810 
minerals is these minerals even building
drones<00:04:03.209> building<00:04:03.930> drones<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:05.220> he's<00:04:05.579> pretty

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
drones building drones so he's pretty

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
bunker so first the command center then

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.960 
bunker so first the command center then
the<00:04:10.079> bunker<00:04:10.380> bit<00:04:10.560> late<00:04:10.799> but<00:04:11.010> mix-up<00:04:11.579> but<00:04:11.730> still

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
the bunker bit late but mix-up but still

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
stopped building his command center when

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.879 
stopped building his command center when
it<00:04:22.260> was<00:04:22.470> more<00:04:22.830> than<00:04:22.979> three-quarters

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
it was more than three-quarters
