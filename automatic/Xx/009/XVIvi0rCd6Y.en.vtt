00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899 

I<00:00:00.199> decided<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.410> make<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.589> custom<00:00:02.159> lathe<00:00:02.460> cover

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
I decided to make a custom lathe cover

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.260 
I decided to make a custom lathe cover
for<00:00:03.510> my<00:00:03.629> grizzly<00:00:04.230> g<00:00:04.620> 0<00:00:04.890> 60<00:00:05.400> or<00:00:05.520> too<00:00:05.700> late<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
for my grizzly g 0 60 or too late and

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.390 
for my grizzly g 0 60 or too late and
i'm<00:00:06.839> using<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.200> process<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.890> was<00:00:07.950> outlined

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
i'm using the process that was outlined

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.990 
i'm using the process that was outlined
by<00:00:08.700> barry<00:00:09.030> young<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:10.190> projects<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.280> metal<00:00:11.550> calm

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
by barry young on projects in metal calm

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.770 
by barry young on projects in metal calm
and<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.990> process<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.559> basically<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.790> go<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
and the process is basically to go to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.680 
and the process is basically to go to
harbor<00:00:16.109> freight<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.590> buy<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> cheap<00:00:17.490> 5<00:00:18.240> foot<00:00:18.510> by

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
harbor freight and buy a cheap 5 foot by

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
harbor freight and buy a cheap 5 foot by
seven<00:00:19.020> foot<00:00:19.230> tarp<00:00:19.820> throw<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> over<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> lathe

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
seven foot tarp throw it over the lathe

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.839 
seven foot tarp throw it over the lathe
and<00:00:22.039> then<00:00:23.039> everywhere<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> tarp

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
and then everywhere that the tarp

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.030 
and then everywhere that the tarp
overlaps<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.840> pin<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:29.570> with<00:00:30.830> straight<00:00:31.830> pins

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
overlaps you pin it with straight pins

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.540 
overlaps you pin it with straight pins
and<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.059> cut<00:00:33.360> off<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> excess<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.550> once

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and then you cut off the excess and once

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.080 
and then you cut off the excess and once
you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> excess<00:00:36.630> cut<00:00:36.899> off<00:00:37.910> you<00:00:38.910> can

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
you have all the excess cut off you can

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.030 
you have all the excess cut off you can
use<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> tarp<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> pattern<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:43.010> sew<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
use the tarp as a pattern to sew a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
use the tarp as a pattern to sew a
regular<00:00:44.579> cloth<00:00:44.910> cover<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.899> i'm<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> be

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
regular cloth cover and i'm going to be

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.970 
regular cloth cover and i'm going to be
using<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:47.250> heavy<00:00:48.030> weight<00:00:48.379> almost<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> gene

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
using a heavy weight almost like a gene

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.939 
using a heavy weight almost like a gene
fabric<00:00:50.460> i<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.850> call<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.030> duck<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
fabric i think they call it duck and

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.860 
fabric i think they call it duck and
it'll<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.070> black<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.090> next<00:00:54.120> step<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it'll be black so the next step here is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
it'll be black so the next step here is
to<00:00:54.989> trim<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.980> excess<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.879> then

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
to trim off all this excess and and then

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.729 
to trim off all this excess and and then
i'll<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.059> ready<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.420> my<00:01:00.539> pattern<00:01:00.780> you'll

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
i'll be ready with my pattern you'll

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.319 
i'll be ready with my pattern you'll
notice<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> things<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.120> did

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
notice that one of the things that I did

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
notice that one of the things that I did
that<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.199> Barry<00:01:04.409> did<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.549> made

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that I don't think Barry did that made

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
that I don't think Barry did that made
it<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> lot<00:01:06.240> easier<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.810> adding<00:01:07.260> magnets<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it a lot easier was adding magnets to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
it a lot easier was adding magnets to
the<00:01:08.580> process<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.180> didn't<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> second

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the process I didn't have a second

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.289 
the process I didn't have a second
person<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.290> helping<00:01:10.619> me<00:01:10.970> put<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> tarp

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
person out here helping me put the tarp

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
person out here helping me put the tarp
over<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> lathe<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> hold<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.530> place<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
over the lathe and hold it in place so I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.149 
over the lathe and hold it in place so I
just<00:01:14.490> used<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:15.439> rather<00:01:16.439> strong<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.130> cheap

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
just used some rather strong and cheap

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.880 
just used some rather strong and cheap
magnets<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.909> also<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> harbor<00:01:18.720> freight

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
magnets that I also got a harbor freight

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
magnets that I also got a harbor freight
to<00:01:19.890> hold<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> tarp<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.909> place<00:01:21.119> while<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.390> pinned

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
to hold the tarp in place while I pinned

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.109 
to hold the tarp in place while I pinned
it<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> I'll<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.220> back<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> second<00:01:23.909> after<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it so I'll be back in a second after I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999 
it so I'll be back in a second after I
trim<00:01:24.420> off<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> excess<00:01:25.140> alright<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.860> now

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
trim off all the excess alright so now

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.280 
trim off all the excess alright so now
after<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:26.759> trimmed<00:01:26.970> everything<00:01:27.330> away<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
after I've trimmed everything away the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.649 
after I've trimmed everything away the
tarp<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.939> starting<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
tarp is really starting to look like a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.140 
tarp is really starting to look like a
custom-fit<00:01:31.320> cover<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.850> thing<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
custom-fit cover and one thing when I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
custom-fit cover and one thing when I
haven't<00:01:33.540> done<00:01:33.720> yet<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.680> wife<00:01:34.860> suggested

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
haven't done yet is my wife suggested

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.760 
haven't done yet is my wife suggested
that<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.549> cut<00:01:35.759> notches<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.479> each<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> seams

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that I cut notches in each of the seams

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
that I cut notches in each of the seams
so<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:39.079> when<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.500> transfer<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.600> pattern<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
so that when I transfer this pattern to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.480 
so that when I transfer this pattern to
the<00:01:42.899> fabric<00:01:43.290> I'll<00:01:43.530> also<00:01:43.740> cut<00:01:44.100> those<00:01:44.250> same

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the fabric I'll also cut those same

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.830 
the fabric I'll also cut those same
notches<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.149> when<00:01:45.270> i<00:01:45.329> go<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> sew<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
notches and then when i go to sew the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.060 
notches and then when i go to sew the
seams<00:01:46.079> together<00:01:46.290> I'll<00:01:46.560> line<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.799> those

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
seams together I'll line up those

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.170 
seams together I'll line up those
notches<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> know<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> two

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
notches so that I know that the two

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.410 
notches so that I know that the two
sides<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> seam<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:52.640> lined<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
sides of the seam are lined up so that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
sides of the seam are lined up so that
was<00:01:54.570> her<00:01:55.020> idea<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.590> trust<00:01:55.860> her<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.009> I'm

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
was her idea and I trust her so I'm

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.920 
was her idea and I trust her so I'm
going<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> other<00:01:57.630> thing<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
going to do that then the other thing I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.709 
going to do that then the other thing I
did<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:59.040> handle<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.579> causing<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.240> tarp<00:02:00.540> to

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
did the handle was causing the tarp to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.020 
did the handle was causing the tarp to
kind<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.960> billow<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.759> handle

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
kind of billow out right here the handle

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.319 
kind of billow out right here the handle
on<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> cross<00:02:03.450> slide<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.219> pulled<00:02:06.210> this

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
on the cross slide so I just pulled this

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.850 
on the cross slide so I just pulled this
in<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:06.840> bit<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.229> pinned<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.680> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
in a little bit and pinned it and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.580 
in a little bit and pinned it and
trimmed<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.429> that'll<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.879> another

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
trimmed it and that'll be another

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.020 
trimmed it and that'll be another
another<00:02:11.590> little<00:02:11.890> seam<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:12.580> I'll<00:02:12.730> need<00:02:12.760> to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
another little seam and all I'll need to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.059 
another little seam and all I'll need to
do<00:02:13.180> whenever<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.870> put<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> tarp<00:02:14.440> over<00:02:14.739> or<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
do whenever I put the tarp over or the

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.649 
do whenever I put the tarp over or the
cover<00:02:15.250> over<00:02:15.459> is<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:15.940> make<00:02:16.090> sure<00:02:16.239> that<00:02:16.420> cross

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
cover over is just make sure that cross

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.509 
cover over is just make sure that cross
slide<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.470> roughly<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.190> middle<00:02:18.400> of

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
slide is in in roughly the middle of

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.130 
slide is in in roughly the middle of
that<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:21.390> middle<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.540> lathe<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.959> then

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
that of the middle of the lathe and then

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.320 
that of the middle of the lathe and then
the<00:02:23.260> tarp<00:02:23.769> or<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.340> cover<00:02:24.549> will<00:02:24.790> will<00:02:25.120> fit<00:02:25.299> just

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
the tarp or the cover will will fit just

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.559 
the tarp or the cover will will fit just
fine<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:26.280> here's<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.459> other<00:02:27.549> side<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:30.569> you

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
fine so here's the other side and you

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.979 
fine so here's the other side and you
know<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:32.140> lady<00:02:32.349> obviously<00:02:32.680> isn't<00:02:33.129> a

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
know this lady obviously isn't a

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.520 
know this lady obviously isn't a
complete<00:02:34.989> square<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:38.349> definitely

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
complete square and so you definitely

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.199 
complete square and so you definitely
have<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.980> make<00:02:39.129> some<00:02:39.250> adjustments<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.940> make<00:02:40.030> it

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
have to make some adjustments to make it

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.449 
have to make some adjustments to make it
fit<00:02:41.170> nice<00:02:41.379> but<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.860> think<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.190> worked<00:02:42.340> out

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
fit nice but I think it worked out

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.210 
fit nice but I think it worked out
pretty<00:02:42.609> well<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:43.060> hoping<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
pretty well I'm hoping that the the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.680 
pretty well I'm hoping that the the
cover<00:02:45.430> will<00:02:45.670> look<00:02:45.790> even<00:02:45.940> better<00:02:46.209> once<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
cover will look even better once the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.660 
cover will look even better once the
seams<00:02:46.930> are<00:02:47.079> turned<00:02:47.319> inside<00:02:47.680> out<00:02:47.709> now<00:02:48.459> one

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
seams are turned inside out now one

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.569 
seams are turned inside out now one
other<00:02:48.700> thing<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.120> need<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.299> do<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:50.340> mark<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.489> this

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
other thing I need to do is mark on this

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.050 
other thing I need to do is mark on this
tarp<00:02:51.879> that<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:53.049> is<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.470> side<00:02:54.099> facing<00:02:54.609> out<00:02:54.760> so

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
tarp that this is the side facing out so

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.410 
tarp that this is the side facing out so
that<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.870> can<00:02:55.959> flip<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.349> tarp<00:02:56.560> inside<00:02:56.950> out

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that I can flip the tarp inside out

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.750 
that I can flip the tarp inside out
before<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> cut<00:02:58.690> out<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.930> pattern<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.760> that's

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
before I cut out the pattern and that's

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.550 
before I cut out the pattern and that's
also<00:03:01.060> outlined<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.629> berries<00:03:01.870> article<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
that's it for now all I'll pull this off

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.080 
that's it for now all I'll pull this off
of<00:03:08.650> here<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.950> lay<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.370> out<00:03:09.459> on<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.609> fabric<00:03:09.819> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
of here and lay it out on the fabric and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.649 
of here and lay it out on the fabric and
cut<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.329> out<00:03:11.790> alright<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.030> now<00:03:13.150> everything<00:03:13.569> is

cut out and you'll notice that i left
about<00:03:15.700> an<00:03:15.910> inch<00:03:16.209> strip<00:03:16.959> all<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.230> way<00:03:17.440> around

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
about an inch strip all the way around

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.009 
about an inch strip all the way around
at<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.150> bottom<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:21.180> cover<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.389> that's<00:03:22.569> so

at the bottom of the cover and that's so
once<00:03:23.319> i<00:03:23.440> get<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.829> place<00:03:23.859> on<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.700> lathe<00:03:24.940> i

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
once i get it in place on the lathe i

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.190 
once i get it in place on the lathe i
can<00:03:25.540> turn<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.470> under<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:28.049> make<00:03:29.049> sure<00:03:29.079> that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
can turn it under and make sure that

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.809 
can turn it under and make sure that
it's<00:03:29.470> all<00:03:29.620> nice<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.010> level<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.519> table

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
it's all nice and level with the table

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.849 
it's all nice and level with the table
top<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.000> then<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.599> last<00:03:32.049> seam<00:03:32.500> all<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
top and then so that last seam all the

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.180 
top and then so that last seam all the
way<00:03:32.980> around<00:03:33.069> all<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.549> way<00:03:33.700> around<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.180> cover

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
way around all the way around the cover

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.080 
way around all the way around the cover
along<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> bottom<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:37.359> next<00:03:37.870> it's<00:03:38.049> time<00:03:39.090> to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
along the bottom so next it's time to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.729 
along the bottom so next it's time to
take<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.359> tarp<00:03:40.599> off<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.049> start<00:03:41.319> sewing<00:03:41.650> up

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
take the tarp off and start sewing up

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.759 
take the tarp off and start sewing up

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
the cover okay so here's a good example

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.619 
the cover okay so here's a good example
of<00:03:45.250> why<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:45.609> necessary<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.239> put<00:03:46.510> those

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
of why it's necessary to put those

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.360 
of why it's necessary to put those
notches<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.260> place<00:03:47.440> now<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.709> understand<00:03:48.220> what

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
notches in place now I understand what

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.670 
notches in place now I understand what
my<00:03:48.519> wife<00:03:48.699> was<00:03:48.940> talking<00:03:49.329> about<00:03:49.620> when<00:03:50.620> you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
my wife was talking about when you

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
you'll notice that sometimes the bottom

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.550 
you'll notice that sometimes the bottom
portion<00:03:57.669> doesn't<00:03:58.120> line<00:03:58.329> up<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.840> if<00:03:59.349> you<00:03:59.470> were

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
portion doesn't line up and if you were

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.710 
portion doesn't line up and if you were
to<00:03:59.590> try<00:03:59.859> and<00:04:00.010> line<00:04:00.160> these<00:04:00.370> two<00:04:00.669> pieces<00:04:00.910> up<00:04:01.269> to

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
to try and line these two pieces up to

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.500 
to try and line these two pieces up to
where<00:04:01.840> they<00:04:01.959> overlapped<00:04:02.319> perfectly<00:04:03.359> then<00:04:04.359> the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
where they overlapped perfectly then the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.089 
where they overlapped perfectly then the
little<00:04:04.660> notch<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.199> you<00:04:05.290> cut<00:04:05.560> right<00:04:06.430> here

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
little notch that you cut right here

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.099 
little notch that you cut right here
wouldn't<00:04:09.099> line<00:04:09.250> up<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.239> purpose<00:04:10.569> again<00:04:10.900> of

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
wouldn't line up so the purpose again of

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.629 
wouldn't line up so the purpose again of
those<00:04:11.230> notches<00:04:11.440> is<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.949> just<00:04:12.099> make<00:04:12.310> sure<00:04:12.459> that

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
those notches is to just make sure that

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.890 
those notches is to just make sure that
you're<00:04:12.730> lining<00:04:12.970> up<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.329> seam<00:04:13.599> in<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
you're lining up the seam in the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.529 
you're lining up the seam in the
appropriate<00:04:14.260> spot<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.099> there's<00:04:15.280> two<00:04:16.209> pieces

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
appropriate spot so there's two pieces

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.180 
appropriate spot so there's two pieces
of<00:04:16.570> fabric<00:04:16.720> here<00:04:17.169> with<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.349> little<00:04:17.590> slit<00:04:17.949> cut

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
of fabric here with a little slit cut

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.620 
of fabric here with a little slit cut
here<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.430> just<00:04:18.549> cut<00:04:18.849> the<00:04:18.969> slit<00:04:19.209> right<00:04:19.359> in<00:04:19.539> the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
here I just cut the slit right in the

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.029 
here I just cut the slit right in the
middle<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.049> notch<00:04:20.349> that<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.680> cut<00:04:20.859> in<00:04:20.950> the

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
middle of the notch that I cut in the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.640 
middle of the notch that I cut in the
pattern

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
pattern

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.340 
pattern
and<00:04:21.769> then<00:04:22.490> by<00:04:22.850> lining<00:04:23.090> up<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.540> slit<00:04:23.930> I<00:04:24.199> know

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
and then by lining up that slit I know

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.730 
and then by lining up that slit I know
that<00:04:24.710> my<00:04:24.860> both<00:04:25.610> sides<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:26.120> my<00:04:26.210> seems<00:04:26.740> both

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
that my both sides of my seems both

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.320 
that my both sides of my seems both
sides<00:04:28.100> of<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> seams<00:04:28.550> are<00:04:28.669> lined<00:04:28.850> up<00:04:29.000> so

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
sides of the seams are lined up so

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.939 
sides of the seams are lined up so
that's<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.900> purpose<00:04:30.139> of<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.530> makes<00:04:30.680> sense

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
that's the purpose of it it makes sense

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.029 
that's the purpose of it it makes sense
now<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:32.020> Thank<00:04:33.020> You<00:04:33.169> Liz<00:04:33.350> but<00:04:33.560> at<00:04:33.680> handy<00:04:33.919> little

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
now so Thank You Liz but at handy little

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.810 
now so Thank You Liz but at handy little
tip<00:04:35.919> okay<00:04:36.919> it<00:04:37.039> might<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.370> little<00:04:37.520> difficult

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
tip okay it might be a little difficult

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.730 
tip okay it might be a little difficult
to<00:04:38.150> see<00:04:38.419> because<00:04:38.600> it's<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.960> dark<00:04:39.169> fabric<00:04:39.410> that

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
to see because it's a dark fabric that

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.210 
to see because it's a dark fabric that
this<00:04:39.919> is<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:43.400> almost<00:04:43.759> finished<00:04:44.240> cover

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
this is the the almost finished cover

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.620 
this is the the almost finished cover
the<00:04:46.220> only<00:04:46.460> thing<00:04:46.729> left<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.120> do<00:04:47.330> is<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:48.020> turn<00:04:48.470> up

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
the only thing left to do is to turn up

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.939 
the only thing left to do is to turn up
each<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.870> these<00:04:53.350> sections<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.710> left

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
each of these sections that I left

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.860 
each of these sections that I left
longer<00:04:55.370> when<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.060> cut<00:04:56.240> out<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.449> pattern<00:04:56.630> I've

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
longer when I cut out the pattern I've

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.170 
longer when I cut out the pattern I've
got<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.169> fold<00:04:57.470> those<00:04:57.650> under<00:04:58.010> twice<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.729> make<00:04:59.150> a

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
got to fold those under twice and make a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.330 
got to fold those under twice and make a
seam<00:04:59.570> all<00:04:59.870> the<00:05:00.229> way<00:05:00.320> around<00:05:00.440> delays<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.190> that

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
seam all the way around delays so that

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.670 
seam all the way around delays so that
it's<00:05:01.460> just<00:05:01.729> sitting<00:05:02.080> maybe<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.169> half<00:05:03.320> inch<00:05:03.470> or

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
it's just sitting maybe a half inch or

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.129 
it's just sitting maybe a half inch or
so<00:05:03.830> off<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.400> table<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.970> way<00:05:05.120> if<00:05:05.900> there's

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
so off of the table that way if there's

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.480 
so off of the table that way if there's
grease<00:05:06.380> or<00:05:06.620> something<00:05:06.889> on<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.070> table<00:05:07.250> it's

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
grease or something on the table it's

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.580 
grease or something on the table it's
not<00:05:07.639> soaking<00:05:07.880> up<00:05:08.060> into<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.539> end<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.380> cover

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
not soaking up into the end of the cover

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.560 
not soaking up into the end of the cover
so<00:05:09.919> I'm<00:05:10.310> going<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.520> flip<00:05:10.820> those<00:05:11.060> underneath

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
so I'm going to flip those underneath

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.839 
so I'm going to flip those underneath
and<00:05:11.810> pin<00:05:12.560> them<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.010> then<00:05:13.250> take<00:05:13.490> this<00:05:13.610> back

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
and pin them and then take this back

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.510 
and pin them and then take this back
into<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.180> house<00:05:14.330> in<00:05:14.599> and<00:05:15.070> sew<00:05:16.070> up<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.310> seam

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
into the house in and sew up the seam

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.909 
into the house in and sew up the seam
along<00:05:16.789> the<00:05:16.970> bottom<00:05:17.289> okay<00:05:18.289> and<00:05:18.470> here's<00:05:18.680> what

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
along the bottom okay and here's what

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.810 
along the bottom okay and here's what
the<00:05:19.310> cover<00:05:19.970> looks<00:05:20.060> like<00:05:20.389> once<00:05:20.599> you've<00:05:20.750> got<00:05:20.960> the

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
the cover looks like once you've got the

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.490 
the cover looks like once you've got the
bottom<00:05:22.820> seam<00:05:23.060> folded<00:05:23.509> under<00:05:23.780> twice<00:05:24.110> and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
bottom seam folded under twice and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.100 
bottom seam folded under twice and
pinned<00:05:24.889> in<00:05:25.070> place<00:05:25.539> takes<00:05:26.539> a<00:05:26.630> little<00:05:26.750> while<00:05:26.930> to

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
pinned in place takes a little while to

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.750 
pinned in place takes a little while to
get<00:05:27.199> it<00:05:27.320> all<00:05:27.440> even<00:05:27.800> all<00:05:27.979> the<00:05:28.039> way<00:05:28.250> across<00:05:28.400> the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
get it all even all the way across the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.390 
get it all even all the way across the
bottom<00:05:29.919> but<00:05:30.919> once<00:05:31.070> you've<00:05:31.220> got<00:05:31.400> it<00:05:31.430> pinned<00:05:32.320> in

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
bottom but once you've got it pinned in

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.899 
bottom but once you've got it pinned in
place<00:05:35.800> you're<00:05:36.800> ready<00:05:36.949> to<00:05:37.130> sew<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:37.490> final

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
place you're ready to sew that final

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.010 
place you're ready to sew that final
seam<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.389> make<00:05:38.599> it<00:05:38.720> look<00:05:38.870> like<00:05:38.960> a

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
seam and make it look like a

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.100 
seam and make it look like a
professionally<00:05:40.389> created<00:05:41.389> laid<00:05:42.229> cover<00:05:44.110> okay

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
professionally created laid cover okay

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.940 
professionally created laid cover okay
and<00:05:45.349> here<00:05:46.010> we<00:05:46.130> have<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.520> finished<00:05:47.560> cover

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
and here we have the finished cover

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.740 
and here we have the finished cover
with<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:50.850> scene<00:05:52.730> turned<00:05:53.730> over<00:05:53.940> twice<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.270> so

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
with the scene turned over twice and so

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.610 
with the scene turned over twice and so
on<00:05:56.360> or<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.390> guess<00:05:57.480> maybe<00:05:57.840> this<00:05:58.050> is<00:05:58.170> called<00:05:58.380> a<00:05:58.470> him

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620

on or I guess maybe this is called a him
according<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.710> my<00:06:01.800> wife<00:06:03.290> and<00:06:04.460> all<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.760> way

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
according to my wife and all the way

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.060 
according to my wife and all the way
around<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.480> base<00:06:07.170> you<00:06:07.410> can<00:06:07.590> see<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.950> it's

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
around the base you can see that it's

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.040 
around the base you can see that it's
nice<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.490> straight<00:06:08.790> and<00:06:08.820> flat<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.390> it's<00:06:09.510> just

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
nice and straight and flat and it's just

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.150 
nice and straight and flat and it's just
barely<00:06:11.510> you<00:06:12.510> know<00:06:12.630> maybe<00:06:12.900> a<00:06:12.990> half<00:06:13.560> inch<00:06:13.710> up<00:06:13.980> off

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
barely you know maybe a half inch up off

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.820 
barely you know maybe a half inch up off
of<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.510> off<00:06:15.510> the<00:06:15.720> table<00:06:15.870> that<00:06:16.170> way<00:06:16.290> if<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.530> spill

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
of it off the table that way if I spill

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.440 
of it off the table that way if I spill
some<00:06:17.010> oil<00:06:17.160> on<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.460> table<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:17.880> cloth<00:06:18.120> isn't

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
some oil on the table the cloth isn't

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.310 
some oil on the table the cloth isn't
going<00:06:18.570> to<00:06:18.630> soak<00:06:18.840> it<00:06:18.990> up<00:06:20.630> but<00:06:21.630> this<00:06:21.780> is<00:06:21.990> what<00:06:22.200> the

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
going to soak it up but this is what the

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.600 
going to soak it up but this is what the
what<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.350> cover<00:06:25.620> looks<00:06:25.680> like<00:06:26.120> so<00:06:28.430> overall<00:06:29.430> I'd

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
what the cover looks like so overall I'd

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.670 
what the cover looks like so overall I'd
say<00:06:29.640> it<00:06:29.910> was<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.030> pretty<00:06:30.570> easy<00:06:30.660> project<00:06:31.530> if

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
say it was a pretty easy project if

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.320 
say it was a pretty easy project if
you've<00:06:31.830> sown<00:06:32.190> before<00:06:32.670> it'd<00:06:32.850> probably<00:06:33.090> be<00:06:33.270> a

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
you've sown before it'd probably be a

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.040 
you've sown before it'd probably be a
lot<00:06:33.510> easier<00:06:34.970> wasn't<00:06:35.970> very<00:06:36.090> difficult<00:06:36.600> i<00:06:36.780> would

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
lot easier wasn't very difficult i would

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.590 
lot easier wasn't very difficult i would
i<00:06:37.260> would<00:06:37.350> recommend<00:06:38.010> using<00:06:38.310> a<00:06:38.760> single<00:06:39.390> color

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
i would recommend using a single color

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.010 
i would recommend using a single color
fabric<00:06:40.200> because<00:06:40.530> if<00:06:40.890> you<00:06:41.010> use<00:06:41.690> any<00:06:42.690> fabric

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
fabric because if you use any fabric

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.080 
fabric because if you use any fabric
that<00:06:43.290> has<00:06:43.380> a<00:06:43.440> pattern<00:06:43.770> on<00:06:44.010> it<00:06:44.160> it'll<00:06:44.370> the

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
that has a pattern on it it'll the

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.580 
that has a pattern on it it'll the
pattern<00:06:45.390> won't<00:06:45.600> line<00:06:45.750> up<00:06:45.780> when<00:06:46.080> you<00:06:46.200> try<00:06:46.410> and

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
pattern won't line up when you try and

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.160 
pattern won't line up when you try and
sew<00:06:46.890> it<00:06:47.040> together<00:06:47.420> you'd<00:06:48.420> also<00:06:48.570> want<00:06:48.720> to<00:06:48.960> use

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
sew it together you'd also want to use

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.310 
sew it together you'd also want to use
