magic and it's very pure I think it's a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.160 
magic and it's very pure I think it's a
good<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> describe<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.510> new

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
good way to describe it and so this new

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.810 
good way to describe it and so this new
creation<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> decks<00:00:44.370> day<00:00:44.579> is

reuse this absolutely you just peel it

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.729

right<00:03:39.160> back<00:03:39.400> up<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.970> pull<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.019> out<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.350> you

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
right back up and pull it out and you

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.710 
right back up and pull it out and you
don't<00:03:41.980> have<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.190> worry<00:03:42.340> about<00:03:42.480> getting<00:03:43.480> it

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
don't have to worry about getting it

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.870 
don't have to worry about getting it
straight<00:03:43.930> because<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.070> metal<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.579> exact

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
straight because the metal is the exact

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.150 
straight because the metal is the exact
same<00:03:46.120> size<00:03:46.359> as<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.959> side<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.440> tuck<00:03:47.620> so

same size as the side of the tuck so

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.470 
same size as the side of the tuck so
you're<00:03:48.310> not<00:03:48.400> gonna<00:03:48.609> get<00:03:48.880> any<00:03:49.090> sort<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
you're not gonna get any sort of a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.150 
you're not gonna get any sort of a
crooked<00:03:50.260> or<00:03:51.160> leaning<00:03:52.739> pieces<00:03:53.739> in<00:03:53.859> there<00:03:54.010> it's

gonna line up really really perfect so

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.699 
gonna line up really really perfect so
yeah<00:03:57.819> that's<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.299> next<00:03:58.480> day<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.989> like<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.650> said

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
yeah that's the next day and like I said

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.199 
yeah that's the next day and like I said
that<00:03:59.980> there<00:04:00.130> are<00:04:00.160> five<00:04:00.489> bucks<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> bad

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
that there are five bucks so the bad

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.030 
that there are five bucks so the bad

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.590 
news well worth what what they're worth
and<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:06.639> I<00:04:06.670> would<00:04:06.910> highly<00:04:07.180> recommend<00:04:07.569> that
