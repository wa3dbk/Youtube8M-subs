00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.939
 been there as issues that are not in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.750
 prepa that's how they're going to get to the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.120

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.820
 that radically changing your life changes 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.739
 of school changes his friends changes the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.760
 state where he lives that he already lived in 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.380
 atlanta 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.030
 and then you have to leave your 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.130
 family and especially the boy who 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.170
 natura likes your stay to go 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 make a total hell since she 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.040
 never did go to paris 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.140
 She did not decide to move, she does not know the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 language does not know the country but little to 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 little copes with it as it continues in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.340
 contact with your best friend you realize 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.440
 that seems like the one of the cinema and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.110
 she is a movie fanatic she loves 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.240
 make reviews about movies but about 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 all because he makes friends with a group of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.940
 guys trying to make it fit in 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.490
 this new school but mostly with 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.970
 a boy called sancler that is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 becomes like his best friend that he 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.300
 identifies quite with her in that of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.729
 that dads make decisions for them 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.590
 and do not let them be according to what's going on 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.650
 developing the story we see how 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.900
 Anna apart from adapting it matures and 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.700
 is gaining confidence and also taking 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.840
 the control of his life a kiss in several 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.300
 It is the first book of the trilogy 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.770
 written by stephenie perkins and is the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.229
 what we liked most about the three books 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.970
 something that we liked a lot is also 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.310
 that although the books are written 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.470
 in a single universe are stories 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.020
 independent and who can go reading 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.650
 you agree and you can read one 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.750
 and the other does not if the characters are in 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.030
 one and another story but you do not give 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.130
 account of that the writer developed a 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.050
 plot that may sound pretty trite 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.340
 now in this of the juvenile literature 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.810
 but I think the way he writes the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.870
 personality of each of his 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.430
 characters and emotions that we 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.830
 wants to transmit 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.020
 stephanie perkins make it a 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.030
 Pretty fresh reading and pretty 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.800
 entertaining but above all we are 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.110
 recommending you read this book because 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.540
 we believe that although it is a youth book 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.970
 it's not like all the books 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.000
 youth that we have read the story 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.650
 We thought it was quite novel and so 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.840
 we think it's a story that can 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.610
 happen to you that can happen to me and that you 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.740
 can happen to your neighbor and that's something 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.410
 that fascinated us we find 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.690
 pretty funny characters that are 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.480
 very mature endearing in few 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.519
 words a kiss 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.080
 I would be that you will fall in love those are 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.090
 our reasons why we decided 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.519
 that this book was our second 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.129
 recommendation in this of the type rúa and 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.440
 speaking a little more of the time rúa already 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.299
 I know that you have asked us in 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.760
 our social networks what happens with 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.799
 this project 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.810
 Well, the 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.390
 last recommendation was only 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.189
 in the filof de guadalajara and it was about 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.620
 letter of dead models and in this 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.709
 occasion we have a kiss in paris the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.620
 recommendation will finally reach the df 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.030
 yes yes yes yes it is to say that they are finally going to 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.790
 get these recommendations to 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.230
 physical branches that are going to be the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.409
 lindavista branch reform 222 and the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.280
 branch of the Republic of Argentina that 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.799
 is the matrix of these libraries called 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.200
