Veyron which does 295 miles an hour has
pretty<00:00:10.889> good<00:00:10.980> handling<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.210> time<00:00:12.480> this

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
pretty good handling so this time this

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.530 
pretty good handling so this time this
is<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.110> pure<00:00:13.530> drag<00:00:14.099> set<00:00:14.429> up<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> Veyron

drive of two point two that's very

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770 
drive of two point two that's very
important<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.699> Deaf<00:00:59.910> initial<00:01:00.570> talk

important for the Deaf initial talk

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.000 
important for the Deaf initial talk
we've<00:01:00.960> got<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.170> high<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.350> possible<00:01:01.500> because

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we've got as high as possible because

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
we've got as high as possible because
it's<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> drag<00:01:02.550> car<00:01:02.850> high<00:01:03.480> acceleration<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
it's a drag car high acceleration and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
it's a drag car high acceleration and
low<00:01:04.619> braking<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> we've<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> talked

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
low braking and we've got the talked

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.859 
low braking and we've got the talked
split<00:01:06.330> 20%<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> front<00:01:08.540> all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> power

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
split 20% to the front all the power

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
split 20% to the front all the power
upgrades<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.680> obviously<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
upgrades you can do obviously and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240 
upgrades you can do obviously and
obviously<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> want<00:01:12.420> nos<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.040> weight<00:01:14.040> loss

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
obviously you want nos and weight loss

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.240 
obviously you want nos and weight loss
you<00:01:14.460> definitely<00:01:15.000> want<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> Vera<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.979> can

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you definitely want on the Vera you can

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
you definitely want on the Vera you can
use<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> manual<00:01:18.090> gearbox<00:01:18.299> obviously<00:01:19.020> it's

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
use a manual gearbox obviously it's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
use a manual gearbox obviously it's
quicker<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.920> use<00:01:20.670> an<00:01:20.759> automatic<00:01:21.360> in

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
quicker if you do use an automatic in

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.950 
quicker if you do use an automatic in
this<00:01:21.630> case<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.479> traction<00:01:24.479> control<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
this case and traction control you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.179 
this case and traction control you
definitely<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> yeah<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.159> said

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
definitely want off so yeah like I said

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
definitely want off so yeah like I said
this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.640> purely<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.299> drag<00:01:30.570> tuned<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this is purely a drag tuned for the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.170 
this is purely a drag tuned for the
Veyron<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.280> designed<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.729> cornering

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
Veyron it's not designed for cornering

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.789 
Veyron it's not designed for cornering
at<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:34.369> once<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.700> above<00:01:35.900> 250<00:01:36.900> 260<00:01:37.470> miles

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
at all once you get above 250 260 miles

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.520 
at all once you get above 250 260 miles
per<00:01:38.040> hour<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.780> doesn't<00:01:39.780> really<00:01:39.869> turn<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.350> all

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
per hour it doesn't really turn at all

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.460 
per hour it doesn't really turn at all
so<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.909> car<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.479> mean<00:01:42.750> I've<00:01:42.869> nicknamed<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so this car I mean I've nicknamed it the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.780 
so this car I mean I've nicknamed it the
Cannonball<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
Cannonball because you have to just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399 
Cannonball because you have to just
point<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> particular<00:01:45.630> direction<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
point it in a particular direction and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.920 
point it in a particular direction and
then<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.920> fire<00:01:47.220> don't<00:01:47.790> expect<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> turn

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
then just fire don't expect it to turn

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.530 
then just fire don't expect it to turn
it's<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.829> straight-line<00:01:50.189> machine<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
it's just a straight-line machine that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.350 
it's just a straight-line machine that
said<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.880> quick

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
said it is a very very quick

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300 
said it is a very very quick
straight-line<00:01:54.869> machine<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.680> has<00:01:55.740> cruising

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
I think this is doing 308 at the moment

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.160 
I think this is doing 308 at the moment
needs<00:02:02.590> an<00:02:02.710> oil<00:02:02.800> change<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.850> 309<00:02:04.660> miles<00:02:04.930> per

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
needs an oil change the 309 miles per

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.410 
needs an oil change the 309 miles per
hour

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.710 

gets<00:02:07.840> there<00:02:08.020> very<00:02:08.200> quickly<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.860> can<00:02:09.010> see

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
gets there very quickly as you can see

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.750 
gets there very quickly as you can see
not<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:11.050> 300<00:02:11.800> with<00:02:12.700> nos<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:14.160> 25<00:02:15.160> seconds<00:02:15.580> on

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
not to 300 with nos is 25 seconds on

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.930 
not to 300 with nos is 25 seconds on
this<00:02:16.060> car<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.600> pretty<00:02:16.720> quick<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.940> with

nos the top speed I think is like three
inch<00:02:21.160> from<00:02:21.340> 25<00:02:21.820> or<00:02:22.030> something<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.660> a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
inch from 25 or something so it's a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.800 
inch from 25 or something so it's a
