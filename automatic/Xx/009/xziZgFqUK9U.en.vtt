terminal from Java to the end of jar CI

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.310 
terminal from Java to the end of jar CI
just<00:00:46.770> copy<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.250> paste<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:47.879> click<00:00:48.390> space

just copy and paste and then click space

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
just copy and paste and then click space
you<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:50.039> sure<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.460> there's<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
you have to make sure that there's a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.389 
you have to make sure that there's a
space<00:00:51.140> right<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.410> or<00:00:52.800> else<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> won't<00:00:53.219> work

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
space right here or else it won't work

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.220 
space right here or else it won't work
so<00:00:53.460> make<00:00:54.120> sure<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> space<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:54.930> after

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so make sure there's a space right after

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
so make sure there's a space right after
jar<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.660> by<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.190> server<00:00:59.489> minecraft

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
jar and by then the server minecraft

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.819 
jar and by then the server minecraft
server<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.750> jar<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.320> downloaded

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
what's going to keep your server running

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.940 
what's going to keep your server running
and<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.610> should<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.940> running<00:01:24.120> on<00:01:24.650> two<00:01:25.650> five

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and it should be running on two five

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.990 
and it should be running on two five
five<00:01:26.190> six<00:01:26.550> five<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> default<00:01:27.750> port

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
says enter the IP of a server to connect
to<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.870> well<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.190> IP<00:01:53.340> it's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
to it well it's not just the IP it's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.540 
to it well it's not just the IP it's
also<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.090> port<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.110> well<00:01:56.010> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.250> just

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
also the port so well this is just

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.460 
also the port so well this is just
totally<00:01:56.820> made-up<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.240> let's<00:01:57.390> say<00:01:57.540> like

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
totally made-up but let's say like

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.730 
totally made-up but let's say like
that's<00:01:59.040> an<00:01:59.280> IP<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:01.200> what<00:02:01.410> you<00:02:01.500> would<00:02:01.590> do

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that's an IP and then what you would do

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.040 
that's an IP and then what you would do
is<00:02:04.010> put<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.310> coal<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.050> type

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
is put a little coal in there and type

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.160 
is put a little coal in there and type
the<00:02:07.380> default<00:02:08.220> port<00:02:08.429> or<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.720> port<00:02:09.990> that's

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the default port or the port that's

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.900 
the default port or the port that's
right<00:02:10.410> here<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:13.680> two<00:02:14.010> five<00:02:14.340> five<00:02:14.580> six

should connect to it and yeah that's how

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.720 
should connect to it and yeah that's how
you<00:02:21.209> do<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.570> yeah<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.220> just
