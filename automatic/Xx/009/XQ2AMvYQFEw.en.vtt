here<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.130> are<00:00:17.250> presenting<00:00:17.760> some<00:00:18.000> recently

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
here we are presenting some recently

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.269 
here we are presenting some recently
results<00:00:19.020> from<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.410> submillimetre<00:00:20.010> array

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
results from the submillimetre array

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.759 
results from the submillimetre array
there<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> high<00:00:21.449> mass<00:00:21.660> star<00:00:22.050> forming<00:00:22.410> region

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
there is a high mass star forming region

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.670 
there is a high mass star forming region
which<00:00:23.310> shows<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:24.060> very<00:00:24.449> rich<00:00:24.750> chemistry<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
which shows it's very rich chemistry so

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.380 
which shows it's very rich chemistry so
these<00:00:25.830> regions<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.789> different<00:00:27.060> from

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
these regions are very different from

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.140 
these regions are very different from
the<00:00:27.660> low<00:00:27.840> mass<00:00:28.199> star<00:00:28.890> forming<00:00:29.189> regions<00:00:29.550> ask

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the low mass star forming regions ask

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.810 
the low mass star forming regions ask
for<00:00:30.480> example<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.199> son<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.669> have

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
for example is our son and then we have

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.500 
for example is our son and then we have
found<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.780> chemical<00:00:34.370> segregation<00:00:35.510> which

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
found is a chemical segregation which

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
found is a chemical segregation which
means<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.590> different<00:00:37.879> morphologies

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
means that we see different morphologies

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
means that we see different morphologies
for<00:00:39.149> different<00:00:39.540> molecular<00:00:39.780> species<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:41.219> can

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
for different molecular species that can

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.180 
for different molecular species that can
be<00:00:41.579> explained<00:00:42.120> by<00:00:42.390> combination<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.620> different

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
be explained by combination of different

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
be explained by combination of different
physical<00:00:44.789> processes<00:00:45.300> within<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.890> very

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
physical processes within the in a very

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.279 
physical processes within the in a very
inner<00:00:47.370> regions<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.719> these<00:00:48.960> scores

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
inner regions of these of these scores

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.110 
inner regions of these of these scores
so<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:51.120> modeled<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:53.070> high<00:00:53.460> master<00:00:53.910> from

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so we have modeled this high master from

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880 
so we have modeled this high master from
Nvidia<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.050> found<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Nvidia now what we have found is that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
Nvidia now what we have found is that
this<00:00:56.309> chemical<00:00:56.789> segregation<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
this chemical segregation is a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.950 
this chemical segregation is a
combination<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.399> clinical<00:01:00.000> effects<00:01:00.449> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
combination of two clinical effects so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.740 
combination of two clinical effects so
the<00:01:01.320> first<00:01:01.500> chemical<00:01:01.949> effect<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> high<00:01:03.390> mass

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the first chemical effect is a high mass

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.469 
the first chemical effect is a high mass
high<00:01:04.500> temperature<00:01:05.100> gas<00:01:05.159> phase<00:01:05.519> chemistry<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
high temperature gas phase chemistry and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
high temperature gas phase chemistry and
then<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> second<00:01:07.200> chemical<00:01:07.350> effect<00:01:07.860> ETA<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
then the second chemical effect ETA is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
then the second chemical effect ETA is
strongly<00:01:08.760> photodissociation<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.320> by

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
strongly photodissociation so by

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
strongly photodissociation so by
comparing<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> results<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.360> observations

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
comparing the results the observations

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
comparing the results the observations
with<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> modeling<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.400> able<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
with the modeling so we are able to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.999 
with the modeling so we are able to
establish<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.930> physical<00:01:16.380> conditions<00:01:16.830> within

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
establish the physical conditions within

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.340 
establish the physical conditions within
these<00:01:17.250> regions<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.450> enable<00:01:18.960> us<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
these regions which will enable us to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620 
these regions which will enable us to
understand<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.520> origin<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.360> formation

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
understand the origin and the formation

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.190 
understand the origin and the formation
processes<00:01:22.290> towards<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> subjects<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
processes towards the subjects so the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
processes towards the subjects so the
goal<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.650> work<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.520> study<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> impact

in<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.680> ring<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.310> kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.790> pretty<00:02:45.170> I've

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
in in this ring this kind of pretty I've

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.700 
in in this ring this kind of pretty I've
observed<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.860> forming<00:02:47.790> stars<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.710> relatively

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
observed the forming stars in relatively

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.500 
observed the forming stars in relatively
nearby<00:02:49.950> star<00:02:50.580> forming<00:02:50.820> regions<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.390> our

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
nearby star forming regions in our

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.010 
nearby star forming regions in our
galaxy<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:53.520> these<00:02:53.640> stars<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:54.090> low<00:02:54.600> low

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
galaxy and so these stars are low low

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.230 
galaxy and so these stars are low low
mass<00:02:55.370> protostars<00:02:56.780> recall<00:02:57.780> them<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.170> they<00:02:58.560> are

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
mass protostars recall them and they are

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.770 
mass protostars recall them and they are
thought<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.440> when<00:03:01.440> they're<00:03:01.590> when<00:03:02.190> they<00:03:02.310> are

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
thought to when they're when they are

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.310 
thought to when they're when they are
finished<00:03:04.220> being<00:03:05.220> born<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:05.970> say<00:03:06.200> they<00:03:07.200> are

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
finished being born so to say they are

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.660 
finished being born so to say they are
going<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.800> resemble<00:03:08.190> our<00:03:08.310> own<00:03:08.490> Sun<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:10.050> then

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
going to resemble our own Sun and then

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.199 
going to resemble our own Sun and then
and<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:16.220> what<00:03:17.220> we<00:03:17.310> look<00:03:17.489> for<00:03:17.520> when<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:17.940> did

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
and with what we look for when we did

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.850 
and with what we look for when we did
these<00:03:18.360> observations<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:19.080> water<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:22.560> as

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
these observations was water and then as

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.130 
these observations was water and then as
you<00:03:22.890> see<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> spectra<00:03:24.030> we<00:03:24.690> detected

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
you see here in the spectra we detected

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.140 
you see here in the spectra we detected
water<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.470> know<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:26.040> all<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.340> our<00:03:26.430> sources<00:03:26.880> and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
water you know in all of our sources and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.060 
water you know in all of our sources and
these<00:03:27.600> are<00:03:28.550> maps<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.910> show<00:03:30.590> just<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.770> water

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
these are maps that show just this water

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.479 
these are maps that show just this water
emission<00:03:32.550> in<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.100> these<00:03:35.100> four

we<00:03:41.520> don't<00:03:41.670> only<00:03:41.820> detect<00:03:42.660> water<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.410> detect

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
we don't only detect water we detect

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.350 
we don't only detect water we detect
several<00:03:44.160> other<00:03:44.550> molecules<00:03:46.760> in<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.820> sources

several other molecules in the sources
and<00:03:49.520> what<00:03:50.520> we<00:03:50.640> try<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.850> do<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:51.600> figure<00:03:52.260> out

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
and what we try to do is to figure out

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.550 
and what we try to do is to figure out
where<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.190> ball<00:03:53.400> remission

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560
