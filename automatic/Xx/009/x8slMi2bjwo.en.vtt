00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
as possible that's pretty much it took

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.410 
as possible that's pretty much it took
the<00:00:15.639> two<00:00:16.090> by<00:00:16.270> three<00:00:16.539> out<00:00:16.689> from<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.050> bottom<00:00:18.420> all

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
the two by three out from the bottom all

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.630 
the two by three out from the bottom all
right<00:00:19.810> y'all<00:00:20.770> now<00:00:20.950> from<00:00:21.189> one<00:00:21.340> end<00:00:21.490> to<00:00:21.550> the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
right y'all now from one end to the

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.429 
right y'all now from one end to the
other<00:00:21.759> two<00:00:22.090> by<00:00:22.240> threes<00:00:22.539> gone<00:00:23.250> see<00:00:24.250> that<00:00:25.349> and<00:00:26.349> it

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
other two by threes gone see that and it

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.900 
other two by threes gone see that and it
took<00:00:26.590> as<00:00:26.739> much<00:00:26.860> of<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.099> floor<00:00:27.400> where<00:00:27.669> they

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
took as much of the floor where they

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.229 
took as much of the floor where they
possibly<00:00:28.449> could<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:30.279> all<00:00:30.399> done<00:00:30.610> by<00:00:30.759> hand<00:00:30.790> so

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
possibly could it's all done by hand so

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.270 
possibly could it's all done by hand so
it's<00:00:31.360> not<00:00:31.509> that<00:00:31.570> easy<00:00:31.899> and<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:34.719> it<00:00:35.280> where's

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
it's not that easy and that's it where's

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.729 
it's not that easy and that's it where's
we<00:00:36.520> at<00:00:36.640> today<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.270> made<00:00:37.540> that<00:00:37.690> little<00:00:37.870> piece<00:00:38.200> of

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.290 

I<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:43.390> know<00:00:43.600> why<00:00:43.719> they<00:00:43.870> have<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.050> whole<00:00:44.260> done

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300

progress so I've added this now I'm
gonna<00:01:30.430> attempt<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.480> solder<00:01:32.260> this<00:01:32.500> as<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:33.070> can

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
gonna attempt to solder this as you can

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.940 
gonna attempt to solder this as you can
see<00:01:33.460> it's<00:01:33.610> kind<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.060> incomplete<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:34.990> I'm

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
see it's kind of incomplete and I'm

see it's kind of incomplete and I'm
trying<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.220> figure<00:01:36.370> out<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.550> way<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:37.330> solder<00:01:37.570> not

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
trying to figure out a way to solder not

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.750 
trying to figure out a way to solder not
corner<00:01:38.350> there<00:01:38.530> which<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.310> think<00:01:39.610> I'm<00:01:39.730> just

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
corner there which I think I'm just

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.640 
corner there which I think I'm just
gonna<00:01:40.000> end<00:01:40.300> up<00:01:40.600> cutting<00:01:40.780> two<00:01:41.080> by<00:01:41.230> three<00:01:41.530> inches

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
gonna end up cutting two by three inches

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.760 
gonna end up cutting two by three inches
sliding

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.390 

anyways

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
well there's my my first soldering looks

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.210 
well there's my my first soldering looks
clean<00:01:57.490> there's<00:01:58.490> my

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:45.450 

well<00:02:01.850> mines<00:02:02.210> proteins

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.580 

that<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.210> was<00:02:46.360> first<00:02:46.660> test<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.230> much<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.560> my

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that it was first test and much to my

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.780 
that it was first test and much to my
surprise<00:02:48.210> there's<00:02:49.210> no<00:02:49.390> leaks

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
surprise there's no leaks

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.240 
surprise there's no leaks
so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
so

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:22.790 
so
Dustin<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.240> was<00:02:55.230> no<00:02:55.410> leaks

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:39.410 

you

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:04:12.970 

you

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.620 

you

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.640 

that's<00:04:22.630> my<00:04:22.900> wiring<00:04:23.380> why<00:04:23.980> all<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.400> way<00:04:24.520> up<00:04:25.650> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
that's my wiring why all the way up that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.880 
that's my wiring why all the way up that
I'm<00:04:26.860> going<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.070> close<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:29.020> comes<00:04:29.290> right<00:04:29.680> around

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
I'm going to close it comes right around

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:37.530 
I'm going to close it comes right around
down<00:04:30.430> here<00:04:32.190> right<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.790> is<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:37.090> here's<00:04:37.360> the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
down here right that is it so here's the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.850 
down here right that is it so here's the
water<00:04:38.760> comes<00:04:39.760> down<00:04:39.910> from<00:04:40.090> there<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:41.410> basically

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
water comes down from there so basically

00:04:41.860 --> 00:05:24.770 
water comes down from there so basically
this<00:04:42.010> which<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.460> nice

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.360 

so<00:05:25.780> here<00:05:25.990> are<00:05:26.020> my<00:05:26.139> light<00:05:26.410> so<00:05:26.620> finally<00:05:26.919> decided

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
so here are my light so finally decided

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.309 
so here are my light so finally decided
on<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.580> placement<00:05:28.180> basically<00:05:28.780> what<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:28.960> did<00:05:29.080> is

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
on the placement basically what I did is

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.999 
on the placement basically what I did is
I<00:05:29.440> took<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:29.680> area<00:05:30.310> up<00:05:30.610> there<00:05:31.020> which<00:05:32.020> is<00:05:32.050> 58

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
I took the area up there which is 58

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.939 
I took the area up there which is 58
inches<00:05:33.460> from<00:05:33.699> 1<00:05:34.030> 2<00:05:34.360> by<00:05:34.539> 4<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.259> the<00:05:35.380> other<00:05:35.560> two<00:05:35.770> by

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
inches from 1 2 by 4 to the other two by

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.600 
inches from 1 2 by 4 to the other two by
four<00:05:36.280> and<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:37.900> said<00:05:38.410> okay<00:05:38.740> that's<00:05:38.919> one<00:05:39.250> square

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
four and I said okay that's one square

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.809 
four and I said okay that's one square
that's<00:05:40.419> the<00:05:40.630> other<00:05:40.720> square<00:05:41.199> so<00:05:41.530> we<00:05:41.680> have<00:05:41.830> 29

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
that's the other square so we have 29

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.510 
that's the other square so we have 29
inches<00:05:43.150> there<00:05:43.419> 29<00:05:44.020> inches<00:05:44.410> there<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.099> we<00:05:45.310> put

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
inches there 29 inches there so we put

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.450 
inches there 29 inches there so we put
out<00:05:45.639> 14<00:05:46.120> and<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.300> half<00:05:46.330> here<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:47.280> 14<00:05:48.280> and<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.430> half

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
out 14 and a half here and 14 and a half

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.409 
out 14 and a half here and 14 and a half
there<00:05:49.000> so<00:05:49.539> this<00:05:49.960> way<00:05:50.490> they<00:05:51.490> don't<00:05:51.520> appear<00:05:52.120> like

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
there so this way they don't appear like

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.879 
there so this way they don't appear like
they're<00:05:52.449> too<00:05:52.750> close<00:05:52.900> together<00:05:53.199> in<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.560> middle

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
they're too close together in the middle

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.149 
they're too close together in the middle
because<00:05:54.370> they're<00:05:54.669> actually<00:05:55.060> further<00:05:55.300> away

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
because they're actually further away

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:06.200 
because they're actually further away
see<00:05:57.159> you<00:05:57.280> bye<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.909> chow
