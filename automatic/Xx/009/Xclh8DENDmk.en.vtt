00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
some people would do it and we thought

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.360 
some people would do it and we thought
oh<00:02:27.870> maybe<00:02:28.260> three<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.650> four<00:02:28.920> hundred<00:02:29.069> people

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
oh maybe three or four hundred people

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.770 
oh maybe three or four hundred people
and<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.790> because<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.299> we<00:02:30.450> thought<00:02:30.569> we'll

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and so because of that we thought we'll

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.360 
and so because of that we thought we'll
give<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.079> name<00:02:31.230> we'll<00:02:31.590> call<00:02:31.739> if<00:02:32.280> you're
