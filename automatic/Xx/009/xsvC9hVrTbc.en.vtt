00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello everyone with you channel metagame this 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.040
 video we'll talk about how to counter 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.140
 the most popular leaders we need 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.509
 know how to resist the hero 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.189
 the enemy from the first levels we will consider 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.259
 strengths and weaknesses 5 heroes 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.330
 which can most often meet on 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.320
 center 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.419
 the first hero who most often 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.579
 will meet you at mid 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.439
 people pooj and now let's consider 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.509
 what he has strong and weak 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.160
 parties 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.200
 better this melee hero with very 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.090
 low armor and that means that his 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.090
 you can elementary zaharasit their 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.340
 ordinary attacks puja skills are not too 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.080
 effective at the beginning of the game for example the mouth 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.080
 will help only if you get a hook 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.790
 and he is quite short on the early levels 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.330
 one of the main advantages of pooja is his 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.520
 high is a large supply of health 2 + 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.110
 pooja is something that at the sixth level I 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.810
 procast can be fatal to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.400
 most heroes 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.450
 so imagine that you are on 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.310
 mide against puja 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.499
 from the first seconds you have to behave 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.689
 try to be as aggressive as possible 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.460
 make it so that each approximation 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.679
 creeps do not go unpunished 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.869
 armor pooja is so terrible that its not 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.579
 will save even his large number of hp and 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.069
 let it be very much sags under 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.200
 your usual attacks your home 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.149
 the task is to make it spend everything 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.490
 your heels and finished off as little as possible 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.439
 creeps it is important to understand that before the third 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.390
 level push almost nothing can us 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.369
 answer but after the third level 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.259
 stand against your husband is not so difficult 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.939
 all you need to remember is constantly 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.950
 stand behind the creeps 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.229
 so that the puja has no opportunity 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.119
 pull you a hook and to exclude everything 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.859
 possible accidents do not forget 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.109
 every two minutes watch the runes 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.389
 against the puja at the Foreign Ministry will be best 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:49.209
 stand rand heroes with escap for example 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:51.490
 clinkz pack or peace on they can easily 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:55.450
 wooing the puja and even falling under it 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.369
 Cook will still be able to escape another 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.079
 frequent guest on mid is this shadow find 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.539
 let's consider what he has 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.340
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.200
 one of the main minuses of sf 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.299
 he has a low survival rate 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.159
 a small amount of health and no 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.140
 escape or even children were to 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:13.540
 escape from the attack on the early levels 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.310
 Joseph is very low and only attack 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.960
 if he goes well, it will last 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.060
 the situation will improve despite not 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.430
 sf survival can quickly inflict 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.640
 huge amount of damage and kill you 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.500
 before you can finish him off 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.570
 if against you at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was csf 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.310
 the main task is to interfere at all costs 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.380
 he should cheer and denat creeps 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.870
 almost all heroes will have a basic attack 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.760
 above so fiercely echo for 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.160
 every creep you have to constantly 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.380
 harass sf with your tables or 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.990
 conventional attacks forcing him to retreat and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.030
 interfering with his farm range of shad attacks 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.260
 finder is 500 what is a hundred 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.360
 less than queen of pain 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.160
 or for now and that means they can 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.040
 put an extra pair on it 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.290
 shots but usually to level five y 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.330
 Joseph already appears serious attack and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.250
 good damage from shadow raise from this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.890
 the moment you need to be careful 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.080
 but his stock of life is still 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.030
 will not be big enough so sf 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.670
 may be seriously affected by any of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.470
 caster on mid against and seppo excellent 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.660
 stand for example templar assassin 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.160
 high damage from refraction will allow 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920
 easily zadenait many creeps and 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.330
 simultaneously harass sf with a flash drive also 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.500
 against him it would be nice to look 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.300
 hero with nukes for example queen of pain 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.370
 outworld devourer can be serious 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.130
 problem for many leaders but he has 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.450
 have their weaknesses 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.810
 a small attack range can easily 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.570
 to make 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.490
 adem target for harass but sixth 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.710
 water level does not have serious 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.230
 home spells and almost no 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.680
 can kill the enemy the main force of it 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.570
 aurora 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.520
 it is an opportunity to solve the Prague of intelligence 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.590
 so any hero who is addicted to 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.720
 your mana pool or any cost 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.820
 will be completely without help from him 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.980
 high base damage, which will be more 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.840
 above after several uses of the astral 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.540
 due to this he can easily railing 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.800
 shine many leaders 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.700
 against diva hurricanes for need 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.560
 special approach 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.210
 if it happened so that you play for 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.970
 the caster is waiting for you not the most pleasant 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.860
 the beginning of the game very soon you can 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.560
 will end mana therefore all that you 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.820
 it remains to fight hand to hand 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.440
 since most range heroes 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.720
 the attack range is higher then you will not be 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.780
 special problems shelling devourer a 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.020
 every time he suits the creeps 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.210
 ed 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.160
 this is one of the least aggressive leaders 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.410
 and to level six 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.220
 nothing to answer your attacks against de 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.230
 armed 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.120
 I fit the heroes with a big knife 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.490
 which does not depend on its mana pool 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.030
 for example, it could be a sniper or 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.010
 ruin 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:43.130
 these 2 heroes without any problems can 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.790
 spoil the devourer u life on mid queen 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.650
 of pain 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.770
 This is one of the very aggressive heroes. 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.510
 whom you will have to meet in mid 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.190
 the main minus of bedbugs is a small stock 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.320
 health while increasing strength for 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.120
 the level is also small so it can 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.910
 just don't survive long countries or 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.980
 strong prokast forte bedbugs 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.840
 this screams prince a small cool down and 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.660
 from which she can easily zaharasit 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.520
 you at the beginning of the game thanks to the pancake kuklin 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.350
 of paint there is excellent mobility 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.040
 which will help her for protection and for 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.960
 attacks against bedbugs you need 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.000
 keep your health high 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.520
 level especially as you approach 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.169
 cult with sonic wave ice cream of 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.030
 pain you can lose very quickly 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.520
 most of life therefore do not risk 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.110
 be in incomplete health for 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.860
 try to use this all the time 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.930
 tango 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.520
 to avoid trouble just 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.919
 try to keep your distance 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.080
 because I'm scream of pain you have 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.940
 short range kill 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.830
 queen of pain is not easy but there is 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.260
 heroes who can badly spoil her 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.330
 life against quaben media is good 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.120
 show themselves heroes such as the silencer and 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.220
 pack first any salon will do 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.190
 to-ass completely helpless and depriving her 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.990
 damage and Blinka and secondly these heroes 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.650
 there are houses more often from dust which are very 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.210
 Knop quickly leave because health and 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.669
 finally another popular mider 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.220
 invoker this hero can meet us 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.530
 two different builds 1 through max class a 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.740
 second there'd max exort now we 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.270
 consider the pros and cons of each build 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.540
 one of the serious disadvantages of the invoker 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.700
 this is a basic movespeed 280 spell power 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.380
 invoker depends on its level therefore 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.930
 in the early stages he is not too 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.610
 strong invoker castes through exort no 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.340
 will have strong children bloom 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.440
 so you can easily get away from it 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.450
 invoker through class will have low 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.340
 basic damage so at the beginning of the game its 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.010
 it will be easy to get around the palace hit medina 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.780
 im invoker with pumped exor there will be 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.640
 possess a very high such due 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.220
 This he can strongly harass you or 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.160
 zadenit most of the creeps exort you 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.230
 invoker from level 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.240
 will have nonweak castes which if 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.580
 being careless can easily kill you 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.860
 Coldsnap is a very dangerous weapon for 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.370
 build class which combines these 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.410
 sable 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.360
 and not a little damage invoker with 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.190
 pumped class has high efficiency 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.130
 Origen we will be very difficult 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.230
 you don't have to wake up against him 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.640
 engage in lengthy skirmish with him 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.250
 little from the floor that can instantly 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.250
 cause damage but let's say hitting meteor 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.330
 or cold days you obviously will not be good 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.920
 so you need to keep all the time 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.780
 safe distance 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.550
 shoot with invoker am usual 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.500
 attacks will not be a good choice either 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.960
 because or his attacks will be stronger 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.480
 or he can easily from riga nica due 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.430
 class if invoker on mid uses 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.410
 cold snaps the most important thing does not fall
