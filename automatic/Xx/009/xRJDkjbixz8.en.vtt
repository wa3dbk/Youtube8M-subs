00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi to all this is the room in this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 video I'm going to present you a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.299
 hysterical who appeared to me as a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 evidence 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.950
 the day before yesterday so I was trying to 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.389
 beat and I told myself why all 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 the players do not attack me at the same 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.969
 time finally at least 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.890
 why do not all NPCs attack me 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.770
 at the same time and that's where I got 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.300
 remembered some documentaries that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.369
 I had seen about fighting in the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 cinema is actually I realized 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.050
 account that there too there was a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.689
 reference to cinema then in gta 5 which 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.420
 has a lot of references to the real world 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.790
 whether it is the cinema that it is by 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.260
 compared to famous people that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 whether in relation to events that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.640
 are happening in real life just 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 to have seen my playlist 10 rules 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.760
 in the description of all my videos 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 to understand a little all these 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.039
 references who has in gta 5 and who have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 a link with real life so here I 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.829
 am showing you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.420
 fight scenes so there for now 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.829
 the guy is alone so that we 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.750
 not interested we'll wait until it's 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 no rapplique and in fact you go 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 see that when his mates will bring back 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.840
 there is still only one guy who 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.430
 attack me at once so there as you 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.290
 see I get attacked but 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.240
 only by him while there is his 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.790
 buddy behind who are watching me and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.299
 yet he does not intervene but it is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.950
 not finished 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.549
 there are other mates to them who are going 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.439
 get here and look at the guy in 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.420
 glass it does the same thing that is to say 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.710
 that revolves around without attacking and in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 do that it's a fighting technique 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.299
 used in the cinema it's like that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.439
 that they proceed in the cinema so I 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.240
 put you in the description of the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.009
 video a link that you can go 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.250
 look then on this link this is a 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.040
 documentary by jackie chan inevitably 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.329
 fight movie had to find a guy 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.159
 who fights a lot in his films then 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.320
 12 minutes 10 to 12 minutes 35 on 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.090
 injects string that speaks briefly of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.310
 this combat technique and 12 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 minutes 35 to 12 minutes 48 is a small 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.149
 demonstration in a movie where his 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 fighting techniques it is used 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.490
 so the combat technique that consists 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.799
 actually to attack each one their turn for 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.439
 not just the fighter 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.969
 principal is overflowed and for that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.649
 good weather too and for the fight 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.450
 lasts longer then it's a 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.610
 technique that is used in 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.140
 a lot of movies that's part of it 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.670
 of cinema that's how it is 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.970
 known in the cinema 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.890
 rockstar used 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.570
 this technique in the game so that's 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.430
 not for us to be in order not to be 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.530
 to overflow precisely it's really for 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.270
 to redo exactly as in the cinema 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.980
 and here again it makes us good 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.450
 reference a historic leap that was 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.430
 there from the beginning but it was necessary 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.690
 notice that's it for this video and 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.320
 I tell you just now 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.320
 ciao
