 computer and with 500 five hundred hd 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:25.060
 1.6 ghz processor 2 gb of ram is not 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.190
 a super machine but because I do 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.440
 who likes audio and who is 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.110
 starting the same I can already do 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:39.210
 enough thing is that I have in the covers 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:44.740
 and a guitar and fender telecaster guitar 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.470
 a nylon acoustic fox pickup guitar 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.920
 letter ne 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.040
 and how it works here it all 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.960
 how do I get the audio out on my 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.470
 boxes is a question I had 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.090
 I soon started with those with this 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.100
 recording business I had a lot of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.310
 I'm going to explain to you how it is 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.259
 that works all this here then I 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 I showed I have my audio card 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:17.319
 alsea 202 is behind the pc of the monitor 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:23.980
 and my table here how this 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:27.220
 that it has an input and output that 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.620
 and if that's what this is the input and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.390
 This is the type ç 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.890
 she has a pre amp here is not the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:45.459
 better but you can record until you have a 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:54.579
 only channel with a volume that takes the pan 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:57.250
 average degree is cool because she has 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:02.950
 these two little button here for you 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.440
 to mute the phone or asp asia 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.670
 I have the volume of the headphones and that I 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.040
 I have the overall volume overall 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.750
 then as I do to work it 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:24.459
 I have two cables here, right? 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:32.889
 then these are here in my entry 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:36.849
 table that I'm going to call my 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.220
 audio card of the Ceará there 202 of 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.280
 America 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:49.780
 then I picked up the entrance of the sea that 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:52.449
 connectu no type ç on my desk no 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.780
 repeating I leave the input between the 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:04:03.459
 table output board noteput i 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.310
 I go into a boost of the audio card 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.669
 then this is the most basic connection and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.010
 We can do as I do. 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.859
 face to leave my party 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.010
 monitors here you can see that they 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:20.840
 are active I also have a medium 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.060
 record the volume 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.330
 so how do I need to get done? 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:32.150
 connection with the RC cables here. 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.040
 I have to leave the table, which is better. 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.600
 she leaves the UN 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.500
 that's why I have to use two 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.780
 cables here then what I do 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.120
 done that I get those two rc cables 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.350
 in here because I have two exits here 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.510
 huh 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.400
 if it works or connect only one 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.500
 cinema leaving here will not work 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.940
 because it's good, it has to go out stereo 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.860
 so I have to connect the two to 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.410
 make the sound out stereo 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:04.560
 So I'll get these two cables from here. 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:11.790
 I go out with them here and I'm going to 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:17.130
 my audio monitor that just easy 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:21.300

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.810
