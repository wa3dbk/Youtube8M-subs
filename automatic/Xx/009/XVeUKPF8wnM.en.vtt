 incredibly natural 2 the court that is what first has to do with 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.850
 the prosthesis 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.040
 because to be a link in them was that you do not notice a step of the hair

 the order or with the blond shoulder this is commissioned by the united states where are the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.909
 worst of all is percent of systems on demand we first make a 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.950
 previous study where are we going to 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.840
 so in a mold of what is the area that we populate from there we go to

 total sum of 600 euros limit 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.489
 and even for partial systems we would be talking about 350 the skill 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.640
 we are managing a ratio is from 6 to 8 months with what 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.760
