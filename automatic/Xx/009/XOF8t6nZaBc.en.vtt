00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230

 tell me which is which one we are going 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.530
 let's try the three 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.139
 what happens 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.400
 but I do not understand you I'm giving you go 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 to accept cocacola 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.669
 tell me which is which 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.650
 so if you do not want to collaborate hello 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.650
 my name is cherry hello handsome hello 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 obsessed hello guys to the girls that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 such wind I hope and if it does not happen because 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.420
 Today I'm going to cheer you up a lot 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.460
 time I'm going to talk about some curves tails 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.010
 somewhat different from varied flavors 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.199
 but alone and talk I will never look 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 the design of the data neither is not anymore I do not 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.320
 I finished believing that there are many 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.000
 you surely already know them 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.350
 you have even tried them but others 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.420
 many, that's not why I 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.160
 I make this video to tell you that there are 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.769
 and that you can see them you can buy them 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.420
 you can inflate them to drink with trees 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.570
 we understand with this coca cola is the 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.270
 classic is not the classic one of es mora 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.070
 if you put Coca-Cola here in support mode 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.340
 I did not buy it one day 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.710
 once I went to Africa by the way to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.190
 those who say that it tastes different is not 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.430
 is exactly the same only in version 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.080
 African Muslim Israeli or whatever 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.270
 no difference with the coca-cola 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.640
 normal and the other day shopping horse 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.860
 and such and suddenly I found some like 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.380
 those who had never approved these 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.330
 two vanilla coke and the cherry 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.940
 As soon as they buy them, I do not 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.950
 I could resist trying some from 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.530
 record and I tried the vanilla had 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.200
 thought of the blog of seeing me both and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.360
 compare them with the normal one but I tried the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.190
 of vanilla and enami liked for nothing of 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.259
 police that had very little gas and is more 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.090
 it still smells like vanilla so why 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.039
 please do not make me drink me another hour 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.990
 because it really is who's endured 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.820
 and now the cherry scared me to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.310
 prove it would not be that I do not 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.350
 like it and that I did not see another one in the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.180
 block party so it would be like an uncle 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.009
 you're talking about the wave and we do not see you 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.780
 try either of the two then it's 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.640
 I was reluctant to try it 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.190
 to all this they come in boxes normally 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.160
 of 12 imported eggs all from china 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.920
 but let's try this one since it 's already 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.200
 I've tried and I've told you for years 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.790
 it has more gas 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.860
 good is the sound seemed at least 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.540
 that had some gauze that the other is 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.510
 it smells it looks like it smells more 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.819
 refreshing more fruity than the other 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.580
 logical is cherry I guess very beige 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.050
 that is very hot spicy nothing else 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.760
 like baby is telling you that 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.200
 It is also cool to get the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.200
 verb we are not going to try the vegetable 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.980
 I do not know what to tell you so good I like it 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.980
 a really tasty and sweet taste 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.500
 when it 's bad but honestly if 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.269
 I had to choose, I would follow 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.890
 being with the traditional coca-cola 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.709
 more than anything because this is not coca-cola 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.040
 it's like plum or cherry syrup 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.230
 although I do not know but they have added that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.760
 I do not know, it does not convince me, it's really not 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.530
 I'm going to say do not try it, try it 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.689
 in life you have to try everything good 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.060
 of almost everything but really not me 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.090
 convince now we're not going to throw it either 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.720
 do not 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.280
 will have to finish determined is but 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.840
 well I'm staying here taking a doctor 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.760
 which tail I hope you have moored and that 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.769
 you have discovered a new can of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.810
 coca-cola if I did not know it and truth every 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.910
 day brings some things more jets I do not know 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.410
 how will this end but good of 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.239
 true if you liked the cream the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 coca-cola or whatever it is to like 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.099
 If you have any questions as where 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.140
 I have caught or how can you buy them or what 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.319
 that is left in the comments and nothing 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.810
 See you in the next video 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.879
 I wanted to describe the video I'm pulling 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.879
 taking with a ball but kidding
