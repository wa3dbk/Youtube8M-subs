Senate<00:01:57.959> which<00:01:58.679> you<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> make<00:01:59.369> sure<00:01:59.399> you

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
kill first because otherwise it'll just

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.279 
kill first because otherwise it'll just
resurrect<00:02:02.639> the<00:02:02.849> other<00:02:02.999> things<00:02:03.329> over<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:04.109> over

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
resurrect the other things over and over

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.469 
resurrect the other things over and over
and<00:02:04.560> over<00:02:04.679> again<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:06.179> also<00:02:06.359> it<00:02:08.149> it's<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.270> boss

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
and over again and also it it's a boss

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.830

so<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.220> chance<00:02:11.549> of<00:02:11.670> getting<00:02:11.840> its

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so you have a chance of getting its

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.400 
so you have a chance of getting its
unique<00:02:13.230> item<00:02:13.530> drops<00:02:13.829> like<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.310> did

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
unique item drops like I just did

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.339 
unique item drops like I just did
and<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.280> died<00:02:17.520> like<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.090> said<00:02:18.300> dying<00:02:18.959> not<00:02:19.319> a

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
and I just died like I said dying not a

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.100 
and I just died like I said dying not a
big<00:02:19.560> problem<00:02:19.739> because<00:02:20.540> your<00:02:21.540> teammates<00:02:21.900> can

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
big problem because your teammates can

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
big problem because your teammates can
resurrect<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.920> also<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:24.120> sure<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.360> use

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
resurrect you and also be sure to use

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.229 
resurrect you and also be sure to use
skill<00:02:24.959> number<00:02:25.080> seven<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.620> resurrect<00:02:26.010> them

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
skill number seven to resurrect them

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.760 
skill number seven to resurrect them
otherwise<00:02:27.239> your<00:02:27.599> team<00:02:27.959> will<00:02:28.110> wipe<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.680> it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
otherwise your team will wipe and it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.800 
otherwise your team will wipe and it
will<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.640> much<00:02:29.819> harder<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.239> get<00:02:30.330> back<00:02:30.569> to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
will be that much harder to get back to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.170 
will be that much harder to get back to
the<00:02:30.900> spot<00:02:31.140> you're<00:02:31.170> at<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:32.670> accidentally

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the spot you're at and I accidentally

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.870 
the spot you're at and I accidentally
ran<00:02:33.390> past<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.900> group<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.380> shambling<00:02:34.920> which

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
ran past the group of shambling which

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.240 
ran past the group of shambling which
you<00:02:36.180> should<00:02:36.360> probably<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.800> learn<00:02:38.069> by

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
you should probably not do like learn by

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850 
you should probably not do like learn by
my<00:02:38.430> example<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.690> watching<00:02:40.470> my<00:02:40.620> team

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
my example and what and watching my team

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.220 
my example and what and watching my team
die<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.700> know<00:02:41.880> not<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:45.230> pretty

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
die so that you know not to do it pretty

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.550 
die so that you know not to do it pretty
much<00:02:46.549> just<00:02:47.549> same<00:02:48.239> strategy<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:48.750> always<00:02:49.230> monk

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
much just same strategy as always monk

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.740 
much just same strategy as always monk
first<00:02:49.860> Mesmer<00:02:50.310> second<00:02:50.760> then<00:02:51.090> everything<00:02:51.660> else

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
first Mesmer second then everything else

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.440 
first Mesmer second then everything else
goes<00:02:52.049> really<00:02:52.319> smooth<00:02:52.910> after<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.000> fight<00:02:54.209> I'll

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
goes really smooth after the fight I'll

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.690 
goes really smooth after the fight I'll
bring<00:02:54.630> up<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:54.989> mini<00:02:55.200> map<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.709> y'all<00:02:56.670> can

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
bring up my mini map so that y'all can

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.410 
bring up my mini map so that y'all can
see<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:58.590> path<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:59.010> took<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.519> that's<00:03:00.180> pretty

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
see the path I took and that's pretty

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.970 
see the path I took and that's pretty
much<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> groups<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.349> can<00:03:01.380> kill<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
much all of the groups you can kill and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.090 
much all of the groups you can kill and
good<00:03:02.549> luck<00:03:02.670> farming
