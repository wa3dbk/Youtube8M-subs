00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.430 
objects let them have it it's like these
scarecrows<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:11.360> hmm<00:01:12.360> yes

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.660 

fortunately<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.680> Scarecrow's<00:01:19.159> don't<00:01:19.430> really

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
fortunately the Scarecrow's don't really

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.219 
fortunately the Scarecrow's don't really
get<00:01:19.790> any<00:01:19.970> harder<00:01:20.210> as<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.570> lump<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:20.960> progress

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
get any harder as the lump is progress

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.380 
get any harder as the lump is progress
this<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.190> about<00:01:22.400> as<00:01:22.550> much<00:01:22.700> as<00:01:22.880> they<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.180> to

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
this is about as much as they have to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.300 
this is about as much as they have to
offer<00:01:23.590> by<00:01:24.590> themselves<00:01:25.130> anyway<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.530> think<00:01:27.830> I

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
offer by themselves anyway so I think I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.219 
offer by themselves anyway so I think I
think<00:01:28.909> because<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.450> getting<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:30.140> many

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
think because of getting so many

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.080 
think because of getting so many
scarecrows<00:01:30.800> near<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.100> beginning<00:01:31.220> getting<00:01:32.060> a

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
scarecrows near the beginning getting a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.480 
scarecrows near the beginning getting a
little<00:01:32.210> bit<00:01:32.390> overconfident<00:01:33.160> and<00:01:34.160> that<00:01:34.340> is

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
little bit overconfident and that is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.510
