00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is going to drop a hide belt and then it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
is going to drop a hide belt and then it
takes<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.250> look<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.790> magic<00:01:27.180> fine

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
takes a look at your magic fine

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.390 
takes a look at your magic fine
percentage<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.560> determines<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
percentage and that determines the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
percentage and that determines the
likelihood<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.390> high<00:01:30.630> belt<00:01:30.960> will

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
likelihood that this high belt will

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.980 
likelihood that this high belt will
actually<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:32.000> magical<00:01:33.000> instead<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
actually be magical instead of just the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.280 
actually be magical instead of just the
regular<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> found<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.960> rare<00:01:36.960> or

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
regular one that I found or rare or

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.580 
regular one that I found or rare or
after<00:01:37.920> retail<00:01:38.280> launch<00:01:38.579> set<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> legendary<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
after retail launch set and legendary so

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.940 
after retail launch set and legendary so
I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.759> pretty<00:01:41.909> obvious<00:01:42.030> why<00:01:42.950> focusing

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I think it's pretty obvious why focusing

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.639 
I think it's pretty obvious why focusing
on<00:01:44.100> magic<00:01:44.520> find<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.060> always<00:01:45.479> having<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:46.049> decent

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
on magic find and always having a decent

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.880 
on magic find and always having a decent
amount<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.159> magic<00:01:47.490> find<00:01:47.790> equipped<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.890> very

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
amount of magic find equipped is very

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.190 
amount of magic find equipped is very
important<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.460> playing<00:01:50.729> through<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> game

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
important when playing through the game

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.560 
important when playing through the game
especially<00:01:52.200> during<00:01:52.740> boss<00:01:53.369> kills<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:54.420> killing

beta is in the weeping hollow there's a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.850 
beta is in the weeping hollow there's a
chance<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.269> den<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.079> Fallen<00:03:13.650> will

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
chance that the den of the Fallen will

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.520 
chance that the den of the Fallen will

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
spawn in the weeping hollow whenever you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.120 
spawn in the weeping hollow whenever you
find<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:17.160> sub<00:03:18.000> zone<00:03:18.329> all<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:19.260> monsters<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
find a sub zone all the monsters in that

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.740 
find a sub zone all the monsters in that
subzone<00:03:20.700> are<00:03:20.970> going<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> higher

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
subzone are going to have a higher

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.600 
subzone are going to have a higher
monster<00:03:22.260> level<00:03:22.650> than<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.920> monsters<00:03:23.400> on<00:03:23.519> the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
monster level than the monsters on the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.850 
monster level than the monsters on the
surface<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.390> often<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.900> good<00:03:24.930> idea<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
surface so it's often a good idea to

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.750 
surface so it's often a good idea to
clear<00:03:26.130> out<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.310> sub<00:03:26.730> zone<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.560> collect<00:03:28.760> that

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
clear out that sub zone and collect that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.300 
clear out that sub zone and collect that
is<00:03:29.940> no<00:03:30.269> potentially<00:03:30.900> much<00:03:31.590> higher<00:03:31.829> level<00:03:31.860> than

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
is no potentially much higher level than

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.160 
is no potentially much higher level than
you<00:03:32.730> know<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.239> you've<00:03:33.390> been<00:03:33.420> gathering

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
you know what you've been gathering

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.440 
you know what you've been gathering
regularly<00:03:34.829> there's<00:03:35.280> also<00:03:35.459> often<00:03:36.030> rare

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
regularly there's also often rare

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.720 
regularly there's also often rare
monsters<00:03:36.989> down<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.680> champions<00:03:38.579> as

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
monsters down there and champions as

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.009 
monsters down there and champions as
well<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.060> champions<00:03:39.450> are<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.630> ones<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.870> are

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
well the champions are the ones that are

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:40.309 
well the champions are the ones that are
high

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
high

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.410 
high
in<00:03:40.650> yellow<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.159> so<00:03:41.579> those<00:03:41.700> monsters<00:03:42.120> actually

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
in yellow and so those monsters actually

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.239 
in yellow and so those monsters actually
haven't<00:03:42.659> even<00:03:42.689> a<00:03:42.870> higher<00:03:43.079> chance<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.620> dropping

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.379 
just sitting back and play more casual
and<00:05:25.199> keeping<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.979> high<00:05:26.400> magic<00:05:26.849> fighting<00:05:27.150> score

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
and keeping a high magic fighting score

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.909 
and keeping a high magic fighting score
and<00:05:27.509> kind<00:05:27.689> of<00:05:27.719> leeching<00:05:28.110> off<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:28.379> other<00:05:28.530> party

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
and kind of leeching off the other party

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.290 
and kind of leeching off the other party
members<00:05:28.949> that<00:05:29.460> maybe<00:05:29.639> don't<00:05:29.849> have<00:05:30.090> as<00:05:30.180> much

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
members that maybe don't have as much

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.390 
members that maybe don't have as much
magic<00:05:30.509> fine<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.139> thus<00:05:31.379> they're<00:05:31.889> doing<00:05:32.250> more

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
magic fine and thus they're doing more

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.040 
magic fine and thus they're doing more
damage<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:32.879> there's<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.090> lot<00:05:33.240> of<00:05:33.270> drama<00:05:33.659> sort<00:05:33.990> of

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
damage so there's a lot of drama sort of

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.110 
damage so there's a lot of drama sort of
around<00:05:34.289> that<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:34.949> that<00:05:35.400> a<00:05:35.430> good<00:05:35.639> idea<00:05:35.699> or

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
around that and is that a good idea or

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.360 
around that and is that a good idea or
should<00:05:36.750> Blizzard<00:05:37.110> maybe<00:05:37.289> average<00:05:37.740> out<00:05:37.919> magic

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
should Blizzard maybe average out magic

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.850 
should Blizzard maybe average out magic
find<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.909> have<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:39.479> apply<00:05:39.750> towards<00:05:40.349> more

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
find and have it apply towards more

members<00:05:41.219> of<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.400> party<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:42.419> mean<00:05:42.780> that's<00:05:42.870> up<00:05:43.080> to

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
members of the party I mean that's up to

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.110 
members of the party I mean that's up to
debate<00:05:43.500> but<00:05:43.710> certainly<00:05:44.250> something<00:05:44.550> important

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
debate but certainly something important

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.510 
debate but certainly something important
to<00:05:45.210> keep<00:05:45.360> in<00:05:45.479> mind<00:05:45.539> how<00:05:46.319> it<00:05:46.740> can<00:05:46.949> be<00:05:47.099> a<00:05:47.129> little

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
to keep in mind how it can be a little

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.999 
to keep in mind how it can be a little
bit<00:05:47.699> unfair<00:05:48.090> during<00:05:48.539> co-op<00:05:48.900> play<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.830> have<00:05:49.979> a

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
bit unfair during co-op play to have a

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.010 
bit unfair during co-op play to have a
whole<00:05:50.219> bunch<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.490> magic<00:05:50.819> find<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.389> let<00:05:51.779> the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
whole bunch of magic find and let the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.559 
whole bunch of magic find and let the
rest<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.500> your<00:05:52.590> party<00:05:52.800> members<00:05:53.090> deal<00:05:54.090> most<00:05:54.360> of

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
rest of your party members deal most of

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.230 
rest of your party members deal most of
the<00:05:54.629> damage<00:05:55.460> so<00:05:56.460> now<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:56.729> I<00:05:56.819> think<00:05:56.939> you<00:05:57.120> guys

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
the damage so now that I think you guys

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.330 
the damage so now that I think you guys
have<00:05:57.419> a<00:05:57.449> better<00:05:57.659> sense<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.139> how<00:05:58.439> exactly<00:05:58.949> magic

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
have a better sense of how exactly magic

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.610 
have a better sense of how exactly magic
find<00:05:59.580> works<00:05:59.909> and<00:06:00.180> of<00:06:00.719> course<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.169> importance

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
find works and of course the importance

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.820 
find works and of course the importance
of<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.979> way<00:06:02.370> into<00:06:02.759> the<00:06:02.879> late<00:06:03.060> game<00:06:03.360> I<00:06:03.830> think

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
of it way into the late game I think

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.740 
of it way into the late game I think
that<00:06:05.460> we're<00:06:05.610> just<00:06:05.729> going<00:06:05.909> to<00:06:06.000> cut<00:06:06.479> off<00:06:06.509> this

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
that we're just going to cut off this

long they don't require a huge amount of
explanation<00:06:15.210> but<00:06:15.779> they<00:06:15.960> are<00:06:16.169> important
