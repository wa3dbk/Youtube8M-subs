something I did earlier where I've got
to<00:00:08.550> v1<00:00:09.420> Hexbug<00:00:10.050> nanos<00:00:10.469> running<00:00:10.980> around<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
to v1 Hexbug nanos running around the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.789 
to v1 Hexbug nanos running around the
track<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.420> can<00:00:12.480> see<00:00:12.570> I've<00:00:13.259> got<00:00:13.530> here

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.080 
track and as you can see I've got here
some<00:00:14.519> v2<00:00:15.590> vertical<00:00:16.590> track<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:17.940> you'll

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
some v2 vertical track and what you'll

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.560 
some v2 vertical track and what you'll
see<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.600> when<00:00:18.990> these<00:00:19.140> v1<00:00:19.980> nano<00:00:20.670> bugs<00:00:20.939> get<00:00:21.240> stuck

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
see is when these v1 nano bugs get stuck

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.800 
see is when these v1 nano bugs get stuck
from<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.140> bottom<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.070> tube<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.090> would

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
from the bottom of the tube I would

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
from the bottom of the tube I would
encourage<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> blue<00:00:25.380> guy<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.130> so

section<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.549> track<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> hardest

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
section of track this is the hardest

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.859 
section of track this is the hardest
part<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.770> climb<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.700> okay<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.299> say<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
part the climb now okay I say this is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
part the climb now okay I say this is
the<00:01:30.960> hardest<00:01:31.259> part<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.560> climb<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the hardest part of climb it is in this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
the hardest part of climb it is in this
of<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.210> certainly<00:01:33.630> would<00:01:33.869> not<00:01:34.079> expect<00:01:34.619> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
of it I certainly would not expect this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
of it I certainly would not expect this
to<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:35.189> through<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.030> twister

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to work through a twister

to work through a twister
the<00:01:37.369> track<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:39.030> comes<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> v2<00:01:40.009> bugs

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the track that comes with the v2 bugs

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.800 
the track that comes with the v2 bugs
where<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.520> actually<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:41.970> around<00:01:42.030> 180

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
where they actually go around 180

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.460 
where they actually go around 180
degrees<00:01:43.790> within<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.909> single<00:01:45.570> same<00:01:45.930> section<00:01:46.320> I'm

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
degrees within a single same section I'm

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.609 
degrees within a single same section I'm
gonna<00:01:46.590> send<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.830> one<00:01:46.860> more<00:01:47.780> v2<00:01:48.780> bug<00:01:49.200> because

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
gonna send up one more v2 bug because

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
gonna send up one more v2 bug because
they<00:01:50.280> almost<00:01:50.490> stalled<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.450> need<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
they almost stalled here they need a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.460 
they almost stalled here they need a
little<00:01:51.840> bit<00:01:51.990> more<00:01:52.170> welly<00:01:52.789> to<00:01:53.789> bridge<00:01:54.000> them

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
little bit more welly to bridge them

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.870 
little bit more welly to bridge them
okay<00:01:55.470> they're<00:01:55.649> nearly<00:01:55.979> completed<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.580> the
