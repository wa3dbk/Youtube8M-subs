00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
last through them magnetic lasso tool if

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.770 
last through them magnetic lasso tool if
you<00:01:51.840> change<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.289> to<00:01:52.349> the<00:01:52.649> UM<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> middle<00:01:53.340> one

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
you change it to the UM the middle one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.520 
you change it to the UM the middle one
if<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.079> start<00:01:55.920> from<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.659> our-our<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.319> image

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
if I start from the our-our of the image

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.309 
if I start from the our-our of the image
so<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.640> doesn't<00:01:59.939> mean<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.239> you<00:02:00.539> touch<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.289> or

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
so it doesn't mean right you touch it or

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:08.210 
so it doesn't mean right you touch it or
not<00:02:05.390> because<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.539> black<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:07.049> over<00:02:07.679> there<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
not because it's black up over there it

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.819 
not because it's black up over there it
does<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> Rhema<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.200> when<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.530> gets<00:02:10.590> about

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
does a Rhema so but when it gets about

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:19.010 
does a Rhema so but when it gets about
this<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.519> need<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.819> quite<00:02:12.090> careful

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.320 

so<00:02:19.680> once<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.560> get<00:02:22.770> way<00:02:22.950> around<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.490> crazy

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
so once you do get way around a crazy

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:34.730 
so once you do get way around a crazy
show<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.020> finish<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.410> off

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.610 

not<00:02:35.310> too<00:02:35.670> long<00:02:37.340> all<00:02:38.340> right

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
not too long all right

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.650 
not too long all right
like<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.800> said<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.460> do<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.730> from<00:02:41.880> outside<00:02:42.240> of

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
like I said if you do it from outside of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
like I said if you do it from outside of
the<00:02:42.750> image<00:02:42.960> on<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:43.410> dark<00:02:43.740> gray<00:02:45.680> sometimes

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the image on to this dark gray sometimes

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.220 
the image on to this dark gray sometimes
it<00:02:46.920> might<00:02:47.190> not<00:02:47.400> let<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.760> copy<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.780> paste<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
it might not let you copy and paste it

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.650 
it might not let you copy and paste it
but<00:02:50.130> if<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.580> rent<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.150> should<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.390> flashing

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
but if you rent it should be flashing

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.630 
but if you rent it should be flashing
but<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.320> done<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.680> already<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.520> way

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
but just done that already all the way

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.390 
but just done that already all the way
around<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:55.530> own<00:02:55.920> today<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.220> can<00:02:56.370> copier

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
around so I own today I can copier

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.310 
around so I own today I can copier
if<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.550> don't<00:03:00.150> edit<00:03:00.500> copy<00:03:01.500> merged<00:03:02.840> make<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> new

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
if you don't edit copy merged make a new

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.970 
if you don't edit copy merged make a new
layer

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.380
