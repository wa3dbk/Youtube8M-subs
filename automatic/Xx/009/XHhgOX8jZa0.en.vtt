cubbyhole doesn't have to be a wall you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.669 
cubbyhole doesn't have to be a wall you
can<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> ceiling<00:00:31.140> form<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
can do this with the ceiling form the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.950 
can do this with the ceiling form the
choice<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.160> yours<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.780> power
