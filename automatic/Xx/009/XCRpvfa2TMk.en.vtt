00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.720 

now<00:00:00.690> we'll<00:00:00.900> talk<00:00:01.020> about<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.589> briefly<00:00:02.550> of

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
now we'll talk about the briefly of

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.610 
now we'll talk about the briefly of
course<00:00:02.939> about<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.389> origins<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:03.990> mechanical

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
course about the origins of mechanical

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.260 
course about the origins of mechanical
timekeeping<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.490> we're<00:00:05.879> talking<00:00:06.180> about

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
timekeeping and we're talking about

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.530 
timekeeping and we're talking about
clocks<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.930> tick<00:00:07.340> they<00:00:08.340> figure<00:00:08.760> beckon

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
clocks that tick they figure beckon

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.350 
clocks that tick they figure beckon
maybe<00:00:09.929> early<00:00:10.920> Italy<00:00:11.400> 11th<00:00:11.820> 12th<00:00:12.030> century<00:00:12.950> the

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
maybe early Italy 11th 12th century the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.019 
maybe early Italy 11th 12th century the
mechanical<00:00:15.360> timekeeper<00:00:15.929> probably<00:00:16.320> began<00:00:16.619> in

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
mechanical timekeeper probably began in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.269 
mechanical timekeeper probably began in
monastery<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.170> may<00:00:19.320> know<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
monastery as you may know that the the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.880 
monastery as you may know that the the
monks<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.850> time<00:00:21.090> felt<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.890> concerned

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
monks at that time felt very concerned

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.189 
monks at that time felt very concerned
about<00:00:23.039> praying<00:00:23.609> frequently<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> praying<00:00:25.019> at

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
about praying frequently and praying at

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.060 
about praying frequently and praying at
the<00:00:25.320> right<00:00:25.500> time

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the right time

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.700 
the right time
and<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.550> often<00:00:26.699> required<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.449> monk<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.930> stay<00:00:28.529> up

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
and it often required a monk to stay up

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.259 
and it often required a monk to stay up
all<00:00:28.890> night<00:00:28.920> perhaps<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.730> his<00:00:29.849> candle

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
all night perhaps with his candle

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.089 
all night perhaps with his candle
burning<00:00:30.449> down<00:00:30.750> or<00:00:31.050> other<00:00:31.470> methods<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.949> we

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
burning down or other methods that we

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.060 
burning down or other methods that we
talked<00:00:32.369> about<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.750> ring<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> bell<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
talked about to ring the bell at a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
talked about to ring the bell at a
certain<00:00:35.399> time<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> monks<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:36.780> get

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
certain time so that the monks would get

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.410 
certain time so that the monks would get
up<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.260> pray<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.850> some<00:00:39.059> beginning

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
up and pray but there was some beginning

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
up and pray but there was some beginning
of<00:00:39.540> understanding<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> gearing<00:00:40.559> even<00:00:41.040> going

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
of understanding of gearing even going

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.740 
of understanding of gearing even going
back<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> Greek<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.420> knew<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
back to the Greek so they knew that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.100 
back to the Greek so they knew that
there<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.079> some<00:00:43.829> ability<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.960> perhaps

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
there was some ability to do to perhaps

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
there was some ability to do to perhaps
use<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.500> machine<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.190> tell<00:00:47.219> time<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.030> could

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
use a machine to tell time if they could

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.740 
use a machine to tell time if they could
the<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:50.579> earliest<00:00:51.000> form<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.480> timekeeping

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the the earliest form of timekeeping

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
the the earliest form of timekeeping
machine<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> little<00:00:53.579> model<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
machine and I have a little model of it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.760 
machine and I have a little model of it
here<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> basically<00:00:56.489> again<00:00:56.789> gears<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
here this is basically again gears that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
here this is basically again gears that
of<00:00:58.770> course<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> original<00:01:00.239> days<00:01:00.449> would

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of course in the original days would

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.590 
of course in the original days would
have<00:01:00.780> been<00:01:00.930> huge<00:01:01.199> probably<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.219> tower<00:01:02.600> but

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
have been huge probably in a tower but

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.609 
have been huge probably in a tower but
it<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.960> been<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> type<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
it would have been this type of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.920 
it would have been this type of
mechanism<00:01:05.309> called<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> folio<00:01:06.119> whether<00:01:06.780> it's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
mechanism called a folio whether it's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
mechanism called a folio whether it's
actually<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> rod<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:08.310> being<00:01:08.820> kicked<00:01:09.119> back

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
actually a rod that's being kicked back

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
actually a rod that's being kicked back
and<00:01:09.540> forth<00:01:09.780> by<00:01:10.020> his<00:01:10.170> weights<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> power

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and forth by his weights or by a power

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.219 
and forth by his weights or by a power
source<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.880> case<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> spring<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:12.990> in

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
source in this case it's a spring but in

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.480 
source in this case it's a spring but in
the<00:01:13.409> old<00:01:13.560> days<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.920> would<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.130> been<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.310> weight

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the old days it would have been a weight

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.429 
the old days it would have been a weight
perhaps<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> giant<00:01:15.450> boulder<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> rope

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
perhaps a giant boulder with the rope

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.260 
perhaps a giant boulder with the rope
around<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.950> hanging<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.310> underneath<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
around it hanging from underneath it and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
around it hanging from underneath it and
this<00:01:18.780> folio<00:01:19.170> would<00:01:19.409> tick<00:01:19.619> back<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> forth<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
this folio would tick back and forth and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.630 
this folio would tick back and forth and
and<00:01:21.509> tell<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> time<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.369> trying

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and tell you the time what you're trying

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.350 
and tell you the time what you're trying
to<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> regulated<00:01:25.590> tick<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.360> you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
to do is have a regulated tick and you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030 
to do is have a regulated tick and you
need<00:01:27.570> some<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> taking<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.770> power

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
need some way of taking all this power

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.370 
need some way of taking all this power
of<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> machine<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.060> letting<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> use<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
of a machine and letting it use the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.450 
of a machine and letting it use the
energy<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.000> regular<00:01:33.479> way<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.110> clock

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
energy in a regular way so the clock

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.069 
energy in a regular way so the clock
ticks<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> keeps<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> time<00:01:36.689> once<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
ticks and keeps the time once you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.780 
ticks and keeps the time once you
translate<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.920> time<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.490> an<00:01:38.640> hour

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
translate it to time that's on an hour

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.270 
translate it to time that's on an hour
on<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.329> dial<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.170> original<00:01:40.590> clocks<00:01:40.860> had<00:01:41.100> no

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
on a dial the original clocks had no

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
on a dial the original clocks had no
dial<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.880> they<00:01:42.119> did<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.329> ring<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.810> bell

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
dial all they did was ring a bell

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
dial all they did was ring a bell
hence<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.310> name<00:01:44.460> clock<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.119> comes<00:01:45.390> from

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hence the name clock which comes from

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.620 
hence the name clock which comes from
Latin<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.220> other<00:01:47.640> languages<00:01:48.329> Latin

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
Latin and and other languages Latin

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
Latin and and other languages Latin
clock<00:01:48.990> other<00:01:49.710> things<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.280> gave<00:01:50.430> us<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> so

theoretically a clock any clock now it
really<00:01:54.030> shouldn't<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.450> called<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.750> clock

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
really shouldn't be called the clock

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
really shouldn't be called the clock
unless<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.710> strikes<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.520> problem<00:01:56.850> with

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
unless it strikes the problem with

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.639 
unless it strikes the problem with
folios<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.049> they<00:01:58.170> weren't<00:01:58.350> very

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
folios is that they weren't very

folios is that they weren't very
accurate<00:01:59.369> these<00:01:59.729> rods<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.659> bar<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.140> just

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
accurate these rods this bar would just

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
accurate these rods this bar would just
tip<00:02:01.710> back<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.130> forth<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.939> could<00:02:03.119> move<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
tip back and forth you could move the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
tip back and forth you could move the
weights<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.290> maybe<00:02:04.439> get<00:02:04.710> an

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
weights in and out and maybe get an

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.380 
weights in and out and maybe get an
adjustment<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.460> these<00:02:05.790> were<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:06.119> only

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
adjustment but these were really only

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.109 
adjustment but these were really only
good<00:02:06.750> accuracy<00:02:07.649> maybe<00:02:07.890> an<00:02:08.250> hour<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.610> day<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
good accuracy maybe an hour a day if you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.390 
good accuracy maybe an hour a day if you
were<00:02:09.209> lucky
