00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.270
 what 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello I am marco dj trainer 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.830
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.370
 we will be able to mix with a tablet 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.080
 digital 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.540
 I will show you that by downloading 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 the apps you can have the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.930
 same type of tool as the dj 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.400
 professional in a tablet 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 now that we are facing this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 application i'm going to show you the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.730
 features at first on 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.030
 will select a music that will 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.550
 directly put yourself in the platinum on 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.470
 will launch it 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.700
 So here we hear the sound we're going 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.860
 to be able to see that the features 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.010
 are identical to a mixer on 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.660
 can for example lower the sound 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.580
 increase it can also speed up the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.560
 speed of a piece slow it down we have 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.420
 a feature that is very present 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.700
 on the cd turntables today even on 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 all systems 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.670
 he knows the master tempo so-called 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.850
 the master tempo which allows us to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.070
 keep the note of the piece we also have the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.750
 possibility of having effects that are 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.280
 directly integrated then we have the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.249
 basic effects that are effects 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.549
 of equalization where we will drop by 

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:19.530
 example low frequencies increase 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.710
 the high frequencies here we came to 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.009
 define a little bit we also have the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.389
 digital effects digital effects 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.389
 for example you hear 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.180
 here I applied an effect that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.280
 call the bit crusher we also have the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.829
 opportunity to do what is called 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.430
 loops so we can do some 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.509
 automatic loops 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.810
 we're going to have a loop we're going 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.810
 hear it and I 'm going to release it 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.939
 there is a feature too 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 important of those of this system it is 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.770
 we can generate entry points 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.330
 point that we call that points to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.940
 anywhere like on 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.390
 most evolved turntables just 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.470
 choose and select the part one 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.840
 will apply this point ku and then in 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.520
 pressing we will get it back to the place 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.340
 where you want it I will create one 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.940
 other 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 here we see that the point is sought 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.760
 now that we have seen the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.390
 basic features of this 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.100
 application 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.430
 I will show you how to make a 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.290
 simple transition between two pieces 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.110
 I run the first title I'm going 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.080
 choose a second type to put it 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.870
 in platinum b then I synchronize 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.130
 the bpm so that it is at the same 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.960
 speed that the other I'm waiting for the moment 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.180
 to be able to link the song in 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.180
 waiting i can do effects 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.930
 add frequencies 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.930
 and remove it from there 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.190
 so we have the sequence that is in 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.510
 being alone 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.920
 now that you know well mixed with 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.170
 a tablet if you want to know 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.370
 how well listened his mix find 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.569
 me in the video how to choose well 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.569
 his dj headphones
