there<00:01:28.570> so<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.660> can<00:01:29.810> see<00:01:30.080> how<00:01:30.260> we<00:01:30.320> rotate

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
there so you can see how we rotate

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.150 
there so you can see how we rotate
around<00:01:31.010> and<00:01:31.730> get<00:01:32.660> quite<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> few<00:01:33.290> reps<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:36.160> we

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
around and get quite a few reps in we

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.310 
around and get quite a few reps in we
want<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.490> keep<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.910> up<00:01:38.060> up<00:01:38.270> tempo<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.080> get<00:01:39.200> as

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
want to keep it up up tempo and get as

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.910 
want to keep it up up tempo and get as
many<00:01:39.470> reps<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.220> as<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:40.580> can<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.090> short<00:01:41.360> period

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
many reps in as we can in a short period

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.980 
many reps in as we can in a short period
now<00:01:42.920> we're<00:01:43.130> reading<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.640> same<00:01:43.670> thing<00:01:43.910> but<00:01:44.810> now
