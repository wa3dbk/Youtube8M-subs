00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.740
 despite the change of top spin 4 development team continues in the search for 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.270
 timing simulation par excellence trying however to render more 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.500
 soft on approach from the point of view of the templars top spin 4 try again 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.080
 the mechanics the structure of the past episode renewed to try 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.710
 receive feedback received over the years 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.040
 the first difference can be seen in the car controls considerably 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.230
 simplified having eliminated the risk modifier 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.940
 in top spin 4 of 4 front keys assigned to top speed have the right to 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.530
 damped or lot can only be matched to the right side cry for 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.230
 dampen the cults you can say left side to perform an acute insaid jab 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.630
 both of these two shots together with the lob will help require a 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.110
 exceptional timing to be carried out correctly I have once 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.810
 learned will guarantee a great variety to your game the backbone 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.610
 right helps move on the ground choosing the best trajectory for 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.300
 go down to the net to complete baggage of shots at your disposal there is a 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.690
 dual mode to hit the ball 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.210
 by quickly pressing the desired key, a deep but safe stroke is performed 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.040
 quite well 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.410
 useful for early trading from the fund or to recover from an impossible position 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.360
 while holding down the button you load a slash here on these boards 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210
 fuck yourself more risky 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.049
 the success of each shot obviously depends on the timing with which 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.159
 this is done the right cuts that allows you to have a trajectory 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.330
 pizza and optimal precision 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.710
 while anticipating or delaying the swing increases your chances of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.840
 error cody winning response from the opponent 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 to address the ball the game will take into account the timing but also of the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.020
 direction imprinted with had analogue left 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.090
 knowing how to vary your game anticipating the opponent's moves will be 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.540
 fundamental to take off guard arrives ale and to administer his own 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.920
 primary discriminating energy for victory and a defeat emac very much. 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.620
 more challenging viscards to help understand all these game elements 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.260
 the developers have made available various indicators that they will report in 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.060
 every moment the kind of faults following its timing by following these 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.010
 indications in a few moments you can understand where what is wrong is possible 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.010
 this way try adjusting your game based on suggestions 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.709
 the mechanics of control and differentiation of the various cults come 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.590
 re-proposed during the service after a simple pressure produces a throw 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.930
 weak and a prolonged allows to engage more defense 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.899
 opposing 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.459
 to maximize the power, they used the right analogue lever which 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.549
 combination with the left one allows for square - lyrics 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.429
 the heart of the basted experience as the cesses warns around the 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.689
 career mode write a tennis player of high hopes completely 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.219
 to cast a bile from the user 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.689
 enter the professional circuit 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.209
 the organization of its development is structured immense during which 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.999
 the user must choose each time he will do two types of rieti 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.919
 the first is preparation 2 facing a specific training for an event in 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.149
 able to improve our statistics while the second part of 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.319
 video is characterized by several tournaments 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.189
 each with different access characteristics capable of giving experience 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 fame or money proportional to the placement trust 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.129
 sisal of fame serve to personalize more tennis players 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.680
 like the opportunity to buy new clothes or gadget the experience is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.440
 fundamental to the technical growth and ethical dates of your storm to each 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.040
 level shift for a maximum of 20 you must decide which family and i 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.079
 attributes to climb between helpful attackers from photos and defender after 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.959
 each of these categories will only raise some of the eight parameters 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 available in a manner consistent with the choice made 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.759
 this system makes the growth of the various tennis players very personal but 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:44.119
 it guarantees in the same way that monsters are not made by always going 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.409
 to mark a few points also the statistics - used 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.199
 a further possibility of personalization will be given 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.120
 by the selected coach able to donate additional bonuses and abilities 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.120
 the athlete 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.089
 alongside the career we will find the possibility of organizing a classic 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.680
 fast meeting funcom or tutorial thanks to which to learn the basics of 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.790
 discipline is the king of the field a kind of good for you who a maximum of 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.059
 4 tennis players and you will face your text reaching profile 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.509
 victory set 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.889
 from the point of view of the online offer and we find the match classified with 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.090
 personalized as well as the opportunity to face a world tour and finally 

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:26.520
 the you that I believe where checking one of the athletes presing vicenza 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.349
 you can contribute to their global success by hand ad 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.490
 accumulate victory in their profile 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.980
 the top spin 4 version we tested allowed us to test the 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.660
 playstation moves the reading accuracy in every game mode 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.349
 movements and very good you really will not see the attempted screen shot 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.310
 unfortunately the motion sensors will read are your swing and the type 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.430
 suddenly he will still be tied to a keystroke 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.509
 the length of many exchanges the required precision yield anyway 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.720
 the use of the mortgage is very demanding from a physical point of view 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.500
 and suitable for those looking for more complete experience that deviates from samples of 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.990
 whose sport 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.360
 from a technical point of view we can only praise the work done by 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.370
 enough 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.490
 the polygonal models are very realistic that resemble the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.790
 real and excellent counterparts and also the management of the different surfaces but the 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.920
 the real strength of the entire sector is definitely the animations 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.449
 customized for each athlete and absolutely realistic and fluid 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.800
 credible 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.860
 from the audio point of view, some good tracks and excellent effects are reported 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.550
