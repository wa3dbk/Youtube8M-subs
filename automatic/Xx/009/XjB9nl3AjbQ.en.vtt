 car's competition with the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.119
 can beat modern technology 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.210
 currently on cloud seven years have 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.890
 Yesterday the training was used directly 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.420
 that is before the big rain came 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.160
 we drove our qualification 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.050
 what she was making the decision and 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.830
 accordingly, of course, super 6 update 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.830
 stood in the moment 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.640
 we have some we consume 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.400
 also some because he will be during the 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.140
 running shorter and shorter and yes I think 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.670
 if we have passed through again 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 no problems need a minimum of 3 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.220
 very exciting so exciting you can see now 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.450
 so many more fans on the track that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.310
 I am the whole great race 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.890
 do not even say that completely 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.030
 other optics at the whole stress the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.030
 guys now it's the right thing to do 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.869
 our audi is just great 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.530
 Finally we have to go to 530 now 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.159
 police will look there of course 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.159
 again very exciting 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.380
 It could not be better than we had to 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.160
 qualify us for the course 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.200
 top 30 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.590
 Therefore, tomorrow was a round 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.590
 burn 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.220
