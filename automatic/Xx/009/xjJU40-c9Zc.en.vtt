choice to either to choose to do that

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
choice to either to choose to do that
supination<00:00:45.640> pronation<00:00:45.790> or

here's an awesome tip for you know
naturally<00:00:53.580> gravity<00:00:54.090> inside<00:00:54.630> a<00:00:54.690> dumbbell

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
naturally gravity inside a dumbbell

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.990 
naturally gravity inside a dumbbell
that's<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.280> making<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.670> before

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that's actually making these before

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.150 
that's actually making these before
proceeding<00:00:57.330> in<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.600> second<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:57.990> you<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
proceeding in a second or you want to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.110 
proceeding in a second or you want to
make<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> harder

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.060 

it's<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> force<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.440> into<00:01:04.589> pronation

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's going to force you into pronation

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.430 
it's going to force you into pronation
actually<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> resist<00:01:08.390> sure<00:01:09.390> let's<00:01:10.260> see

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
actually have to resist sure let's see

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.660 
actually have to resist sure let's see
you<00:01:11.860> know<00:01:11.920> slippers<00:01:12.220> on

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.000 

looks<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.300> sometimes<00:01:15.690> heavy

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
looks like sometimes heavy

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.470 
looks like sometimes heavy
so<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:17.550> actually<00:01:17.700> give<00:01:18.060> away<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> do

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
so let's actually give away you can do

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.030 
so let's actually give away you can do
an<00:01:18.570> extended<00:01:18.990> set<00:01:19.290> without<00:01:19.410> changing<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> way

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
an extended set without changing the way

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.650 
an extended set without changing the way
start<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.940> other<00:01:21.090> side<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.390> dumbbell

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
start out the other side of the dumbbell

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:30.370 
start out the other side of the dumbbell
unless<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.050> tired<00:01:22.290> there

notice anybody gets tired that's cheap
at<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.340> Moose<00:01:40.520> swears<00:01:41.390> by<00:01:41.539> some<00:01:41.899> way

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
at the Moose swears by some way

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.560 
at the Moose swears by some way
dude

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.290 

explain<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.670> means<00:01:47.880> since<00:01:48.210> you

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
explain what that really means since you

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.630 
explain what that really means since you
guys<00:01:48.390> might<00:01:48.630> understand<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:50.040> my<00:01:50.310> hand<00:01:50.520> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
guys might understand that so my hand is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
guys might understand that so my hand is
here<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.350> greater<00:01:52.620> percentage

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
here you know it's a greater percentage

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620 
here you know it's a greater percentage
of<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.280> weight<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.730> dumbbell<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.300> on<00:01:54.450> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
of the weight of the dumbbell is on this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.330 
of the weight of the dumbbell is on this
side<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.590> actually<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.010> force<00:01:56.220> me

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
side so it's actually going to force me

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.970 
side so it's actually going to force me
to<00:01:56.370> do<00:01:56.550> this<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.150> if<00:01:57.660> I<00:01:57.750> wasn't<00:01:57.960> fisting<00:01:58.650> my

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
to do this so if I wasn't fisting my

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.890 
to do this so if I wasn't fisting my
bicep<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.940> dumbbell<00:02:00.240> would<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.690> turn

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
bicep the dumbbell would actually turn

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.400 
bicep the dumbbell would actually turn
this<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:02.490> forcing<00:02:03.240> me<00:02:03.360> into

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
this so that's actually forcing me into

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.440 
this so that's actually forcing me into
supination<00:02:04.410> fashion<00:02:05.040> disengaged<00:02:05.490> fleshlight

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
supination fashion disengaged fleshlight

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.029 
supination fashion disengaged fleshlight
this<00:02:06.720> way

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this way

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.219 
this way
in<00:02:08.939> the<00:02:09.090> supination<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.780> actually<00:02:10.079> make

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in the supination to actually make

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.020 
in the supination to actually make
seizure-free<00:02:13.430> start<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.519> way<00:02:14.640> here<00:02:14.879> it's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
seizure-free start the way here it's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.470 
seizure-free start the way here it's
gonna<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.209> one<00:02:16.400> second<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.000> then<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.269> guess

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
gonna be one second and then as I guess

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.899 
gonna be one second and then as I guess
as<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.109> you<00:02:19.530> gonna<00:02:19.650> miss<00:02:19.829> fight<00:02:20.040> that's

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
as a to you gonna miss fight that's

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.789 
as a to you gonna miss fight that's
gonna<00:02:21.239> be<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.510> an<00:02:21.659> assistance<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.680> gonna

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
gonna be like an assistance it's gonna

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.850 
gonna be like an assistance it's gonna
make<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.010> easier

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.470 

feels<00:02:27.100> like<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.370> heavier<00:02:28.090> when<00:02:28.330> you're

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
feels like it's heavier when you're

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.450 
feels like it's heavier when you're
