up<00:00:57.880> and<00:00:58.360> I'm<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.750> this<00:00:59.070> world<00:01:00.070> alright<00:01:00.730> i'm

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
up and I'm in this world alright i'm

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.840 
up and I'm in this world alright i'm
standing<00:01:01.270> on<00:01:01.380> what<00:01:02.380> i<00:01:02.410> can<00:01:02.620> see<00:01:02.830> i<00:01:03.100> must<00:01:03.490> be<00:01:03.610> a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
standing on what i can see i must be a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.789 
standing on what i can see i must be a
pair<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.689> hands<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.170> face<00:01:05.350> because<00:01:05.619> there's

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
pair of hands and a face because there's

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.100 
pair of hands and a face because there's
somebody<00:01:06.070> across<00:01:06.610> from<00:01:06.970> me<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.299> then<00:01:08.020> they

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
somebody across from me and then they

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.690 
somebody across from me and then they
start<00:01:08.350> talking<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.890> me<00:01:09.009> yeah<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.549> then<00:01:09.640> i

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
start talking to me yeah and then i

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.830 
start talking to me yeah and then i
realize<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.030> they're<00:01:10.299> in<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.509> room<00:01:10.630> behind

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
realize that they're in the room behind

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.710 
realize that they're in the room behind
and<00:01:11.500> we're<00:01:11.800> actually<00:01:11.920> playing<00:01:12.280> together

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.940 

so<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> basis<00:01:17.170> for<00:01:17.320> this<00:01:17.409> whole<00:01:17.619> thing<00:01:17.799> is

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
so the basis for this whole thing is

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.210 
so the basis for this whole thing is
that<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.310> are<00:01:18.549> in<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:19.420> virtual<00:01:20.140> space<00:01:20.409> with

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
that you are in a virtual space with

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.070 
that you are in a virtual space with
somebody<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:21.939> in<00:01:22.119> actuality<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.750> guys<00:01:22.900> are

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
somebody but in actuality you guys are

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.230 
somebody but in actuality you guys are
in<00:01:23.170> separate<00:01:23.560> locations<00:01:23.770> right<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:24.909> and

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
in separate locations right so and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.580 
in separate locations right so and
essentially<00:01:25.780> what<00:01:25.960> you're<00:01:26.049> accomplishing<00:01:26.229> is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
essentially what you're accomplishing is

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.380 
essentially what you're accomplishing is
you<00:01:26.890> have<00:01:27.159> created<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:27.970> little<00:01:28.119> scenario

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
you have created this little scenario

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.670 
you have created this little scenario
that<00:01:28.720> doesn't<00:01:29.020> exist<00:01:29.200> with<00:01:29.350> any<00:01:29.530> other

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
that doesn't exist with any other

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.350 
that doesn't exist with any other
technology<00:01:29.920> yes<00:01:30.549> I<00:01:30.790> don't<00:01:31.030> think<00:01:31.240> it's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
technology yes I don't think it's

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.060 
technology yes I don't think it's
possible<00:01:31.509> any<00:01:31.840> other<00:01:31.990> way<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.830> really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
possible any other way to really

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.660 
possible any other way to really
interact<00:01:33.310> like<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.119> were<00:01:34.330> in<00:01:34.630> 3d<00:01:34.899> space<00:01:35.020> like

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
interact like you were in 3d space like

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.320 
interact like you were in 3d space like
what<00:01:36.670> were<00:01:36.729> some<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:36.970> things<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.210> guys

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
what were some of the things you guys

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.639 
what were some of the things you guys
are<00:01:37.450> doing<00:01:37.600> because<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.780> know<00:01:37.840> my<00:01:38.170> favorite<00:01:38.380> was

the sanction also have to pick up the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.250 
the sanction also have to pick up the
slingshot<00:03:03.640> right<00:03:03.820> like<00:03:04.299> I<00:03:04.329> still<00:03:04.570> use<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.959> but

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
slingshot right like I still use it but

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.060 
slingshot right like I still use it but
now<00:03:05.410> I'm<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:07.230> exact<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.380> 10<00:03:08.650> times<00:03:08.920> as

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
now I'm like exact like 10 times as

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.699 
now I'm like exact like 10 times as
large<00:03:09.450> yeah<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:10.930> like<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.380> I'm<00:03:11.500> sure

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
like an absolute numpty playing this

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.780 
like an absolute numpty playing this
thing<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:16.209> was<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:17.560> was<00:03:17.680> unbelievable<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.609> was

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
thing it was it was unbelievable it was

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.920 
thing it was it was unbelievable it was
like<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.120> was<00:03:19.209> one<00:03:19.329> of<00:03:19.359> those<00:03:19.510> things<00:03:19.780> were

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
like it was one of those things were

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.990 
like it was one of those things were
like<00:03:20.079> I<00:03:20.380> could<00:03:21.280> have<00:03:21.370> described<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.819> to<00:03:21.850> you

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
like I could have described it to you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.410 
like I could have described it to you
and<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.359> probably<00:03:22.569> wouldn't<00:03:23.079> have

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
and you probably wouldn't have

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.570 
and you probably wouldn't have
any<00:03:23.510> idea<00:03:23.930> how<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.319> felt<00:03:24.620> because<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:25.550> a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
any idea how it felt because it is a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.980 
any idea how it felt because it is a
feeling<00:03:25.849> it<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.180> not<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:26.599> something<00:03:26.810> that

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
feeling it is not just something that

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.410 
feeling it is not just something that
you<00:03:27.440> learn<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.340> then<00:03:28.489> understand<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.209> have

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
you learn and then understand you have

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.210 
you learn and then understand you have
to<00:03:29.450> experience<00:03:29.930> totally<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.680> there's<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.069> wait

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
to experience totally and there's a wait

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.520 
to experience totally and there's a wait
it<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:32.030> intuitive<00:03:32.480> like<00:03:32.690> when<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.170> was<00:03:33.380> talking

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
it the intuitive like when I was talking

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.620 
it the intuitive like when I was talking
to<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.580> gentleman<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.150> other<00:03:35.270> side<00:03:35.480> are

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
to the gentleman on the other side are

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.170 
to the gentleman on the other side are
talking<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.930> Christ<00:03:36.140> like<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.489> microphone<00:03:38.090> on

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
talking to Christ like the microphone on

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.360 
talking to Christ like the microphone on
the<00:03:38.209> headset<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:38.959> like<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.590> just<00:03:39.620> works<00:03:40.040> and

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
the headset so like it just works and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.760 
the headset so like it just works and
when<00:03:40.520> they<00:03:40.640> talk<00:03:40.880> there<00:03:41.270> it's<00:03:41.930> like<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.200> pulsing

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
when they talk there it's like a pulsing

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.170 
when they talk there it's like a pulsing
a<00:03:42.800> little<00:03:43.100> ecstatic<00:03:43.640> like<00:03:43.850> waiting<00:03:44.150> for

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
a little ecstatic like waiting for

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.850 
a little ecstatic like waiting for
exactly<00:03:44.840> Jenna<00:03:44.989> floating<00:03:45.350> head<00:03:45.500> with<00:03:45.709> like<00:03:45.830> a

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
exactly Jenna floating head with like a

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.590 
exactly Jenna floating head with like a
wireframe<00:03:46.069> but<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.700> moves<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.060> everything

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
wireframe but it moves and everything

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.449 
wireframe but it moves and everything
about<00:03:47.690> us<00:03:47.840> like<00:03:48.230> head<00:03:48.560> gestures<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:49.130> like<00:03:49.280> that

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
about us like head gestures to like that

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.190 
about us like head gestures to like that
I've<00:03:49.610> ever<00:03:49.670> like<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.569> felt<00:03:50.840> like<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:51.050> was

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
I've ever like just felt like I was

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.589 
I've ever like just felt like I was
talking<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.730> human<00:03:52.730> person<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.420> think<00:03:53.569> a

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
talking to a human person and I think a

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.850 
talking to a human person and I think a
lot<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.750> people<00:03:53.810> expect<00:03:54.290> for<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.560> feel

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
lot of people expect for that to feel

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.290 
lot of people expect for that to feel
that<00:03:55.010> way<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.310> has<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.580> look<00:03:55.790> exactly<00:03:56.000> like

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
that way it has to look exactly like

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.240 
that way it has to look exactly like
them<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.720> has<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.989> be<00:03:57.170> this<00:03:57.350> yeah<00:03:57.620> like<00:03:57.890> perfect

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
them it has to be this yeah like perfect

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.970 
them it has to be this yeah like perfect
representation<00:03:58.750> but<00:03:59.750> we<00:04:00.050> are<00:04:00.319> instinctively

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
representation but we are instinctively

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.100 
representation but we are instinctively
trained<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.790> see<00:04:02.420> faces<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.780> things<00:04:03.049> that

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
trained to see faces in things that

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.750 
trained to see faces in things that
don't<00:04:03.230> exist<00:04:03.440> right<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:04.250> therefore<00:04:04.580> when<00:04:04.700> we

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
don't exist right so therefore when we

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.250 
don't exist right so therefore when we
have<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.030> thing<00:04:05.390> that's<00:04:05.540> rendered<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:06.049> just

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
have a thing that's rendered that just

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.630 
have a thing that's rendered that just
sort<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.410> shares<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.799> qualities<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.430> face

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
sort of shares the qualities of a face

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.460 
sort of shares the qualities of a face
it's<00:04:08.180> really<00:04:08.420> easy<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.780> just<00:04:09.019> sort<00:04:09.140> of<00:04:09.200> buy

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
it's really easy to just sort of buy

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.990 
it's really easy to just sort of buy
into<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.950> go<00:04:10.040> along<00:04:10.069> and<00:04:10.519> then<00:04:10.790> there's

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
into it and go along and then there's

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.729 
into it and go along and then there's
this<00:04:11.090> world<00:04:11.360> it's<00:04:11.630> like<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.140> it<00:04:12.530> all<00:04:12.709> just

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
this world it's like so it all just

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.920 
this world it's like so it all just
works<00:04:13.069> it's<00:04:13.489> basically<00:04:13.850> a<00:04:13.940> physics<00:04:14.269> demo<00:04:14.480> but

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
works it's basically a physics demo but

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.820 
works it's basically a physics demo but
there's<00:04:15.110> all<00:04:15.200> these<00:04:15.290> different<00:04:15.470> things<00:04:15.590> gonna

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
there's all these different things gonna

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.080 
there's all these different things gonna
be<00:04:15.950> like<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.130> instance<00:04:16.220> with<00:04:16.549> these<00:04:16.639> balls<00:04:16.880> in

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
be like for instance with these balls in

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.849 
be like for instance with these balls in
the<00:04:17.150> corner<00:04:17.479> that<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.750> smash<00:04:18.139> and<00:04:18.530> they

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
the corner that you smash and they

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.560 
the corner that you smash and they
turned<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:19.250> into<00:04:19.400> like<00:04:19.790> underwater<00:04:20.239> land

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
turned it into like underwater land

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.360 
turned it into like underwater land
where<00:04:21.109> like<00:04:21.139> space<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:22.010> then<00:04:22.070> suddenly

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
where like space and then suddenly

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.430 
where like space and then suddenly
gravity<00:04:23.210> works<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:23.720> right<00:04:23.990> at<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.200> end<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.350> the
