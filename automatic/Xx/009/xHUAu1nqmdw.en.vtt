00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.890

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.560
 New Year's holidays take a break then already 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.720
 I want debts, the league will also go to 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.910
 holidays to fight chimes and shoulders 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.040
 champagne to sum up the calendar 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.590

 go friends just to the top 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.659
 frozen lake away from urban 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.089
 the hustle and bustle will be skiing and skating 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.930
 and lots of outdoor sports for sure 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.360

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.659
 competition for the best moments resumed 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.760
 g-1 league in my easier way 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.100
 winning gaming gold is simply not 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.380
 there is everything to notice 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.390
 interesting moment in any league match 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.870
 and write about it a special topic on 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.050
 the forum 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.480

 Department of eSports Alexei Kuznetsov 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.090

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.070
 closely related to eSports and of course 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.450
 We followed closely following the addition 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.370
 new maps is a very serious step 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.840
 before making such decisions we 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.350
 consult with professional 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.690

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.430
 the captain of the stalker team promised 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.990

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.460
 gold for damage damage 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.680
 replays sent us a huge amount 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.770
 but not all of them fit the conditions 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.290
 competition and yet the winner is 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.240
