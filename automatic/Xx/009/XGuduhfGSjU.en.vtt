00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200

going to use the data for beef right now

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.849 
going to use the data for beef right now
because<00:02:39.659> it<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.170> meat<00:02:40.349> that's<00:02:40.470> had<00:02:40.709> the

produce one pound of beef it takes

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.220 
produce one pound of beef it takes
approximately<00:02:44.609> 55<00:02:45.599> square<00:02:45.930> feet<00:02:46.109> of

approximately 55 square feet of

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.720 
rainforest which depending on the area
is<00:02:48.120> anywhere<00:02:48.450> between<00:02:48.510> 45<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.379> 55<00:02:49.980> trees
