in<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.240> last<00:00:06.420> video<00:00:06.630> I<00:00:07.020> introduced<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> pen

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
in the last video I introduced the pen

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.150 
in the last video I introduced the pen
tool<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.400> showed<00:00:08.639> its<00:00:08.790> various<00:00:09.179> attributes

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
tool and showed its various attributes

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.259 
tool and showed its various attributes
now<00:00:11.160> I'm<00:00:11.249> going<00:00:11.369> to<00:00:11.459> show<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.639> how<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:12.030> can<00:00:12.179> be

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
now I'm going to show you how it can be

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.560 
now I'm going to show you how it can be
easily<00:00:12.480> applied<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.289> your<00:00:13.469> paintings<00:00:14.389> so<00:00:15.389> once

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
easily applied in your paintings so once

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.390 
easily applied in your paintings so once
I've<00:00:15.690> closed<00:00:15.959> a<00:00:16.080> path<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:16.770> time<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.099> turn<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I've closed a path it's time to turn it

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.429 
I've closed a path it's time to turn it
into<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> selection<00:00:18.090> which<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.929> also<00:00:19.080> known<00:00:19.199> as

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
into a selection which is also known as

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.980 
into a selection which is also known as
a<00:00:19.500> marquee<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.089> I<00:00:21.390> first<00:00:21.839> opened

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
a marquee so to do this I first opened

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.159 
a marquee so to do this I first opened
up<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.349> paths<00:00:22.589> palette<00:00:23.779> window<00:00:25.339> Pat's<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
up the paths palette window Pat's and I

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.079 
up the paths palette window Pat's and I
select<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> work<00:00:28.769> path<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.699> case<00:00:29.910> it's

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
select the work path in this case it's

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.659 
select the work path in this case it's
the<00:00:30.150> only<00:00:30.390> path<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.369> then<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> bottom

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the only path I have and then the bottom

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.060 
the only path I have and then the bottom
palette<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.240> click<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> button<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.860> turn<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
palette I click the button to turn it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.940 
palette I click the button to turn it
into<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> marquee<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.440> now<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.560> I<00:00:37.650> make<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.830> new

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
into a marquee and now if I make a new

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.730 
into a marquee and now if I make a new
layer<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:39.120> paint<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.480> inside<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:42.740> now

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
layer I can paint right inside there now

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.470 
layer I can paint right inside there now
to<00:00:43.800> take<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.130> step<00:00:44.160> further<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.760> prefer<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to take it a step further I prefer to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.510 
to take it a step further I prefer to
automate<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> single<00:00:46.950> button<00:00:47.190> press

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
automate it with a single button press

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
automate it with a single button press
so<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.290> need<00:00:49.380> to<00:00:49.500> bind

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so to do this I'm going to need to bind

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
so to do this I'm going to need to bind
those<00:00:49.950> steps<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.640> an<00:00:50.940> action<00:00:53.240> the<00:00:54.240> action

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
those steps into an action the action

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.210 
those steps into an action the action
i'm<00:00:54.750> about<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.140> record<00:00:55.470> is<00:00:55.740> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> require

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
i'm about to record is going to require

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.640 
i'm about to record is going to require
a<00:00:56.490> new<00:00:56.850> work<00:00:57.060> path<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.170> i'm<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.380> to<00:00:58.440> first

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
a new work path so i'm going to first

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.680 
a new work path so i'm going to first
open<00:00:58.860> up<00:00:59.040> my<00:00:59.190> paths<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.820> actions<00:01:00.180> palette<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
open up my paths and actions palette and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.299 
open up my paths and actions palette and
then<00:01:01.410> make<00:01:01.560> a<00:01:01.590> new<00:01:01.770> path<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:04.799> once<00:01:04.949> I've<00:01:05.070> closed

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
then make a new path so once I've closed

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
then make a new path so once I've closed
the<00:01:05.339> path<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> make<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:06.690> new<00:01:06.780> action

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the path it's time to make a new action

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
the path it's time to make a new action
and<00:01:07.440> start<00:01:07.740> recording<00:01:10.310> i'll<00:01:11.310> call<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.890> pen<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and start recording i'll call it pen to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.790 
and start recording i'll call it pen to
path

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.620 

and<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.760> this<00:01:20.880> point<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.240> could<00:01:21.360> assign<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and at this point you could assign a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.190 
and at this point you could assign a
function<00:01:22.050> key<00:01:22.260> to<00:01:22.560> trigger<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> action<00:01:24.200> okay

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
function key to trigger the action okay

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380 
function key to trigger the action okay
so<00:01:25.440> now<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.740> recording<00:01:26.190> I'm<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:27.300> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
so now that it's recording I'm going to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.800 
so now that it's recording I'm going to
do<00:01:27.480> the<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:27.810> steps<00:01:28.080> first<00:01:29.240> convert<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.540> work

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
do the two steps first convert the work

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.010 
do the two steps first convert the work
path<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> selection<00:01:34.730> next<00:01:35.730> I<00:01:36.120> delete<00:01:36.870> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
path to a selection next I delete the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.400 
path to a selection next I delete the
work<00:01:37.200> path<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:40.940> that's<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.380> my

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
work path and that's it I now have my

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.010 
work path and that's it I now have my
path<00:01:44.130> converted<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.120> into<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.390> selection<00:01:45.690> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
path converted it into a selection and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
path converted it into a selection and
I've<00:01:46.350> removed<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.580> work<00:01:47.760> path<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> don't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I've removed the work path so I don't

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.110 
I've removed the work path so I don't
get<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.960> buildup<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.500> extra<00:01:49.830> paths<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.940> I<00:01:51.000> hit

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
get a buildup of extra paths so I hit

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.300 
get a buildup of extra paths so I hit
stop<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:52.740> doesn't<00:01:53.010> make<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> very

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
stop and that doesn't make for a very

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.910 
stop and that doesn't make for a very
complex<00:01:53.880> or<00:01:54.150> show<00:01:54.360> reaction<00:01:54.900> but<00:01:55.470> i<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.710> tell

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
complex or show reaction but i can tell

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.680 
complex or show reaction but i can tell
you<00:01:55.950> over<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> past<00:01:56.700> few<00:01:56.970> years<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.630> has

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
you over the past few years this has

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.880 
you over the past few years this has
saved<00:01:58.050> me<00:01:58.290> countless<00:01:58.590> hours<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.310> work<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.740> now

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
saved me countless hours of work so now

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.890 
saved me countless hours of work so now
i'll<00:02:01.980> show<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.370> in<00:02:02.430> action<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.970> make<00:02:03.720> my

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
i'll show you it in action I make my

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.070 
i'll show you it in action I make my
path<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.090> when<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.240> closed<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.660> I'm<00:02:06.810> happy

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
path and when it's closed and I'm happy

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.810 
path and when it's closed and I'm happy
with<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.230> I<00:02:07.500> trigger<00:02:08.010> the<00:02:08.190> action<00:02:08.490> with<00:02:08.640> one

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
with it I trigger the action with one

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.780 
with it I trigger the action with one
key<00:02:09.200> now<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.230> have<00:02:10.290> a<00:02:10.410> selection<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.640> can

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
key now I have a selection and I can

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.550 
key now I have a selection and I can
paint<00:02:11.970> right<00:02:12.120> inside<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:15.320> now<00:02:16.320> if<00:02:16.410> you've
