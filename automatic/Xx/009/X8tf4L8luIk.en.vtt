 symbols convince him to give him 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.089
 train and become good and so not and therefore 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.859
 then in our pokemon partner 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.339

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.620
 pokemon paradise which is this 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.740
 side 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.020

 if you look here this door this door to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.219
 turn the game around will go away 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.109
 will be what is this board and this 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.399
 strength that is here on this board 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:32.250
 exclusively against good bosses and you 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.560
 you can give an account here I think you're 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.880
 out here this puts the signal that what 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.759
 can do in cooperative mode with a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.840
 red stars the stars have 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.549
 increased the range of difficulty of the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.530
 enemies from the poles of the enemies 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.479
 of the dungeons or the enemies 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 Pokemon has increased in 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.909
 considerably already almost occurs in 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.299

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.370
 mind that there are no floors no levels 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.560
 or nothing because it sends you directly to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.350
 boss to fight against them is 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.570

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.750

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.870
 once once he takes a letter to his 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.840

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.320
 own account you can not do for it 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.270
 for no reason unless you have 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.680
 a mission in a mission a mission 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.140
 can not get out of this 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.690
 zone here at least if you have with you 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.510

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 attitude of venues from from the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.620
 good menu 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.390

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.830
 a pokémon and it 's the pokemon is the one 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.320
 will fight against a certain amount of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.180
 Pokemon is enemies and good terrain 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.620
 then we go 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.879
 and here is the mission board of 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.469
 mission rescue missions 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.530

 found wrongdoers and is not here 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.579
 as you see is a star in the mission 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.950
 one of the easiest missions here 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.139
 there are the signs that also appear 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.420
 as they had already explained the floor 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.200
 is this the fourth floor 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:37.580

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.150
 overturned and part of the steam 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.000

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.629
 things these are all are all 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.810
 prizes that you earn all these objects 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.010
 that serve to 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.590
 all these objects that serve to 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.300
 create for him are these exclusive 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.540

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.790
 nothing else are for up to also handle for

 customize your home to create for the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.319
 time that we go to create zones for 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.110
 can create there to be able to put 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.810

 it serves to put new zones create 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.840
 new areas and this is the money that you 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.550
 they give stevens as they see until the seventh 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.150
 floor 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.620
 the question mark and what there is 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:35.850
 a stranger like yes yes 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:40.360
 a strange thing, something weird for each other 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.030
 that then all of friendship will read 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.490
 the missions as it comes like here is 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.650
 open your mobile and you can access 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.350
 this board is arranged from the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.530
 principle in this in the game this one does not 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.970
 be busy in the return to the game and already 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.850
 you can use it, it can be 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.660
 usable then do not stop here until 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.580
 the objects then it's around here you do not 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.639
 you recover movements that you have 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.490
 learned did not hear cuéllar ok here in the 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.039
 good team as well as you can see this 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.039
 just jets boxer that does have this 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.930
 story of the game good fax yesterday at 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.199
 that I got to see is that being like 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.230
 gives you what is a little money for 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:26.380
 go fight here in paradise pokemon 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.380
 a home and live there because you want to stay 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.600
 the country for that is this game because he 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.850
 has to give pokemon paradise good 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.820
 then also it engaged in case of 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:41.080
 rocks an evildoer at the end already at 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.510
 altar to give you the rewards he will 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.100
 the day he tells you about him it's said that 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.500
 thanks for capturing bad hector jazz and 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.780
 then the wrongdoer says no longer what 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.210
 I'll do it again and that's how we can 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.140
 So, here, also, you with him 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.430
 you can edit the equipment or put a 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.080
 two others 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.330
 here eliminate the team here and here then 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.370
 with this option so here to eliminate a 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.100
 member of the team other than 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.810
 front of the story good here 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.750
 as for example as you can see this 26 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.700
 fell evolution to its final stage as 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.000
 can see is the level 50 that can 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.190
 they could increase this level is found 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.290
 until many times but it does not matter if 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.190
 it does not matter if you're in the dungeon 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.920
 with two pokemones 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.100
 and all these pokemons stay in the 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.500
 they stay here with you level up 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.820
 at sea in the dungeons like 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.160
 this pokemon that is here for example 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.230
 if it was level 15 it will rise to the level 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.380
 21 once you bring them a new one 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:50.420
 dungeon and take it with you and climb to 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:52.040
 level 21 and that's not why that's because 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.290
 it's easier to level up 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.270
 everyone who chooses our 9 is no more 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.130
 easy to level up but it's more 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.900
 easy to level up the others 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.689
 pokemons that are not participating in 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.399
 a good dungeon the evolutions 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.129
 all pokemones can evolve 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:10.080
 except you and through this the story 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.449
 in the elbow of the turn 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.829
 You can evolve as you can see 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:20.729
 also in flames crazy descriptions of 

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:23.459
 ok this your attacks and it ends well in each 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:25.529
 attack with their respective descriptions 

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:27.929
 of this with all how many 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:31.949
 can use the power is very large 

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:37.139
 that the kind of land the tactics and the 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:41.249
 know I do not think with the movement with 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:45.300
 the DNA here another one here and the last one 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:48.449
 I saw but good and we already confirmed 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.529
 we will not go we no longer leave us no 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:53.009
 they did but if we want to do something 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:55.589
 well then this has been all friends 

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:58.199
 in the next video 

00:07:55.589 --> 00:08:00.839
 I will talk about how to create the paris or 

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:03.389
 pokemon in this country or pokemon and so and 

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:06.329
 well the country or pokemon that from this side 

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:08.460
 is the last part and all the latest in 

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:13.100
