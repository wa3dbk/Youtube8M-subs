00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
way around they're only like across this

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.310 
way around they're only like across this
way<00:01:37.939> and<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.030> found<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.540> kind<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> weird<00:01:40.079> so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
way and I found that kind of weird so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.660 
way and I found that kind of weird so
it's<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> awkward<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's kind of awkward to use because you

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.359 
it's kind of awkward to use because you
can<00:01:41.759> only<00:01:42.060> use<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> certain<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
can only use it a certain way and I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.649 
can only use it a certain way and I
don't<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.060> wants<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.540> bit

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
don't know I think it wants a little bit

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
don't know I think it wants a little bit

good enough for the amount of money I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.380 
good enough for the amount of money I
paid<00:02:18.530> for<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:18.860> cuz<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.430> ordered<00:02:19.700> online<00:02:19.819> so<00:02:20.360> I

paid for it so cuz I ordered online so I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.960 
paid for it so cuz I ordered online so I
don't<00:02:20.629> like<00:02:20.780> try<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.019> out<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.260> store<00:02:21.440> but

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
probably go to the counter or the store

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
probably go to the counter or the store

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
bit of this goes a heck of a long way

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.910 
bit of this goes a heck of a long way
like<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.150> don't<00:02:53.329> even<00:02:53.480> need<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.989> quarter<00:02:54.709> pump

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
like you don't even need a quarter pump

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.580 
like you don't even need a quarter pump
to<00:02:55.069> cover<00:02:55.280> your<00:02:55.489> whole<00:02:55.610> face<00:02:55.880> I'm<00:02:56.269> not

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
to cover your whole face I'm not

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.430 
to cover your whole face I'm not
exaggerating<00:02:57.590> at<00:02:58.250> all<00:02:58.310> it's<00:02:59.150> like<00:02:59.360> super<00:03:00.049> spin

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
exaggerating at all it's like super spin

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.380 
exaggerating at all it's like super spin
so<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.160> not<00:03:01.250> quite<00:03:01.489> look<00:03:01.640> as<00:03:01.790> good<00:03:01.970> as<00:03:02.090> water

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
so it's not quite look as good as water

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.240 
so it's not quite look as good as water
or<00:03:02.630> anything<00:03:02.870> but<00:03:03.290> it's<00:03:03.440> really<00:03:03.709> really<00:03:03.890> thin

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
or anything but it's really really thin

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.089 
or anything but it's really really thin
so<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.549> spreads<00:03:05.000> out<00:03:05.180> thin<00:03:05.599> so<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.620> get<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.920> lot

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
so it spreads out thin so you get a lot

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.170 
so it spreads out thin so you get a lot
of<00:03:07.130> coverage<00:03:07.400> too

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
of coverage too

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.880 
of coverage too
it's<00:03:08.720> all<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.900> got<00:03:08.959> spread<00:03:09.260> standing<00:03:09.620> covers

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
it's all I got spread standing covers

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.350 
it's all I got spread standing covers
nothing<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.940> really<00:03:11.239> good

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
nothing it just it's really good

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.750 
nothing it just it's really good
coverage<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.250> really<00:03:13.250> really<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:13.579> this

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
coverage and I really really like this

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.610 
coverage and I really really like this
and<00:03:14.030> then<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.269> last<00:03:14.420> thing<00:03:14.569> is<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.989> most

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
and then the last thing is the most

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
stopper which is a little bit bigger so

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.860 
stopper which is a little bit bigger so
that's<00:04:40.919> that<00:04:41.159> and<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:42.090> only<00:04:42.419> complaint<00:04:42.810> I

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
that's that and the only complaint I

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.050 
that's that and the only complaint I
have<00:04:43.080> about<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:43.379> is<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.919> smaller<00:04:44.699> side

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
have about this is the smaller side

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.659 
have about this is the smaller side
doesn't<00:04:45.780> really<00:04:46.050> give<00:04:46.259> enough<00:04:46.500> mascara<00:04:47.460> I'd

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
doesn't really give enough mascara I'd

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.580 
doesn't really give enough mascara I'd
say<00:04:47.879> and<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.689> bigger<00:04:48.840> side<00:04:49.050> gives<00:04:49.289> a<00:04:49.379> little

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
say and the bigger side gives a little

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.929 
say and the bigger side gives a little
bit<00:04:49.710> too<00:04:49.919> much<00:04:50.099> I<00:04:50.250> mean<00:04:50.400> it's<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.639> so<00:04:50.789> much

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
bit too much I mean it's not so much

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.309 
bit too much I mean it's not so much
there<00:04:51.150> changes<00:04:51.449> might<00:04:51.599> a<00:04:51.629> complete<00:04:51.960> opinion

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
there changes might a complete opinion

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.110 
there changes might a complete opinion
about<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.560> but<00:04:52.889> I<00:04:53.159> just<00:04:53.550> feel<00:04:53.849> like<00:04:53.969> they

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
about it but I just feel like they

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.790 
about it but I just feel like they
should<00:04:54.300> have<00:04:54.389> had<00:04:54.509> a<00:04:54.569> happy<00:04:54.810> medium<00:04:55.349> maybe

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
should have had a happy medium maybe

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.860 
should have had a happy medium maybe
like<00:04:56.069> three<00:04:56.490> but<00:04:56.909> that<00:04:57.150> might<00:04:57.330> be<00:04:57.360> too<00:04:57.509> much<00:04:57.659> to

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
like three but that might be too much to

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.860 
like three but that might be too much to
ask<00:04:58.759> because<00:04:59.759> like<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.300> one<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.539> gives<00:05:00.629> too

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
ask because like the one that gives too

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.420 
ask because like the one that gives too
much<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:01.229> kind<00:05:01.409> of<00:05:01.529> makes<00:05:01.800> your<00:05:01.949> lashes<00:05:02.039> stick

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
much it kind of makes your lashes stick

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.570 
much it kind of makes your lashes stick
together<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:03.330> I'm<00:05:03.539> a<00:05:03.569> mascara<00:05:04.110> freak<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.159> I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
together and I'm a mascara freak so I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.730 
together and I'm a mascara freak so I
don't<00:05:06.360> know<00:05:06.569> usually<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.110> don't<00:05:07.169> mind<00:05:07.500> more

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
don't know usually I don't mind more

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.679 
don't know usually I don't mind more
product<00:05:08.400> but<00:05:08.639> this<00:05:08.789> one<00:05:08.969> it's<00:05:09.270> just<00:05:09.449> kind<00:05:09.659> of

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689 
product but this one it's just kind of

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.330 
product but this one it's just kind of
hard<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.930> deal<00:05:10.169> with<00:05:10.409> with<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.919> clumping

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
hard to deal with with the clumping

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.459 
hard to deal with with the clumping
clumping<00:05:12.240> but<00:05:12.389> just<00:05:12.569> they<00:05:12.659> stick<00:05:12.930> together<00:05:13.080> so

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
clumping but just they stick together so

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.350 
clumping but just they stick together so
it's<00:05:14.099> harder<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.520> work<00:05:14.639> with<00:05:14.699> with<00:05:15.000> an<00:05:15.090> eyelash

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
it's harder to work with with an eyelash

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.149 
it's harder to work with with an eyelash
brush<00:05:15.629> and<00:05:15.870> everything<00:05:15.930> but<00:05:16.379> other<00:05:16.919> than<00:05:17.099> that

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
brush and everything but other than that

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.640 
brush and everything but other than that
