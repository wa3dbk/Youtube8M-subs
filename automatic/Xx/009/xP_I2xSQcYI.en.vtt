00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so so once you figured that out now we

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
so so once you figured that out now we
got<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> figure<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.759> foods<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
there okay so step two is figuring out

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.170 
there okay so step two is figuring out
what<00:01:42.960> foods<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> put<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.920> each<00:01:44.100> meal<00:01:44.490> now

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
so wheats multi grains and basically

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.580 
so wheats multi grains and basically
anything<00:02:40.550> with<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> higher<00:02:41.360> fiber<00:02:42.050> content

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
anything with a higher fiber content

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.500 
anything with a higher fiber content
alright<00:02:43.280> most<00:02:44.180> known<00:02:44.780> as<00:02:45.110> complex<00:02:45.980> carbs<00:02:46.519> and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
alright most known as complex carbs and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.930 
alright most known as complex carbs and
then<00:02:47.750> again<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.680> doesn't<00:02:48.920> have<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
then again it doesn't have to be the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.900 
then again it doesn't have to be the
only<00:02:50.150> source<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.690> your<00:02:50.840> carb<00:02:51.080> intake<00:02:51.820> but<00:02:52.820> it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
has to be the majority and this is

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.229 
has to be the majority and this is
simply<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.400> ensure<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.940> you're<00:02:56.090> getting

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
you're going to get the average way way

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.400 
you're going to get the average way way
in<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.400> then<00:04:13.790> at<00:04:14.000> week<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.600> again

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410

those<00:04:18.650> two<00:04:18.980> average<00:04:19.519> weigh-ins<00:04:19.970> for<00:04:20.090> week<00:04:20.390> one

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
those two average weigh-ins for week one

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.660 
those two average weigh-ins for week one
and<00:04:20.750> two<00:04:20.930> then<00:04:21.560> you're<00:04:21.739> going<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.160> see<00:04:22.400> if

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
and two then you're going to see if

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.310 
and two then you're going to see if
you're<00:04:22.880> gaining<00:04:23.360> weight<00:04:23.540> if<00:04:23.780> you're<00:04:23.900> gaining

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
you're gaining weight if you're gaining

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.560 
you're gaining weight if you're gaining
weight<00:04:24.470> then<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.340> puts<00:04:25.670> you<00:04:25.820> in<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.120> surplus

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
weight then this puts you in a surplus

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.750 
weight then this puts you in a surplus
if<00:04:26.990> you're<00:04:27.110> maintaining<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:28.010> puts<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.640> at

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
if you're maintaining it puts you at

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.370 
if you're maintaining it puts you at
maintenance<00:04:29.000> level<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.660> if<00:04:29.810> you're<00:04:29.930> losing

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
maintenance level and if you're losing

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.790 
maintenance level and if you're losing
then<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.790> are<00:04:31.970> in<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.300> deficit<00:04:32.900> okay<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:33.770> all

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
then you are in a deficit okay so all

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.850 
then you are in a deficit okay so all
you<00:04:34.280> have<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.520> do<00:04:34.790> at<00:04:34.910> that<00:04:34.940> point<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.690> going<00:04:36.650> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
you have to do at that point is going to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.890 
you have to do at that point is going to
be<00:04:36.980> obviously<00:04:37.220> determine<00:04:38.120> whether<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:38.720> want

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
be obviously determine whether you want

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900 
be obviously determine whether you want
to<00:04:38.960> lose<00:04:39.170> weight<00:04:39.410> or<00:04:39.470> gain<00:04:39.770> weight<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.280> then

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
to lose weight or gain weight and then

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.450 
to lose weight or gain weight and then
adjust<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.840> meal<00:04:42.050> plan<00:04:42.260> accordingly<00:04:42.950> so<00:04:43.070> I'll

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
adjust the meal plan accordingly so I'll

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.620 
give you an example if you want to gain
weight<00:04:45.680> but<00:04:46.490> at<00:04:46.700> the<00:04:46.850> end<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.210> two<00:04:47.390> weeks

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
weight but at the end of the two weeks

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.630 
weight but at the end of the two weeks
you<00:04:47.840> notice<00:04:48.140> you're<00:04:48.440> at<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> maintenance<00:04:49.250> level

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
you notice you're at a maintenance level

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.910 
you notice you're at a maintenance level
then<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.420> want<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.660> slightly<00:04:50.960> increase<00:04:51.710> the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
increase the carbs serving slightly and

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.620 
increase the carbs serving slightly and
that<00:05:00.590> will<00:05:00.710> put<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.040> in<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.190> surplus<00:05:01.640> all<00:05:02.180> right

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
may be slightly the fat intake and then

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.650 
may be slightly the fat intake and then
continue<00:05:13.580> running<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.060> that's<00:05:14.210> going<00:05:14.420> to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
continue running it and that's going to

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.900 
continue running it and that's going to
ensure<00:05:14.930> that<00:05:15.380> you're<00:05:15.740> continuously<00:05:16.400> in<00:05:16.790> a
