and<00:01:53.700> battles<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> reason<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.860> personally

and battles so the reason I personally

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
and battles so the reason I personally
pick<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.729> Dane<00:01:57.030> axe<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> has<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
pick the Dane axe is because it has a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.770 
pick the Dane axe is because it has a
bit<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:58.799> reach<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> than<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> other<00:02:00.509> two

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
bit more reach on it than the other two

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.749 
bit more reach on it than the other two
axes<00:02:01.200> available<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.189> wanted<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> give

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
axes available to you I wanted to give

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.639 
axes available to you I wanted to give
myself<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.509> bit<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> break<00:02:04.140> because

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
myself a little bit of a break because

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.550 
myself a little bit of a break because
I'm<00:02:05.100> still<00:02:05.490> unsure<00:02:05.700> about<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.930> reach<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
I'm still unsure about the reach of a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.529 
I'm still unsure about the reach of a
lot<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> weaponry<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.849> manor<00:02:09.060> armors

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
lot of the weaponry in the manor armors

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.670 
lot of the weaponry in the manor armors
arsenal<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.920> figured<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.610> weapon<00:02:12.090> that

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
arsenal and I figured a weapon that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.559 
arsenal and I figured a weapon that
has<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.829> bit<00:02:13.340> more<00:02:13.370> reach<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.969> it<00:02:14.090> would<00:02:14.299> be<00:02:14.540> a

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
has a bit more reach to it would be a

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.229 
has a bit more reach to it would be a
little<00:02:14.930> bit<00:02:15.200> more<00:02:15.409> forgiving<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.189> me<00:02:16.459> as<00:02:16.640> I'm

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
little bit more forgiving to me as I'm

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.089 
little bit more forgiving to me as I'm
learning<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.719> play<00:02:17.900> style<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.439> class<00:02:18.829> and

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
learning the play style and class and

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.369 
learning the play style and class and
strategy<00:02:19.579> speaking<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.599> which<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:21.170> should

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
strategy speaking of which this should

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.470 
strategy speaking of which this should
be<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.739> last<00:02:22.069> class<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.730> touch<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.269> my

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
be the last class you touch in my

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.809 
be the last class you touch in my
opinion<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.079> highly<00:02:24.590> recommend<00:02:25.040> devoting<00:02:25.579> time

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
opinion I highly recommend devoting time

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.819 
opinion I highly recommend devoting time
into<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.299> other<00:02:26.480> three<00:02:26.750> classes<00:02:27.260> before<00:02:27.500> you

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
into the other three classes before you

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.520 
into the other three classes before you
even<00:02:28.040> get<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.579> man-at-arms<00:02:29.530> specifically

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
even get to the man-at-arms specifically

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.080 
even get to the man-at-arms specifically
because<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:31.069> lot<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.760> management

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
because a lot of the management

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.809 
because a lot of the management
strategies<00:02:32.989> relies<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.829> knowing<00:02:34.519> how<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
strategies relies on knowing how the

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.270 
strategies relies on knowing how the
other<00:02:35.120> classes<00:02:35.780> operate<00:02:36.439> on<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.709> battlefield

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
other classes operate on the battlefield

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.670 
other classes operate on the battlefield
the<00:02:38.150> distance<00:02:38.659> of<00:02:38.810> their<00:02:38.900> weapons<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.500> reach

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
the distance of their weapons the reach

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.589 
the distance of their weapons the reach
of<00:02:39.859> their<00:02:39.950> weapons<00:02:40.400> how<00:02:40.639> fast<00:02:40.969> they<00:02:41.239> can<00:02:41.299> move

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
of their weapons how fast they can move

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.929 
of their weapons how fast they can move
the<00:02:42.319> best<00:02:42.560> way<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.739> figure<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.219> stuff<00:02:43.280> out<00:02:43.700> is

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
the best way to figure that stuff out is

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.179 
the best way to figure that stuff out is
to<00:02:44.090> actually<00:02:44.239> play<00:02:44.750> with<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:45.139> class<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.950> I

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
to actually play with that class so I

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.860 
to actually play with that class so I
would<00:02:46.340> highly<00:02:46.669> recommend<00:02:46.700> dumping<00:02:47.450> some<00:02:47.629> time

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
would highly recommend dumping some time

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.990 
would highly recommend dumping some time
into<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.829> other<00:02:49.040> three<00:02:49.340> classes<00:02:49.819> before

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
into the other three classes before

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.659 
into the other three classes before
moving<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.019> man-at-arms<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:52.400> manor

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
moving on to the man-at-arms the manor

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.179 
moving on to the man-at-arms the manor
Arms<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.750> weakest<00:02:54.319> class<00:02:54.620> when<00:02:55.010> you're

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
Arms is the weakest class when you're

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.640 
Arms is the weakest class when you're
first<00:02:55.519> starting<00:02:55.700> out<00:02:56.180> as<00:02:56.419> a<00:02:56.450> beginner<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.469> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
first starting out as a beginner but the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280 
first starting out as a beginner but the
most<00:02:57.889> devastating<00:02:58.819> class<00:02:59.090> when<00:02:59.870> you're<00:03:00.049> an

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
most devastating class when you're an

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.849 
most devastating class when you're an
advanced<00:03:00.769> player<00:03:01.159> in<00:03:01.459> my<00:03:01.819> opinion<00:03:02.269> anyway

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
advanced player in my opinion anyway

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.970 
advanced player in my opinion anyway

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
play with this class and it's also why I

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.100

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
mentioned that a lot of the strategy

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.290 
mentioned that a lot of the strategy
behind<00:05:18.260> this<00:05:18.620> class<00:05:18.919> comes<00:05:19.340> from<00:05:19.730> knowing<00:05:20.150> how

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
behind this class comes from knowing how

the other classes operate moving on to

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.000 
the other classes operate moving on to

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
going to be pulling it out all that

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.920 
going to be pulling it out all that
often<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:37.430> only<00:05:37.640> scenario<00:05:37.970> where<00:05:38.480> I<00:05:38.510> might

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
often the only scenario where I might

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.080 
often the only scenario where I might
see<00:05:39.290> it<00:05:39.440> as<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.590> viable<00:05:40.100> weapon<00:05:40.430> is<00:05:40.760> if<00:05:40.910> you're

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
see it as a viable weapon is if you're

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.180
