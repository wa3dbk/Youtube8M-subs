00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:17.150
 You are dark confrontation and conflict 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:21.680
 I am afraid to experience pain, pain, and fear, but in fact you have only the dark you want 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.850
 Light is allowed to experience 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:32.079
 It is because the light knows 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 Nobody can recognize light as light if there is no darkness of interest 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:44.650
 So light loves reading unconditionally 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:52.990
 In other words, when you love darkness unconditionally, you no longer need to experience it 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:55.710
 Because at that time you treat the darkness as valuable as the light 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:01.780
 I'm a big paradox 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.610
 Is another, but Hodomono that to love the darkness unconditionally live in accordance with the passion 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.890
 include 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:13.180
 Because they fear the darkness what its thereby in the same direction as the darkness 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.200
 As a result , I experience the darkness as a result 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.380
 Please unconditionally love reading 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.920
 that way 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:25.180
 Yum becomes transparent 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.180
 Everyone is can also be experience also able to see the two people 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:34.659
 Always a lifeline to connect with light is also in everyone's as though was how dark look situation 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:42.039
 There is 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:45.929
 The reason why you can understand that is that light can not exist as well as light can not exist without it 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.929
 It can not exist without it 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.490
 It is also in you that you exist 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.330
 Four 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:01.740
 That there is both a relative and a darkness 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:03.220
 And you always be both and access if they both located in in you 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.670
 I can do it 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.670
 What Light and Dark are Together It is because it is an inherent wave of unconditional love
