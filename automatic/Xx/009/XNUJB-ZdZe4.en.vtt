00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.430
 hello to all and welcome to the place 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.100
 will give you back today we find ourselves 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.960
 for the customization of a dock 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.570
 to have several docs like you 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.940
 can see it on my blog 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.920
 thanks to the application two heads so 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.620
 auction makes a small application 5 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.750
 mega about so you install it and 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.730
 will simply ask you if you 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.090
 want to open it directly to 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.950
 opening your mac or no it's 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.199
 as you want so he comes to himself 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.949
 place in the pool of menus so here 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.409
 as you can see 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.749
 we can simply add a new 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.760
 dock so here you ask for the 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:50.239
 rename for example if I call design 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.789
 like these one can choose the size 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:58.219
 of the dock so means here choose the 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.229
 the position so left to the right in 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.909
 up or down so I'm going to put it to 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.260
 right 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.720
 then we can simply choose 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.540
 self riding so that means the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.870
 mask and like like the two that are 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.340
 here on the left and up 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.380
 then we can choose the color of the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.170
 mourning after that is how you want 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.000
 which I will leave blank if we 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.620
 found in items 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.390
 we can simply choose them 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.340
 in our applications so there as I 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.850
 put design and I'm just going 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.100
 added photoshop like these and 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.770
 click open so we could 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.900
 see photoshop got here if you 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.460
 want to add more items there 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.200
 you are simply enough to 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.720
 select the one you want so 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.340
 for example illustrator and click on 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.120
 open and there you can see that the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.010
 dock is created with its icons has it 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.520
 then what else is there 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.550
 simply 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.590
 you can add as I say them this 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.490
 so you want that so far these 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.950
 good so there we could see it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.420
 had self-riding that means that I 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.720
 back on the desk he leaves 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.510
 so the masking is removed so if we 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.980
 wants to create a workspace 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.679
 you simply need to 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.330
 click here and there where you can create 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.890
 another workspace if by 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.560
 example really wanted to have several 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.490
 mourning that we will name for example 2 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.040
 2 and we can even add 1 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.880
 a keyboard shortcut so shortcut 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.590
 keyboard and I like to be commands y can 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.270
 not be used so we will put shift 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.820
 orders 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.650
 b here are just commands b and there we can 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.260
 simply add new ones 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.570
 applications like this here etc 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.100
 and as soon as that is done then you 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.190
 simple it is not enough for you 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.950
 to press shift commands b for my 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.360
 apart and it will show your dock that you 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.660
 lead your workspace that you 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.750
 just created if you want 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.270
 return to your workspace 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.250
 home you click on wheels but there you 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.570
 have again both of you 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.430
 have created from the very beginning so you can 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.200
 really create workspaces 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.120
 to make the difference between a 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.700
 workspace let's say that if age 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.010
 called the new chief commands b I 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.360
 go to the workspace so doc 2 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.720
 and if I come back to the workplace 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.550
 at M 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.960
 I find again all my 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.930
 applications so could really have 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.900
 a lot of two different then we 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.090
 will continue on good the display 1280 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.980
 by 800 is the display of my macbook 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.810
 pro 13 inches for you if you have a 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.080
 another another 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.280
 another display that would be different 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.920
 then in the preferences 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.270
 we can choose the size of the font 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.230
 we can automatically choose the 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.870
 masking the masking delay it's like 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.280
 to be manifestation it's not at all 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.460
 that it is necessary to test that it is the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.300
 preview size preview time 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.090
 opacity of simply low 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.100
 dudok as wanted to see him after that 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.660
 was shown documents etc 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.040
 I'll let you see all this 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.630
 I did not do everything to you translations 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.820
 because personally I can not 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.230
 not translate everything so that's what 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.570
 was really this application 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.030
 the tutorial is more or less long but 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.620
 really it's very important to know 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.760
 already nothing but the workplaces if 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.200
 you start creating a lot and 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.490
 you know even more how to get back on 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.380
 the starting one who is Roma 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.210
 so it's just here that this 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.440
 so here is a little bit 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.210
 all I had to say about this 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.400
 application in any case if I him 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.420
 give note i would give ten out of ten 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.660
 without hesitation she is true 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.340
 very high performance and the coating of the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.140
 all in the capacity of your computer 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.050
 they do not make me much more 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.610
 woodpecker or nothing at all so here I am 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.560
 leave you on his last words in 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.730
