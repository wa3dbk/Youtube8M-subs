on<00:00:52.059> with<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.210> few<00:00:52.449> tweaks<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.170> approach<00:00:53.410> to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
on with a few tweaks is the approach to

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.860 
on with a few tweaks is the approach to
design<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.250> control<00:00:54.730> layout<00:00:57.089> ok<00:00:58.089> so<00:00:58.150> let's

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
design and control layout ok so let's

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.420 
design and control layout ok so let's
talk<00:00:59.170> specs<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:01.629> XE<00:01:02.470> one<00:01:02.680> use<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.070> same

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
talk specs so the XE one use the same

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.880 
talk specs so the XE one use the same
sensor<00:01:04.000> as<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.239> expert<00:01:05.049> one<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.500> 16

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
sensor as the expert one so 16

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.620 
sensor as the expert one so 16
megapixels<00:01:08.100> lens<00:01:09.100> as<00:01:09.430> well<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:10.030> does<00:01:10.270> use<00:01:10.510> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
megapixels lens as well it does use the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.230 
megapixels lens as well it does use the
