long nosed golf clubs and today I'm

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.820 
long nosed golf clubs and today I'm
going<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.360> hit<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.960> first<00:00:10.110> time<00:00:10.410> and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
going to hit one for the first time and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:26.810 
going to hit one for the first time and
see<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.099> far<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.429> goes<00:00:24.830> that<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> good<00:00:26.279> shot

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
see how far it goes that was a good shot

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630 
see how far it goes that was a good shot
and<00:00:26.910> I'll<00:00:27.779> paste<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.289> there<00:00:28.470> 175<00:00:29.369> yards

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and I'll paste that out there 175 yards

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
and I'll paste that out there 175 yards
so<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.390> pretty<00:00:30.810> happy<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.529> really

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
so I'm pretty happy about that really

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.889 
so I'm pretty happy about that really
this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.820> about<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.239> best<00:00:33.390> feathery<00:00:33.750> I've

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
this is about the best feathery I've

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:54.939 
this is about the best feathery I've
made<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> date<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.070> we'll<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.340> how<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.579> goes

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.020 

actually<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.579> quite<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> nice

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
actually that was really quite a nice

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.979 
actually that was really quite a nice
shot<00:00:57.469> probably<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.890> 120<00:00:59.820> yards<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.840> bit

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
shot probably about 120 yards and a bit

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.850 
shot probably about 120 yards and a bit
of<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> draw<00:01:02.570> okay<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> third<00:01:04.589> shot

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of a draw okay so this is the third shot

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:17.490 
of a draw okay so this is the third shot
with<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.309> feather

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.140 

again<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.250> was<00:01:18.340> pretty<00:01:18.520> straight<00:01:18.850> but

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
again it was pretty straight but

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.130 
again it was pretty straight but
probably<00:01:19.990> about<00:01:20.370> 95<00:01:21.370> yards<00:01:21.820> again<00:01:22.110> okay<00:01:23.110> so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
probably about 95 yards again okay so

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.920 
probably about 95 yards again okay so
this<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:23.710> feathery<00:01:24.550> that's<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.510> bit<00:01:25.660> bigger

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
this is a feathery that's a bit bigger

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.550 
this is a feathery that's a bit bigger
than<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.380> last<00:01:26.860> one<00:01:27.960> probably<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.050> bit<00:01:29.200> heavier

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
than the last one probably a bit heavier

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.640 
than the last one probably a bit heavier
but<00:01:30.070> it's<00:01:30.250> not<00:01:30.670> as<00:01:30.880> round<00:01:31.290> we'll<00:01:32.290> see<00:01:32.410> how<00:01:32.500> this

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
but it's not as round we'll see how this

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:45.270 
but it's not as round we'll see how this
goes

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.860 

okay<00:01:46.000> that's<00:01:46.240> going<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.420> see<00:01:46.630> whether<00:01:46.810> these

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
okay that's going to see whether these

00:01:46.870 --> 00:02:45.520 
okay that's going to see whether these
balls<00:01:47.170> finished

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.199 

don't<00:02:46.100> place

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.709 

well<00:02:50.140> we<00:02:50.349> can<00:02:50.500> see<00:02:50.620> from<00:02:50.799> this<00:02:50.920> ball<00:02:51.209> it's<00:02:52.209> the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
well we can see from this ball it's the

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.770 
well we can see from this ball it's the
one<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.620> had<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.799> two<00:02:54.099> split<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.489> seams<00:02:54.790> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
one that had the two split the seams it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.440 
one that had the two split the seams it
definitely<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.849> mad<00:02:57.849> it's<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.060> last<00:02:58.209> day<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.359> a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
definitely is mad it's the last day of a

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.039 
definitely is mad it's the last day of a
shot<00:02:58.689> because<00:02:59.310> you<00:03:00.310> can<00:03:00.459> see<00:03:00.689> that<00:03:01.689> all<00:03:01.810> the

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
shot because you can see that all the

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:47.120 
shot because you can see that all the
feathers<00:03:02.409> are<00:03:03.310> coming<00:03:03.609> out<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:29.079> stop

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.340 

one<00:03:48.120> thing<00:03:48.270> you<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:48.600> have<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.050> do<00:03:49.200> with

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
one thing you really have to do with

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.350 
one thing you really have to do with
this<00:03:49.440> clump<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.280> just<00:03:50.640> tee<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.150> ball<00:03:51.180> up

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
this clump is to just tee the ball up

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.620 
this clump is to just tee the ball up
just<00:03:52.050> above<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.380> surface
