00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.269 
of high school and I think part of this
film<00:00:20.490> though<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.300> cup<00:00:22.039> when<00:00:23.039> Emma's

notices<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> he<00:00:27.000> doesn't<00:00:27.660> notice<00:00:27.960> much<00:00:28.349> about

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
notices and he doesn't notice much about

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
notices and he doesn't notice much about
other<00:00:29.310> kids<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.970> his<00:00:30.119> school<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.660> she's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
other kids in his school but when she's

so<00:00:33.300> why<00:00:33.690> don't<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.020> ever<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.530> work<00:00:34.710> on

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
so why don't you ever do your work on

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.190 
so why don't you ever do your work on
the<00:00:35.309> Teflon<00:00:35.730> slacker<00:00:35.910> they're<00:00:36.809> really<00:00:37.020> weird

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the Teflon slacker they're really weird

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.910 
the Teflon slacker they're really weird
I<00:00:37.620> should<00:00:38.010> hang<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.809> Sally<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.170> George<00:00:40.590> their

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I should hang out Sally and George their

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.440 
I should hang out Sally and George their
relationship<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> very<00:00:41.640> odd<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.390> think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
relationship is very odd because I think

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.010 
relationship is very odd because I think
that<00:00:43.129> they<00:00:44.129> both<00:00:44.430> don't<00:00:45.000> understand<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that they both don't understand what the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
that they both don't understand what the
other<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.350> wants<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> two

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
other one wants so I think when the two

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.069 
other one wants so I think when the two
of<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.730> start<00:00:47.940> talking<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.719> kind<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
of them start talking it's this kind of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.810 
of them start talking it's this kind of
thing<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> figuring<00:00:49.829> each<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.610> can

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
thing of figuring each other out you can

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.979 
thing of figuring each other out you can
mistake<00:00:50.969> love<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.539> friendship<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
mistake love for friendship and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.290 
mistake love for friendship and
friendship<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.590> love<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.070> attraction<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
friendship for love and attraction for

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.410 
reality of an 18 year old and luckily I
had<00:01:48.950> Freddie<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.429> Emma<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.700> help<00:01:49.850> me<00:01:49.970> do<00:01:50.179> that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.460 
think that Gavin wrote something so
special<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.429> so<00:01:55.670> true<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.600> asked<00:01:57.200> was<00:01:57.350> it

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
special and so true and I asked was it

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.620 
special and so true and I asked was it
was<00:01:57.649> there<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.860> Sally<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:58.520> there<00:01:59.030> wasn't<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> way

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
was there a Sally and there wasn't a way

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.870 
was there a Sally and there wasn't a way

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
but she's kind of every girl I think

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.120 
but she's kind of every girl I think

that he ever liked and I think he wanted
to<00:02:04.190> make<00:02:04.280> her<00:02:04.670> kind<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:05.030> more<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:06.409> character

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
to make her kind of more of a character

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.319 
to make her kind of more of a character
that<00:02:07.520> everyone<00:02:07.850> can<00:02:08.090> relate<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:09.229> okay<00:02:10.329> I'm

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
allergic to hormones what hormones mine

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.229 
allergic to hormones what hormones mine
what<00:02:15.920> makes<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.459> other<00:02:16.579> getting<00:02:16.880> by<00:02:16.970> really

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
what makes the other getting by really

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.360 
what makes the other getting by really
appealing<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> fact<00:02:18.049> that<00:02:18.140> everyone<00:02:19.070> in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
appealing is the fact that everyone in

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.550 
appealing is the fact that everyone in
in<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.120> world<00:02:20.299> has<00:02:20.450> gone<00:02:20.600> through<00:02:20.780> those

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
in the world has gone through those

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.680 
in the world has gone through those
feelings<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.190> being<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.820> love<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.269> think<00:02:23.510> it's<00:02:23.600> a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
feelings of being in love I think it's a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.960 
feelings of being in love I think it's a
great<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:24.109> kind<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.380> enter<00:02:24.799> into<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
great that you kind of enter into the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.819 
great that you kind of enter into the
movie<00:02:26.329> before<00:02:26.780> they've<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.260> connected

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
movie before they've really connected

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.039 
movie before they've really connected
but<00:02:28.130> when<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.430> leave<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.390> know<00:02:29.540> there's<00:02:29.780> so

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
but when you leave you know there's so

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.120 
but when you leave you know there's so
much<00:02:30.170> ahead<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.560> them<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.829> I<00:02:30.859> think<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
much ahead to them and I think the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.050 
much ahead to them and I think the
little<00:02:31.280> ease

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.120
