what<00:00:00.359> you<00:00:00.510> really<00:00:00.719> see<00:00:01.079> is<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> ridership<00:00:02.190> that

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
what you really see is a ridership that

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.970 
what you really see is a ridership that
has<00:00:02.790> grown<00:00:03.120> largely<00:00:04.020> at<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.740> state

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
has grown largely at in the state

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.540 
has grown largely at in the state
corridors<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:06.000> we<00:00:06.720> have<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> lot<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.170> state

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
corridors and we have a lot of state

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.890 
corridors and we have a lot of state
support<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.700> business<00:00:08.880> especially<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.809> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
support and business especially in the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.080 
support and business especially in the
Midwest<00:00:10.349> there's<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.710> Midwest<00:00:11.099> hub<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.969> we

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
Midwest there's a Midwest hub that we

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.940 
Midwest there's a Midwest hub that we
operate<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:12.630> Illinois<00:00:13.049> Michigan<00:00:13.410> Wisconsin

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.510 
operate with Illinois Michigan Wisconsin
and<00:00:14.730> others<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.830> Northeast<00:00:17.250> Corridor

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
and others and the Northeast Corridor

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.689 
and others and the Northeast Corridor
has<00:00:17.970> had<00:00:18.270> great<00:00:18.810> growth<00:00:19.230> even<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.070> last<00:00:20.340> year

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
has had great growth even this last year

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.599 
has had great growth even this last year
that<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.090> our<00:00:21.270> leading<00:00:21.810> growth<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.010> there

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
that was our leading growth and there

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.640 
that was our leading growth and there
was<00:00:23.730> actually<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> reduction<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.500> long

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
was actually a reduction in the long

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.609 
was actually a reduction in the long
distance<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.340> also<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.380> state

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
distance and also the the the state

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.189 
distance and also the the the state
corridors<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:29.519> primarily<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
corridors because primarily because of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
corridors because primarily because of
the<00:00:31.349> delays<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> saw<00:00:32.369> happen<00:00:32.610> around<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the delays that we saw happen around the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.380 
the delays that we saw happen around the
Chicago<00:00:34.110> area<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.980> generally<00:00:35.489> we're<00:00:36.090> seeing

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
Chicago area but generally we're seeing

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.549 
Chicago area but generally we're seeing
a<00:00:36.890> demand<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.780> ridership<00:00:39.780> especially<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
a demand for ridership especially in the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.840 
a demand for ridership especially in the
Northeast<00:00:40.950> Corridor<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> state

holding up with that increased demand do

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
holding up with that increased demand do
you<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.190> ready<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> meet<00:00:48.300> the
