00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.820
 two years drove somewhere 20 thousand 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.599
 barrel antifreeze floated a couple drops 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.540
 oils here after the last long 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.539
 trips for kilometers five hundred six hundred 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.369
 on top appeared its own oil 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.369
 liquids somewhere around five millimeters 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.070
 this problem needs to be fought as 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.250
 can be faster 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.780
 as the oil begins to corrode the tubes with 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.550
 In time, they will begin to crack and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:14.680
 burst polazil on the internet learned 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:18.270
 several possible reasons one of 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 reasons may be 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 heat exchanger 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:31.320
 somewhere cracks can be and miss 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 oil to all cooling is another reason 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.400
 can be glasses under the injectors here 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.280
 under the nozzles are available 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.690
 aluminum cups with sealing 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.640
 rings with time rings dubeet and 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.320
 begins to miss the oil 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.380
 cooling system is still an option 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.890
 of course there may be a head gasket or 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 the very same head start with the simplest 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.050
 start bypassing the heat exchanger and later 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 and see if it will appear there 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.740
 oil heat exchangers where there should be 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.869
 outstanding liquid must first be drained 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.590
 coolant right here on 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.270
 there is a special place for the radiator 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:23.420
 designed to drain the fluid here 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.130
 this one and the birds need to wear slag and 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.170
 when you can unscrew the screwdriver this one 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.410
 here's a cork cooling merge through 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.410
 slag 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.870
 now take off the fuel filter to 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.410
 would be easier to get 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.170
 there are nuts on the heat exchanger 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.510
 can be unscrewed and bracket along with 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.580
 filter faces with them now need to be removed 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.600
 clamp and you can detach the tube 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.180
 connected heat exchanger tubes 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:12.720
 first who has the best visibility picked up the phone 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.260
 from the stove ring removed so that's Pasca 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.920
 sponge 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:22.170
 and then shot 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:27.440
 tubes on the cult heat exchanger itself 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.440
 filmed with ordinary pliers 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:41.750
 I will take such a tube at 16 and connect 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.750
 Whether tube connected hoses 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.910
 now you can ride some 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.230
 time and see 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.540
 does the level rise at the outputs 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.890
 heat exchanger does not float there from above 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.520
 oils then it will be clear he is guilty or 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.230
 something else was very uncomfortable 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:11.990
 remove the ring is something that really does not crawl 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.030
 half an hour there dared 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:19.709
 on a flank 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:23.290
 very dirty at the same time about my 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.960
 all set inlet and outlet heat exchanger 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.770
 just blocked the rim and tied 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.930
 gum will go a week then look 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.840
 appeared there something personal agained 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.470
 train a few hundred kilometers 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.479
 you can hide the cellophane and see 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.750
 whether there appeared oils removed cellophane 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.120
 oil in the tube is not observed level 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.280
 also did not rise means heat exchanger 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.820
 there is nothing to watch next 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.820
 already glasses
