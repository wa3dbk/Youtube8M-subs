thought it felt very good running on
hard<00:00:47.100> surface<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.969> slightly<00:00:48.600> different<00:00:48.989> yeah

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
hard surface was slightly different yeah

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.810 
hard surface was slightly different yeah
still<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.320> natural<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.100> felt<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> little

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
still was natural but it felt a little

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540 
still was natural but it felt a little
bit<00:00:53.969> funnier<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:55.230> are<00:00:55.440> better<00:00:55.829> videos<00:00:56.309> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
bit funnier there are better videos on

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000 
bit funnier there are better videos on
the<00:00:56.760> web<00:00:57.079> showing<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> results<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> running

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
more and down it just naturally seemed

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
more and down it just naturally seemed
to<00:01:17.610> happen<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> went<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.170> put<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.710> old

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
running shoes on with the thicker heels

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.320 
running shoes on with the thicker heels
on<00:01:22.200> him<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> thought<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.490> very<00:01:23.520> awkward<00:01:23.909> do

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
on him well I thought it very awkward do

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.429 
on him well I thought it very awkward do
land<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.229> forefoot<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.430> heel<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.479> down<00:01:28.200> too

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
land on my forefoot the heel is down too

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
land on my forefoot the heel is down too
much<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.100> something<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.850> back<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
much and something about the back of the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
much and something about the back of the
shoe<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.350> foot<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
shoe but I just your foot is kind of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.850 
shoe but I just your foot is kind of
pointed<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.659> did<00:01:34.170> find<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.710> was

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
pointed up so I did find it was

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
pointed up so I did find it was
difficult<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> forefoot<00:01:36.090> runner<00:01:36.420> with

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
difficult to be a forefoot runner with

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
difficult to be a forefoot runner with
the<00:01:37.020> big<00:01:37.200> wedge<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.829> shoes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the big wedge to shoes

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.810 
the big wedge to shoes
so<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.600> final<00:01:40.020> observations<00:01:40.829> they're<00:01:41.369> very

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
so my final observations they're very

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
so my final observations they're very
difficult<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.329> put<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.350> I'm<00:01:43.530> expecting

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
difficult to put on but I'm expecting

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.550 
difficult to put on but I'm expecting
that<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.460> easier<00:01:44.790> over<00:01:44.939> time<00:01:45.350> they<00:01:46.350> feel

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that will get easier over time they feel

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.899 
that will get easier over time they feel
very<00:01:46.979> natural<00:01:47.240> running<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.439> treadmill

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
very natural running on treadmill

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.580

these first runs but I haven't been

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.000 
these first runs but I haven't been
running<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.469> while

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
running for a while

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.830
