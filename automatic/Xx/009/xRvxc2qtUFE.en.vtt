picture<00:02:37.060> beside<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.630> shows<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.940> tell<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
picture beside it it shows a tell a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.850 
picture beside it it shows a tell a
shotgun<00:02:41.500> microphone<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:43.060> pickup<00:02:43.480> pattern

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
shotgun microphone this pickup pattern

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.440 
shotgun microphone this pickup pattern
but<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:46.360> basically<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:47.130> badly<00:02:48.450> amplifies

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
but it basically just badly amplifies

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.140 
but it basically just badly amplifies
the<00:02:49.780> sound<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> never<00:02:50.980> use<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.520> in<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.850> mode

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the sound so I never use it in that mode

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.810 
the sound so I never use it in that mode
I<00:02:52.500> always<00:02:53.500> use<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.070> normal<00:02:54.280> mode<00:02:54.520> because

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
I always use it in normal mode because

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.920 
I always use it in normal mode because
it<00:02:55.060> delivers<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.840> best<00:02:56.250> quality<00:02:57.250> sound<00:02:57.520> and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it delivers the best quality sound and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.000 
it delivers the best quality sound and
it<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.530> best<00:03:00.070> for<00:03:00.520> close<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.890> the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
it is best for close to this to the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.130 
it is best for close to this to the
subject<00:03:03.489> or<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.090> my<00:03:04.209> mouth<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.660> one<00:03:04.870> thing

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
subject or to my mouth the one thing

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.580 
subject or to my mouth the one thing
that's<00:03:05.350> kind<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.709> odd<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:08.140> really

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
that's kind of odd is that it is really

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.729 
that's kind of odd is that it is really
quiet<00:03:09.280> when<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.000> put<00:03:10.150> on<00:03:10.330> normal<00:03:10.690> mode<00:03:10.739> but

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
quiet when you put on normal mode but

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.420 
quiet when you put on normal mode but
you<00:03:11.770> can<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.489> simply<00:03:12.700> add<00:03:14.160> amplify<00:03:15.160> in

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
you can just simply add amplify in

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.690 
you can just simply add amplify in
audacity<00:03:16.150> or<00:03:16.750> some<00:03:16.989> other<00:03:17.230> sound<00:03:17.700> recording

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
audacity or some other sound recording

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.790 
audacity or some other sound recording
software<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.239> it'll<00:03:20.020> be<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.350> fine<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
software and it'll be just fine the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.650 
software and it'll be just fine the
noise<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.340> actually<00:03:21.640> really<00:03:22.060> good<00:03:22.330> on<00:03:22.510> this

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
noise is actually really good on this

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.290 
noise is actually really good on this
microphone<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.790> even<00:03:24.790> though<00:03:24.940> it's<00:03:25.120> like

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
microphone and even though it's like

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.130 
microphone and even though it's like
thirty<00:03:25.630> bucks

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
thirty bucks

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.090 
thirty bucks
it<00:03:26.800> delivers<00:03:27.220> super<00:03:28.150> clean<00:03:28.450> sound<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.620> is

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
it delivers super clean sound that is

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.600 
it delivers super clean sound that is
comparable<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.510> more<00:03:31.840> expensive

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
comparable to the more expensive

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.350 
comparable to the more expensive
microphones<00:03:33.610> like<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.959> rode<00:03:35.910> microphone<00:03:36.910> you

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
microphones like the rode microphone you

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.180 
microphones like the rode microphone you
can<00:03:37.540> see<00:03:37.750> it's<00:03:37.959> kind<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.799> looks

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
can see it's kind of it's it looks

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.190 
can see it's kind of it's it looks
exactly<00:03:39.489> like<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.910> shotgun<00:03:40.269> microphone<00:03:40.690> has

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
exactly like a shotgun microphone has

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.270 
exactly like a shotgun microphone has
the<00:03:41.799> notches<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.670> everything<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.560> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
the notches and everything that is the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.750 
the notches and everything that is the
norm<00:03:46.090> for<00:03:46.420> shotgun<00:03:47.080> microphones<00:03:47.530> but<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.489> just

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
norm for shotgun microphones but I just

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.750 
norm for shotgun microphones but I just
I<00:03:49.030> don't<00:03:49.299> see<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:50.049> removing<00:03:50.650> background<00:03:51.190> sound

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
I don't see it removing background sound

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.400 
I don't see it removing background sound
at<00:03:51.910> all<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.450> look<00:03:52.570> at<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.840> cable<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
at all if you look at the cable the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.910 
at all if you look at the cable the
cable<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.829> like<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.280> super<00:03:55.209> long<00:03:55.870> cable<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.799> I

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
cable is like a super long cable that I

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.240 
cable is like a super long cable that I
mean<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.910> wouldn't<00:03:58.570> normally<00:03:59.110> take<00:03:59.799> this<00:04:00.010> out

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
mean you wouldn't normally take this out

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.970 
mean you wouldn't normally take this out
all<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:01.090> way<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.260> maximum<00:04:02.709> length

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
all the way to the to the maximum length

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.699 
all the way to the to the maximum length
I<00:04:03.220> keep<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.910> on<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.980> monoprice<00:04:05.980> cable<00:04:06.790> wrap<00:04:07.360> so<00:04:08.230> I

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
I keep it on a monoprice cable wrap so I

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.830 
I keep it on a monoprice cable wrap so I
don't<00:04:09.220> have<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:10.680> unravel<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:12.010> when<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:13.420> need<00:04:13.660> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
don't have to unravel it when I need to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.349 
don't have to unravel it when I need to
use<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.350> for<00:04:14.680> just<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.430> being<00:04:15.820> next<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.239> my

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
use it for just it being next to my

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.750 
use it for just it being next to my
mouth<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.290> it's<00:04:17.530> great<00:04:17.829> that<00:04:17.859> they<00:04:18.280> gave<00:04:18.489> me

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
mouth so it's great that they gave me

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.420 
mouth so it's great that they gave me
the<00:04:19.570> possibility<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.410> use<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.799> really<00:04:21.100> long

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
the possibility to use it really long

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.600 
the possibility to use it really long
distances<00:04:22.060> but<00:04:22.840> of<00:04:23.110> course<00:04:23.350> I<00:04:23.530> for<00:04:24.190> just<00:04:24.460> these

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
distances but of course I for just these

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.180 
distances but of course I for just these
videos<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:25.060> don't<00:04:25.240> need<00:04:25.390> it<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.960> be<00:04:26.140> pulled<00:04:26.979> out

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
videos I don't need it to be pulled out

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.800 
videos I don't need it to be pulled out
so<00:04:27.580> long<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:29.200> don't<00:04:29.470> actually<00:04:29.710> do<00:04:30.070> that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
so long so I don't actually do that

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.990 
so long so I don't actually do that
now<00:04:31.260> beside<00:04:31.590> those<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.340> see<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.610> mounts

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000

around<00:05:15.500> $300<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.700> think<00:05:18.000> price-wise<00:05:18.600> and

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
around $300 so I think price-wise and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.719 
around $300 so I think price-wise and
quality<00:05:20.700> wise<00:05:21.110> it's<00:05:22.110> ratio<00:05:22.680> is<00:05:22.919> just<00:05:23.070> way<00:05:23.430> out

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
quality wise it's ratio is just way out

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.969 
quality wise it's ratio is just way out
of<00:05:23.970> there<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:24.150> mean<00:05:24.419> you<00:05:25.020> can<00:05:25.229> use<00:05:25.680> this

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
of there I mean you can use this

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.659 
of there I mean you can use this
microphone<00:05:26.840> for<00:05:27.840> videos<00:05:28.620> YouTube<00:05:29.160> videos<00:05:29.460> and

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
microphone for videos YouTube videos and

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.270 
microphone for videos YouTube videos and
stuff<00:05:29.820> like<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.240> but<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.410> think<00:05:31.710> for<00:05:31.979> movies

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
stuff like that but I think for movies

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.310 
stuff like that but I think for movies
where<00:05:32.550> you<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:33.210> have<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.750> do<00:05:33.930> long<00:05:34.290> range

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
where you you have to do long range

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.240 
where you you have to do long range
stuff<00:05:35.690> since<00:05:36.690> this<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.290> don't<00:05:37.590> think<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.890> is<00:05:38.010> a

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
stuff since this I don't think it is a

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.560 
stuff since this I don't think it is a
true<00:05:38.640> shotgun<00:05:39.600> microphone<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.380> can<00:05:40.890> pick<00:05:41.250> up

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
true shotgun microphone that can pick up

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.290 
true shotgun microphone that can pick up
sound<00:05:42.570> from<00:05:42.720> really<00:05:43.050> far<00:05:43.229> away<00:05:43.380> it's<00:05:43.800> not<00:05:44.340> that

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
sound from really far away it's not that

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.130 
sound from really far away it's not that
great<00:05:45.600> because<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:46.680> shot<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:47.160> movie<00:05:47.840> using<00:05:48.840> it

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
great because I shot a movie using it

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.860 
great because I shot a movie using it
and<00:05:49.260> actually<00:05:49.770> that<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.580> sound<00:05:51.030> from<00:05:51.390> the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
and actually that the sound from the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.890 
and actually that the sound from the
camera<00:05:52.590> itself<00:05:53.010> turned<00:05:53.820> out<00:05:54.000> better<00:05:54.270> than<00:05:54.840> the

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
camera itself turned out better than the

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.550
