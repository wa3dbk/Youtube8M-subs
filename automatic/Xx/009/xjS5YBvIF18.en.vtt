00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello marc pons guardian's world 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.370
 points like your online store 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.650
 goalkeepers 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.139
 we present the adidas glove 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.290
 pro predators 2014 of the collection 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.000
 spring-summer and 2014 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.230
 no real change on the bench not 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.810
 Technical developments 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.390
 technology on the predator model 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.950
 it's just the color that changes 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.890
 who evolves and who goes with 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.259
 with the range has the current range we 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:38.780
 find this color on the shoes 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:42.860
 on the textile so the glove with 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.040
 negative seams so the glove and shots 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.820
 mouth up is delivered to the place 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.180
 so the seams are inside 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.420
 you have latex on the entire dorsal 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.940
 of the glove you have the push rolling the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.910
 latex that goes back as of course the side 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.879
 no sewing at that level and the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.090
 latex that goes back well to the level of 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.409
 scaphoid 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.090
 the low closing system 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.130
 already know that we have already seen 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.120
 old predator versions well 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.909
 elastic broadband the entrance tunnel 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:26.420
 in the glove and the body of the bench and in 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:29.479
 neoprene textile the welcome in the bath 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.840
 is nice we feel the thickness of 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:39.470
 foam so three and a half us that marty 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.770
 health 4 mm is not bad a good 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.770
 hangs 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.950
 there is this little system there that is 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.799
 system that we start to see anyway 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.630
 everywhere the origin was rush the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.460
 missed pool that allows to put on 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.330
 the glove correctly we still 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.400
 already a first hand who write so 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.470
 the double scratch closure system 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.560
 we may already be tight 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.950
 first and come and shake the second 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.779
 it's not bad we are well maintained I 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.840
 will loosen even a bit if I will 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:21.079
 meaning in the hand so here at the level 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.659
 know how it is between 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:28.849
 happy at home or sport here you have 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.370
 an area of ​​personalization so the gift 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.559
 is customizable of course because 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.709
 that the area is really small so 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:41.680
 avoid name surname family address etc 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.680
 I think that the initials are enough 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.329
 here in the adidas packaging you 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.629
 also find a gloves cleaner 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.909
 it's nice you can test it 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.879
 test the cleaning of vauban with a 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:59.209
 special concept sof allow to see 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.900
 that's it it was mark for universe of the
