00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
it's point 2 millimeters thick so it's

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.509 
it's point 2 millimeters thick so it's
very<00:00:44.839> very<00:00:45.019> thin<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.100> let's<00:00:46.220> go<00:00:46.339> ahead<00:00:46.370> and

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
very very thin so let's go ahead and

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
inside and it's a bit tricky there's a

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.570 
inside and it's a bit tricky there's a
little<00:00:51.019> pull<00:00:51.470> tab<00:00:51.769> at<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:51.979> bottom<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.489> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.600 
packaging and I fail to see that at
first<00:00:54.350> just<00:00:54.890> go<00:00:54.979> ahead<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:55.159> pull<00:00:55.339> that<00:00:55.460> open

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
first just go ahead and pull that open

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.609 
first just go ahead and pull that open
and<00:00:55.940> then<00:00:56.150> the<00:00:56.269> bottom<00:00:56.570> will<00:00:57.110> open<00:00:57.470> and<00:00:57.589> you

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
and then the bottom will open and you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.770 
and then the bottom will open and you
can<00:00:57.769> slide<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.309> little<00:00:58.610> styrofoam<00:00:59.299> tray<00:00:59.570> out

actually<00:01:30.800> pry<00:01:31.250> up<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.520> corner<00:01:31.909> it'll<00:01:32.300> also<00:01:32.570> come

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
actually pry up a corner it'll also come

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.570 
actually pry up a corner it'll also come
in<00:01:33.200> use<00:01:33.409> if<00:01:33.620> you<00:01:33.740> want<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.070> take<00:01:34.280> off<00:01:34.460> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
screen shield later on in the future so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.050 
screen shield later on in the future so
make<00:01:36.380> sure<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:36.590> save<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.670> remove<00:01:37.940> it

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
make sure you save it you can remove it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.640 
make sure you save it you can remove it
with<00:01:38.210> your<00:01:38.360> fingers<00:01:38.659> but<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.050> bit<00:01:39.290> hard

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
with your fingers but it's a bit hard

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.830 
with your fingers but it's a bit hard
this<00:01:40.340> tool<00:01:40.580> actually<00:01:40.790> helps<00:01:41.300> when<00:01:41.480> removing

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
this tool actually helps when removing

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.450 
this tool actually helps when removing
it<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.230> go<00:01:42.409> ahead<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.710> save<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.130> put<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.310> to

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
it so go ahead and save it and put it to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.130 
it so go ahead and save it and put it to
the<00:01:43.490> side<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:44.060> here's<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.420> quick<00:01:44.690> look<00:01:44.870> at<00:01:45.050> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
screen protector prior to installing it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.280 
screen protector prior to installing it
and<00:01:47.150> as<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:47.540> see<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.900> looks<00:01:48.050> like<00:01:48.170> a

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
and as you can see it looks like a

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.320 
and as you can see it looks like a
regular<00:01:48.620> static<00:01:49.250> clean<00:01:49.520> screen<00:01:49.820> protector<00:01:50.210> it

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
regular static clean screen protector it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.670 
regular static clean screen protector it
looks<00:01:50.479> like<00:01:50.600> it's<00:01:50.750> nothing<00:01:50.930> fancy<00:01:51.320> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
looks like it's nothing fancy it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.260 
looks like it's nothing fancy it
definitely<00:01:52.220> doesn't<00:01:52.400> look<00:01:52.580> like<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.820> tempered

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
definitely doesn't look like a tempered

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.060 
definitely doesn't look like a tempered
glass<00:01:53.300> screen<00:01:53.479> protector<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.409> fact<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.860> looks

glass screen protector in fact it looks

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.790 
glass screen protector in fact it looks
more<00:01:55.340> like<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.940> I<00:01:55.970> loom<00:01:56.510> flex<00:01:56.870> series<00:01:57.290> now

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
more like the I loom flex series now

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.140 
more like the I loom flex series now
here's<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.040> quick<00:01:58.250> look<00:01:58.400> at<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.670> from<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.909> side

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
here's a quick look at it from the side

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.149 
here's a quick look at it from the side
and<00:01:59.570> as<00:01:59.720> you<00:01:59.840> can<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.320> hardly<00:02:00.680> notice<00:02:00.950> it

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
and as you can see you hardly notice it

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.800 
and as you can see you hardly notice it
on<00:02:01.280> your<00:02:01.490> phone<00:02:01.640> whatsoever<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:02.510> it's<00:02:02.630> very

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
on your phone whatsoever so it's very

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.140 
on your phone whatsoever so it's very
very<00:02:03.140> slim<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.130> does<00:02:04.310> not<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.790> rounded

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
very slim and it does not have rounded

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.030 
very slim and it does not have rounded
edges<00:02:05.540> because<00:02:05.690> it<00:02:05.930> does<00:02:06.080> not<00:02:06.110> need<00:02:06.590> rounded

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
edges because it does not need rounded

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.249 
edges because it does not need rounded
edges<00:02:07.370> since<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.030> not<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.239> full<00:02:08.659> out<00:02:08.869> tempered

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
edges since it's not a full out tempered

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.110 
edges since it's not a full out tempered
glass<00:02:09.289> screen<00:02:09.440> protector<00:02:10.220> it's<00:02:10.429> not<00:02:10.759> going<00:02:10.940> to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
glass screen protector it's not going to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.670 
glass screen protector it's not going to
be<00:02:11.240> prone<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.780> chipping<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.319> things<00:02:12.530> like

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
be prone to chipping and things like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.730 
be prone to chipping and things like
that<00:02:12.740> which<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.400> excellent<00:02:13.910> now<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:15.200> install

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
that which is excellent now the install

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.480 
that which is excellent now the install
of<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:16.130> screen

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
of this screen

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.070 
of this screen
was<00:02:16.970> probably<00:02:17.180> one<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.810> most<00:02:17.960> difficult

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
was probably one of the most difficult

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080 
was probably one of the most difficult
installs<00:02:18.920> I've<00:02:19.070> had<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> screen<00:02:19.880> shield

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
installs I've had with a screen shield

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.120 
installs I've had with a screen shield
only<00:02:20.510> because<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.080> slimness<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
only because of the slimness the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.220 
only because of the slimness the
flexibility<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.540> was<00:02:23.870> very<00:02:24.050> very

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
flexibility of it it was very very

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.960 
flexibility of it it was very very
difficult<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.950> had<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.220> actually<00:02:25.400> pry<00:02:25.910> it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
difficult and I had to actually pry it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.240 
difficult and I had to actually pry it
up<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.180> few<00:02:26.390> times<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:27.110> remove<00:02:27.500> pieces<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.040> lint

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
up a few times to remove pieces of lint

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.040 
up a few times to remove pieces of lint
that<00:02:28.430> got<00:02:28.550> trapped<00:02:28.790> underneath<00:02:29.120> there<00:02:29.480> but

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
that got trapped underneath there but

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.720 
that got trapped underneath there but
the<00:02:30.200> beauty<00:02:30.560> behind<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.010> screen<00:02:31.280> shield<00:02:31.490> is

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
the beauty behind the screen shield is

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.850 
the beauty behind the screen shield is
it<00:02:31.970> has<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.480> properties<00:02:32.960> of<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.200> static<00:02:33.560> cling

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
it has the properties of a static cling

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.560 
it has the properties of a static cling
so<00:02:34.310> you're<00:02:34.460> going<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.610> be<00:02:34.760> able<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:35.030> remove<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
so you're going to be able to remove it

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.810 
so you're going to be able to remove it
and<00:02:35.720> use<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.590> dust<00:02:37.010> removal<00:02:37.370> sticker<00:02:37.610> to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
and use that dust removal sticker to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.220 
and use that dust removal sticker to
remove<00:02:38.090> any<00:02:38.270> piece<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.660> debris<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.050> got

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
remove any piece of debris that got

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.230 
remove any piece of debris that got
caught<00:02:39.380> underneath<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.950> over<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.400> over<00:02:40.580> but

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
caught underneath it over and over but

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.790 
caught underneath it over and over but
after<00:02:41.360> using<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.930> little<00:02:42.170> tool<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.440> actually

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
after using the little tool to actually

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.070 
after using the little tool to actually
pry<00:02:43.250> up<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.460> screen<00:02:43.820> shield<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.360> notice<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:44.990> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
pry up the screen shield I notice in the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.320 
pry up the screen shield I notice in the
corners<00:02:45.470> where<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> used<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.490> did<00:02:46.940> not<00:02:46.970> want

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
corners where I used it it did not want

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330 
corners where I used it it did not want
to<00:02:47.480> adhere<00:02:47.660> correctly<00:02:48.470> anymore<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.040> as<00:02:49.190> you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
to adhere correctly anymore so as you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.400 
to adhere correctly anymore so as you
see<00:02:49.550> here<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.940> top<00:02:50.180> two<00:02:50.450> corners<00:02:50.900> it's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
see here in the top two corners it's

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.440 
see here in the top two corners it's
almost<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.310> screen<00:02:52.850> protector<00:02:53.270> got

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
almost like the screen protector got

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.810 
almost like the screen protector got
damaged<00:02:54.050> when<00:02:54.320> prying<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:54.890> up<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.550> could

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
damaged when prying it up and I could
