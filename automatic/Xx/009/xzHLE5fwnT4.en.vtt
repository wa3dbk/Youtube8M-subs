PlayStation controller when can we
expect<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.870> PlayStation<00:01:04.440> controller

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
expect that PlayStation controller

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.960 
expect that PlayStation controller
should<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.220> ready<00:01:05.400> by<00:01:05.489> mid-september

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
should be ready by mid-september

should be ready by mid-september
mid-september<00:01:06.979> how<00:01:07.979> much<00:01:08.159> BB<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:09.300> on<00:01:09.450> forty

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
mid-september how much BB are on forty

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.240 
mid-september how much BB are on forty
dollars<00:01:10.080> three<00:01:10.409> dollars

dollars three dollars

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.350 
dollars three dollars
so<00:01:12.820> how<00:01:12.940> does<00:01:13.000> this<00:01:13.090> work

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
so how does this work

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.030 
so how does this work
I<00:01:14.420> were<00:01:15.140> looking<00:01:15.410> for<00:01:15.590> dumb<00:01:16.550> dick

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
it's program to move the joystick it

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.290 
it's program to move the joystick it
goes<00:01:25.900> ahead

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
goes ahead

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.320 
goes ahead

now<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:40.050> black<00:01:40.260> piece<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.690> let<00:01:42.690> me

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
now if the black piece on that let me

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.540 
now if the black piece on that let me
see<00:01:42.960> better<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> place<00:01:43.680> listen<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.430> a

default receiver right that you've

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.950 
default receiver right that you've
interface<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.980> some<00:01:47.880> new<00:01:48.000> hardware<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.750> can

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
interface with some new hardware you can

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
interface with some new hardware you can
buy<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> receiver<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.850> controller<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.420> them

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
buy the receiver and controller for them

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020 
buy the receiver and controller for them
to<00:01:51.690> reference<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.260> ok<00:01:52.800> so<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.760> receiver

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
to reference but ok so the receiver

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.360 
to reference but ok so the receiver
doesn't<00:01:54.270> come<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> hardware<00:01:55.830> this<00:01:56.220> is

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
doesn't come with the hardware this is

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.890 
doesn't come with the hardware this is
what<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.550> does<00:01:56.640> come<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:56.850> da<00:01:57.120> oh<00:01:57.330> he<00:01:57.690> doesn't

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
what it does come with da oh he doesn't

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.290 
what it does come with da oh he doesn't
come<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.290> our<00:01:58.380> hardware<00:01:58.890> ok<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.730> assume<00:02:00.120> that

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
come with our hardware ok I assume that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.410 
come with our hardware ok I assume that
most<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.810> kid<00:02:00.960> will<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.350> it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
most of the kid will have it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
most of the kid will have it
they<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.320> some<00:02:04.560> fun<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.950> played<00:02:05.220> with

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
they can have some fun with played with

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.940 
they can have some fun with played with
the<00:02:05.549> next<00:02:05.939> year<00:02:06.060> over<00:02:06.299> rather<00:02:06.540> than

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.820 

very<00:02:09.520> nice<00:02:09.700> there<00:02:10.539> are<00:02:10.840> 14<00:02:11.200> buttons<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.680> this

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
very nice there are 14 buttons on this

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.490 
very nice there are 14 buttons on this
and<00:02:12.069> two<00:02:12.190> analog<00:02:12.610> joystick<00:02:13.030> with<00:02:13.180> two<00:02:13.360> axis<00:02:13.780> so

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and two analog joystick with two axis so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250 
and two analog joystick with two axis so
you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.739> even<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:15.129> not<00:02:15.340> oh<00:02:15.610> that's<00:02:15.970> awesome

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.530 

we<00:02:18.739> are<00:02:18.860> hardly<00:02:19.129> using<00:02:19.519> anything<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:20.360> when

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
we are hardly using anything like when

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.030 
we are hardly using anything like when
guys<00:02:20.750> they<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.110> three<00:02:21.319> buttons<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.769> are<00:02:21.860> using

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
guys they can three buttons we are using

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.600 
guys they can three buttons we are using
what's<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.030> range<00:02:23.379> range<00:02:24.379> probably<00:02:24.650> it's

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
what's the range range probably it's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.769 
what's the range range probably it's
really<00:02:25.849> not<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.299> check<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.500> go
