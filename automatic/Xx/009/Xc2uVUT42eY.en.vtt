00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.325
 In one version of the myth of the ancient Greeks, 

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:13.311
 the kingdom of Crete defeats Athens during the war and forces its inhabitants to make regular sacrifices, 

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.806
 to remind you of your power. 

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:21.854
 Athenian boys and girls are taken as a tribute and locked in a vast labyrinth, 

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.546
 where they are hunted down and devoured by the monstrous Minotaur. 

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:31.852
 These cruel crimes continue until one day a hero appears in Athens, 

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:33.911
 a young man named Teres, 

00:00:33.912 --> 00:00:37.452
 who voluntarily takes the place of one of the convicted boys. 

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.927
 Sounds familiar? 

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:43.837
 Yes, because Suzanne Collins, author of popular books "The Hunger Games", 

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:48.308
 she consciously drew on ancient legends when she wrote her series. 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.067
 Young Theseus proves that he is a hero: 

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:56.771
 With the help of the king's daughter, he finds his way through the maze and kills the Minotaur. 

00:00:56.772 --> 00:01:02.108
 Ends the time of trouble and no one has to die anymore. 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.657
 In ancient Rome, we find a similar story that may sound familiar to fans of the "Hunger Games." 

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:15.323
 Gladiator Spartacus is forced as a slave to fight for life and death in the arena 

00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:20.204
 in a spectacle to entertain the political elite and calm the masses. 

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:25.093
 However, he refuses to adhere to the rules of a macabre game. 

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:30.923
 He leads other slaves to an uprising against the Roman Empire in the first century BC, 

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.873
 and his name becomes a symbol of shouting for freedom. 

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:42.383
 Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of the death games trilogy, inherits both Theseus and Spartacus's scepter. 

00:01:42.384 --> 00:01:49.487
 It becomes part of the struggle for freedom, part of the political revolution and a hero of coercion. 

00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:53.715
 Her world has been updated to symbolize our modern fears, 

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:58.813
 her government uses advanced technology to spy on its citizens, 

00:01:58.814 --> 00:02:00.328
 and even attacking them; 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.276
 propaganda is combined with the television show 

00:02:03.277 --> 00:02:11.511
 - ultimately, history affects us with such strength, because it reaches for a fight that has been taking place for thousands of years. 

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:17.223
 As a professor of intellectual history who specializes in the tradition of dystopia, 

00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:23.818
 I think it is important to consider why these stories have such a good effect on us. 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.166
 Stories about Theseus, Spartacus and Katniss, 

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:33.092
 they all proclaim the same story of rulers using coercive measures 

00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:36.030
 and individuals appearing against them. 

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.921
 These heroes do not want to become new tyrants themselves. 

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:45.133
 They just want to be able to decide their own lives and let others do the same. 

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:49.757
 We find similar heroes in many other episodes of history, 

00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:54.090
 we talk about them in our films, novels and songs. 

00:02:54.091 --> 00:03:02.117
 They move our hearts, because the struggle between freedom and power remains a very real part of our world. 

00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:07.149
 In every place, people long for the freedom to pursue their own goals and dreams. 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.026
 These stories are not just entertainment. 

00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:15.322
 It is a reflection of who and what we are. 

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:22.901
