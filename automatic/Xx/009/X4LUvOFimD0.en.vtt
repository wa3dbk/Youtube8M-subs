00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.180
 it was from the internet and people who are not going 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.880
 late without a time limit we are with 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.980
 the cybernetic how are you and see a 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.349
 important fight exposing the championships 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.329
 of tercias before two tercias because 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.549
 they've been kind of messing in the 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.650
 lately, triplemania 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.500
 I think that's the first defense 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.000
 that we are going to have the brothers and in 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.029
 triplemania imagine is not the party 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.130
 big as you say is this are not stones 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.900
 on the way there are water bottles 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.029
 empty you have to kick the ones since 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.969
 continue with the road is what they are for 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.660
 we in this case are this 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.530
 predicting the triumph of those who 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.739
 brothers 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.449
 in what way do you think you can defeat 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.670
 his rivals have already studied him or not 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.109
 they need this what the blogger like 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.780
 because look I have if you are one is a 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:53.230
 fight in a cage but they say it's something 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.930
 strange we have no idea how 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.630
 is going to be then that day let's see 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.400
 how are we going to 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.080
 to take to the fight there will be no fight to 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.820
 out I believe they will be hanged the 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.800
 belts then it's not going you're not going to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.210
 be a common and current struggle in a 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.210
 triangular becomes a regular within 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.980
 the cage and it's kind of weird but the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.260
 truth is that we are used to 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.320
 struggles were the extreme fights all 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.810
 that's not going to be something different then 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.030
 but this will not be strange to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.490
 we 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.210
 in the future in the past they have seen 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.990
 other factions with you the tradition 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.549
 present that both the ambition to want 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.640
 save yourself from saying to which device you are going to 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.070
 lead to this this time 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.890
 I think everyone will want to snatch 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.460
 the lots our not what is our 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.470
 by right it is already written on the stone 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.260
 since years ago then I think that 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.940
 let's get to the last until what 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.800
 more extreme that there may be to continue 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.390
 having the championships the problem is 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.530
 that if they are willing to get 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.540
 that is extreme that limit if they are not 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.090
 ahead they will run into some books 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.150
 totally different version this 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.000
 23 way in which is big of the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.160
 triple wrestling to the brothers let's go 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.380
 to do we are going to enter champions we are going to 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.260
 to leave champions that I can assure you 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.420
 is going to be hell on earth when 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.730
 we are again with the belt of 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.510
 we are going to tell them to contemplate the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760
 hell 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.570
 look at the greens and it's going to be your 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.570
 apocalypse now
