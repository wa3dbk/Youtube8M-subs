like everyone as a tinder and I getting
down<00:05:54.220> but<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.520> think<00:05:54.730> at<00:05:54.790> the<00:05:54.850> beginning<00:05:55.240> no

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
down but I think at the beginning no

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.390 
down but I think at the beginning no
one's<00:05:55.900> do<00:05:56.620> anything<00:05:56.980> because<00:05:57.100> no<00:05:57.250> one's

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
one's do anything because no one's

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.010 
one's do anything because no one's
competing<00:05:57.880> so<00:05:58.030> I<00:05:58.090> think<00:05:58.330> towards<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:58.630> end<00:05:58.720> it

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
competing so I think towards the end it

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.970 
competing so I think towards the end it
just<00:05:59.050> gets<00:05:59.380> that's<00:05:59.680> when<00:05:59.770> you<00:05:59.830> Olympic

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
just gets that's when you Olympic

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.890 
just gets that's when you Olympic
reaction<00:06:00.910> started<00:06:01.180> yes<00:06:01.390> that's<00:06:01.630> when<00:06:01.780> it
