the<00:00:58.199> fins<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.760> like

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the fins out of that these are just like

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.070 
the fins out of that these are just like
the<00:01:00.149> g<00:01:00.660> three<00:01:01.020> thousand<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.219> g2000<00:01:03.059> fins<00:01:03.239> by

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the g three thousand or g2000 fins by

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.270 
the g three thousand or g2000 fins by
FCS<00:01:05.030> they're<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.479> close<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> fins<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.240> um

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
FCS they're very close to the fins so um

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.550 
FCS they're very close to the fins so um
yeah<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.520> need<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.600> work<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> still

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it's really just great stuff but I all

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.870 
it's really just great stuff but I all
this<00:01:43.500> stuff<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.040> bumpy<00:01:44.399> great<00:01:44.640> stuff

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
this stuff is just bumpy great stuff

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.749 
this stuff is just bumpy great stuff
like<00:01:45.000> i<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.180> saying<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> mean<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
like i was saying down so I mean it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.880 
like i was saying down so I mean it
looks<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.180> worse<00:01:48.240> than<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.890> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
looks a lot worse than it is it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.290 
looks a lot worse than it is it's
actually<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.340> smooth

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
yeah the way I'm going to do this is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.540 
yeah the way I'm going to do this is
take<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:01.020> things<00:02:01.260> i<00:02:01.560> miss<00:02:01.800> timmy<00:02:01.890> quad<00:02:02.250> Finn

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
take these things i miss timmy quad Finn

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.150 
take these things i miss timmy quad Finn
if<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.450> already<00:02:03.600> said<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.230> don't<00:02:04.440> know<00:02:04.500> but

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
if I already said that I don't know but

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.370 
if I already said that I don't know but
um<00:02:05.400> I'm<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> figure<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> fin

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
um I'm going to figure out the fin

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.000 
um I'm going to figure out the fin
placements<00:02:08.060> take<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> drill<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.510> that's<00:02:09.690> about

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
placements take a drill bit that's about

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.450 
placements take a drill bit that's about
the<00:02:11.010> size<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.780> weight<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.960> this
