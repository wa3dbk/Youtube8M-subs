00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.589
 as for example this 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.269
 in this case for you to see it is a 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.109
 little above is this vale this is my 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.669
 menu is not worth my version one created by 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.669
 me with a payment's base menu 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.579
 I will leave the expression in the 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.579
 description or if you want 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.590
 If you want it, you have a place 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.780
 prestige 11 level 70 and mainly 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 is 6 - that is to say basically 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.879
 although there are some that do not work but 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.370
 well we need one then like 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.090
 example this 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.090
 for it 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.030
 we close everything 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.010
 we arrived here 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.030

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.580
 and we are going to give it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.660
 next what we must operate 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.500
 the play is to put it in the ruin of the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:36.060
 right slot between the left and the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:40.030
 we put right in the slot 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.520
 right is to say in the slot that is 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.090
 closer to the buttons below 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.970

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.970
 As you can, it's like you've seen before 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.479

 so Paris studied putting this as if 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.349
 we had the online is worth then 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.010
 we start heading off without changing anything 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.530
 or anything unopened weapon or anything 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.879
 then depending on the map it is 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.879
 will start in this case is rust 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.709
 we put the game 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.189
 then we must open it according to the menu 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.310
 in this case neither menus open with select and 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.860

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.620
 once we have opened 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.620
 we ended up with a match 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.020
 once we have had a game 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.020
 we go 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.550
 once we have finished heading 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.070

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.400
 See, it's a little 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.560
 we put ourselves sorry for not having anything 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.560
 but 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 It is what it is 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.830
 and now we can open for example some 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.580
 infection 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.580
 demi spam 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.160
