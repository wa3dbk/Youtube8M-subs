hello<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.129> Attila<00:00:02.550> from<00:00:02.850> hyper<00:00:03.060> organic

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hello this is Attila from hyper organic

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.340 
hello this is Attila from hyper organic
and<00:00:04.200> today<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.009> will<00:00:05.190> demonstrate<00:00:05.870> the<00:00:06.870> filter

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
and today I will demonstrate the filter

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.890 
and today I will demonstrate the filter
demon<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.980> container<00:00:08.880> how<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> use<00:00:09.450> them

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
demon and container how to use them

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.400 
demon and container how to use them
so<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:11.090> it's<00:00:12.090> gonna<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> really<00:00:12.630> fun<00:00:12.750> tutorial

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
so I it's gonna be a really fun tutorial

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.130 
so I it's gonna be a really fun tutorial
I<00:00:13.650> created<00:00:14.099> an<00:00:14.190> object<00:00:15.830> it's<00:00:16.830> gonna<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
I created an object it's gonna be a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.340 
I created an object it's gonna be a
snowman

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
snowman

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
snowman
so<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.180> object--<00:00:21.380> it's<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:23.150> really<00:00:24.150> basic

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
so we have object-- it's a really basic

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.580 
so we have object-- it's a really basic
model<00:00:25.130> first<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.990> let's<00:00:27.990> started<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> buy

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
model first of all let's started to buy

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.890 
model first of all let's started to buy
a<00:00:28.619> frame<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> D<00:00:29.720> shortcut<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> can

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
a frame so with the D shortcut you can

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.420 
a frame so with the D shortcut you can
turn<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.579> bounding<00:00:32.579> box<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:34.430> sorry

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
turn it to the bounding box and sorry

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.580 
turn it to the bounding box and sorry
not<00:00:35.670> laughs<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.630> body<00:00:36.840> because

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
not laughs and with one body because

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
not laughs and with one body because
we're<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> fill<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.219> object<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:39.570> then

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
we're going to fill this object and then

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.190 
we're going to fill this object and then
we're<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> create<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> object<00:00:42.200> we

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
we're going to create the object we

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
we're going to create the object we
leave<00:00:43.379> everything<00:00:43.500> default<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:44.640> just

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
leave everything default and we're just

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.190 
leave everything default and we're just
going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.000> pick<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> set<00:00:45.809> stone<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:48.200> fill

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
going to pick the set stone and fill

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.040 
going to pick the set stone and fill
mine<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:53.640> filled<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.449> we're<00:00:54.690> gonna<00:00:54.809> need<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
mine it's filled now we're gonna need a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.310 
mine it's filled now we're gonna need a
couple<00:00:55.260> extra<00:00:55.559> objects<00:00:56.430> first<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
couple extra objects first we want to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
couple extra objects first we want to
box<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> cube<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.550> we're<00:01:03.300> gonna

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
box so there's a cube and we're gonna

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.880 
box so there's a cube and we're gonna
scale<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.140> cube<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.979> 300

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.570 

sorry<00:01:13.640> 10<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:16.930> good<00:01:17.930> one<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.680> chill<00:01:19.430> you

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
can go to save you and let's move it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.950 
can go to save you and let's move it
down<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.400> little<00:01:22.640> bit<00:01:24.700> like<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.659> party

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
down a little bit like this so the party

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.940 
down a little bit like this so the party
closed<00:01:27.229> tonight<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:27.770> can<00:01:28.040> relate<00:01:29.800> on<00:01:30.800> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
closed tonight I can relate on the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.120 
closed tonight I can relate on the
ground<00:01:33.790> for<00:01:34.790> all<00:01:34.970> particle<00:01:35.540> simulations<00:01:36.170> it's

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
ground for all particle simulations it's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.270 
ground for all particle simulations it's
recommended<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.880> create<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.360> kiln<00:01:38.630> volume<00:01:39.290> so

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
recommended to create the kiln volume so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.969 
recommended to create the kiln volume so
I<00:01:40.310> create<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.820> volume<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.479> just<00:01:41.509> hit<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.710> stain

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
I create a volume I just hit it to stain

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.850 
I create a volume I just hit it to stain
and<00:01:44.740> that's<00:01:45.740> really<00:01:46.310> good<00:01:46.610> if<00:01:46.759> your<00:01:47.090> particles

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
and that's really good if your particles

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.940 
and that's really good if your particles
fly<00:01:48.860> away<00:01:49.130> by<00:01:50.170> anything<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.470> have<00:01:51.619> like

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
fly away by anything I have like

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.490 
fly away by anything I have like
collision<00:01:52.460> or<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.240> simulation<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.080> unstable

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
collision or the simulation is unstable

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.550 
collision or the simulation is unstable
if<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.460> particles<00:01:55.910> fly<00:01:56.119> away<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:57.140> could<00:01:57.410> be

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
if the particles fly away that could be

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.460 
if the particles fly away that could be
really<00:01:57.860> memory<00:01:58.220> intense<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.869> your<00:01:59.869> sink

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
really memory intense and your sink

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.969 
really memory intense and your sink
crash<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:02.660> if<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.899> could<00:02:03.110> cave<00:02:03.440> on<00:02:03.619> him<00:02:03.770> then

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
crash so if you could cave on him then

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.770 
crash so if you could cave on him then
all<00:02:04.100> those<00:02:04.220> particles<00:02:04.729> going<00:02:04.910> to<00:02:04.970> be<00:02:05.090> killed

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
all those particles going to be killed

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.479 
all those particles going to be killed
and<00:02:05.929> we<00:02:06.860> won't<00:02:07.009> have<00:02:07.190> any<00:02:07.399> problems<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:10.070> let's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
and we won't have any problems so let's

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.190 
and we won't have any problems so let's
clean<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.820> up<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.269> don't<00:02:11.390> want<00:02:11.480> global<00:02:11.959> links

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
clean this up we don't want global links

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.610 
clean this up we don't want global links
right<00:02:12.350> now<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:14.810> we're<00:02:15.650> gonna<00:02:15.800> need<00:02:17.620> filter

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
right now but we're gonna need filter

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.949 
right now but we're gonna need filter
demon<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.959> also<00:02:20.959> container<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.570> filter

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
demon and also container so what filter

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.979 
demon and also container so what filter
demon<00:02:24.320> does<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.799> it<00:02:25.640> checks<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.239> particle

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
demon does is it checks for particle

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.180 
demon does is it checks for particle
properties<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:28.450> moves<00:02:29.450> particles<00:02:30.200> over<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
properties and moves particles over to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.970 
properties and moves particles over to
another<00:02:31.880> emitter<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.350> previous<00:02:33.739> roof

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
another emitter in the previous roof

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.449 
another emitter in the previous roof
those<00:02:34.480> enough<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.690> for<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.739> have<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.130> create

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
those enough of for you have to create

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.190 
those enough of for you have to create
scripts<00:02:38.030> for<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.720> check<00:02:38.959> with<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
scripts for this and check with the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.910 
scripts for this and check with the
scripts<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:39.890> what<00:02:40.549> is<00:02:40.670> particle<00:02:41.120> properties

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
scripts so what is particle properties

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.350 
scripts so what is particle properties
if<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.070> go<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> fill<00:02:43.610> object<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.299> you

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
if you go to the fill object and you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.460 
if you go to the fill object and you
should<00:02:44.630> display<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.870> property<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.200> can

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
should display then in property you can

now<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.630> filter<00:03:00.250> we<00:03:01.250> have<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:02.260> right<00:03:03.260> here

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
now in filter we have this right here

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.679 
now in filter we have this right here
it's<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.980> condition<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.680> okay

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.970 

as<00:03:12.689> speed<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.760> have<00:03:14.939> position<00:03:15.629> X<00:03:16.079> Y<00:03:16.260> Z<00:03:16.500> speed

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
as speed so we have position X Y Z speed

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.380

of<00:03:21.450> neighbors<00:03:21.870> etc<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.530> condition

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189

if<00:03:26.370> greater<00:03:27.739> lower<00:03:28.739> range<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:31.650> can<00:03:31.829> have

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
if greater lower range and you can have

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.000 
if greater lower range and you can have
expression<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:33.480> right<00:03:33.719> now<00:03:33.900> we're<00:03:34.620> just<00:03:34.799> going

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
expression so right now we're just going

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.580 
expression so right now we're just going
to<00:03:35.069> use<00:03:36.230> greater<00:03:37.230> than<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:39.139> we're<00:03:40.139> gonna<00:03:40.230> pick

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
to use greater than and we're gonna pick

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.250 
to use greater than and we're gonna pick
the<00:03:40.859> source<00:03:41.099> a<00:03:41.310> meter<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.209> we're<00:03:43.139> gonna

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the source a meter so we we're gonna

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.979 
the source a meter so we we're gonna
check<00:03:43.799> for<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.639> few<00:03:44.939> objects<00:03:45.389> properties<00:03:46.010> and

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
check for the few objects properties and

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.159 
check for the few objects properties and
if<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.650> property<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.549> true<00:03:51.239> then<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:51.959> going

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
if the property is true then it's going

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.770 
if the property is true then it's going
to<00:03:52.230> go<00:03:52.470> into<00:03:52.889> the<00:03:53.099> container<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:54.510> we're<00:03:54.689> going

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
to go into the container so we're going

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.849 
to go into the container so we're going
to<00:03:54.840> pass<00:03:55.079> particles<00:03:55.889> have<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:58.530> we're<00:03:58.739> gonna

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
to pass particles have and we're gonna

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.280 
to pass particles have and we're gonna
check<00:03:59.129> for<00:03:59.239> vorticity<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:01.939> let's<00:04:02.939> do<00:04:03.269> what<00:04:04.139> you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
check for vorticity so let's do what you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:12.979 
check for vorticity so let's do what you
see<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:06.709> three<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.780> if<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:11.669> object<00:04:12.209> if

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
see and three so if the the object if

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.589 
see and three so if the the object if
the<00:04:13.049> particle<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.069> fill<00:04:14.310> object<00:04:14.790> has<00:04:15.569> a

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
the particle in the fill object has a

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.379 
the particle in the fill object has a
verticity<00:04:16.109> gradient<00:04:16.799> at<00:04:16.979> three<00:04:17.310> then<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.209> goes

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
verticity gradient at three then it goes

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.500 
verticity gradient at three then it goes
into<00:04:18.570> container<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.440> if<00:04:20.159> it's<00:04:20.340> fault<00:04:20.699> if<00:04:20.940> this

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
into container and if it's fault if this

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.439 
into container and if it's fault if this
is<00:04:22.049> false<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.800> stays<00:04:23.220> in<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.849> fill

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
is false then it stays in the fill

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.990 
is false then it stays in the fill
object<00:04:25.580> okay<00:04:26.659> now<00:04:28.220> we<00:04:29.220> have<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.490> take<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.789> fill

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
object okay now we have to take the fill

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.149 
object okay now we have to take the fill
object<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.750> we<00:04:31.020> have<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.409> make<00:04:31.860> sure<00:04:31.889> that

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
object and we have to make sure that

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.350 
object and we have to make sure that
this<00:04:32.669> vorticity<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:34.070> calculated<00:04:35.210> right<00:04:36.210> now

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
this vorticity is calculated right now

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.999 
this vorticity is calculated right now
this<00:04:36.539> is<00:04:36.720> not<00:04:36.900> like<00:04:37.080> it's<00:04:37.380> not<00:04:37.500> gonna<00:04:37.740> be<00:04:37.889> an

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
this is not like it's not gonna be an

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.850 
this is not like it's not gonna be an
accurate<00:04:38.849> simulation<00:04:39.300> or<00:04:40.050> it's<00:04:40.349> not<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.530> shot

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
accurate simulation or it's not a shot

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.710 
accurate simulation or it's not a shot
it's<00:04:41.130> basically<00:04:41.580> just<00:04:41.699> demonstrating<00:04:42.539> the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
it's basically just demonstrating the

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.450 
it's basically just demonstrating the
power<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.349> this<00:04:44.240> filter<00:04:45.240> Damon<00:04:46.460> previously

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
power of this filter Damon previously

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.399 
power of this filter Damon previously
when<00:04:47.759> we<00:04:48.270> used<00:04:48.690> scripts<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:50.099> had<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:51.409> use

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
when we used scripts and we had to use

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.680 
when we used scripts and we had to use
these<00:04:52.530> advanced<00:04:52.830> scripts<00:04:53.250> then<00:04:53.789> just<00:04:54.360> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
these advanced scripts then just the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.450 
these advanced scripts then just the
scripting<00:04:55.169> in<00:04:55.470> Python<00:04:55.919> is<00:04:56.070> single<00:04:56.430> threaded

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
scripting in Python is single threaded

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.010 
scripting in Python is single threaded
and<00:04:58.820> so<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.840> fluid<00:05:01.289> calculation<00:05:02.070> is<00:05:03.020> booty

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
and so the fluid calculation is booty

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.850 
and so the fluid calculation is booty
threaded<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.130> goes<00:05:05.430> which<00:05:05.759> would<00:05:06.860> whatever

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
threaded so it goes which would whatever

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.920 
threaded so it goes which would whatever
processing<00:05:08.729> power<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.270> have<00:05:09.479> like<00:05:09.720> eight

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
it's easier to do it that you don't want

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.269 
it's easier to do it that you don't want
to<00:05:25.849> mess<00:05:26.029> with<00:05:26.059> scraps<00:05:26.569> and<00:05:26.929> your<00:05:27.649> scenes<00:05:27.979> are

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
to mess with scraps and your scenes are

easily<00:05:29.529> easier<00:05:30.529> to<00:05:30.769> save<00:05:31.039> and<00:05:31.519> you<00:05:32.059> can<00:05:32.269> use

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
easily easier to save and you can use

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.789 
easily easier to save and you can use

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:36.799 
the XML export import also so we turned

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:39.759 
the XML export import also so we turned
on<00:05:37.599> Wade<00:05:38.599> you<00:05:38.689> have<00:05:38.719> to<00:05:38.929> turn<00:05:39.079> on<00:05:39.289> for<00:05:39.529> fill

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:42.549 
on Wade you have to turn on for fill
object<00:05:40.159> we<00:05:40.279> have<00:05:40.309> to<00:05:40.519> turn<00:05:40.759> on<00:05:41.029> vorticity<00:05:41.569> so

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:42.559 
object we have to turn on vorticity so

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:46.419 
object we have to turn on vorticity so
compute<00:05:42.979> what<00:05:43.219> you<00:05:43.339> say<00:05:43.489> and<00:05:44.329> then<00:05:45.249> we<00:05:46.249> also

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:46.429 
compute what you say and then we also

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.549 
compute what you say and then we also
want<00:05:46.759> to<00:05:46.819> see<00:05:47.089> it<00:05:47.149> so<00:05:47.659> we're<00:05:47.899> going<00:05:47.989> to<00:05:48.079> turn<00:05:48.289> on

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:48.559 
want to see it so we're going to turn on

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:50.319 
want to see it so we're going to turn on
what<00:05:49.219> you<00:05:49.369> city<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:49.819> we're<00:05:49.969> just<00:05:50.059> going<00:05:50.269> to

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:50.329 
what you city and we're just going to

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:54.279 
what you city and we're just going to
leave<00:05:50.509> it<00:05:50.569> on<00:05:50.809> automatic<00:05:51.169> range<00:05:51.999> all<00:05:52.999> right

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
leave it on automatic range all right

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.609 
leave it on automatic range all right
we're<00:05:54.979> also<00:05:55.189> going<00:05:55.519> to<00:05:55.610> need<00:05:55.989> we<00:05:56.989> want<00:05:57.199> we<00:05:57.589> want

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:57.619 
we're also going to need we want we want

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:59.379 
we're also going to need we want we want
this<00:05:58.039> trip<00:05:58.610> so<00:05:58.939> we're<00:05:59.059> going<00:05:59.179> to<00:05:59.239> create

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
this trip so we're going to create

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.629 
this trip so we're going to create
gravity<00:06:00.639> and<00:06:02.589> let's<00:06:03.589> remove<00:06:03.949> these<00:06:04.219> from<00:06:04.550> the

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
gravity and let's remove these from the

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.290 
gravity and let's remove these from the
global<00:06:04.939> links<00:06:05.239> and<00:06:06.429> let's<00:06:07.429> create<00:06:07.699> exclusive

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
global links and let's create exclusive

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.659 
global links and let's create exclusive
links<00:06:08.869> so<00:06:09.259> first<00:06:09.559> of<00:06:09.709> all<00:06:09.829> we'd<00:06:10.219> only<00:06:10.369> get

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
links so first of all we'd only get

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.329 
links so first of all we'd only get
collision<00:06:11.539> with<00:06:11.749> the<00:06:11.779> set<00:06:12.110> snowman<00:06:12.619> which<00:06:13.219> is

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:13.339 
collision with the set snowman which is

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.249 
collision with the set snowman which is
okay<00:06:13.610> let's<00:06:13.909> wait<00:06:14.179> we<00:06:14.569> just<00:06:14.749> need<00:06:14.899> to<00:06:15.019> fill

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
okay let's wait we just need to fill

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:19.839 
okay let's wait we just need to fill
object<00:06:15.649> and<00:06:16.489> we<00:06:16.610> need<00:06:16.759> container<00:06:17.499> now<00:06:18.849> they

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
object and we need container now they

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:25.329 
object and we need container now they
both<00:06:20.119> affect<00:06:21.049> each<00:06:21.259> other<00:06:23.439> but<00:06:24.439> the<00:06:24.829> container

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:25.339 
both affect each other but the container

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.459 
both affect each other but the container
where<00:06:26.119> the<00:06:26.239> fill<00:06:26.389> object<00:06:26.809> is<00:06:26.959> not<00:06:27.079> going<00:06:27.319> to<00:06:27.379> be

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
where the fill object is not going to be

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.459 
where the fill object is not going to be
affected<00:06:27.860> by<00:06:27.889> the<00:06:28.069> gravy
