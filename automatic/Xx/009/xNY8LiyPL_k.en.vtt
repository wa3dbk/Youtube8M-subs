so<00:00:00.599> here<00:00:00.810> we<00:00:00.930> have<00:00:01.140> Olympus's<00:00:01.740> v<00:00:02.040> OMD<00:00:02.580> camera

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
so here we have Olympus's v OMD camera

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.789 
so here we have Olympus's v OMD camera
the<00:00:03.419> e/m<00:00:03.780> 10<00:00:04.049> mark<00:00:04.380> 2<00:00:07.730> that's<00:00:08.730> cool

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.680 

few<00:00:13.799> years<00:00:13.830> ago<00:00:14.219> Olympus<00:00:14.759> brought<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> m5

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
few years ago Olympus brought out the m5

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.570 
few years ago Olympus brought out the m5
and<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.350> drastically<00:00:16.650> changed<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.369> way<00:00:17.550> we

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
and it drastically changed the way we

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.359 
and it drastically changed the way we
think<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.119> mirrorless<00:00:18.660> cameras<00:00:19.189> they<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
think of mirrorless cameras they then

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.740 
think of mirrorless cameras they then
bought<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.730> others<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> range<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
bought out the others in the range the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.859 
bought out the others in the range the
m1<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.590> 10<00:00:22.890> as<00:00:23.070> well<00:00:23.279> all<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.390> their<00:00:24.570> certain

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
m1 in 10 as well all with their certain

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.529 
m1 in 10 as well all with their certain
grades<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.320> qualities<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.099> them<00:00:26.279> as<00:00:26.430> well<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
grades and qualities to them as well the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.599 
grades and qualities to them as well the
m10<00:00:28.050> was<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> those<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.949> only<00:00:29.189> had<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> 3

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
m10 was one of those that only had the 3

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
m10 was one of those that only had the 3
axis<00:00:29.939> stabilization<00:00:30.119> system<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.260> only

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
axis stabilization system and only

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
axis stabilization system and only
worked<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> certain<00:00:32.910> level<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.270> kind<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
worked at a certain level which kind of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.080 
worked at a certain level which kind of
made<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> look<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.380> feel<00:00:34.579> more<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> pen

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
made it look and feel more like a pen

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930 
made it look and feel more like a pen
series<00:00:36.570> camera<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.190> nice<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.700> just

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
series camera so it was nice but it just

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
series camera so it was nice but it just
didn't<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.420> everything<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> others

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
didn't have everything that the others

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.799 
didn't have everything that the others
had<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.640> often<00:00:41.820> felt<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> wasn't<00:00:42.719> as

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
had so often felt like it wasn't as

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.600 
had so often felt like it wasn't as
premium<00:00:43.230> grade<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.770> build<00:00:44.010> quality<00:00:44.160> was

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
premium grade the build quality was

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.150 
premium grade the build quality was
there<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.410> were<00:00:46.530> missing<00:00:46.710> those<00:00:46.980> other

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
there but we were missing those other

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.299

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
little traits the m10 mark 2 changes

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
little traits the m10 mark 2 changes
that<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.329> what's<00:00:51.480> new<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> camera<00:00:52.379> it's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
that so what's new about the camera it's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.010 
that so what's new about the camera it's
got<00:00:52.890> its<00:00:53.070> epic<00:00:53.489> 5<00:00:53.670> axis<00:00:54.030> stabilization<00:00:54.180> system

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
got its epic 5 axis stabilization system

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.319 
got its epic 5 axis stabilization system
in<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:55.410> massive<00:00:55.890> bonus<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> new<00:00:57.270> and

for<00:01:04.199> magnification<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.400> very<00:01:05.820> much<00:01:06.030> similar

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
for magnification it's very much similar

this<00:01:11.250> camera<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.610> changed<00:01:11.939> ever<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.510> subtly

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
this camera have changed ever so subtly

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
this camera have changed ever so subtly
over<00:01:13.290> its<00:01:13.409> predecessor<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.549> you've<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
over its predecessor so you've got a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
over its predecessor so you've got a
slightly<00:01:15.210> better<00:01:15.420> hang<00:01:15.720> grip<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
slightly better hang grip there for you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.840 
slightly better hang grip there for you
to<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:16.950> your<00:01:17.040> hand<00:01:17.310> round<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to actually get your hand round the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.460 
to actually get your hand round the
camera<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.570> hold<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

camera really hold on to it
the<00:01:20.040> dials<00:01:20.430> equally<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.299> all<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the dials equally have all got this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
the dials equally have all got this
slightly<00:01:22.530> modelled<00:01:22.979> effect<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> moon<00:01:23.670> ray

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
slightly modelled effect to the moon ray

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.640 
slightly modelled effect to the moon ray
'zed<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.390> lot<00:01:24.570> higher<00:01:24.810> than<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> old<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.500> as

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
'zed a lot higher than the old one as

'zed a lot higher than the old one as
well<00:01:26.060> first<00:01:27.060> saw<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.420> didn't<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.020> but

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
well first saw that I didn't like it but

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960 
well first saw that I didn't like it but
initially<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.070> starting<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> use<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
initially when starting to use the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
initially when starting to use the
camera<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.479> actually<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> real<00:01:31.200> good<00:01:31.350> feel

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
camera you actually get a real good feel

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
camera you actually get a real good feel
and<00:01:31.799> real<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.280> grasp<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.820> those<00:01:33.329> dial

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and real good grasp of those dial

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.280 
and real good grasp of those dial
controls<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.320> actually<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.130> quite<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> bonus

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
controls so actually it's quite a bonus

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.710 
controls so actually it's quite a bonus
in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> retro<00:01:37.740> side<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.159> things<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:39.479> dial

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
in the retro side of things this dial

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
in the retro side of things this dial
top<00:01:40.020> looks<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:40.920> familiar<00:01:41.430> from<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
top looks very very familiar from the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.179 
top looks very very familiar from the
old<00:01:41.820> om<00:01:42.090> film<00:01:42.360> cameras<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.500> powering<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
old om film cameras and for powering the

old om film cameras and for powering the
camera<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.270> also<00:01:45.780> activating<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
camera on and then also activating the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.069 
camera on and then also activating the
flash<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.909> guessing<00:01:48.270> someone<00:01:48.509> who<00:01:48.630> Japan<00:01:48.899> had

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
flash I'm guessing someone who Japan had

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.389 
flash I'm guessing someone who Japan had
a<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.350> bit<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> joke<00:01:49.770> putting<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.250> on

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
a little bit of a joke putting that on

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.819 
a little bit of a joke putting that on
there<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.030> I'd<00:01:51.240> rather<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.590> reality

of although M switches and decided to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
of although M switches and decided to
build<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> camera<00:01:57.270> around<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
often faced before is that the light

that<00:04:17.299> sounds<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.660> bit<00:04:17.810> daft<00:04:18.080> because<00:04:18.590> you

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
that sounds a bit daft because you

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.090 
that sounds a bit daft because you

it<00:04:22.100> actually<00:04:22.160> works<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.180> m10<00:04:24.140> mark<00:04:24.440> twos<00:04:24.620> all

so got an electronic shutter in there as

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.930 
so got an electronic shutter in there as
well<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.080> it's<00:04:27.230> silent<00:04:27.770> ideal<00:04:28.370> for<00:04:28.610> all<00:04:28.640> those

you<00:04:34.790> tend<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.090> find<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:35.540> low-light

you tend to find it in low-light

environments you get banding through the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.490 
environments you get banding through the
photograph<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:38.450> you<00:04:38.540> can't<00:04:38.780> really<00:04:39.080> use<00:04:39.290> it<00:04:39.440> in

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
photograph so you can't really use it in

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.680 
photograph so you can't really use it in
those<00:04:39.590> conditions<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.790> far<00:04:41.060> here<00:04:41.270> with<00:04:41.450> the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
those conditions so far here with the

those conditions so far here with the
m10<00:04:42.080> mark<00:04:42.320> 2<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.680> haven't<00:04:43.130> had<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.250> problem

m10 mark 2 I haven't had that problem
another<00:04:44.420> nice<00:04:44.720> little<00:04:44.750> improvement<00:04:45.620> is<00:04:45.770> the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
another nice little improvement is the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.260 
another nice little improvement is the
enhanced<00:04:46.430> focus<00:04:46.790> peaking<00:04:46.970> they've

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
enhanced focus peaking they've

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.930 
enhanced focus peaking they've

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
incorporated same as the m1 more

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.670 
incorporated same as the m1 more
customization<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.900> better<00:04:51.050> refresh<00:04:51.470> rate

cog system can they so this is getting
rained<00:07:26.290> on<00:07:26.470> and<00:07:26.530> it's<00:07:26.800> a<00:07:26.860> pre-production
