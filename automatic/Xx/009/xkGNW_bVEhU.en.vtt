00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
to find the variety name but they're

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.479 
to find the variety name but they're
they're<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.140> hybridized<00:00:50.679> these<00:00:50.949> days<00:00:51.219> that

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
they're so hybridized these days that

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.729 
they're so hybridized these days that
it's<00:00:51.670> hard<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:51.910> find<00:00:52.289> exactly<00:00:53.289> what<00:00:53.440> they<00:00:53.590> are

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
it's hard to find exactly what they are

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.009 
it's hard to find exactly what they are
because<00:00:53.980> they're<00:00:54.070> so<00:00:54.280> similar<00:00:54.670> looking<00:00:55.179> some

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
because they're so similar looking some

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.099 
because they're so similar looking some
of<00:00:56.109> them<00:00:56.260> are<00:00:56.350> really<00:00:56.590> unique<00:00:56.859> but<00:00:57.780> yeah<00:00:58.780> these

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
of them are really unique but yeah these
