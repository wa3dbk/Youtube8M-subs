 Welcome to our channel dedicated to 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.220
 world to pons today we are going to teach how 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.590
 use the gps to the phone without 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.969
 need to use data or internet 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 is basically that using the gps of the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 old way that we will talk to you more 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.270
 but first we invite you to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.590
 subscribe to our channel to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.300
 that are pending of the new ones 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 videotutorials of the devices 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.650
 Apple and the iphone phone can give you 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 click there below where it says subscribe to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 your street with subscription is totally 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.380
 Free normally if we wanted 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 use the gps normally what 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 we use in combination of the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 application of the map but suppose that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.809
 we are in a place where we do not have 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.750
 internet we do not have data it is simply 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.460
 we went camping or hiking and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 we basically need that to use 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.820
 the gps the phone for that we should 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.489
 first of all to do two things one 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.469
 before leaving excursion download 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.520
 an application that shows me the data 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.500
 of the gps 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.620
 I downloaded several here discard 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.470
 quickly 3 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.080
 that they call gps data is this that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.420
 calls gps status that is calling gps 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.940
 status too but it has an icon 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.080
 different is the center does not work for 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.240
 nothing so it is we can download it 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.810
 before we can discard it and we can 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 eliminate very bad 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.250
 then we stay 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.780
 to see eliminate the download we eliminate 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.270
 then and we are left with only 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.009
 these 2 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.380
 as I told them gps data to gps status 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.869
 how we simply download them 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.469
 we enter the author we describe here 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.960
 up gps and here I get this option 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:56.890
 which is what I showed you earlier in 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.890
 apps and if we write you here gps status 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.230
 will give us the option to download the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.480
 another that is this that is here the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.750
 we unload and the other thing that we should 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.890
 to do is if we go for a walk or a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.070
 excursion to a walk is to take a 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.860
 hand map is to make use of the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.190
 old school use already get 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.980
 compass physical map to be able to locate them 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.350
 since with this application if we enter 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.650
 to her that application is going to tell us 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.500
 what is our longitude our latitude 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.209
 what is our our sea level 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.820
 our meter with respect to the level of 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.790
 sea and this is the only way with which 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.910
 We can use the GPS without having to 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.910
 to have 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.409
 intermediate data already knowing in 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.599
 our latitude and longitude simply 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.999
 we use the manual map we place it 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.659
 with a rule and in that way we 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:59.180
 we locate with the gps if we enter here 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.730
 for this other application at this time 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.310
 is not giving me data because when I 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.469
 I installed you I did not allow you to use the gps 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.560
 not then in this case let's activate 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:13.329
 the gps to this application we go here for 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.310
 adjustments we look for the option of privacy 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.349
 we go to the location option and 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.199
 we look for the application in this case here 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.650
 is gps status the gps is not activated 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:26.780
 for the selective application we already 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.319
 the use of gps was enabled for that 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.139
 application and we return to the application 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.409
 and that way already gives me a latitude a 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:39.910
 length and more or less tells me the 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.530
 more data has me speed 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.530
 what interests us most of all 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.660
 is our our latitude and longitude 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.970
 to locate us on a physical map or 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.170
 manual that was all for this video 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.080
 thank you very much for watching our videos 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.440
 do not forget to subscribe you will highlight many 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.440
 Thank you
