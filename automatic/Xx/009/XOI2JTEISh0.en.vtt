stage<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.490> second<00:01:26.760> stage<00:01:26.790> itself<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.870> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
stage the second stage itself as you can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.719 
stage the second stage itself as you can
see<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.260> also<00:01:28.650> great<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.070> cold<00:01:29.250> water<00:01:29.340> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
see is also great for cold water you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
see is also great for cold water you
know<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.909> has<00:01:30.120> a<00:01:30.150> heat<00:01:30.450> exchanger<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.440> as<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
know it has a heat exchanger just as it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.500 
know it has a heat exchanger just as it
enters<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> body<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.360> helps

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
enters the body this just helps

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.410 
enters the body this just helps
dissipate<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:35.310> temperature<00:01:35.880> differentials

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
dissipate the temperature differentials

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.490 
dissipate the temperature differentials
between<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.610> water<00:01:38.610> temperature<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
between the water temperature and the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
between the water temperature and the
mechanism<00:01:40.500> sides<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.220> prevents<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.880> free

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
mechanism sides just prevents it free

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.200 
mechanism sides just prevents it free
flowing<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.890> balanced<00:01:44.190> second<00:01:44.520> stage<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
flowing it's a balanced second stage so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
flowing it's a balanced second stage so
it's<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> give<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> good<00:01:46.260> inhalation

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it's going to give you good inhalation

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.450 
it's going to give you good inhalation
results<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:49.020> excellent<00:01:49.470> performance<00:01:49.979> with

on<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.299> side<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
on the side here it's just that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.309 
on the side here it's just that
basically<00:02:08.849> changes<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.720> air<00:02:10.019> flow

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
basically changes the way the air flow

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.399 
basically changes the way the air flow
in<00:02:10.500> size<00:02:11.329> in<00:02:12.329> its<00:02:12.510> positive<00:02:12.719> position<00:02:13.290> it's

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
in size in its positive position it's

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.559 
in size in its positive position it's

force<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.400> air<00:02:20.580> flow<00:02:20.880> back<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.390> diaphragm

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
force the air flow back to the diaphragm

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.260 
force the air flow back to the diaphragm
so<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.160> need<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.820> just<00:02:23.910> sit<00:02:24.120> in

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
so if you need so you can just sit in

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.300 
so if you need so you can just sit in
this<00:02:24.360> position<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.350> if<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.710> was<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.980> free<00:02:26.160> flow

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
this position and if it was to free flow

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.540 
this position and if it was to free flow
it<00:02:27.150> would<00:02:27.390> force<00:02:27.960> air<00:02:28.320> back<00:02:28.650> join<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
it would force air back join the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.010 
it would force air back join the
diaphragm<00:02:30.060> else<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.600> closing<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> valve

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
diaphragm else and closing the valve
