00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.660
 you 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.660
 like everyone then today 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.570
 it's a special video tutorial for 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.430
 coualy book bouquets really sublime in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.360
 class for you to know versions 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.470
 are not my natural hair these are 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.550
 two loops is that I made myself 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.320
 but without heat 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.680
 so how do you explain for 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 curls are heat you need to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.530
 aluminum foil so I'm going to you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.620
 explain how we will proceed with these 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.969
 steps there so this method there and 100% 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.369
 without heat as I know said we are going 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.180
 use that and you need to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.590
 nothing else 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.210
 if you see ben I do not know if you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.270
 see here it is really 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.310
 little streamers I find it sublime 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.410
 for its too beautiful I find it changes 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 really may muckler me usually 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.180
 his comic all those who do not have the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.560
 basic curly hair I think that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.229
 it's really a very good method 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 and all that without heat so here we go 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.270
 so start for that you need 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.619
 from your taste buds to jean yanne 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.000
 so I will show you in the video 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.770
 how do I do to bend them 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.509
 I cut a large sheet of paper 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.550
 aluminum that I cut below and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.229
 then I will superimpose the two 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.229
 leaves that I cut in half 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.210
 alas from there it makes me 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.000
 large square rectangles that I'm going 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.610
 start folding so that it makes a 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.729
 really a made a rectangle a kind 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.729
 long candle actually like this 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.519
 so then I'll start sending 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.140
 my locks so I'm divided 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.940
 my hair so it's up to you to see 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.260
 how do you want to divide them 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.580
 if you want to start from the top of 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.920
 head or if you want to start with 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.470
 down or by a short side it's like 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.690
 you want what you want so 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 then I advise you to take 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.549
 big magick wicks but not too much 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.829
 kind like this here you see 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.060
 matches like that you go 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.980
 wrap it around the small rectangle 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.200
 of aluminum that you did as a 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.879
 big jay do you turn yourself round but you 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.230
 turn to the root 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.090
 from there you will bend the two 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.480
 ends that have not been sent 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.549
 by your hair so you bend and that's it 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.680
 your little butt who goodrich and a 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.780
 all night where the four hours that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.269
 you wanted to stay with me I you 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.500
 advise four hours because less 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.480
 4 hours I think it's insufficient 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.730
 to be able to please you and hair 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.530
 so do that on wet hair and he 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.180
 really have to take the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.930
 time to dry that really take the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.959
 shape of the aluminum curler therefore less 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.019
 4 hours I think it might be 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.019
 ripples but not standing club I 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.790
 I'm not sure it's up to you test me 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.269
 say a comment what you 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.609
 think 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.930
 for those who do not have hair 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.190
 curly who have hair smoothed a 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.230
 method I think it can really 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.199
 you and ideas already do not spoil your 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.810
 hair and it really changes crazy 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.160
 it really does not know when I 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.480
 unrolled my hair that made 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.090
 really really curly hair really 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.790
 loops tight enough and you see on 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.489
 is crazy doing is springs and 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.900
 I found that beautiful 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.639
 this is a very nice method for 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.560
 curling her hair is a very good 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.930
 method to curl his hair and 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.849
 here I think about hydra more than one so 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.260
 I, however, I left the whole 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.130
 night because already my hair is 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.200
 real ones 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.260
 I take a long time to actually dry 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.120
 himself a lot of time to dry 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.670
 so I left all night and 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.350
 I wrapped it in a scarf so do not 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.000
 do not worry it does not bother the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 all night the little steps for this 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.750
 Aluminium foil 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.890
 you do not even feel them during the night 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.780
 you have your crazy here it is so I 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.080
 advise to attach it by cons 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.300
 so that's the next morning I have everything 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.940
 removed so to remove curlers 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.990
 you just attract the wick it's 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.270
 that you just have to play-out 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.880
 curlers attract the meije no need to 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.540
 unwind your big beauty in aluminum 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.610
 so that's when you find 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.530
 that it's too many shields like me 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.540
 so I wet a little bit 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.920
 especially in the fringe because I 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.590
 already found but slices are enough 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.770
 short my bangs at the end the matches 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.360
 of tomorrow are pretty short and I 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.040
 found that before going up too much 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.100
 as you see on the video I was 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.220
 shocked at the result actually I thought 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.800
 that it has delivered members doing beautiful 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.630
 loops but not so much in fact and 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.160
 I was really surprised because she 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.600
 was completely zapped that it's me 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.460
 was doing that here anyway it's a 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.410
 very practical method I advise to 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.370
 all those who want to complete their 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.200
 hair as I say so if you have 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.210
 questions do not hesitate to me 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.080
 pose and I think I really did 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.760
 the turn so for you want to put 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.220
 something under rocks coming mom 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.930
 as if wet it warms his foot 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.930
 left will not be dry at all 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.580
 instead they are doubiens 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.160
 see it moves it's alive what is it 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.360
 not his card as seniors when 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.220
 made goofs offered 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.020
 So here I am, I think it's 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.140
 really a very good method I have 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.610
 used a little care cream for 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.580
 before putting the hair curlers of course 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:09.450
 and after just after for novel for 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.340
 give a good smell more shine 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.740
 more texture to my hair 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.190
 but that's it but otherwise they're not 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.290
 all 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.540
 and when I rolled them out it's 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.700
 really send enough is really 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.770
 all flexible and you can do this 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:28.560
 that you want so here I love 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.910
 really much this method and I the 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.920
 advise to everything 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:38.220
 so as I say it can work on 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.720
 kinky or curly hair or 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.100
 totally a bed often had to leave his 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.600
 mark on all types of hair I am 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.190
 really happy to share 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.200
 this method for small pieces 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.730
 of aluminum paper I can not give you 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.040
 exactly the number of small leaves 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:54.240
 that you have to prepare but I have 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:07:00.720
 done little by little I did it 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:02.250
 not feel there so I cross twizy in all 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.310
 this is a very good size 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:10.500
 but that changed level pleads this fact 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:15.300
 of good and I do not do very much and and I 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.980
 find it sexy here it changes 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.660
 in any case I hope this video 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.100
 you will have pleased and then I you 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.270
 not find the next video I you 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.930
 do big kisses and see you soon 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.930
 for the next video
