00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
 Obviously, in a football game, you can never focus on just one thing. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Because there are so many variables 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 What I am going to explain now is if the goalkeeper can quickly pass the ball to one of the central defenders. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 For example, we are now the 4-2-3-1 battle of the blue shirt against the red shirt 4-3-3 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 We try to make one of the central defenders 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 The ideal is that the ball control ability is not too high, received football 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Then we have to control his choice, understand? 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 We have to stare at each other's ball handler, No. 4 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 For example, Tom is the 9th player who will respond. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 And Mark or David is number 10. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 When the player receives the ball, I donâ€™t want Tom to run over to intercept him. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Obviously he might pass, so it will bounce on the opponent's foot. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 So I just want you to open to the side of the court. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Force him to stay in this range 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So that we can keep an eye on one of them here. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And we also have someone staring at this guard. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 When Tom is slowly and surely hitting the stadium 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Obviously, this player will wait for an opportunity to pass the ball to the midfielder. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 We want Mark or David to come here, almost blocking the player. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 So that he can't pass the ball over there, or here. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 In this way, it may be these midfielders, or the midfielder, or even the defender. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Depending on which side of you, he is on your left to allow you to make adjustments, or to the right. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Now the player is holding the ball and Tom is coming from the side of the court. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 At the same time, No. 10 is blocking this player. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 At this time, we will find 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Try to go to this vacancy on the 10th 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Expressed that he hopes to grab the ball 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 In this way, our two midfielders and two midfielders must have good communication. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 When this player seems to want to grab the ball 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 We don't want our midfielder to chase because there is no need 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Because suddenly if the ball goes through here 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 We will have a one-on-one situation here, we donâ€™t want this 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 We instead hope that George will keep an eye on the player and isolate him. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So when football comes here, suddenly we can put pressure on it here. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Can also press here 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 And depending on the performance of this player, 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Depending on his good response 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Or if his connection is not good 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Suddenly we can greatly restrain the player.
