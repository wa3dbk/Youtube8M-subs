new 4k camera and to pull still images
from<00:00:32.490> that<00:00:32.759> footage<00:00:33.060> we're<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> test

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
from that footage we're going to test

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.960 
from that footage we're going to test
the<00:00:34.560> different<00:00:34.829> shutter<00:00:35.010> speeds<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.820> how

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
the different shutter speeds and see how

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.300 
the different shutter speeds and see how
they<00:00:36.120> affect<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.540> video<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> stills<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
they affect the video and the stills so

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.500 
they affect the video and the stills so
let's<00:00:38.490> go<00:00:38.579> ahead<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:38.940> started<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.390> of

unlike stills video needs motion blur to
look<00:01:59.640> good<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.150> that's<00:02:01.020> our<00:02:01.170> challenge<00:02:01.440> here<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
look good so that's our challenge here a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.390 
look good so that's our challenge here a
balance<00:02:02.430> between<00:02:02.520> those<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:02.850> thoughts

before<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.120> do<00:02:05.240> our<00:02:05.270> shadow<00:02:05.600> test<00:02:05.870> let's<00:02:06.080> take

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
before we do our shadow test let's take

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.980 
before we do our shadow test let's take
a<00:02:06.260> look<00:02:06.500> at<00:02:06.590> how<00:02:06.680> we<00:02:06.740> set<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:06.980> a<00:02:07.160> range<00:02:07.370> shot

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
a look at how we set up a range shot

a look at how we set up a range shot
we're<00:02:08.990> shooting<00:02:09.170> outside<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.100> rain<00:02:10.280> can

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
we're shooting outside so the rain can

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.890 
we're shooting outside so the rain can
run<00:02:10.640> down<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.970> driveway<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.540> not<00:02:11.660> cause<00:02:11.870> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.820 
problem first we're going to put up to
twelve<00:02:14.150> by<00:02:14.270> twelve<00:02:14.300> do<00:02:14.690> 18<00:02:14.990> side<00:02:15.260> by<00:02:15.440> side<00:02:15.680> to

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
twelve by twelve do 18 side by side to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.010 
twelve by twelve do 18 side by side to
create<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.070> black<00:02:16.340> background<00:02:16.670> do<00:02:17.660> 18<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:17.990> a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
black fabric that doesn't really reflect

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.040 
black fabric that doesn't really reflect
much<00:02:19.910> light<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.600> perfect

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
much light so that's a perfect

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
making rain in an earlier video we did

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.450 
making rain in an earlier video we did
called<00:02:41.840> creating<00:02:42.440> rain<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.710> special<00:02:43.190> effect

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
called creating rain a special effect

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.310 
called creating rain a special effect
these<00:02:44.210> will<00:02:44.360> both<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.630> placed<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.050> camera

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
these will both be placed on the camera

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.050 
these will both be placed on the camera
right<00:02:45.470> side<00:02:45.680> shooting<00:02:46.160> up<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.610> allowing<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
right side shooting up and allowing the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.270 
right side shooting up and allowing the
rain<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.330> fall<00:02:47.480> onto<00:02:47.660> our<00:02:47.840> umbrellas<00:02:48.280> it's

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
rain to fall onto our umbrellas it's

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.740 
rain to fall onto our umbrellas it's
nice<00:02:49.520> because<00:02:49.700> our<00:02:49.940> frame<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.270> pretty<00:02:50.510> tight

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
nice because our frame is pretty tight

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
nice because our frame is pretty tight
so<00:02:51.020> these<00:02:51.170> two<00:02:51.380> will<00:02:51.500> cover<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.980> area<00:02:52.250> pretty

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
so these two will cover the area pretty

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.240 
so these two will cover the area pretty
well<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.230> supposed<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.620> be<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.770> night<00:02:55.010> shot

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
well this is supposed to be a night shot

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.800 
well this is supposed to be a night shot
so<00:02:55.490> I'll<00:02:55.610> set<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.910> color<00:02:56.210> balance<00:02:56.600> on<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
so I'll set the color balance on the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.560 
so I'll set the color balance on the
canon<00:02:57.110> 1dc<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.920> tungsten<00:02:58.160> or<00:02:58.520> 3200<00:02:59.270> degrees

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.440 
canon 1dc to tungsten or 3200 degrees
this<00:03:00.350> makes<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.770> sunlight<00:03:01.190> very<00:03:01.220> blue<00:03:01.790> here's

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
this makes the sunlight very blue here's

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.820 
this makes the sunlight very blue here's
our<00:03:02.600> first<00:03:02.810> shot<00:03:03.080> with<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.320> rain<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.530> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
our first shot with the rain and the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.360 
our first shot with the rain and the
sunlight<00:03:04.040> only<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.770> camera<00:03:07.100> left<00:03:07.250> side

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
sunlight only for the camera left side

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.640 
sunlight only for the camera left side
we<00:03:07.670> added<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.940> 1k<00:03:08.330> Fresnel<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.050> be<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.290> her<00:03:09.380> face

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
we added a 1k Fresnel to be on her face

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.350 
we added a 1k Fresnel to be on her face
this<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.459> tungsten<00:03:10.760> light<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.150> it'll<00:03:11.300> be

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
this is a tungsten light so it'll be

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.610 
this is a tungsten light so it'll be
neutral<00:03:11.750> on<00:03:11.840> her<00:03:12.020> face<00:03:14.170> here<00:03:15.170> we're<00:03:15.350> trying<00:03:15.470> to

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
neutral on her face here we're trying to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.199 
neutral on her face here we're trying to
compete<00:03:15.950> with<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.190> Sun<00:03:16.430> as<00:03:16.580> our<00:03:16.700> backlight<00:03:17.180> so

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
compete with the Sun as our backlight so

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.060 
compete with the Sun as our backlight so
we<00:03:17.480> need<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.660> lot<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:17.959> light<00:03:18.080> on<00:03:18.110> her<00:03:18.410> face<00:03:18.620> we'll

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
we need a lot of light on her face we'll

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.370 
we need a lot of light on her face we'll
add<00:03:19.250> another<00:03:19.400> 2k<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.050> looks<00:03:21.230> much

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
add another 2k and that looks much

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.470 
add another 2k and that looks much
better

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
better

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.580 
better
our<00:03:23.480> last<00:03:23.720> slide<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:24.050> going<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.260> be<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.380> fill

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
our last slide is going to be a fill

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.290 
our last slide is going to be a fill

now<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.750> our<00:03:35.840> lights<00:03:36.080> are<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.320> place<00:03:36.530> let's

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
now that our lights are in place let's

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.840 
now that our lights are in place let's
take<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.920> look<00:03:37.160> at<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.400> different<00:03:37.700> shutter

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850

to add another layer I thought that was

very effective here's some of the
footage<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.710> we<00:04:52.889> shot<00:04:52.919> at<00:04:53.190> 60<00:04:53.520> frames<00:04:53.669> a

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
footage that we shot at 60 frames a

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.120 
footage that we shot at 60 frames a
second<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.389> one<00:04:54.600> 125th<00:04:55.380> of<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.590> second<00:04:55.949> shutter

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
second and one 125th of a second shutter

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.279 
second and one 125th of a second shutter
speed<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.330> one<00:04:57.600> of<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.780> stills<00:04:58.050> that<00:04:58.139> we

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
speed this is one of the stills that we

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.689 
speed this is one of the stills that we
pulled<00:04:58.530> from<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.830> slow-motion<00:04:59.490> footage

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
pulled from that slow-motion footage

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.820 
pulled from that slow-motion footage
this<00:05:00.510> is<00:05:00.660> a<00:05:00.720> fast<00:05:01.020> shutter<00:05:01.260> speed<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:01.590> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
this is a fast shutter speed so the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.800 
this is a fast shutter speed so the
stills<00:05:02.100> are<00:05:02.220> a<00:05:02.250> little<00:05:02.400> sharper<00:05:02.699> but<00:05:03.419> downsize

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
stills are a little sharper but downsize

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.330 
stills are a little sharper but downsize
your<00:05:04.020> shooting<00:05:04.289> slow<00:05:04.500> motion<00:05:04.919> it's<00:05:05.130> very

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
your shooting slow motion it's very

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.800 
your shooting slow motion it's very
beautiful<00:05:05.580> but<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.210> can't<00:05:06.419> shoot<00:05:06.600> slow

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
beautiful but you can't shoot slow

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.900 
beautiful but you can't shoot slow
motion<00:05:07.199> all<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.350> time

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.580 

you<00:05:10.420> know<00:05:10.540> my<00:05:10.690> conclusion<00:05:11.290> about<00:05:11.440> this

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
you know my conclusion about this

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.530 
you know my conclusion about this
process<00:05:11.860> employing<00:05:12.430> stills<00:05:12.730> from<00:05:12.970> video<00:05:13.300> with

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
process employing stills from video with

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.910 
process employing stills from video with
the<00:05:13.630> intent<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:13.930> using<00:05:14.200> both<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.500> stills<00:05:14.680> and

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
the intent of using both the stills and

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.980 
the intent of using both the stills and
the<00:05:15.100> video<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.640> that<00:05:16.330> it's<00:05:16.480> pretty<00:05:16.690> difficult

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
the video is that it's pretty difficult

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.470 
the video is that it's pretty difficult
and<00:05:17.470> only<00:05:17.830> good<00:05:18.160> for<00:05:18.310> certain<00:05:18.610> things<00:05:18.790> if

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
and only good for certain things if

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.670 
and only good for certain things if
you're<00:05:19.600> shooting<00:05:19.750> wildlife<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:20.590> outdoor

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
you're shooting wildlife and outdoor

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.350 
you're shooting wildlife and outdoor
things<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.430> think<00:05:21.490> this<00:05:21.760> could<00:05:21.940> be<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.060> great

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
things I think this could be a great

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.900 
things I think this could be a great
option<00:05:22.600> has<00:05:23.320> tremendous<00:05:23.770> possibilities<00:05:24.430> the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
option has tremendous possibilities the

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.070 
option has tremendous possibilities the
problem<00:05:25.240> is<00:05:25.330> you're<00:05:25.450> going<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.630> lose<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:25.840> lot<00:05:26.020> of

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
problem is you're going to lose a lot of

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.840 
problem is you're going to lose a lot of
frames<00:05:26.440> to<00:05:26.620> motion<00:05:27.010> blur<00:05:27.160> especially

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
frames to motion blur especially

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.460 
frames to motion blur especially
shooting<00:05:28.150> something<00:05:28.360> moving<00:05:28.690> like<00:05:28.960> an<00:05:29.080> animal

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
shooting something moving like an animal

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.460 
shooting something moving like an animal
as<00:05:30.270> for<00:05:31.270> advertising<00:05:31.810> when<00:05:32.200> you're<00:05:32.320> shooting

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
as for advertising when you're shooting

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.960 
as for advertising when you're shooting
something<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:33.010> have<00:05:33.130> complete<00:05:33.550> control<00:05:33.580> over

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
something you have complete control over

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.600 
something you have complete control over
it<00:05:34.840> just<00:05:35.230> doesn't<00:05:35.530> make<00:05:35.710> very<00:05:35.740> much<00:05:36.040> sense<00:05:36.190> to

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
it just doesn't make very much sense to

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.730 
it just doesn't make very much sense to
me<00:05:36.760> I<00:05:36.940> found<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.720> process<00:05:38.110> of<00:05:38.200> point<00:05:38.440> frames

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
me I found the process of point frames

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.980 
me I found the process of point frames
was<00:05:39.190> kind<00:05:39.340> of<00:05:39.370> like<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.520> shotgun<00:05:39.820> approach<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:40.930> I

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
was kind of like a shotgun approach so I

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.150 
was kind of like a shotgun approach so I
kind<00:05:41.170> of<00:05:41.230> felt<00:05:41.410> like<00:05:41.440> we're<00:05:41.710> just<00:05:41.740> letting<00:05:41.980> the

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
kind of felt like we're just letting the

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.220 
kind of felt like we're just letting the
camera<00:05:42.460> roll<00:05:42.640> having<00:05:43.120> her<00:05:43.240> move<00:05:43.450> and<00:05:43.930> did<00:05:44.110> we

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
camera roll having her move and did we

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.770 
camera roll having her move and did we
get<00:05:44.440> something<00:05:44.890> was<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.280> right<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.820> just<00:05:46.570> felt

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
get something was it right I just felt

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.830 
get something was it right I just felt
very<00:05:46.840> distant<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.650> not<00:05:47.770> comfortable<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.460> me

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
very distant and not comfortable to me

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.910 
very distant and not comfortable to me
the<00:05:49.840> shutter<00:05:50.080> speed<00:05:50.260> really<00:05:50.500> is<00:05:50.650> an<00:05:50.770> issue

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
the shutter speed really is an issue

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.640 
the shutter speed really is an issue
that<00:05:51.040> can't<00:05:51.370> be<00:05:51.430> solved<00:05:51.880> right<00:05:51.940> now<00:05:52.650> one

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
that can't be solved right now one

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.170 
that can't be solved right now one
fifteenth<00:05:54.070> of<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.220> second<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:54.640> what<00:05:54.760> looks<00:05:54.940> best

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
fifteenth of a second is what looks best

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.630

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
at 24 frames a second it gives too much

at 24 frames a second it gives too much

1dc and want to buy one I see times when
it<00:06:10.960> would<00:06:11.020> be<00:06:11.080> a<00:06:11.140> great<00:06:11.500> value<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:11.950> be<00:06:12.010> able<00:06:12.040> to

it would be a great value to be able to

personally learned this process has
limitations<00:06:16.570> but<00:06:16.810> there<00:06:16.960> are<00:06:17.050> times<00:06:17.260> when<00:06:17.440> it

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
limitations but there are times when it

limitations but there are times when it
be<00:06:17.590> extremely<00:06:18.070> valuable<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:19.240> keep<00:06:19.480> those
