00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
burnt there's a big crater in the center

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
burnt there's a big crater in the center
of<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> audio

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
of it there and all that is is the audio

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.740 
of it there and all that is is the audio
amp<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.130> standard<00:01:17.340> through<00:01:17.909> mount<00:01:18.150> IC

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
amp and it's a standard through mount IC

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
amp and it's a standard through mount IC
not<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.439> fancy<00:01:19.680> service<00:01:20.189> mountain<00:01:20.490> junk<00:01:20.759> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
not some fancy service mountain junk so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
not some fancy service mountain junk so
I<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:22.320> could<00:01:22.470> care<00:01:22.590> less<00:01:22.650> about<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.100> audio

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
I really could care less about the audio

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.399 
I really could care less about the audio
on<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.390> testing<00:01:24.750> purposes<00:01:25.170> I'll

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
on this and for testing purposes I'll

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
on this and for testing purposes I'll
just<00:01:25.560> remove<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.130> chip<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
just remove that chip and see if the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.569 
just remove that chip and see if the
monitor<00:01:27.390> runs<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.890> order<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> these

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
monitor runs I can order one of these

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.260 
monitor runs I can order one of these
any<00:01:29.850> time<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> stick<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> back<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
any time and stick it back in there so I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.410 
any time and stick it back in there so I
guess<00:01:33.720> I'll<00:01:33.869> pull<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.170> board<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.590> now<00:01:35.420> all

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
guess I'll pull this board out now all

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
guess I'll pull this board out now all
right<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.960> got<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.290> piece<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> junk

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right now that I got that piece of junk

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.760 
right now that I got that piece of junk
M<00:01:38.220> chip<00:01:38.490> removed<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:39.960> gonna<00:01:40.110> try<00:01:40.320> power<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
M chip removed I'm gonna try power this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.940 
M chip removed I'm gonna try power this
up<00:01:41.329> see<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.960> rest<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> monitor<00:01:43.710> works

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
up see if the rest of the monitor works

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.760 
up see if the rest of the monitor works
I<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.369> found<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.909> I've<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> broken

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
I also found that I've got a broken

being see Jack I'm gonna try and Satre

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.039 
being see Jack I'm gonna try and Satre
that<00:01:48.479> back<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.840> place<00:01:49.079> while<00:01:49.350> I'm<00:01:49.470> attitude

that back in place while I'm attitude

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
that back in place while I'm attitude
after<00:01:52.049> some<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.649> poking<00:01:53.040> around<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
after some more poking around I

after some more poking around I
discovered<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.579> DC<00:01:56.579> converter<00:01:56.969> circuit

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
discovered that the DC converter circuit

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.490 
discovered that the DC converter circuit
is<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> backlight<00:01:58.619> inverter<00:01:58.979> board

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
is on the backlight inverter board

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.190 
is on the backlight inverter board
and<00:02:00.340> there<00:02:00.790> was<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> very<00:02:01.210> tiny<00:02:01.510> fuse<00:02:01.900> it<00:02:02.110> was

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
and there was a very tiny fuse it was

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.090 
and there was a very tiny fuse it was
belong<00:02:02.470> called<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.520> picot<00:02:03.850> fuse<00:02:04.150> actually<00:02:04.690> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
belong called a picot fuse actually and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.800 
belong called a picot fuse actually and
I<00:02:06.100> did<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> temporary<00:02:06.940> very<00:02:07.630> crappy<00:02:08.259> looking

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
I did a temporary very crappy looking

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.300 
I did a temporary very crappy looking
fuse<00:02:10.810> rig<00:02:11.080> there<00:02:11.320> I<00:02:11.350> put<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> two<00:02:11.830> minute<00:02:11.950> fast

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
fuse rig there I put a two minute fast

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.590 
fuse rig there I put a two minute fast
blow<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.390> board<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.760> removed<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.940> burn

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
blow on the board and removed that burn

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.660 
blow on the board and removed that burn
up<00:02:16.750> amp<00:02:16.990> chip<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.590> said<00:02:17.830> got<00:02:18.400> rid<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.610> that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
up amp chip like I said got rid of that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:31.860 
up amp chip like I said got rid of that
short<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:20.700> check<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.850> out

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.000 

works

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.340 

so<00:02:37.270> very<00:02:38.270> promising<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.960> think<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:39.170> going<00:02:39.320> to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
so very promising I think I'm going to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.550 
so very promising I think I'm going to
go<00:02:39.470> ahead<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.920> get<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.110> amp<00:02:42.290> chip

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
go ahead and get the get that amp chip

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.220 
go ahead and get the get that amp chip
replaced<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:44.060> course<00:02:44.330> replace<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.050> with

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
replaced and of course replace that with

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.640 
replaced and of course replace that with
the<00:02:45.320> proper<00:02:45.470> fuse<00:02:46.690> caps<00:02:47.690> are<00:02:47.900> all<00:02:48.020> good<00:02:48.230> except

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the proper fuse caps are all good except

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.130 
the proper fuse caps are all good except
for<00:02:48.680> like<00:02:49.070> two<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.910> them<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.150> think<00:02:50.420> I'll<00:02:50.780> change

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
for like two of them I think I'll change

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.720 
for like two of them I think I'll change
those<00:02:52.870> when<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.050> other<00:02:54.650> parts<00:02:54.950> come<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.340> and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
those when the other parts come in and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.490 
those when the other parts come in and
this<00:02:56.030> project<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.630> coming<00:02:56.810> along<00:02:57.110> quite<00:02:57.290> well

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
this project is coming along quite well

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.830 
this project is coming along quite well
I<00:02:57.980> didn't<00:02:58.790> think<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.000> was<00:02:59.060> able<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.390> fix<00:02:59.630> this

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
I didn't think I was able to fix this

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.020 
I didn't think I was able to fix this
one<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.350> think<00:03:00.950> what<00:03:01.250> happened<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.820> somebody

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
one I think what happened is somebody

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.980 
one I think what happened is somebody
used<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.540> wrong<00:03:02.690> AC<00:03:02.960> adapter<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.990> that

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
used the wrong AC adapter on it and that

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.780 
used the wrong AC adapter on it and that
you<00:03:06.320> know<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.560> toll<00:03:06.770> bolts<00:03:07.130> go<00:03:07.250> straight<00:03:07.550> into

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
you know the toll bolts go straight into

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.790 
you know the toll bolts go straight into
the<00:03:07.880> amp<00:03:08.060> chip<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.570> burnt<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.050> out<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.560> then

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the amp chip it burnt that out and then

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.410 
the amp chip it burnt that out and then
the<00:03:10.040> rest<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.430> goes<00:03:10.610> through<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:10.940> fuse

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
the rest of it goes through that fuse

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.320 
the rest of it goes through that fuse
there<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.220> luckily<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.490> fuse<00:03:13.760> actually

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
there so luckily the fuse actually

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.970 
there so luckily the fuse actually
protected<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> circuit<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.470> time<00:03:15.710> instead

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
protected the circuit this time instead

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.410 
protected the circuit this time instead
of<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.220> circuit<00:03:16.640> protecting<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.240> fuse<00:03:17.800> so

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
of the circuit protecting the fuse so

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.900 
of the circuit protecting the fuse so
let<00:03:20.420> me<00:03:20.600> see<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:21.020> I<00:03:21.110> can<00:03:21.290> get<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.370> parts<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:22.730> and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
let me see if I can get the parts in and

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.160 
let me see if I can get the parts in and
make<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.180> thing<00:03:23.390> work<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.810> put<00:03:24.020> back

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
make this thing work and put back

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.400 
make this thing work and put back
together<00:03:25.480> all<00:03:26.480> right<00:03:26.720> I'm<00:03:26.870> getting<00:03:26.960> ready<00:03:27.290> to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
together all right I'm getting ready to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.140 
together all right I'm getting ready to
make<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.620> parts<00:03:28.040> order<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:28.790> want<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.030> make

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
make a parts order and I want to make

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.730 
make a parts order and I want to make
sure<00:03:29.300> I've<00:03:29.390> got<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.630> right<00:03:29.780> value<00:03:30.170> fuse<00:03:30.440> here

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
sure I've got the right value fuse here

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.700 
sure I've got the right value fuse here
and<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:32.000> funny<00:03:32.270> thing<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:33.020> guess<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.530> two

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
and the funny thing is I guess the two

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.070 
and the funny thing is I guess the two
meant<00:03:33.890> fast<00:03:34.130> blow<00:03:34.490> just<00:03:35.480> off<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.720> top<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.930> my

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
meant fast blow just off the top of my

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.630 
meant fast blow just off the top of my
head<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.440> ended<00:03:36.770> up<00:03:36.890> being<00:03:37.100> about<00:03:37.220> exactly

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
head it ended up being about exactly

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.030 
head it ended up being about exactly
what<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:37.940> need<00:03:38.180> because<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:39.560> monitor<00:03:39.980> is

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
what I need because the monitor is

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.380 
what I need because the monitor is
drawing<00:03:40.280> one<00:03:40.520> point<00:03:40.790> three<00:03:40.970> amps

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
drawing one point three amps

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.460 
drawing one point three amps
continuously<00:03:42.020> during<00:03:42.980> operation<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.750> 1.5

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
continuously during operation and a 1.5

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.040 
continuously during operation and a 1.5
amp<00:03:45.740> probably<00:03:46.100> blow<00:03:46.250> on<00:03:46.430> startup<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.210> two

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
amp probably blow on startup so two

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.200 
amp probably blow on startup so two
minute<00:03:48.260> fast<00:03:48.530> blow<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.550> probably<00:03:49.850> right

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
minute fast blow and it's probably right

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.730 
minute fast blow and it's probably right
about<00:03:50.300> what<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.660> needs<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:53.620> don't<00:03:54.620> really

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
about what it needs and don't really

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.210 
about what it needs and don't really
want<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.010> use<00:03:55.160> another<00:03:55.370> Pico<00:03:55.820> fuse<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:57.100> mean<00:03:58.100> I

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
want to use another Pico fuse I mean I

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.250 
want to use another Pico fuse I mean I
could<00:03:58.490> if<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:59.180> can<00:03:59.390> get<00:03:59.570> them<00:03:59.660> easily<00:04:00.020> enough

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
could if I can get them easily enough

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.690 
could if I can get them easily enough
but<00:04:00.560> what<00:04:00.770> I'll<00:04:00.860> probably<00:04:01.070> end<00:04:01.220> up<00:04:01.310> doing<00:04:01.370> is

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
but what I'll probably end up doing is

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.580 
but what I'll probably end up doing is
just<00:04:01.880> attaching<00:04:02.390> wires<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.080> spot<00:04:03.350> and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
just attaching wires to the spot and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.190 
just attaching wires to the spot and
either<00:04:04.460> mount<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.790> fuse<00:04:05.030> holder<00:04:05.060> here<00:04:05.660> or<00:04:05.990> just

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
either mount a fuse holder here or just

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.230 
either mount a fuse holder here or just
have<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.350> small<00:04:06.650> internal<00:04:07.040> fuse<00:04:07.400> soldered<00:04:08.120> on

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
have a small internal fuse soldered on

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.880 
have a small internal fuse soldered on
the<00:04:08.330> board<00:04:08.540> there<00:04:11.170> I'm<00:04:12.170> gonna<00:04:12.380> order<00:04:12.650> some

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
the board there I'm gonna order some

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.650 
the board there I'm gonna order some
parts<00:04:13.070> at<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.730> same<00:04:13.790> time<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.390> get<00:04:14.480> this

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
parts at the same time and get this

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.770 
parts at the same time and get this
audio<00:04:15.200> amp<00:04:15.440> ship<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.740> I<00:04:15.800> need<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.780> try
