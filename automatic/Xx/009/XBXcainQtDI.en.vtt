00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:02.270
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.240
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.900
 Today, I would like to learn rests on the second day of reading beginner's manual. 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.950
 To put it so flatly, music only has to make or not make a sound. 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.880
 Even if I make a sound, I wonder what the rhythm is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.110
 Even if you don't make a sound, there will be a rhythm, but 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.690
 If it divides roughly, it is a story whether it makes or does not make a sound. 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.870
 Roughly speaking, it is the sign, but there is a sign and what kind of kind is in it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.350
 One is a note. It is a sign that I will make a sound, a sign. 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.060
 Another is rest. 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.640
 It is a symbol that it does not make a sound. 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.829
 This two. 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.320
 On the first day, I used only quarter notes or quarter notes, 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.380
 The rest comes out on the second day. 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.470
 What kind of rest is it? It's a quarter rest. 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.930
 It is written in the text. 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.270
 "Lear rest, quarter rest". It is written as "un". 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.210
 What does it mean, what does it mean and how to read it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.689
 If this comes ・ ・ ・ This is a quarter rest, but when this comes, I read "un". 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.939
 I read this quarter note "tan". 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.909
 In the case of quarter rest, it is "un". 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.600
 "Tan" and "Un". 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.470
 I want this length to focus on the same place. 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.369
 I will try for a moment. 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:53.179
 In the first day's review, for example, if there were such notes, these were "tan", "tan", "tan" and "tan". 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.420
 "Tan", "Tan", "Tan", "Tan". 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.609
 But this interval 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.479
 What if a new quarter break comes in today? 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.879
 This, just before ... 

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:12.599
 "Tan", "Tan", "Tan", "Tan" part of "Tan" will change to "U". 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.690
 "Tan", "Un", "Tan", "Tan". 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.029
 "Tan", "Un", "Tan", "Tan". 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.790
 With "tan", "un", "tan", "tan". 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.319
 And this "un" part does not make a sound. 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.069
 It does not stretch, it does not make a sound. 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.749
 If you say "Jahn" and "Tang" and "Turn", "Un" cuts the sound. 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:37.860
 When you play the guitar, it is a symbol that you should always cut the sound so that this part does not make a sound. 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.379
 And furthermore, if this "un" also comes here, 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:50.129
 It feels like “tan”, “un”, “tan”, “un”, “tan”, “un”, “tan”, “un”. 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.540
 Let's actually play this on a guitar. 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.409
 Oh, good tuning. 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:06.709
 It feels like “tan”, “un”, “tan”, “un”, “tan”, “un”, “tan”, “un”. 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.319
 If this is an application, let's see 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.079
 "Taka", "Un", 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.909
 It feels like "Taka", "Un". 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:28.109
 With "Taka", "Un", "Taka", "Un", "Taka", "Un", "Taka", and "Un". 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.420
 It is NG that this will be extended to "Takar", "Takar", "Takar", "Takar". 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.849
 However, even if I really play "Taka, Tan", "Taka, Tan", it is NG. 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.780
 Stop the sound here 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.289
 "Taka", ("Un"), "Taka", ("Un"), "Taka", ("Un"), "Taka", ("Un"), 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:53.289
 With "Taka", ("Un"), "Taka", ("Un"), "Taka", ("Un"), "Taka", ("Un") 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.469
 I will cut off the sound. 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.530
 This is a quarter rest I want you to remember on the second day. 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.569
 A symbol that says no sound. 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.599
 This is a combination of various issues for the second day. 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.719
 At first I try to sing and if I have enough power I try to play the guitar. 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:17.329
 Let's do it for a while, the second day. 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.329
 BPM goes by 100. 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.480
 "・ ・ Sun, Sea". 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.130
 "Tang, Un, Tang, Un", "Taka, Un, Taka, Un" 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.720
 "Tang, Un, Tang, Un", "Taka, Un, Taka, Un". 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.670
 "Taka, Un, Un, Taka", "Un, Tan, Un, Tan", 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.510
 "Taka, Un, Un, Taka", "Un, Tan, Un, Tan". 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.390
 It is like this. 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.840
 So, this rest will be continuous from the third row. 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.860
 It feels like "un, ung" or "un, ung, ung". 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:59.950
 I do not play more than one, two, three or three, but two or three in a row 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.710
 What do you mean? 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.180
 There are people who just don't know where you are now, 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.770
 With your eyes firmly, what note are you singing now? 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.480
 I think that you should listen while checking. 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.780
 At present there are three types. 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.790
 "Tan", "Taka", "Un". 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.430
 Because only these three come out, I know calmly and firmly 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.710
 I think it would be nice if you could read the score as smooth. 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.120
 First of all, you can download and print this, because you can always print this, 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.290
 You may write your own words. 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.130
 Below the note this reads "tan". I read "un". I read "Tan". I read "un". 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.730
 It feels like "Taka, Un, Taka, Un", "Tan, Un, Tan, Un". 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:49.260
 So if you try to sing along to the sound source and fit together, the second day is OK. 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.770
 It feels like. 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.920
 If you struggled on the first day, maybe you would struggle on the second day, 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.070
 Please try a challenge. 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.060
 Then the next day is the third day. 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.160
 Those who finished here were thank you today. good night. 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.100
 If you continue on the third day as it is, please next, thank you.
