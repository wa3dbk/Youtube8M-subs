00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 when they started with this morning 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.660
 this beautiful philosophy at the end 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.250
 again but I forget now 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 intentionally forgetting that I speak English 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.630
 and I forget that all that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.000
 we all have these difficult chords 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.710
 and a bit of jesse chords the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.420
 installation really has to be perfect 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.130
 I have forced myself to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 say let me just times with 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 be part of set and suddenly 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.970
 I have the feeling that I was whole 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 okay i am part of the group 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.790
 Now I'll just leave it as I leave it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.040
 Just walk and that was the best part 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.399
 day but this courage you have to do that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.410
 have next to these incredible 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.329
 repaired ensemble there you are 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 Of course at the beginning you think like 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.960
 I manage to be one-piece values 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.320
 if you are less exhausting then 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.320
 it will be easier 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.590
 So there was a stake in the violence 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.290
 the vocal ensemble work 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.540
 we talked about it, I love it 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.310
 I love singing with singers too 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.110
 I love to work as a singer at all 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.430
 but it has always been incredible 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.640
 that's why I'm fascinated by the 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.290
 Idea with the patient to say it would be 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.670
 not a great idea with the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.710
 rights to work and become 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.900
 different so spoken and me 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.210
 different discussed and then 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.530
 At some point I said on 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.510
 Of course, the best would be the king's singers 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.130
 but the king's singers ask 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.300
 Let's get the best ensemble 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.300
 ask what's there 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.430
 May 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830
 2 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.080
 I have already thought with you earlier 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.360
 in some ways it is so much better 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.580
 because he was standing next to us 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.620
 if you are with us then feel or 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.150
 we breathe the things out here 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.980
 want it makes a big difference 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.470
 when you feel the energy 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.730
 feels if yes was allowed to stand exactly and 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.840
 I do not feel just when you are 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.210
 inhale i feel that too is coming 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.010
 before he starts I already have this 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.140
 energy the enjoyment and then it starts 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.660
 this is something that is incredibly beautiful 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.660
 you can hardly do that to a singer 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660
 to explain 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.709
 we always do so many 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.989
 Christmas concerts in the year and we 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.080
 thought is like cool idea somehow 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.900
 not only christmas songs in january in 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.700
 march in november it came by a 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.860
 All winter show june sank 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.480
 between october and april is everything 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.480
 year in england already june 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.380
 b 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.870
 a lot of opera the hÃ¤nsel and 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.370
 of course , gretel child know this 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.150
 I want a beautiful duet in the evening 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.150
 go to sleep 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.130
 when I was there I already heard of 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.280
 first concert I said something 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.780
 I have something like that never would and 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.780
 I know a lot of singers 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.030
 old 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.810
 I am so in this sense of this 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.040
 song fell in love with the cheapest 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.280
 is all together would 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.190
 I have this wonderful arranger in 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.520
 berlin likes to fuck and he has 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.139
 really incredible 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.729
 I think that's something quite 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.250
 special in this point because it is 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.740
 Not just not just two people 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.840
 the sing or have this dialogue are 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.500
 it really is infiltrated by agree 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.780
 voice 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.620
 it still remains possible this one 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.350
 beautiful 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.090
 for me what so special also 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:00.310
 determine our first counter tenor 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:04.580
 sing it that way 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.990
 even though it's so high espace me 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.960
 It is not an easy piece though 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.850
 somehow it would be too strong somehow 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.180
 be voting for others during one 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.180
 voice
