00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 The folks I did it in a car and 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.040
 connector I drew from an old motherboard 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.020
 and I put two connectors to be dumb 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.130
 to be able to pay part of the other 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.769
 I can go to the radio where you can 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.510
 put the photo in my photo 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.510
 camera does not focus here 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.460
 a dr recorder i bought on the free market 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:46.129
 29 20 reais plus freight 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:50.930
 He comes with cable, you see. 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.970
 correct pin assignment here of the two terminals 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.120
 You already saw the image that I put 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:07.430
 we use 66 wires six connections one ovcc 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:11.119
 reset s &amp; r msmo ufms รณ eo eo o gnv 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:16.180
 so we have to call an accent now 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:23.630
 on the soldering board and then I'll be right back 29 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.369
 the staff is no longer complicated at all 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.429
 give a little condition in the image 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.270
 to hit the tuning I'm going to do 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:34.250
 now I'm going to close this here I'm going to put 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.110
 a retractable car here leave a way 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.560
 maybe from the opinion of hot glue here 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.899
 For this, do not force yourself and I will. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.700
 close it and we'll test it, I'll go 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.509
 also show after how I go 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.640
 attach the connector there on the other side 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:57.860
 in a little while the people what I did 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:03.369
 open a hole here in the place where 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.369
 We put the battery and I do not 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:19.510
 a battery that is bigger here then 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.510
 who will do is catch the bug 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:35.790
 now that I'll do it well here 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:39.209
 with hot glue and looks perfect from the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.130
 staff expects the personnel program 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:48.300
 is here a connector glued to the line 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:52.560
 with it well with hot glue behind right 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.069
 now I'm going to close the radio and pass part 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.069
 of programming 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:07.019
 just got ready ready it's all done 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:12.709
 It's been really cool because here in the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.709
 right sahy corner
