00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
well that's a very complex question I am

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.360 
well that's a very complex question I am
not<00:01:51.030> sure<00:01:51.080> whether<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.560> experience<00:01:53.160> of<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
not sure whether the experience of the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.270 
not sure whether the experience of the
works<00:01:53.580> is<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.360> helped<00:01:54.900> by<00:01:55.470> asking<00:01:55.920> oneself

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
works is really helped by asking oneself

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490 
works is really helped by asking oneself
the<00:01:56.520> question<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.690> art<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.440> not

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the question is this art or is this not

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.730 
the question is this art or is this not
art<00:01:59.010> finally<00:01:59.880> although<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:01.170> will<00:02:01.500> always

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
art finally although you will always

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.430 
art finally although you will always
come<00:02:01.920> back<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.280> question<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.440> but

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
come back to that question so but

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.220 
come back to that question so but
finally<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.120> much<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.570> than<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
finally it is much more than just the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.410 
finally it is much more than just the
question<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.860> art<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:09.060> question<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
question is this art the question is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.320 
question is this art the question is
does<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.290> an<00:02:10.560> impact<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.040> me<00:02:11.250> does<00:02:12.210> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
does this have an impact on me does this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.620 
does this have an impact on me does this
move<00:02:12.540> me<00:02:12.720> does<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.710> make<00:02:13.890> me<00:02:13.950> see<00:02:14.370> things

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
move me does this make me see things

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.320

is straight literal paint on canvas you

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.270 
is straight literal paint on canvas you

marriage of reason and squalor so

marriage of reason and squalor so
minimalist<00:03:00.150> art<00:03:00.330> isn't<00:03:00.570> just<00:03:01.020> about<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.350> work

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
minimalist art isn't just about the work

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.560 
minimalist art isn't just about the work
itself<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:02.700> about<00:03:03.000> what<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.330> viewer

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
itself it's about what the viewer

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.260 
itself it's about what the viewer
experiences<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.430> depends<00:03:05.760> largely<00:03:05.970> on

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
experiences and that depends largely on

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.410 
experiences and that depends largely on
where<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.989> art<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.290> exhibited<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.150> think<00:03:09.150> one

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
where the art is exhibited I think one

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.490 
where the art is exhibited I think one
of<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.600> most<00:03:09.810> interesting<00:03:10.230> things<00:03:10.410> about

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
of the most interesting things about

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.850 
of the most interesting things about
minimalism<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.060> engages<00:03:12.209> its

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
minimalism is that it engages its

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.590 
minimalism is that it engages its
architectural<00:03:13.860> surroundings<00:03:14.400> directly<00:03:14.970> so

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
architectural surroundings directly so

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.930 
architectural surroundings directly so
for<00:03:15.810> example<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.800> sculpture<00:03:17.250> by<00:03:17.280> carl<00:03:17.790> andre

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
for example the sculpture by carl andre

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.940 
for example the sculpture by carl andre
rests<00:03:18.570> directly<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> floor<00:03:19.530> there's<00:03:19.830> no

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
rests directly on the floor there's no

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.250 
rests directly on the floor there's no
pedestal<00:03:20.340> underneath<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.180> it's<00:03:21.750> about<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
pedestal underneath it it's about the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.290 
pedestal underneath it it's about the
relationship<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.100> these<00:03:23.520> industrially

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
relationship of these industrially

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.050 
relationship of these industrially
fabricated<00:03:25.020> aluminum<00:03:25.170> squares<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> floor

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
fabricated aluminum squares to the floor

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.479 
fabricated aluminum squares to the floor
and<00:03:27.330> it's<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.470> composition<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.160> grid

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
and it's in the composition of a grid

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.420 
and it's in the composition of a grid
and<00:03:29.760> also<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.380> visitor<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.100> case<00:03:32.280> is

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
and also the visitor in this case is

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.460 
and also the visitor in this case is
actually<00:03:32.850> invited<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.540> really<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:33.959> walk<00:03:34.200> on

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
actually invited to really just walk on

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.440 
actually invited to really just walk on
the<00:03:34.590> piece<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:35.370> engaged<00:03:35.880> directly<00:03:36.150> with

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
the piece so it's engaged directly with

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.970 
the piece so it's engaged directly with
a<00:03:36.510> floor<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.900> with<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.140> viewer<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.680> walk

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
a floor and with the viewer you can walk

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.890 
a floor and with the viewer you can walk
on<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.280> art<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.510> can<00:03:39.690> walk<00:03:39.870> on

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
on the art you can in you can walk on

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.140 
on the art you can in you can walk on
this<00:03:40.380> art<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.920> know<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.400> confusing<00:03:41.550> because

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
this art I know it's confusing because

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.660 
this art I know it's confusing because
you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.080> walk<00:03:43.320> on<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.680> carl<00:03:43.890> andre<00:03:44.070> sculpture

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
you can walk on the carl andre sculpture

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.009 
you can walk on the carl andre sculpture
but<00:03:44.820> we<00:03:44.970> hope<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.330> don't<00:03:45.480> walk<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:45.780> anything

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
but we hope you don't walk on anything

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.030 
but we hope you don't walk on anything
else<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> show

that creates some interesting

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.899 
feature solid space if you if you wish
and<00:04:06.870> then<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.079> go<00:04:07.170> from<00:04:07.409> there<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.950> look<00:04:08.459> into

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
and then you go from there and look into

the doorway which is the opposite one

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.610 
the doorway which is the opposite one
could<00:04:11.819> call<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.420> negative<00:04:12.959> space<00:04:13.319> and

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
could call this a negative space and

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.470 
could call this a negative space and
this<00:04:14.250> negative<00:04:14.579> space<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.939> defined<00:04:15.090> by<00:04:15.420> the

normally<00:04:48.539> one<00:04:48.630> says<00:04:48.810> artists<00:04:49.199> something

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
normally one says artists something

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.520 
normally one says artists something
intrinsic<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.520> an<00:04:51.210> artwork<00:04:51.570> is<00:04:51.930> intrinsically

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
intrinsic so an artwork is intrinsically

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.800 
intrinsic so an artwork is intrinsically
art<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:55.500> is<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.650> very<00:04:55.800> romantic<00:04:55.979> idea

candies<00:07:44.199> once<00:07:44.560> our<00:07:45.060> installation<00:07:46.060> is<00:07:46.240> over

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 
candies once our installation is over

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.469 
candies once our installation is over
are<00:07:46.960> just<00:07:47.770> it's<00:07:48.039> just<00:07:48.160> a<00:07:48.400> pile<00:07:48.610> of<00:07:48.639> candies<00:07:49.240> and

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.030 
it's no more something that is endorsed

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.680 
it's no more something that is endorsed
by<00:07:52.120> the<00:07:52.270> artist<00:07:52.690> and<00:07:53.820> if<00:07:54.820> we<00:07:54.849> keep<00:07:55.180> coming<00:07:55.389> back

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:55.690 
by the artist and if we keep coming back

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.350 
by the artist and if we keep coming back
to<00:07:55.750> the<00:07:55.990> question<00:07:56.349> of<00:07:56.440> why<00:07:56.949> is<00:07:57.009> this<00:07:57.340> art<00:07:57.639> maybe

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 
to the question of why is this art maybe

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.760 
to the question of why is this art maybe
it's<00:07:58.599> because<00:07:58.810> there<00:07:59.110> really<00:07:59.229> isn't<00:07:59.650> an

00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.770 
it's because there really isn't an

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.339 
it's because there really isn't an
answer<00:07:59.949> that<00:08:00.340> art<00:08:01.300> might<00:08:01.569> well<00:08:01.870> be<00:08:02.110> whatever

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:02.349 
answer that art might well be whatever

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:05.249 
answer that art might well be whatever
an<00:08:02.680> artist<00:08:03.009> says<00:08:03.340> is<00:08:03.580> art<00:08:03.789> and<00:08:04.000> the<00:08:04.750> value<00:08:05.110> of

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:05.259 
an artist says is art and the value of

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:08.490 
an artist says is art and the value of
it<00:08:05.380> are<00:08:05.500> lies<00:08:05.770> within<00:08:06.159> the<00:08:06.310> experience<00:08:07.000> itself

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:08.500 
it are lies within the experience itself

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.719 
it are lies within the experience itself
you
