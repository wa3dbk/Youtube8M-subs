00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.180
 welcome to geek lees this week 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.189
 we will see the tutorial of the popular game of 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.919
 parties and meetings of jungle friends 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.630
 speed this game is usually fast 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.000
 explain but many times it's complicated 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.500
 do it without using the manual and without 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.150
 lose those valuable minutes that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 we could dedicate to play and pass it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 alright so in this guide we're going to see 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.390
 the rules as well as for players 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.920
 new as for veterans who want 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.920
 refresh we're going to it 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.260
 the objective of the game is simple you must 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.359
 get rid of all of your 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.730
 letters and the first one to get it is the 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.500
 winner at the start of the game 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.870
 place the totem in the center of the table 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.850
 in a place as equidistant as possible 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.500
 among all the players 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.019
 then the player is determined 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.030
 initial random and the cards are dealt 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.089
 one by one starting with this player 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.589
 until they have distributed 80 well 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.239
 we make sure that all have been 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.600
 distributed more evenly 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.600
 possible 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.340
 when all the cards are dealt 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 the starting player starts the game 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
 take a letter from your reservation and place it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.570
 face up in front of him forming his mallet 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.620
 of discards the letter must be removed 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.690
 always outward not inward 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.580
 this is done so that the player does not 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.160
 can see the letter that he gets before the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.050
 rest of the players is important 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.630
 note that it can only be used in this 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.490
 I play one of the hands and the other does not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.130
 you can use nothing more than to fasten 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 Reserve once the player 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.060
 initial has drawn a letter and has 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.800
 put on his discard he touches the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.610
 next player in the sense of 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.610
 clock hands 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.610
 when two players have about their 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.680
 discard deck two cards with 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.110
 identical symbols no matter if they are 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.659
 of different colors a duel occurs 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 the first one who manages to catch the totem 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.310
 wins the duel and eye the rest of 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.259
 players do not participate in it the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.019
 loser will take the discard pile 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.090
 this his adversary his own discards 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.620
 and the boat that are the cards that are 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.930
 under the totem if there was 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.360
 If, as a result of a letter, there 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.099
 duel between more than one player is the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.349
 winner who chooses how to distribute the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.680
 letters and their three cantes and the pot between 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.680
 the losers 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.780
 you have to be careful as there are many 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.820
 symbols that look the same but do not 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.590
 they are so players can 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.530
 wrong and catch the tate in when in 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.270
 reality a duel is not taking place 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.610
 if a player takes the totem when I do not 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.710
 it corresponds either because it is not your duel 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.390
 or because he was wrong or he has it 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.430
 losing its verticality without being 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.260
 being caught immediately he 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.750
 will carry all the discards of the rest 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.180
 of the players and the pot 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.100
 if the players legitimately take the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.490
 'top ten' at the same time the one that has more 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.410
 fingers grabbing it is considered winner 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.120
 in case of a tie fingers that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.120
 grip below is the winner 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.090
 once a duel is resolved it is put 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.310
 again the totem in the center of the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.010
 table and the loser is the one who continues the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.200
 game there are some special cards 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.020
 that do not cause duels but modify a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.310
 little the normal development of the game 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.170
 when the letter of arrows 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.690
 in all players must 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.550
 try to catch the totem the player that 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.790
 he gets it he puts all his deck of 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.680
 discards in the pot and is the first 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.930
 start a new turn 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.299
 when the letter comes Arrows 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.969
 colors are the colors and not the 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.099
 symbols that cause the duels 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.260
 effects of the letter end when it falls 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.269
 the totem there is a duel or another appears 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.719
 special letter looking back at the 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.719
 symbols 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.060
 when the arrow card comes out towards 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.490
 outside all players will draw a 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.350
 letter at a time clear if two appear 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.270
 or three equal symbols there is a 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.980
 duel if a duel does not take place 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.860
 the player who drew the arrow card 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.750
 outward continues the game eye for 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.790
 make sure that the cards are taken out 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.549
 It is recommended that everyone count 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.200
 out loud to three to get them out if 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.740
 another arrow card comes out 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.570
 it is resolved as long as there is no duel 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.280
 if it comes out more by giving it at the same time it only 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.470
 resolves the pain of the player who takes 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.750
 first the totem and this includes if it comes out 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.280
 the letter of arrows inwards that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.280
 take first the totem receives 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.059
 when a player draws the last card 

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:43.759
 this is still in play while the 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:45.769
 rest of players still playing no 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.889
 can be proclaimed winner until it 

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:51.080
 rid of all your discard and eye mallet 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.149
 if the last letter that comes out is the one from 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.399
 arrows towards the center or arrows of 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:57.709
 colors instead of doing what it says 

00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:00.830
 the card is usually the player pick 

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:03.769
 all the discard decks and the pot and 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.779
 the game continues from him without 

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:08.179
 However, if the last letter is 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:11.439
 arrows out that player wins 

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:11.439
 automatically heading 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.660
 and here ends the jungle tutorial 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.030
 speed a game that will surely triumph in 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.770
 the parties and meetings of friends in the 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.750
 next video we will do the tutorial of a 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.700
 game that has received great prizes and 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.220
 that combines the collaborative system with 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.530
 the medieval setting the legends of 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.970
 walk if you liked the video not 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.620
 forget to give the option I like in
