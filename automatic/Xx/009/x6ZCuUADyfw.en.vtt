00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
between them and then you can get a good

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.010 
between them and then you can get a good
front<00:00:27.380> line<00:00:27.560> going<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:29.539> other<00:00:29.570> thing<00:00:29.930> to

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
front line going the other thing to

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.840

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
we're going to use open E reading

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.549 
we're going to use open E reading
seventh<00:01:00.589> fret<00:01:00.829> e<00:01:01.129> on<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.909> a<00:01:01.940> string

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the B

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.480 
the B
and<00:01:12.369> then<00:01:12.850> at<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.780> turn<00:01:14.080> around<00:01:14.440> we're<00:01:15.280> going

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
and then at the turn around we're going

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.980 
and then at the turn around we're going
to<00:01:15.640> use<00:01:15.880> fifth<00:01:16.690> fret<00:01:17.400> sixth<00:01:18.400> fret<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:19.390> seventh

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
to use okay and what we're going to do

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.270 
to use okay and what we're going to do
is<00:01:25.869> we're<00:01:26.170> going<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.350> find<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.740> one<00:01:26.979> measure

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
is we're going to find a one measure

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.999 
is we're going to find a one measure
phrase<00:01:27.729> that<00:01:28.030> we<00:01:28.180> can<00:01:28.390> loop<00:01:28.690> again<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.710> again

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
phrase that we can loop again and again

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.760 
phrase that we can loop again and again
and<00:01:30.340> then<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.300> fourth<00:01:31.690> time<00:01:32.110> we're<00:01:32.619> going<00:01:32.710> to

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
and then the fourth time we're going to

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.010 
and then the fourth time we're going to
change<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.220> just<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.759> little<00:01:33.940> bit<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.869> let

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
change it just a little bit to let

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.600 
change it just a little bit to let
everybody<00:01:35.350> know<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.950> count<00:01:36.220> starts

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
everybody know that the count starts

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.330 
everybody know that the count starts
over<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.659> can<00:01:37.869> do<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.170> at<00:01:38.409> four<00:01:38.710> fret

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
over and you can do this at four fret

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.520 
over and you can do this at four fret
four<00:01:39.729> measures<00:01:40.119> or<00:01:40.450> eight<00:01:40.780> measures<00:01:41.049> or

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
four measures or eight measures or

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.070 
four measures or eight measures or
whatever<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:42.820> this<00:01:42.970> particular<00:01:43.509> one<00:01:43.659> we're

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
whatever for this particular one we're

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.180 
whatever for this particular one we're
going<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.259> use<00:01:44.320> four<00:01:44.740> because<00:01:44.920> that's<00:01:45.100> a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
going to use four because that's a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.930 
going to use four because that's a
pretty<00:01:45.369> standard<00:01:45.670> one<00:01:46.060> okay<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:47.619> I'm<00:01:48.550> taking

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
pretty standard one okay now I'm taking

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.510 
pretty standard one okay now I'm taking
a<00:01:49.030> trick<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.300> I<00:01:49.479> learned<00:01:49.720> from<00:01:49.810> Carol<00:01:50.259> Kaye

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
a trick that I learned from Carol Kaye

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.710 
a trick that I learned from Carol Kaye
instead<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.610> counting<00:01:51.970> four<00:01:52.240> beats<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
instead of counting four beats to the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.320 
instead of counting four beats to the
bar<00:01:52.840> I'm<00:01:53.259> going<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.710> count<00:01:53.890> eight<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.670> that's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
bar I'm going to count eight and that's

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.820 
bar I'm going to count eight and that's
going<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.570> help<00:01:55.720> me<00:01:55.929> stay<00:01:56.229> with<00:01:56.259> my

going to help me stay with my
syncopation<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:57.789> instead<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.300> one<00:01:58.630> two<00:01:59.460> three

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
syncopation so instead of one two three

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.559 
syncopation so instead of one two three
four<00:02:01.119> one<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.140> two<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.920> three<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.700> four<00:02:03.759> and

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
four one and two and three and four and

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:46.580 
four one and two and three and four and
one<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.080> two<00:02:05.679> and<00:02:06.039> three<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.819> four<00:02:06.909> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.710 

okay<00:02:47.610> let's<00:02:48.610> take<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.819> look<00:02:48.910> at<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.239> close-up

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720
