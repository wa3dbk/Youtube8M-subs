into your settings and you have to go to
ROM<00:02:53.880> control<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.440> go<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> navigation

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
ROM control then you go to navigation

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.570 
ROM control then you go to navigation
bar<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.850> then<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.660> go<00:02:57.890> navigation<00:02:58.890> bar<00:02:59.130> I

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
bar and then you go navigation bar I

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.610 
bar and then you go navigation bar I
think<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.300> down<00:03:00.510> here<00:03:00.570> navigation<00:03:01.440> bar

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
think it's down here navigation bar

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.040 
think it's down here navigation bar
height<00:03:01.920> landscape<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.450> put<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.810> off

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
height landscape and you put it on off

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.320 
height landscape and you put it on off
so<00:03:04.710> every<00:03:04.980> time<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.250> turn<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.520> device<00:03:05.640> most

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
so every time you turn the device most

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.790 
so every time you turn the device most
of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.600> time<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.020> isn't<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.380> problem<00:03:07.530> because

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
of the time this isn't a problem because

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.009 
um that's one that's the way to enable
basically<00:04:06.690> your<00:04:07.940> software<00:04:08.940> keys<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.840> when

you have them hidden in landscape

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.070 
you have them hidden in landscape
because<00:04:11.850> if<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.120> say<00:04:12.269> for<00:04:12.300> example<00:04:12.480> going<00:04:12.930> to

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
because if you say for example going to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.990
