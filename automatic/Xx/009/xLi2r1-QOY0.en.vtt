hello<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.310> my<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:02.669> on<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:03.090> to

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hello and this is my video on how to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.349 
hello and this is my video on how to
program<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:04.049> Reds<00:00:04.410> game<00:00:04.620> computer<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.850> big

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
program the Reds game computer this big

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.770 
program the Reds game computer this big
thing<00:00:06.690> behind<00:00:07.109> me<00:00:07.670> so<00:00:08.670> well<00:00:09.030> first<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:09.540> in

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
thing behind me so well first of all in

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.120 
thing behind me so well first of all in
order<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.050> program<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.500> computer<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:10.950> need

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
order to program this computer you need

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.100 
order to program this computer you need
to<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:11.429> binary<00:00:11.849> works<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.690> here<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.990> this

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
to know how binary works so here is this

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.250 
to know how binary works so here is this
wall<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.710> how<00:00:14.160> we'll<00:00:15.030> find<00:00:15.299> basic<00:00:16.080> binary

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
wall with how we'll find basic binary

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.510 
wall with how we'll find basic binary
siphon<00:00:16.650> works<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.640> if<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> computer<00:00:18.150> needs<00:00:18.420> one

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
siphon works so if a computer needs one

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.050 
siphon works so if a computer needs one
simply<00:00:20.520> wants<00:00:20.820> active<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:22.109> answer<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:23.060> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
simply wants active to answer to the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.480 
simply wants active to answer to the
second<00:00:24.420> switch<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.720> pressed<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.340> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
second switch is pressed now this is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.160 
second switch is pressed now this is
where<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.699> gets<00:00:26.820> confusing<00:00:26.939> when<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.900> computer

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
where it gets confusing when a computer

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.070 
where it gets confusing when a computer
needs<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.650> number<00:00:28.890> 3<00:00:29.220> 2<00:00:30.179> &amp;<00:00:30.420> 1

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
needs the number 3 2 &amp; 1

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.299 
needs the number 3 2 &amp; 1
so<00:00:31.890> 1<00:00:32.130> plus<00:00:32.309> 2<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.730> 3<00:00:33.350> obviously<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:35.280> have

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
so 1 plus 2 is 3 obviously they have

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
so 1 plus 2 is 3 obviously they have
computer<00:00:35.640> needs<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:37.250> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:40.100> 5<00:00:41.840> 6<00:00:43.340> 7<00:00:44.340> 8<00:00:45.680> 9<00:00:48.289> 10

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
computer needs for this is 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.979 
computer needs for this is 5 6 7 8 9 10
and<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.649> forth<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.480> computer<00:00:51.840> can

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and so forth so this computer can

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.240 
and so forth so this computer can
calculate<00:00:52.020> thousand<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.800> twenty<00:00:52.920> eight<00:00:53.100> or

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
calculate thousand and twenty eight or

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.420 
calculate thousand and twenty eight or
something<00:00:54.020> because<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.320> ten<00:00:55.530> bits<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> 10<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
something because it's ten bits so 10 of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.270 
something because it's ten bits so 10 of
those<00:00:56.550> switch<00:00:56.910> things<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.920> protocol

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
those switch things now the protocol

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.219 
those switch things now the protocol
which<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.910> basically<00:01:03.390> how<00:01:03.840> Peter<00:01:04.650> works

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
which is basically how Peter works

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
which is basically how Peter works
players<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.500> follows<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.490> red<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.420> green

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
players as follows the red and the green

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.530 
players as follows the red and the green
lines<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> next<00:01:11.400> commands<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.360> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
lines or for the next commands this is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.530 
lines or for the next commands this is
for<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> command<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> program<00:01:14.220> manager<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
for the command the program manager this

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.789 
for the command the program manager this
is<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> command<00:01:16.409> manager<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> firstly

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
is for the command manager so firstly

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.359 
is for the command manager so firstly
this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.909> first<00:01:21.119> program<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.659> executed

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
this is the first program to be executed

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.730 
this is the first program to be executed
the<00:01:23.369> moms<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.759> executed

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.429 

basically<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.759> go<00:01:27.969> to<00:01:28.030> system<00:01:28.630> so

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
basically it's a go to system so

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.649 
basically it's a go to system so
depending<00:01:30.159> on<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.430> output<00:01:30.579> of<00:01:30.820> an<00:01:30.969> ALU<00:01:31.210> or<00:01:31.630> a

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
depending on the output of an ALU or a

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.840 
depending on the output of an ALU or a
switch<00:01:32.020> depending<00:01:32.619> on<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.490> function

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
switch depending on the function

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.940 
switch depending on the function
performed<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.990> tells<00:01:35.229> which<00:01:35.439> come<00:01:35.619> on<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.860> do

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
performed it tells which come on to do

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.080 
performed it tells which come on to do
next<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:38.020> if<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.560> don't<00:01:38.740> want<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.070> go<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.280> like

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
next so if you don't want to go to like

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.179 
next so if you don't want to go to like
conditional<00:01:40.840> branching<00:01:41.259> which<00:01:41.380> means<00:01:41.590> going

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
conditional branching which means going

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.440 
conditional branching which means going
to<00:01:42.280> different<00:01:42.610> programs<00:01:42.759> depending<00:01:43.240> on

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
to different programs depending on

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.899 
to different programs depending on
different<00:01:43.689> things<00:01:43.869> simply<00:01:44.740> enter<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.670> next

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
different things simply enter the next

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.999 
different things simply enter the next
program<00:01:48.000> from<00:01:49.000> both<00:01:49.210> lives<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.649> now<00:01:50.740> running

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
program from both lives it's now running

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.880 
program from both lives it's now running
this<00:01:51.100> program<00:01:51.360> well<00:01:52.360> after<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.079> clock<00:01:53.289> go<00:01:53.829> to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
this program well after the clock go to

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.069 
this program well after the clock go to
this<00:01:54.100> commands<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:55.329> doesn't<00:01:55.689> affect<00:01:55.929> the

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
this commands this doesn't affect the

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.380 
this commands this doesn't affect the
program<00:01:56.500> or<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.890> commands<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.579> any<00:01:57.789> way<00:01:58.030> these

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
program or the commands in any way these

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.190 
program or the commands in any way these
basically<00:01:58.810> separates<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:01.090> here's<00:02:01.569> the<00:02:01.750> actual

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
basically separates so here's the actual

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.830 
basically separates so here's the actual
command<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.860> computer<00:02:03.130> will<00:02:03.250> execute

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
command that the computer will execute

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.410 
command that the computer will execute
first<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:05.140> have<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.319> mode<00:02:05.530> select<00:02:05.979> this<00:02:06.789> both

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
first you have the mode select this both

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.669 
first you have the mode select this both
selects<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.140> mode<00:02:08.289> it's<00:02:08.500> quite

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
selects the mode it's quite

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.719 
selects the mode it's quite
self-explanatory

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
self-explanatory

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.190 
self-explanatory
it<00:02:10.630> decides<00:02:11.019> between<00:02:11.200> GP<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.930> put<00:02:14.110> an

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
it decides between GP you can put an

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.330 
it decides between GP you can put an
output<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.549> think<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:17.340> command

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
output and I think this was a command

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.280 
output and I think this was a command
and<00:02:23.579> well<00:02:24.579> it's<00:02:24.849> quite<00:02:25.420> important<00:02:26.049> I'm

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and well it's quite important I'm

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.140 
and well it's quite important I'm
remembering<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.519> something<00:02:27.940> very

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
remembering it's something very

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.110 
remembering it's something very
important<00:02:28.420> well<00:02:28.660> anyways<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
important well anyways so that is the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.800 
important well anyways so that is the
mode<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.530> actual<00:02:32.829> program<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
mode of the actual program this is the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.930 
mode of the actual program this is the
mote<00:02:34.959> argument<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.709> basically<00:02:36.069> if<00:02:36.519> you're

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
mote argument so basically if you're

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.759 
mote argument so basically if you're
going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.180> do<00:02:37.269> an<00:02:37.359> ALU<00:02:37.600> function<00:02:38.109> which<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.440> the

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
going to do an ALU function which is the

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.660 
going to do an ALU function which is the
math<00:02:39.130> machine<00:02:39.819> big<00:02:40.239> calculator<00:02:40.840> thing<00:02:41.079> there

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
math machine big calculator thing there

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.039 
math machine big calculator thing there
you<00:02:42.670> have<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.150> choose<00:02:43.389> what<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.750> want<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.959> do

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
you have to choose what you want to do

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.020 
you have to choose what you want to do
add<00:02:44.790> subtract<00:02:45.930> -<00:02:46.930> these<00:02:47.260> three<00:02:47.590> lines<00:02:47.799> for<00:02:48.670> Lu

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
add subtract - these three lines for Lu

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.240 
add subtract - these three lines for Lu
commands<00:02:49.500> choose<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.739> function<00:02:51.130> add

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
commands choose the function add

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.379 
commands choose the function add
subtract<00:02:51.700> shift<00:02:52.510> left<00:02:52.780> shift<00:02:52.900> right<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.730> XOR

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
subtract shift left shift right or XOR

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.750 
subtract shift left shift right or XOR
and<00:02:55.889> you<00:02:56.889> don't<00:02:57.069> need<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.220> worry<00:02:57.370> about<00:02:57.430> any<00:02:57.670> of

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
and you don't need to worry about any of

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.009 
and you don't need to worry about any of
those<00:02:57.880> but<00:02:58.060> adding<00:02:58.269> let's<00:02:58.389> subtract<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:58.930> you

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
those but adding let's subtract if you

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.990 
those but adding let's subtract if you
just<00:02:59.170> need<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> do<00:02:59.500> normal<00:02:59.799> Maxim's<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.489> this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
just need to do normal Maxim's and this

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.509 
just need to do normal Maxim's and this
one<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.239> invert<00:03:01.739> which<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.889> useful<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.370> other

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
one is invert which is useful in other

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.580 
one is invert which is useful in other
programs<00:03:04.109> you<00:03:05.109> don't<00:03:05.290> need<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.440> worry<00:03:05.560> about

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
programs you don't need to worry about

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.150 
programs you don't need to worry about
that<00:03:05.829> either

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that either

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.960 
that either
and<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.239> save<00:03:07.660> -<00:03:08.609> so<00:03:09.609> this<00:03:09.910> is

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
and this is the save - so this is

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.080 
and this is the save - so this is
basically<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.450> RAM<00:03:10.569> slot<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.989> save<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:12.090> save

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
basically the RAM slot to save to save

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.789 
basically the RAM slot to save to save
the<00:03:13.299> answer<00:03:13.600> oh<00:03:13.810> yeah<00:03:14.109> that<00:03:14.260> reminds<00:03:14.560> me<00:03:14.769> that

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
the answer oh yeah that reminds me that

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.470 
the answer oh yeah that reminds me that
was<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.069> what<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.700> other<00:03:15.819> command<00:03:16.150> 1<00:03:16.299> was

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
was the what the other command 1 was

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.990 
was the what the other command 1 was
ran'<00:03:16.870> movements<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:18.310> basically<00:03:18.609> then<00:03:18.819> these

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
ran' movements so basically then these

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.120 
ran' movements so basically then these
become<00:03:19.389> the<00:03:19.569> RAM<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.930> load<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:20.859> is<00:03:21.010> where

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
become the RAM to load and this is where

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.789 
become the RAM to load and this is where
you<00:03:21.250> want<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.579> save<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.500> that's

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
you want to save it to so that's

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.099 
you want to save it to so that's
basically<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.310> command<00:03:24.730> system<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:25.959> see

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
basically the command system you can see

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.140 
basically the command system you can see
in<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.230> manual<00:03:26.590> how<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.769> works<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:27.099> depth<00:03:27.340> now

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
in the manual how it works in depth now

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.610 
in the manual how it works in depth now
you<00:03:28.209> know<00:03:28.420> basically<00:03:28.810> how<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.109> work

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
you know basically how it work

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.559 
you know basically how it work
okay<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.680> imagine<00:03:31.609> how<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.120> computer<00:03:32.540> works

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
okay so imagine how the computer works

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.410 
okay so imagine how the computer works
so<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.290> understand<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.829> better<00:03:34.359> all<00:03:35.359> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
so you understand it better all the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.709 
so you understand it better all the
wires<00:03:35.870> from<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.469> actual<00:03:37.219> probe<00:03:37.480> program<00:03:38.480> a

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:38.719 
wires from the actual probe program a

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.319 
wires from the actual probe program a
command<00:03:39.469> go<00:03:40.040> into<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.280> command<00:03:40.609> manager<00:03:40.939> as

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
command go into the command manager as

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.629 
command go into the command manager as
said<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:42.049> by<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.319> science<00:03:42.849> come<00:03:43.849> on<00:03:43.999> manager

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
said to by the science come on manager

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.759 
said to by the science come on manager
Dyson<00:03:47.590> yeah

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
Dyson yeah

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.470 
Dyson yeah
so<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.310> basically<00:03:49.400> goes<00:03:49.760> into<00:03:49.819> this<00:03:50.180> thing

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
so it basically goes into this thing

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.910 
so it basically goes into this thing
over<00:03:51.469> here<00:03:51.680> at<00:03:51.920> muxes<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:53.680> separates<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.859> into

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
over here at muxes and separates it into

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.550 
over here at muxes and separates it into
the<00:03:55.129> different<00:03:55.400> form<00:03:55.549> arms<00:03:55.870> splits<00:03:56.870> all<00:03:57.109> over

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
the different form arms splits all over

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.890 
the different form arms splits all over
the<00:03:57.620> place<00:03:57.939> this<00:03:58.939> is<00:03:59.120> for<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.299> RAM<00:03:59.510> commands

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
the place this is for the RAM commands

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.839 
the place this is for the RAM commands
this<00:04:00.439> is<00:04:00.650> for<00:04:01.599> ALU<00:04:02.599> this<00:04:03.019> one<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:04.400> one's<00:04:04.669> for

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
this is for ALU this one this one's for

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.830 
this is for ALU this one this one's for
GPU<00:04:05.209> commands<00:04:05.659> and<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:07.760> know<00:04:07.819> input<00:04:08.689> and

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
GPU commands and you know input and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.500 
GPU commands and you know input and
output<00:04:09.109> is<00:04:09.199> managed<00:04:09.560> here<00:04:10.069> lots<00:04:10.730> of<00:04:10.819> flowers

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
output is managed here lots of flowers

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.949 
output is managed here lots of flowers
really<00:04:11.859> okay<00:04:12.859> so<00:04:13.699> the<00:04:13.819> RAM<00:04:14.000> Jana<00:04:14.569> looks<00:04:14.719> like

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
really okay so the RAM Jana looks like

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.430 
really okay so the RAM Jana looks like
this<00:04:16.359> now<00:04:17.359> an<00:04:17.570> important<00:04:17.989> rule<00:04:18.199> when

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
this now an important rule when

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.420 
this now an important rule when
switching<00:04:18.979> Ram<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.489> my<00:04:19.609> computer<00:04:20.090> is<00:04:20.989> that

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
switching Ram in my computer is that

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.610 
switching Ram in my computer is that
rambu<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:25.460> basically<00:04:26.289> if<00:04:27.289> you<00:04:27.410> want<00:04:27.530> to

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
rambu this so basically if you want to

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.670 
rambu this so basically if you want to
move<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:28.250> Ram<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:29.389> there<00:04:29.630> they<00:04:30.349> just<00:04:30.410> gonna

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
move this Ram to there they just gonna

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.600 
move this Ram to there they just gonna
move<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.160> way

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
move it that way

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.700 
move it that way
one<00:04:32.150> important<00:04:32.570> thing<00:04:32.599> to<00:04:32.720> remember<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:33.680> that

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
one important thing to remember is that

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.399 
one important thing to remember is that
say<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:34.070> cannot<00:04:34.310> move<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:34.909> slots<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:36.169> there

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
say you cannot move this slots to there

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.950 
say you cannot move this slots to there
that<00:04:37.009> does<00:04:37.159> not<00:04:37.280> work<00:04:37.520> ran<00:04:38.479> goes<00:04:38.690> like<00:04:38.930> that

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
that does not work ran goes like that

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.659 
that does not work ran goes like that
and<00:04:39.500> this<00:04:40.340> is<00:04:40.639> not<00:04:40.669> connected<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.650> so

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
and this is not connected to that so

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.980 
and this is not connected to that so
basically<00:04:43.669> if<00:04:43.909> you<00:04:43.970> want<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.210> go<00:04:44.330> one<00:04:44.509> back<00:04:44.690> or

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
basically if you want to go one back or

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.170 
basically if you want to go one back or
any<00:04:45.289> amounts<00:04:45.650> back<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.699> have<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.909> go<00:04:47.000> through

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
any amounts back you have to go through

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.080 
any amounts back you have to go through
the<00:04:47.630> calculator<00:04:48.409> thing<00:04:48.650> then<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.550> perform<00:04:49.880> a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
the calculator thing then you perform a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.070 
the calculator thing then you perform a
fat<00:04:50.300> sub<00:04:50.630> say<00:04:51.199> ads<00:04:51.470> by<00:04:51.680> zero<00:04:52.039> or<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:56.300> go<00:04:56.780> three

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
fat sub say ads by zero or you go three

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.170 
fat sub say ads by zero or you go three
here

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
here

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.560 
here
okay<00:04:59.570> these<00:04:59.750> things<00:05:00.250> also<00:05:03.580> registers<00:05:04.580> you

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
okay these things also registers you

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.510 
okay these things also registers you
register<00:05:06.259> so<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.560> two<00:05:06.710> numbers<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:07.190> you're

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
register so the two numbers that you're

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.230 
register so the two numbers that you're
going<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.759> add<00:05:07.909> subtract<00:05:08.539> divide<00:05:09.070> multiply

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
going to add subtract divide multiply

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.189 
going to add subtract divide multiply
whatever<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:11.389> want<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.630> do<00:05:11.750> with<00:05:11.900> it

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
whatever you want to do with it

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.939 
whatever you want to do with it
they're<00:05:12.889> basically<00:05:13.159> these<00:05:13.460> two<00:05:14.380> they<00:05:15.380> go<00:05:15.530> into

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
they're basically these two they go into

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.310 
they're basically these two they go into
the<00:05:16.039> yo-yo<00:05:16.159> so<00:05:16.639> if<00:05:16.759> you<00:05:16.880> want<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.090> sit<00:05:17.479> so<00:05:17.930> if<00:05:18.169> he

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
the yo-yo so if you want to sit so if he

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.010 
the yo-yo so if you want to sit so if he
wants<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.940> do<00:05:19.940> a<00:05:19.969> number<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.479> must<00:05:20.630> save<00:05:20.870> them

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
wants to do a number you must save them

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.200 
wants to do a number you must save them
to<00:05:21.169> ram<00:05:21.380> one<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.800> two<00:05:22.009> that's<00:05:22.669> three<00:05:22.849> four

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
to ram one and two that's three four

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.310

this<00:05:33.940> one<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.300> wired<00:05:34.479> to<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.690> user<00:05:34.870> inputs<00:05:35.879> so

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
this one is wired to the user inputs so

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.029 
this one is wired to the user inputs so
loading<00:05:37.599> from<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.930> Ram<00:05:38.139> will<00:05:38.560> load<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.860> user

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
loading from this Ram will load the user

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.360 
loading from this Ram will load the user
inputs<00:05:39.750> but<00:05:40.750> saving<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.259> the<00:05:41.349> RAM<00:05:41.530> will

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.210 
inputs but saving to the RAM will
actually<00:05:42.669> change<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:43.090> screen<00:05:43.889> that<00:05:44.889> big

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
actually change the screen that big

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.480 
actually change the screen that big
screen<00:05:45.520> you<00:05:45.849> have<00:05:46.000> right<00:05:46.360> there<00:05:47.340> then<00:05:48.340> the

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
screen you have right there then the

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.450 
screen you have right there then the
other<00:05:48.610> four<00:05:48.970> on<00:05:49.569> this<00:05:49.810> side<00:05:50.050> these<00:05:50.889> four<00:05:51.250> or

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
other four on this side these four or

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.450 
other four on this side these four or
GPU<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:53.229> if<00:05:53.289> you're<00:05:53.379> gonna<00:05:53.470> do<00:05:53.650> a<00:05:53.680> GPU<00:05:54.069> command

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
GPU so if you're gonna do a GPU command

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.670 
GPU so if you're gonna do a GPU command
it<00:05:54.669> reads<00:05:54.909> from<00:05:55.060> these<00:05:55.270> lines<00:05:55.569> the<00:05:56.110> x<00:05:56.319> and<00:05:56.560> y

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
it reads from these lines the x and y

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.129 
it reads from these lines the x and y
values<00:05:57.159> if<00:05:58.090> you<00:05:58.330> read<00:05:58.509> them<00:05:58.720> you<00:05:58.750> read<00:05:58.990> these

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
values if you read them you read these

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.620 
values if you read them you read these
ROM<00:05:59.470> statements<00:06:00.190> which<00:06:00.940> for<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.180> example

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
ROM statements which for the example

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.850 
ROM statements which for the example
program<00:06:01.990> is<00:06:02.199> y<00:06:02.500> offsets<00:06:03.069> and<00:06:04.560> what<00:06:05.560> is<00:06:05.650> this

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
program is y offsets and what is this

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.379 
program is y offsets and what is this
one<00:06:05.919> again<00:06:06.840> add<00:06:07.840> by<00:06:08.259> value<00:06:08.710> distance<00:06:09.389> see

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
one again add by value distance see

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.379 
one again add by value distance see
that's<00:06:10.659> why<00:06:10.780> sons<00:06:11.020> are<00:06:11.169> very<00:06:11.199> Hank<00:06:11.590> Oh<00:06:12.360> such<00:06:13.360> a

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
that's why sons are very Hank Oh such a

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.770 
that's why sons are very Hank Oh such a
good<00:06:13.539> friend<00:06:13.780> and<00:06:15.389> basically<00:06:16.389> this<00:06:16.539> is<00:06:16.720> the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
good friend and basically this is the

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.350 
good friend and basically this is the
massive<00:06:17.050> graphics<00:06:17.500> card<00:06:17.770> this<00:06:18.520> is<00:06:18.729> actually

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
massive graphics card this is actually

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.409 
massive graphics card this is actually
so<00:06:19.630> epic<00:06:19.930> it's<00:06:20.080> got<00:06:20.199> its<00:06:20.319> own<00:06:20.380> topic<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:22.150> really

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
so epic it's got its own topic it really

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.869 
so epic it's got its own topic it really
is<00:06:22.539> quite<00:06:22.990> a<00:06:23.110> device<00:06:23.469> it's<00:06:24.460> actually<00:06:24.789> an

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
is quite a device it's actually an

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.640 
is quite a device it's actually an
exclusive<00:06:25.360> version<00:06:25.509> the<00:06:25.780> and<00:06:25.900> X<00:06:26.110> two<00:06:26.349> deluxe

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
exclusive version the and X two deluxe

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.300 
exclusive version the and X two deluxe
using<00:06:27.340> this<00:06:27.460> thing<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:29.440> anyways<00:06:29.949> that's<00:06:30.159> the

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
using this thing so anyways that's the

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.080 
using this thing so anyways that's the
program<00:06:30.819> protocol<00:06:32.639> now<00:06:33.639> based<00:06:33.849> on<00:06:33.940> how<00:06:34.030> the

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
program protocol now based on how the

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.649 
program protocol now based on how the
ALU<00:06:34.569> works<00:06:35.580> basically<00:06:36.580> it's<00:06:37.000> a<00:06:37.060> stack<00:06:37.419> tell

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
ALU works basically it's a stack tell

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.709 
ALU works basically it's a stack tell
you<00:06:37.840> so<00:06:38.020> commands<00:06:38.770> are<00:06:38.949> above<00:06:39.250> each<00:06:39.430> other<00:06:39.719> so

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:40.719 
you so commands are above each other so

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.659 
you so commands are above each other so
this<00:06:40.870> is<00:06:40.990> what<00:06:41.139> does<00:06:41.319> adding<00:06:41.740> is<00:06:42.310> what<00:06:42.520> they're

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
this is what does adding is what they're

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:43.320 
this is what does adding is what they're
subtracting

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
subtracting

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.390 
subtracting
this<00:06:43.930> is<00:06:44.080> what<00:06:44.229> does<00:06:44.409> carrying<00:06:44.860> left<00:06:45.190> and

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
this is what does carrying left and

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.680 
this is what does carrying left and
right<00:06:45.840> care<00:06:46.840> this<00:06:47.229> is<00:06:47.289> extra<00:06:48.029> and<00:06:49.029> an<00:06:49.360> order

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
right care this is extra and an order

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.839 
right care this is extra and an order
both<00:06:49.900> managed<00:06:50.289> in<00:06:50.380> this<00:06:50.500> floor<00:06:50.740> those<00:06:51.580> are<00:06:51.729> all

many more things the invert is managed
here<00:06:58.599> basically<00:06:59.500> XOR<00:07:00.159> gates

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.790 

basically<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.690> date<00:07:04.870> owed<00:07:05.080> from<00:07:05.380> the<00:07:05.590> arrays

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
basically the date owed from the arrays

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.830 
basically the date owed from the arrays
go<00:07:06.130> into<00:07:06.490> here<00:07:06.759> these<00:07:07.000> two<00:07:07.180> massive<00:07:07.539> towers

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
go into here these two massive towers

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.339 
go into here these two massive towers
does<00:07:08.770> the<00:07:08.919> sum<00:07:09.779> then<00:07:10.779> they<00:07:10.990> come<00:07:11.169> back<00:07:11.199> down

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
does the sum then they come back down

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:15.059 
does the sum then they come back down
here<00:07:11.590> and<00:07:12.090> go<00:07:13.090> into<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:13.360> RAM<00:07:13.680> like<00:07:14.680> everything

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:15.069 
here and go into the RAM like everything

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:17.879 
here and go into the RAM like everything
else<00:07:15.219> does<00:07:15.430> then<00:07:16.180> comes<00:07:16.449> up<00:07:16.599> all<00:07:17.199> the<00:07:17.800> way

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889 
else does then comes up all the way

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.369 
else does then comes up all the way
around<00:07:18.130> and<00:07:18.340> says

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:22.379 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:25.050 

okay<00:07:23.379> so<00:07:23.439> that's<00:07:23.919> basically<00:07:24.310> the<00:07:24.430> explanation

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
okay so that's basically the explanation

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.360 
okay so that's basically the explanation
I<00:07:25.300> should<00:07:26.259> be<00:07:26.439> doing<00:07:26.560> apart<00:07:26.979> on<00:07:27.129> how<00:07:27.310> to

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370 
I should be doing apart on how to

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.779 
I should be doing apart on how to
program<00:07:27.879> its<00:07:28.330> -<00:07:28.949> from<00:07:29.949> the<00:07:30.099> default<00:07:30.460> program

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
program its - from the default program

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:33.179 
program its - from the default program
to<00:07:31.180> run<00:07:31.300> a<00:07:31.360> graphing<00:07:31.840> program<00:07:32.050> so<00:07:32.590> thanks<00:07:33.099> for

00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:33.189 
to run a graphing program so thanks for

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:35.520 
to run a graphing program so thanks for
watching
