other<00:01:47.820> board<00:01:48.090> connectors<00:01:48.600> which<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.140> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
other board connectors which is going to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.840 
other board connectors which is going to
be<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.649> clean<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.280> side<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> are

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
be to clean the right side if you are

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.899 
be to clean the right side if you are
looking<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> back<00:01:51.540> side<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.990> computer

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:05.200 

and<00:01:57.710> make<00:01:58.710> sure<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.100> lose<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.520> screws

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.809 

all<00:02:06.210> cases<00:02:06.810> open<00:02:07.079> differently<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.069> typically

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
all cases open differently but typically

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.550 
all cases open differently but typically
it<00:02:08.910> will<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.660> slide<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.140> back<00:02:10.289> side

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it will be you will slide the back side

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.580 
it will be you will slide the back side
first<00:02:11.090> don't<00:02:12.090> apply<00:02:12.420> too<00:02:12.480> much<00:02:12.630> pressure<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
first don't apply too much pressure you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.720 
first don't apply too much pressure you
don't<00:02:13.830> want<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.099> break<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.459> case

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.130 

and<00:02:19.920> we<00:02:20.920> get<00:02:21.129> our<00:02:21.280> compressed<00:02:21.790> air<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.870> short

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and we get our compressed air in short

00:02:23.140 --> 00:03:24.399 
and we get our compressed air in short
bursts<00:02:23.500> just<00:02:23.739> get<00:02:23.890> some<00:02:24.129> air

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:31.250 

don't<00:03:25.409> forget<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.830> put<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.069> screws<00:03:26.310> back<00:03:26.519> on

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.229 

now<00:03:32.129> it's<00:03:32.340> time<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.580> put<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> all<00:03:33.060> back

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
now it's time to put it all back

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.800 
now it's time to put it all back
together<00:03:34.459> first<00:03:35.459> I'll<00:03:35.610> start<00:03:35.819> by<00:03:36.450> connecting

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
together first I'll start by connecting

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.020 
together first I'll start by connecting
the<00:03:37.110> sound<00:03:37.560> card<00:03:37.830> connectors<00:03:38.370> these<00:03:38.819> are

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the sound card connectors these are

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.720 
the sound card connectors these are
usually<00:03:39.180> color-coded<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:41.190> follow<00:03:41.549> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
usually color-coded just follow the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.119 
usually color-coded just follow the
color<00:03:41.970> code<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.920> like<00:03:43.920> goes<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.519> black

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
color code on it like goes to black

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.380 
color code on it like goes to black
green<00:03:47.129> goes<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.549> green<00:03:48.080> orange<00:03:49.080> ghost<00:03:49.379> orange

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
green goes to green orange ghost orange

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.559 
green goes to green orange ghost orange
next<00:03:51.390> I'll<00:03:51.569> connect<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.989> monitor<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:53.569> just

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
next I'll connect the monitor and just

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.920 
next I'll connect the monitor and just
tighten<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.049> connector<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.540> next<00:03:57.540> I'll<00:03:57.660> plug

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
tighten the connector and next I'll plug

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.819 
tighten the connector and next I'll plug
in<00:03:58.049> my<00:03:58.200> network<00:03:58.650> connection<00:04:02.810> or<00:04:03.810> USB<00:04:04.290> cables

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
in my network connection or USB cables

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.869 
in my network connection or USB cables
it<00:04:04.980> really<00:04:05.579> doesn't<00:04:05.910> matter<00:04:06.000> where<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.360> goes

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.259 

and<00:04:12.799> last<00:04:13.799> we<00:04:14.010> can<00:04:14.190> connect<00:04:15.060> our<00:04:15.239> power

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
and last we can connect our power

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:27.260 
and last we can connect our power
connector<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:24.680> now<00:04:25.680> our<00:04:25.919> computer<00:04:26.460> is<00:04:26.789> ready

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
connector and now our computer is ready

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.800 
connector and now our computer is ready
