00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:05.560
 ah 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.560
 i 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.900
 very good to all that I am so tactic 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.699
 vÃ­ctor and if I already come with pvp pvp that 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.080
 as you have seen the previous video 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.810
 it has happened at will and well we started 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.310
 we are here against who but what is a 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.380
 scammer with 50% kings grade 67 I do not know 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.940
 very good and good let's start very 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.640
 strong I have two fights that have 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.169
 liked a lot in this video 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.140
 and well, it's costing me a lot 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.320
 start because everyone goes with 50% 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.760
 resistance I do not have 6pm but but 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.680
 good you do what you can I'll go 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 improving the set I do not have it yet 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.610
 improved I have it of pvm but but good 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.589
 I'm doing here we see that it puts the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.930
 pump and it does magnetization and so 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.150
 quickly knows what I am but when doing 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.370
 that does not fit you to try 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.500
 get into glyph whatever it is then 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.180
 well let's see what I do around here that 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.710
 I think about it a lot I think about it a lot and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.989
 Of course I did not want to go near the bombs 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.759
 because if they did not put me glyph and I say 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.300
 well at least he does not put me in the 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.020
 yours 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.740
 and bojan dollar channels masses channels remove 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.200
 150 do not rise to 170 and rivers do not go down 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.050
 of 300 and the truth that was quite 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.910
 scared here we see that with thymus bot the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.810
 It makes me very good get me and the bomb 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.760
 both 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.560
 then I was a little crazy 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.190
 and nothing like I had as a pet or a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.530
 pump all yours too and nothing 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.830
 I still do not put him just waiting 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.480
 the occasion on the ideal occasion its 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.400
 pumps are not so loaded now 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.740
 I have two two fat pumps you're there 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.750
 waiting 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.360
 and nothing here we see that he tries to kill 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.060
 but it leaves you with very little life the bomb 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 and that is going to be what I do 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 win more or less the fight here by 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.759
 deduction more or less I knew that I do not know 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.829
 was going to approach the bombs because if not 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.439
 again I say good because it was that 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.840
 it's far here I was counting the pm 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.070
 to be the seventh comes to us and I put 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.380
 that bomb more than anything for 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.330
 will try to cover me for what I 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.940
 can do and we see what element 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.910
 I remove more life and we are going strong 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.580
 and well here we see that they try not to know 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.520
 what you try now we will see it is that 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.010
 I do not remember either 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.660
 but I do not know do not know what trying and seeing 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.330
 nothing comes out he starts attacking me and he 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.760
 would be close to the pumps then 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.459
 here 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.019
 with last breath I do everything and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.120
 little to out good me in truth the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.879
 scammer is very pro and then there are times that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.420
 It's won pretty good but I'll go 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.390
 getting better 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.519
 here we are against a sacred eight degree 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.310
 of these typical I do marathon 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.170
 in bonn is this one was 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.659
 walking bourbon is and I for the bank and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 says let's attack them grade 1 do not 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.260
 can do anything and of course I wanted 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.090
 put away because this is a field 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.459
 open but I have not had time had 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.049
 here and I have stayed next to you but 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.750
 that makes it more interesting then 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.930
 here with trick he tried to run away now 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.760
 I try to leave this loop of this 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.159
 little corner where you can fuck me 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 easily but in the cooperation 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.569
 there we see that it has the wings degrees 8 is 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.420
 a quite last theme a sacrum 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.310
 quite pro but had no resistances 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.519
 because he's wearing a queen hammer but 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.560
 just like that is super coarse here with 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.110
 remission and gunpowder something that neither can 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.090
 bring him to kill her 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.370
 and well I can not kill anymore and follow 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.500
 live but it will also cost me more 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.080
 place him by luck is about sack 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.150
 then it is easier for me to put him instead 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.780
 to do the magnetization I prefer to go more 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.569
 away and kicking and I think here at 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.549
 a key move yes I think so 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.950
 that one still finished to take away a bit of 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.349
 life and here I make a key move estimated 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.450
 hard and mature clear the thing is that 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.670
 would try the logical thing is that he will try 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.950
 get out of here get out of this loop of 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.109
 this corner that can violate me but 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.670
 as I think he thinks I'm going to 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.709
 do that I say so I get 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.260
 inside and so sure you will not see for me 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.420
 and there we see that clearly says good is 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.329
 obviously he has to be back there 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.940
 to leave here and I say no 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.979
 take I'm going forward here good 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.250
 concave more and step because I can get him 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:27.610
 I did not have anything left to run away 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.410
 but I have a trick and all that I say 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.259
 well at least I'm going to hit him a little hey 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.620
 that I punish myself and such a prayer so that I do not 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.600
 mate 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.660
 and then I already put him in my super 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.790
 how will I ride them and well here we see 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.350
 I left with very little life I already 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.780
 I was calculating more or less 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.270
 well I do not think he kills me then here 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.850
 to see how I managed or magnetize and 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.100
 so he took it off me at last slow 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.610
 trick to take more life with him 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.639
 tap and detonate 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.080
 and well this has been all at the moment 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.099
 I hope you liked life
