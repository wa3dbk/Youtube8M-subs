 hi hello guys and girls in this 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:08.490
 I bring three issues of those that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.740
 it was a flower order that told me that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.740
 he had liked the naruto theme 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.780
 He said I told him that if he wanted someone else 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 topic that I did not hesitate to ask, he told me 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.640
 I wanted one of those that and that's why I 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.619
 I took the liberty of creating three already maybe 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 which is one of the most requested characters 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.380

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.730

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.440
