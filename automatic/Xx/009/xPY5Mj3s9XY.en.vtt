00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
success because you know last year you

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.849 
success because you know last year you
reach<00:02:47.959> also<00:02:48.379> and<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.299> finer<00:02:50.569> I<00:02:50.930> guess<00:02:51.590> II

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
reach also and this and finer I guess II

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.430
