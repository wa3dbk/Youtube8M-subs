00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this is pretty much what you use the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429 
this is pretty much what you use the
entire<00:01:41.340> game<00:01:41.490> yeah<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.509> didn't<00:01:43.320> bother

grenades<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.079> entire<00:01:49.350> tech<00:01:49.530> game<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.100> only

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
grenades that entire tech game the only

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.740 
grenades that entire tech game the only
thing<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:51.000> make<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> easy<00:01:51.540> mark

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
but I only ask her and I've been using

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.139 
but I only ask her and I've been using
it<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.009> entire<00:01:59.189> game<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.060> some

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it for this entire game but for some

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.569 
it for this entire game but for some
reason<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.450> still<00:02:00.479> don't<00:02:00.780> own<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.579> it's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
reason I still don't own it it's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.399 
equipped right now you can see it's
equipped<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:05.840> instead<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> sniper<00:02:07.290> rifle

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
equipped and instead of a sniper rifle

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.979 
equipped and instead of a sniper rifle
i've<00:02:07.770> been<00:02:07.920> using<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.250> m416<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.899> see

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
i've been using the m416 you can see

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.999 
i've been using the m416 you can see
it's<00:02:10.110> got<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> hell<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.619> lot<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.830> damage

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it's got a hell of a lot of damage

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.949 
it's got a hell of a lot of damage
precision<00:02:11.730> no<00:02:12.090> handling<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:12.810> got<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
precision no handling but it's got a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.500 
precision no handling but it's got a
hell<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.260> lot<00:02:13.349> of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
hell of a lot of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.179 
hell of a lot of
decision<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.409> I've<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.530> been<00:02:14.799> using<00:02:14.980> this

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
decision and I've just been using this

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.110 
decision and I've just been using this
thing<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.180> souped-up<00:02:17.049> scope

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
thing with the really souped-up scope

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.410 
thing with the really souped-up scope
the<00:02:19.120> Mexico<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:19.689> gets<00:02:20.019> three<00:02:20.319> times<00:02:21.420> yeah

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
the Mexico but gets three times yeah

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.170 
the Mexico but gets three times yeah
yeah<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:24.549> served<00:02:24.790> him<00:02:24.879> quite<00:02:25.150> well

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
yeah and it served him quite well

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.699 
yeah and it served him quite well
because<00:02:25.450> he<00:02:25.629> has<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> semi-automatic<00:02:26.439> sniper

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
because he has a semi-automatic sniper

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.500 
because he has a semi-automatic sniper
rifle<00:02:27.250> actually<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:27.819> fully<00:02:27.939> automatic<00:02:28.360> oh

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
rifle actually it's fully automatic oh

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.809 
rifle actually it's fully automatic oh
you<00:02:28.689> know<00:02:28.780> what<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.930> mean<00:02:29.340> yeah<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:30.670> went

you know what I mean yeah I just went
for<00:02:30.879> as<00:02:31.030> much<00:02:31.209> precision<00:02:31.690> accuracy<00:02:32.110> as<00:02:32.440> i

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
for as much precision accuracy as i

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.680 
for as much precision accuracy as i
could<00:02:32.620> with<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.069> thing<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.599> painted<00:02:34.599> it
