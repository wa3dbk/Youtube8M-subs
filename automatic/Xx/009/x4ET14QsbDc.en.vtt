firing<00:00:49.500> upwards<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.670> gives<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> much

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
firing upwards this gives you a much

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.979 
firing upwards this gives you a much
higher<00:00:51.960> sound<00:00:52.879> dispersion<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.149> gives<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
see from the drive units that are used

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.039 
see from the drive units that are used
they're<00:01:13.140> actually<00:01:13.560> called<00:01:14.030> aramid<00:01:15.030> fiber<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
they're actually called aramid fiber and

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.219 
they're actually called aramid fiber and
it's<00:01:16.920> manufactured<00:01:17.850> very<00:01:18.659> similar<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it's manufactured very similar to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.310 
it's manufactured very similar to
another<00:01:19.520> type<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.549> system<00:01:21.060> called<00:01:21.509> Kevlar<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
with this type of drive unit which is a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.850 
with this type of drive unit which is a
Roven<00:01:26.369> material<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.720> minimizes<00:01:28.619> distortion

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
Roven material it minimizes distortion

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.490 
Roven material it minimizes distortion
and<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.090> helps<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> give<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.960> clearer

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and it helps to give you much clearer

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.359 
and it helps to give you much clearer
and<00:01:31.650> more<00:01:31.920> precise<00:01:32.369> sound<00:01:33.590> audio<00:01:34.590> wise<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and more precise sound audio wise it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.780 
and more precise sound audio wise it
will<00:01:35.610> play<00:01:35.909> DVD<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.500> play<00:01:37.710> blu-ray<00:01:38.400> 3d

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
will play DVD it will play blu-ray 3d

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.660 
will play DVD it will play blu-ray 3d
blu-ray<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.320> does<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:40.710> 4k<00:01:41.009> upscaling

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
audio formats that you would expect the

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
audio formats that you would expect the
rear<00:02:01.079> speakers<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.640> wear<00:02:02.850> are

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
rear speakers just to make you wear are

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810 
rear speakers just to make you wear are
wireless<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.950> comes<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> separate

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
wireless so it comes with a separate

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340 
wireless so it comes with a separate
amplifier<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.570> connects<00:02:06.869> at<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> back<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
amplifier that connects at the back of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.949 
amplifier that connects at the back of
the<00:02:07.680> room<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.819> rear<00:02:09.000> speakers<00:02:09.509> plug<00:02:09.750> into

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the room and the rear speakers plug into

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
the room and the rear speakers plug into
that<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> run<00:02:11.220> cables

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that so you don't have to run cables

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.500 
that so you don't have to run cables
from<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> front<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:12.989> rear<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
from the front to the rear of the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.290 
from the front to the rear of the
connectivity<00:02:15.510> wise<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.860> supports<00:02:17.430> digital

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
connectivity wise it supports digital

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.470 
connectivity wise it supports digital
input<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.170> optical<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.890> example<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:21.060> also<00:02:21.090> has

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
input so optical for example it also has

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.560 
input so optical for example it also has
HDMI<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.710> does<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.250> RC<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.360> if<00:02:24.480> you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
HDMI and it does have a RC so if you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.450
