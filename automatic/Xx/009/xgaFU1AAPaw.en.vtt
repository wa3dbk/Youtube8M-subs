00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
for my liquid foundation since it makes

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.630 
for my liquid foundation since it makes
the<00:00:58.449> blending<00:00:58.870> easier<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.680> doesn't<00:01:00.280> give<00:01:00.460> me

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
the blending easier and doesn't give me

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.880 
the blending easier and doesn't give me
any<00:01:00.879> streaking<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.930> bristles<00:01:02.410> are<00:01:02.590> so

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
any streaking and the bristles are so

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.170 
any streaking and the bristles are so
soft<00:01:03.250> which<00:01:03.820> is<00:01:03.850> great

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.570

I'm also bringing the BB cream down

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.790 
I'm also bringing the BB cream down

because I wouldn't want my face to have

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.970 
because I wouldn't want my face to have
a<00:01:13.860> different<00:01:14.400> color<00:01:14.640> than<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.150> neck<00:01:15.950> with<00:01:16.950> my

ring<00:01:19.440> finger<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> apply<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.550> on<00:01:20.940> any

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
