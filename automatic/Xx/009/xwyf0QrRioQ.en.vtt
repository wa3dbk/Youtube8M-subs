00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
right hand the same CFA so now F over

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.449 
right hand the same CFA so now F over
b-flat<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:13.010> call<00:02:13.190> an<00:02:13.280> F<00:02:13.430> over<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:15.459> then

b-flat this we call an F over a and then

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.240 
b-flat this we call an F over a and then
for<00:02:16.640> our<00:02:16.850> final<00:02:17.390> chord<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:18.200> go<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.590> same<00:02:18.890> C

for our final chord we go to that same C

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.720 
for our final chord we go to that same C
chord<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.140> first<00:02:21.380> time<00:02:21.620> around<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.489> bass

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
chord so the first time around the bass

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.920 
chord so the first time around the bass
moves<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.660> D

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930

moves<00:02:28.590> down<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:34.569> rhythm<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
moves down to a and the rhythm on the

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.339 
moves down to a and the rhythm on the
second<00:02:35.409> time<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.829> same<00:02:36.040> one<00:02:36.640> two<00:02:37.420> three

try<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.640> little<00:02:54.670> faster<00:02:54.879> one<00:02:55.720> two<00:02:56.379> three

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
try it a little faster one two three

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.230 
try it a little faster one two three
four

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.380 

two<00:03:00.900> three<00:03:01.530> four

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.150 

okay<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.810> our<00:03:06.960> verse<00:03:07.410> we're<00:03:07.950> going<00:03:08.070> to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
okay so for our verse we're going to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.820 
okay so for our verse we're going to
repeat<00:03:08.460> that<00:03:08.640> four<00:03:09.030> times<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.620> then<00:03:10.740> we're

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
repeat that four times and then we're

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.170 
repeat that four times and then we're
going<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:10.980> get<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.370> what<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.550> call<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
going to get to what I call the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.150 
going to get to what I call the
pre-chorus<00:03:13.020> now<00:03:13.320> this<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.710> part<00:03:13.950> where<00:03:14.130> he

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
pre-chorus now this is the part where he

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.640 
pre-chorus now this is the part where he
first<00:03:14.520> says<00:03:14.760> let<00:03:15.030> me<00:03:15.150> love<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.600> before<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
first says let me love you before the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.100 
first says let me love you before the
synth<00:03:16.890> line<00:03:17.130> comes<00:03:17.460> in<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.660> imitate

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
synth line comes in and so to imitate

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.110 
synth line comes in and so to imitate
that<00:03:19.140> part<00:03:19.620> we're<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.400> keep<00:03:20.640> our<00:03:20.820> piano

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
that part we're going to keep our piano

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.750 
that part we're going to keep our piano
part<00:03:21.390> pretty<00:03:21.600> much<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.020> same<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:23.520> we're<00:03:23.670> going

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
part pretty much the same so we're going

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.910 
part pretty much the same so we're going
to<00:03:23.850> add<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> little<00:03:24.330> bit<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.600> pulsing<00:03:25.170> left

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
to add a little bit of a pulsing left

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.550 
to add a little bit of a pulsing left
hand<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.450> our<00:03:27.570> left<00:03:27.750> hand<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.170> going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.320> sound

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
hand so our left hand is going to sound

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:43.430 
hand so our left hand is going to sound
like<00:03:28.650> this

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.510 

so<00:03:44.220> we're<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.490> start<00:03:44.790> with<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> octaves

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
so we're going to start with the octaves

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.400 
so we're going to start with the octaves
but<00:03:47.520> then<00:03:47.700> after<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.210> as<00:03:48.510> I'm<00:03:48.930> holding<00:03:49.140> down

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
but then after that as I'm holding down

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.810 
but then after that as I'm holding down
the<00:03:49.590> low<00:03:49.770> note<00:03:50.040> I'm<00:03:50.190> going<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.370> play<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.640> high

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
the low note I'm going to play the high

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.000 
the low note I'm going to play the high
note<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.330> octave<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.380> for<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> b-flat

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
note of the octave so for the b-flat

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.050 
note of the octave so for the b-flat
it'll<00:03:53.430> be<00:03:53.550> 1<00:03:53.940> &amp;<00:03:54.330> 2<00:03:55.200> &amp;<00:03:56.750> try<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.960> with<00:03:58.110> me<00:03:58.320> 1<00:03:58.680> &amp;<00:03:59.100> 2

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
it'll be 1 &amp; 2 &amp; try that with me 1 &amp; 2

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.610 
it'll be 1 &amp; 2 &amp; try that with me 1 &amp; 2
&amp;<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:01.200> for<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.190> D<00:04:02.810> it's<00:04:03.810> only<00:04:04.050> going<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.440> have

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
&amp; and for the D it's only going to have

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.560 
&amp; and for the D it's only going to have
three<00:04:04.950> eighth<00:04:05.160> notes<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.700> it'll<00:04:05.880> be<00:04:06.000> 1<00:04:06.390> &amp;<00:04:06.950> 2

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
three eighth notes so it'll be 1 &amp; 2

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.260 
three eighth notes so it'll be 1 &amp; 2
so<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:10.690> three<00:04:11.050> eighth<00:04:11.230> notes<00:04:11.260> one<00:04:11.890> two<00:04:12.520> three

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
so it's three eighth notes one two three

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.790 
so it's three eighth notes one two three
then<00:04:13.570> down<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.230> see

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800
