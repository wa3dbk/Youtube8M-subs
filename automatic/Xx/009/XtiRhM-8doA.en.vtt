on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> stone<00:01:52.619> age<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:53.280> i'm<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.579> too

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
on the stone age but then i'm not too

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300 
on the stone age but then i'm not too
sure<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> mattered<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.229> stabbed<00:01:55.590> but

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
sure if it mattered it's not stabbed but

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
sure if it mattered it's not stabbed but
then<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> high<00:01:57.420> critical<00:01:57.869> hit<00:01:58.079> ratio

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
then there is a high critical hit ratio

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.370 
then there is a high critical hit ratio
and<00:01:58.860> he<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.310> banded<00:01:59.880> so

yeah I get buffeted by the sandstorm and

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.690 
yeah I get buffeted by the sandstorm and
now<00:02:46.940> he<00:02:47.000> tries<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.810> bring<00:02:47.959> out<00:02:48.140> his<00:02:48.700> horny

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.089 
now he tries to bring out his horny
which<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.150> his<00:02:50.390> Mamoswine<00:02:51.080> now<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.650> know<00:02:51.950> that

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
which is his Mamoswine now I know that

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.130 
which is his Mamoswine now I know that
most<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.790> them<00:02:52.970> carried<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.360> ice<00:02:53.510> shards<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.019> I

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
most of them carried the ice shards so I

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.960 
most of them carried the ice shards so I
decide<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.530> switch<00:02:54.709> out<00:02:54.950> into<00:02:55.610> my<00:02:55.730> scissor

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
decide to switch out into my scissor

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.240 
decide to switch out into my scissor
because<00:02:56.390> he<00:02:56.540> can<00:02:56.720> take<00:02:56.900> any<00:02:57.079> ice<00:02:57.290> hit<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.829> I'm

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
because he can take any ice hit and I'm

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.670 
because he can take any ice hit and I'm
able<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.790> probably<00:02:59.120> revenge<00:02:59.569> kill<00:02:59.870> him<00:03:00.110> with<00:03:00.410> a

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
able to probably revenge kill him with a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.630 
able to probably revenge kill him with a
bullet<00:03:01.099> punch<00:03:01.370> if<00:03:01.670> he<00:03:02.200> yeah<00:03:03.200> well<00:03:03.650> yeah<00:03:04.190> just

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
kill him off with a bullet punch I guess

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.770 
kill him off with a bullet punch I guess
and<00:03:06.859> he<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.280> life<00:03:07.549> for<00:03:07.730> him<00:03:07.850> actually<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:08.750> I

hit him with a boulder punch and that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.110 
hit him with a boulder punch and that
will<00:03:11.120> be<00:03:11.329> an<00:03:11.450> easy<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:12.019> hit<00:03:12.200> KO<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.850> is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
will be an easy one hit KO so that is

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
wake up or so so I said to switch out

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.319 
wake up or so so I said to switch out

now bring out hip out on I'm not too
sure<00:03:44.750> why<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.590> did<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.609> but<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.150> knew<00:03:47.389> he<00:03:47.720> goes

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
sure why I did that but I knew he goes

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.949 
sure why I did that but I knew he goes
with<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.260> quiver<00:03:48.500> dance<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.130> yup<00:03:50.030> gets<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.660> +1

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
with the quiver dance and yup gets a +1

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
speed and is probably going to lock

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.850 
speed and is probably going to lock
himself<00:03:56.150> into<00:03:56.660> petal<00:03:56.989> dance<00:03:57.200> because

sure I can

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.180 
sure I can
take<00:05:50.430> at<00:05:50.639> least<00:05:51.120> two<00:05:51.449> or<00:05:51.599> three<00:05:51.710> so<00:05:52.710> now<00:05:52.919> goes

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
take at least two or three so now goes

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.460 
take at least two or three so now goes
for<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.460> mock<00:05:53.699> punch<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.449> yeah<00:05:54.900> that<00:05:55.229> seems

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
for the mock punch and yeah that seems

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.339 
for the mock punch and yeah that seems
like<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.830> two<00:05:56.310> or<00:05:56.340> three<00:05:56.729> hit<00:05:56.970> KO<00:05:57.210> but<00:05:58.020> then<00:05:58.199> now

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
like a two or three hit KO but then now

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.140 
like a two or three hit KO but then now
he<00:05:58.409> goes<00:05:58.740> for<00:05:58.949> the<00:05:59.039> mock<00:05:59.220> hunt<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.759> this<00:05:59.909> just

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
he goes for the mock hunt and this just

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.730 
he goes for the mock hunt and this just
turned<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.569> whole<00:06:00.750> game<00:06:00.930> around<00:06:01.110> because<00:06:01.590> he

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
turned the whole game around because he

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.219 
turned the whole game around because he
does<00:06:01.979> get<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.280> crit<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:02.789> that<00:06:03.449> mattered<00:06:03.930> so

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
does get a crit and that mattered so

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.770 
does get a crit and that mattered so
much<00:06:04.259> because<00:06:04.800> as<00:06:05.159> you<00:06:05.370> can<00:06:05.580> as<00:06:05.849> you<00:06:06.360> will<00:06:06.539> see

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
much because as you can as you will see

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.770 
much because as you can as you will see
now<00:06:06.990> um<00:06:07.550> she<00:06:08.550> will<00:06:08.759> keep<00:06:08.940> going<00:06:09.300> for<00:06:09.539> the<00:06:09.629> mock

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
now um she will keep going for the mock

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.559 
now um she will keep going for the mock
punch<00:06:10.139> and<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:10.500> only<00:06:11.039> move<00:06:11.280> I<00:06:11.580> can<00:06:11.819> do<00:06:12.030> on<00:06:12.270> him

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
punch and the only move I can do on him

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.339 
punch and the only move I can do on him
is<00:06:12.810> ah<00:06:14.000> well<00:06:15.000> nothing<00:06:15.479> actually<00:06:15.659> because<00:06:16.199> it

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
is ah well nothing actually because it

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.320 
is ah well nothing actually because it
has<00:06:16.560> priority<00:06:17.220> and<00:06:17.430> then<00:06:17.580> I<00:06:17.610> actually<00:06:17.879> lived
