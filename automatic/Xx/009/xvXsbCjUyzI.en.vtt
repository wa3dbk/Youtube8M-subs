00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.609
 Hello and welcome to the Council - today with the small display 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.129
 is 2 video also occurred but omitted 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.490
 All year to Schaumburg now there is no giving back 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.169
 which are extrapolated in chapter 7 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.029
 There, the game is in charge 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.710
 automatically in this shaft yes that's no different 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.340
 and that means an alternative short summary was really difficult 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.689
 it did not break out 20 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.349
 why not with you 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 yes, down through the shaft 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.450
 Formula briefly glance at the imagery and then look at the fuse 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.890
 Arranged projects 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.190
 to guide the game through that by now is the return game count 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.570
 Jesus was Christopher Wallace opening up Whittle and then they're killing each other 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690
 old ski racer tuned 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 for all four in it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.200
 turns Sokol Kiev are likely to make switches, it continues to go back to 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.900
 your first starting point 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.130
 since I arrived here you have quite a switchboard 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.490
 with which this whole storm could turn and then comes in the link 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.899
 on 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.740
 So again a victory the lock 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.540
 unknown so far below 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.630
 Come back out and the same team carefully 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 against the men will again from the beginning 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 the winter sports 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.990
 Year is done Look we from the village like Esther switchboard 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.870
 put the fuse in turn 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.570
 and switch presses 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.590
 so now you might think you are climbing out and the Wars 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.330
 Tablet form at the exit 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.080
 That's why we want this way around open on this red icon 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.220
 see light up and now the crash moves also fuse and locates 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.580
 the new again 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.120
 to see them as a good symbol, the bright blue was on 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.390
 and now you can see the shaft here at once 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.540
 turn left again and it opens a compartment way to a 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.750
 new room 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.020
 r 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.200
 we shut up a third time and shut up 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.600
 turn left and enter the secret room 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.300
 maybe you can already think so hard 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.520
 I hope I was annoyed that they can help many thanks for 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.760
 watch and see if
