connector<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.869> allows<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
connector and this just allows you to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.319 
connector and this just allows you to
plug<00:01:52.560> your<00:01:52.680> PC<00:01:53.220> headphones<00:01:53.640> into<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.149> 360

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
plug your PC headphones into your 360

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.569 
plug your PC headphones into your 360
you<00:01:57.329> also<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.079> USB<00:01:58.110> power<00:01:58.770> lead<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
you also get a USB power lead and this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.880 
you also get a USB power lead and this
is<00:01:59.670> actually<00:02:00.000> got<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:00.479> USB<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.200> ports<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.740> one

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
is actually got two USB to ports on one

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.499 
is actually got two USB to ports on one
end<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.369> provide<00:02:02.670> more<00:02:02.909> power<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
end to provide more power to the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.280 
end to provide more power to the
Thunderer<00:02:03.840> FX<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.540> then<00:02:06.659> you've<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:06.960> got

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
Thunderer FX so then you've actually got

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.749 
Thunderer FX so then you've actually got
the<00:02:07.320> unit<00:02:07.710> itself

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.520 

so<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> unit<00:02:11.930> we've<00:02:12.050> got<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:13.010> power<00:02:13.640> LED<00:02:14.150> a

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
so on the unit we've got the power LED a

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.500 
so on the unit we've got the power LED a
mode<00:02:15.530> selection<00:02:16.250> dial<00:02:16.489> bar<00:02:17.000> where<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.300> choose

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the ENC mic and LED and basically this

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.860 
the ENC mic and LED and basically this
is<00:02:35.989> just<00:02:36.019> a<00:02:36.260> built-in<00:02:36.650> mic<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:38.239> listens<00:02:38.810> to

is just a built-in mic that listens to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.970 
is just a built-in mic that listens to
the<00:02:38.959> environments<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.620> help<00:02:39.799> reduce

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the environments that help reduce

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.000 
the environments that help reduce
background<00:02:40.459> noise<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:42.319> people<00:02:42.650> can<00:02:42.769> detain

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
background noise so people can detain

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.789 
background noise so people can detain
you<00:02:43.130> more<00:02:43.310> clearly<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:45.319> if<00:02:45.410> we<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.680> move

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
you more clearly so then if we just move

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.759 
you more clearly so then if we just move
on<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.099> rear<00:02:46.280> panel<00:02:46.780> we've<00:02:47.780> got<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.170> RCA

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
little bit confused as to why they

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.770 
little bit confused as to why they
bother<00:03:10.459> including<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.510> motherboard

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
bother including this in a motherboard

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.710 
bother including this in a motherboard
that<00:03:12.019> already<00:03:12.860> has<00:03:13.130> such<00:03:13.370> high<00:03:13.640> quality

that already has such high quality
onboard<00:03:14.720> audio<00:03:15.100> but<00:03:16.100> then<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.340> found<00:03:16.489> out<00:03:16.700> this

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
onboard audio but then I found out this

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.120 
onboard audio but then I found out this
only<00:03:17.209> Fathy<00:03:17.720> pound<00:03:17.989> more<00:03:18.200> expensive<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:19.010> get

external first i'll sound card that not

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.190 
external first i'll sound card that not
only<00:03:27.769> looks<00:03:28.190> epic<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:29.299> it's<00:03:29.420> got<00:03:29.569> easy<00:03:29.840> for
