00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.260 

the<00:01:50.950> Z<00:01:51.160> button<00:01:51.430> doesn't<00:01:51.820> appear<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.180> be

the Z button doesn't appear to be

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.460 
the Z button doesn't appear to be
working<00:01:54.180> behind<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.720> our<00:01:55.870> Tekkit<00:01:56.320> is

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
working behind you that our Tekkit is

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.400 
working behind you that our Tekkit is
buggy<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.690> doesn't<00:01:58.690> always<00:01:58.900> function<00:01:59.320> the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
buggy and doesn't always function the

buggy and doesn't always function the
way<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.620> should<00:02:02.580> cannot<00:02:03.580> seem<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.880> get<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.180> to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
way it should cannot seem to get this to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.170 
way it should cannot seem to get this to
work<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.690> save<00:02:04.900> my<00:02:05.080> life<00:02:05.260> either<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.940> right

work to save my life either all right
I'll<00:02:10.300> take<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.510> quick<00:02:10.750> break<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.050> get<00:02:11.590> back<00:02:11.800> to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
I'll take a quick break and get back to

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.550 
I'll take a quick break and get back to
you<00:02:12.040> all<00:02:13.030> right<00:02:13.240> so<00:02:13.450> I'm<00:02:13.540> back<00:02:13.720> now<00:02:13.750> after<00:02:14.350> many

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
you all right so I'm back now after many

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.200 
you all right so I'm back now after many
a<00:02:14.650> trial<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.250> error<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.520> figured<00:02:15.880> out<00:02:15.970> what<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
a trial and error I figured out what the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.850 
a trial and error I figured out what the
problem<00:02:16.330> was<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.990> actually<00:02:17.380> need<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.710> know

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
problem was you actually need to know

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.520 
problem was you actually need to know
what<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.540> toggle<00:02:19.540> button<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.900> set<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.290> your

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
what the toggle button is set to on your

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.500 
what the toggle button is set to on your
controls<00:02:20.980> also<00:02:21.460> if<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.000> scroll<00:02:22.270> back<00:02:22.480> down

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
controls also if you scroll back down

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.290 
controls also if you scroll back down
into<00:02:22.900> here<00:02:23.580> you'll<00:02:24.580> find<00:02:24.640> your<00:02:25.000> extra

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
into here you'll find your extra

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.900 
into here you'll find your extra

function button which mine is mapped to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.120 
function button which mine is mapped to
see<00:02:28.300> therefore<00:02:28.990> when<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.170> hit<00:02:29.350> see<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.950> see

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
see therefore when I hit see as you see

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.520 
see therefore when I hit see as you see
it<00:02:30.220> says<00:02:30.430> normal<00:02:30.760> impact<00:02:31.150> mode<00:02:31.390> where<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.410> only

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
it says normal impact mode where it only

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.440 
it says normal impact mode where it only
breaks<00:02:32.830> one<00:02:33.040> at<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.220> time<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.240> toggle

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
breaks one at a time and then we toggle

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.050 
breaks one at a time and then we toggle
it<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> mega<00:02:34.959> impact<00:02:35.410> mode<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.820> break<00:02:37.030> a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
it a mega impact mode and we break a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.870 
it a mega impact mode and we break a
block<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.690> can<00:02:37.810> see<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:39.160> dealing<00:02:39.580> quite

block as you can see it's dealing quite
a<00:02:39.910> bit<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.180> damage<00:02:40.209> it's<00:02:40.720> knocking<00:02:41.080> out<00:02:41.200> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
a bit of damage it's knocking out I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.320 
a bit of damage it's knocking out I
believe<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> three<00:02:41.980> by<00:02:42.130> three<00:02:42.160> area<00:02:42.790> which<00:02:43.180> is

believe a three by three area which is

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.970 
believe a three by three area which is
very<00:02:43.780> useful<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.380> mining<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:47.410> in<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.740> next

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
very useful for mining I'm in the next

very useful for mining I'm in the next
video<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.280> think<00:02:48.700> we're<00:02:48.850> going<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.209> on<00:02:49.330> to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
video I think we're going to get on to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.590 
video I think we're going to get on to
making<00:02:49.690> red<00:02:50.050> matter<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.370> sure<00:02:51.400> if<00:02:52.390> you're

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
making red matter so be sure if you're

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.730 
making red matter so be sure if you're
watching<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:52.959> video<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.380> you've<00:02:53.620> been

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
watching this video and you've been

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.340 
watching this video and you've been
following<00:02:53.890> along<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.780> save<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.959> dark<00:02:56.200> matter

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
following along to save that dark matter

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.690 
following along to save that dark matter
because<00:02:56.739> we're<00:02:56.890> going<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.070> need<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.459> to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
because we're going to need that to

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970 
because we're going to need that to
convert<00:02:58.060> into<00:02:58.300> red<00:02:58.480> matter<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.709> hope<00:02:59.860> you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
convert into red matter but I hope you

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.380 
convert into red matter but I hope you
