00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.250
 hello how about firmat diary friends 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.680
 here we are again in the square 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.680
 Manuel Belgrano from the neighborhood of the fatherland 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:23.230
 from the city of firmat on this day 2 of 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:28.080
 March 2013 that the hammock woke up today 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.130
 which usually begins to move 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.050
 around the month of June but good in 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.670
 this opportunity as I said 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 previously we are in the month of March 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.830
 and one of them has started to get 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.080
 here we are so that you can 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.690
 observe 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.360
 that this medicine if there is a little wind 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.060
 if we are focusing the trees we see 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.410
 the other brands that also replicate 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.410
 which is taking movement at three o'clock 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.740
 it is not usual either that all three are 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.130
 moving is a little bit is a replica 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.220
 that when the people of the USA came is 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.070
 they made her do to make 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.150
 experiments on them 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.310
 we are seeing we see the trees also 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.200
 there is a small movement then it 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.680
 can safely listen in the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 microphone the camera but it's not a wind 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.090
 It is a very strong west wind south 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.939
 eleven thirty in the morning 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.359
 in the city since filming them as well 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.359
 I said earlier 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.570
 the hammocks in this year 2013 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.470
 the reality you can get to say 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.650
 that is the wind itself but the question of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.670
 The other side asks our question because 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:51.229
 see how the other two hammocks are 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.150
 motionless still and the one on the left in 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.119
 this opportunity that today is not 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.149
 he wanted to move in the on the left 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.630

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.759

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.270
 as we always repeat it because it 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.580
 considers one of the world phenomena 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.490
