and then just scoop the edge okay see

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.840 
and then just scoop the edge okay see
that<00:00:32.669> again<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.330> scoop<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.199> edge<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that again just scoop the edge this is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.670 
that again just scoop the edge this is
almost<00:00:36.150> like<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> powder<00:00:36.900> blue<00:00:37.699> collar

and<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:51.690> lot<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.199> times<00:00:52.410> we'd<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and a lot of times we'd like to have a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
and a lot of times we'd like to have a
little<00:00:53.640> bit<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> light<00:00:54.180> sparkling<00:00:54.930> right

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little bit of light sparkling right

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.340 
little bit of light sparkling right
across<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.890> top<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> our<00:00:56.519> waterfall<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.359> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
causes that waterfall to Sparkle let's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.150 
causes that waterfall to Sparkle let's
go<00:01:14.009> do<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.399> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.880> lower<00:01:15.380> now<00:01:16.380> notice

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
go do that on the one lower now notice

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.680 
go do that on the one lower now notice
we've<00:01:17.369> got<00:01:17.399> a<00:01:17.610> couple<00:01:17.849> of<00:01:18.000> things<00:01:18.179> we've<00:01:18.479> got

we've got a couple of things we've got
some<00:01:18.959> cascades<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:20.039> we<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.550> actually<00:01:21.140> do

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
some cascades going we can actually do

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
some cascades going we can actually do
that<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.920> cascades<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:23.970> back<00:01:24.209> there

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
that with the cascades right back there

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
that with the cascades right back there
see<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.289> maybe<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.610> light<00:01:26.849> is<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
see that and maybe the light is just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.339 
see that and maybe the light is just
sparkling<00:01:27.989> enough<00:01:28.410> for<00:01:28.739> us<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.759> side

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:30.349 
sparkling enough for us on this side

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:35.120 
sparkling enough for us on this side
okay<00:01:31.349> so<00:01:31.649> let's<00:01:32.160> go<00:01:32.340> ahead<00:01:32.489> and<00:01:33.800> grab<00:01:34.800> some

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
okay so let's go ahead and grab some

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
okay so let's go ahead and grab some
more<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.610> color<00:01:35.940> just<00:01:36.539> like<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
color just like it is because I want the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.930 
color just like it is because I want the
scratchiness<00:01:43.880> alright<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.940> what's

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
scratchiness alright see that and what's

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.109 
scratchiness alright see that and what's
nice<00:01:48.239> about<00:01:48.300> it<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:50.039> very<00:01:50.369> little<00:01:50.489> of<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
nice about it is that very little of it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.900 
nice about it is that very little of it
comes<00:01:51.569> off<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.369> need<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
comes off and that's what you need is

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.050 
comes off and that's what you need is
very<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> gives<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> spark

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
very little and that gives the spark

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.229 
very little and that gives the spark
spark<00:01:57.899> leanness<00:01:58.379> that<00:01:59.099> really<00:01:59.640> sets<00:02:00.000> this

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
spark leanness that really sets this

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.469 
spark leanness that really sets this
painting<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:01.160> okay<00:02:02.160> that's<00:02:02.789> a<00:02:02.970> tip<00:02:03.179> from

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
painting out okay that's a tip from

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.199 
painting out okay that's a tip from
Darrel<00:02:04.020> let's<00:02:04.800> move<00:02:05.069> right<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.489> in<00:02:05.700> our<00:02:05.819> study

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
Darrel let's move right on in our study

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.780 
Darrel let's move right on in our study
