00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.170

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.690

 they want to learn how to make this rich 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.580
 salad stay with me and we go with 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.700
 the ingredients 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.520
 for this recipe we will need 500 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.530
 grams of gun- type pasta and me 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.630
 like this type of pasta because it is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 with more consistency when cooked 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.210
 but you can use this type of pasta that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.239
 more you like two or three cans of tuna in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.790
 oil or in water a can of grain 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.040
 golden ears a can of salad 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.260
 vegetables or if you want you can put your 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.920
 own vegetables and fix them in small squares 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.430
 you will need carrot peas and potatoes 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.710
 green beans cream and mayonnaise to taste to me 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.400
 I like it to be creamy so I know 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.010
 about a cup of mayonnaise and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.170
 250 milliliters of cream and salt to taste 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.510
 and the first thing we will do is put 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.820
 boil water in a pot for every 100 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.880
 grams of pasta we will put a liter of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.730
 water and cover the pot so that the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.410
 water boils faster because the water 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.840
 it's boiling I'll show you 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.450
 we will put a tablespoon flush with salt 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.520
 for each liter of water the salt is 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.010
 add until it's boiling because 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.470
 if you put it on before the water will take longer 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.470
 in the lic since you've put the salt 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 add to the pasta we will leave the pot 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 uncovered and we'll let it cook from 10 to 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.900
 12 minutes each type and brand of pasta 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.180
 has its cooking time different in 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.350
 the package comes the instructions and the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 time to cook them 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.000
 since the pasta is ready we will put it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.070
 in a pasta strainer to drain the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.200
 hot water and we will put you under the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.690
 Jet cold water until it cools 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.239
 completely to cut the cooking and 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.670
 that the pasta is not cooked in a 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.480
 container we will put the pasta and the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.600
 we deny the corn the vegetables the tuna the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.209
 cream and mayonnaise and we will mix it very 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.090
 well if you want you can add salt I 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.180
 I do not put it on but this is to your liking and 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.660
 ready so easy we prepare a 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.239
