00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 description I will also give a top 10 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.550
 clarified that I will not put games in my top 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.920
 the legend of zelda or final fantasy 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.890
 because I'm not a fan of rpg games 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.230
 at number 10 we have metal slug 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 advanced this game is just like the one 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.400
 you played in the little machines with the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.929
 difference of characters the history of the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.489
 game I do not know because I only 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.550
 shoot everything that moves or 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.980
 breathe x of its graphic sounds and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.469
 enemies do not change everything remains the same in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.450
 the number 9 we have a meter 0 mission 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.370
 is a king that from the first meter to the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.590
 finishing it will give us the option to play 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 the original Danish metroid his 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.000
 playability is very good and contains 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.190
 new posts the history of this game 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 is that the metro is a parasite 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 murderers invade and then the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.039
 bounty hunter samus aran has them 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.050
 to destroy and then I do not need much 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.930
 explanation for this game since it is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.870
 very harmful at number 8 we have one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.140
 what happened here there seems to be a tie 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.020
 xd here I will put three games the mario kart 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.000
 the nixon racing and the car network racing 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.430
 in the one of mario you choose the characters 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.410
 de mario in the nixon racing you choose to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.350
 one of the old nick characters 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.450
 as well as spongebob the tom berries the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.490
 rugrats and cat dog and the same with the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430
 cartoon network with the characters 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.540
 old as well as johnny bravo labaka and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 the chicken 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 eddie and many more the gameplay in the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 three is the same in the end the game is 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 great if you are one of those who saw those 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.810
 series like me in number 7 we have to 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.910
 super mario advance 12 to the super mario 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.980
 bros 2 since they're going to tell me that the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.230
 super mario bros 3 or the world network are 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.150
 better but I liked it better because the 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.620
 playability is different from the others and 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.230
 the story is another one that is not 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.540
 rescue princesses in the end the game is 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.640
 great and change things a bit 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 the same as always at number 6 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.660
 we have the king of fighters 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 exploited this game like the 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.070
 metal slug 'advanced is just like the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.770
 arcade and nothing changes the characters 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.120
 Combos sounds and others are exactly 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.340
 same in number 5 we have to 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 story that in the anime has a good 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.370
 playability and the best graphics of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
