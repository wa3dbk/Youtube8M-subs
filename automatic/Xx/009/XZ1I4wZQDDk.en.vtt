00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.860
 Katharina Merz and study at the University 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.900
 mainz medicine coming semester and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.860
 complete my obligatory internship here 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 for general medicine my name is 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.050
 Friedel Magma doctor here in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.970
 framersheim in the heart of rheinhessen 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.490
 I am now 25 years old 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.740
 general practitioner active 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 next I was emergency medicine am 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.949
 download the notary cfm award and since 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.410
 some time as well 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.239
 palliative here in the area involved 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 with the education of students 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.010
 started very early and that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.510
 Ultimately, that's what most of all to me 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.399
 the heart of the many advantages of the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.960
 general medicine to make it really clear 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.769
 and have students come to show that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.199
 General medicine just not so 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.850
 Small subject is what you do next to it 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.399
 but can be a very 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.890
 varied times where one never 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.200
 boring is the whole spectrum of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 medicine has very very narrow down 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.740
 give contact also goes to the patient 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 Everything is completely fixed here , nothing comes to me 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.720
 happens and then goes on 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.159
 this is a motley patient 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.479
 clientele that means in consequence 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.439
 should take care a bit 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.579
 berlusconi indeed times really satisfied 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.990
 its like me already 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.250
 presented that each station small 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.930
 aches and pains come from the can 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.220
 worse be less bad the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.149
 doctor then decides whether to continue 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.180
 is transferred 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.530
 at established specialists or 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.990
 maybe even to the hospital 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.909
 and yes it is a bit selected 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.549
 and that's the way to go 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.229
 even before giving me small at first 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.270
 here 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.689
 kg we see now right away 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.119
 always the same inconspicuous 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.039
 milk as a rhythm with a frequency too 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.930
 90 I try to convey what 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.240
 it consists in dealing with patients 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.030
 yes it does not matter the latest 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.650
 Studies of level medicine in the head 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.370
 to have 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.980
 important on the human level 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.290
 to find contact with the patients and 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.829
 try over this human level 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.549
 common strategy for treatment 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.780
 develop 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.780
 sometimes good then we'll see 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.760
 older lady but single 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.190
 we look what is the overall situation 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.920
 the blood pressure is like that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.610
 glucose-world is the passes away 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.790
 one and afternoon co-production federal 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.860
 firmly and inject to reason and so 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.080
 and the usual things are at one 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.990
 home visit 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.239
 this is a kind of medicine that goes into 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.280
 the uni sounds totally over then what that 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.360
 protein just did not exist 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.580
 infinitely much to do 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.380
 The doctor really does not have a break 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.780
 has made between door and angel 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.720
 Eaten and is really from 8 o'clock 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:32.770
 in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening on axis 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.770
 been stressful so they say 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.890
 So what were broad spectrum 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.890
 antibiotic tunis 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.860
 you drink a lot more in the 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.180
 privacy of the patient and 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.250
 but also gets more with so one 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.010
 also gets more information about the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.660
 lifestyle and maybe over the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.030
 illness as the patient then in the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.400
 everyday life and if it can 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.380
 one then rather ask if the patient in 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.730
 the practice is but you just look 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.600
 not and some things fall then 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.980
 perhaps our table as 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.239
 I think some patients are important 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.690
 You just can not do it anymore 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.820
 come 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.680
 then they have no relatives who they 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.660
 then you can drive and for this 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.710
 important that the general medicine doctor 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.710
 to the home comes 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:38.760
 that belongs please what did you hear 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:41.280
 normal risk ok in union clear one 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.350
 then listen to it but it 's easy 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.060
 not at this moment does not get there 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.920
 routine and I have five now 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.940
 six times normal lungs now belonged 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.520
 I also know how a normal 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.830
 lungs sounds and I think that needs it 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.220
 So you can do it similarly 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.220
 learn books 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.950
 the special craft in the 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.620
 general medicine 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.070
 that is different in many from 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.740
 what after the uni clinic learns if 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.520
 you have to average a lot with little 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.530
 can do 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.410
 and there is a very big one 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.080
 Manko I mean that again and again 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.370
 with a few things a good one 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.090
 can do diagnostics 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.200
 It's always exciting so you get 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.940
 yes, to see things even for the 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.530
 a specialist may be difficult 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.420
 You have to decide how the way 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.200
 patents goes on and on 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.420
 patient just longer it to 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.890
 The hospital sees the patient 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.330
 then he is gone but he knows too 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.880
 not like the patient over the long 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.710
 period goes and how the family with it 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.880
 bypasses and the general practitioner of 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.070
 then sees the successes the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.720
 long-term successes maybe that 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.720
 can also make you happy
