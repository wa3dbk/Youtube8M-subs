00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
it's with pylons as you can see I'm

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.789 
it's with pylons as you can see I'm
still<00:03:53.120> making<00:03:53.329> void<00:03:53.720> rays<00:03:53.930> I'm<00:03:54.530> basically

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
still making void rays I'm basically

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.099 
still making void rays I'm basically
getting<00:03:54.980> charged<00:03:55.370> void<00:03:56.060> rays<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.569> just<00:03:56.930> said

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
getting charged void rays I just said

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.099 
getting charged void rays I just said
it's<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.859> my<00:03:57.980> gateways<00:03:58.840> getting<00:03:59.840> two<00:03:59.959> more

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
it's with my gateways getting two more

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.629 
it's with my gateways getting two more
gateways<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.500> think<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.160> should<00:04:01.310> have<00:04:01.400> added

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
gateways I think I should have added

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.580 
gateways I think I should have added
them<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> bit<00:04:02.060> earlier<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:03.109> replace<00:04:03.410> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
them a bit earlier to replace the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.430 
them a bit earlier to replace the
gateways<00:04:03.889> that<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.489> already<00:04:05.299> know<00:04:05.750> i<00:04:06.019> really

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
gateways that I already know i really

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.839 
gateways that I already know i really
knew<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.709> were<00:04:07.040> going<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.280> get<00:04:07.400> killed<00:04:07.609> and

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
knew that were going to get killed and

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.970 
knew that were going to get killed and
here<00:04:08.359> i<00:04:08.450> activate<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.079> phones<00:04:09.319> of<00:04:09.560> charge<00:04:09.919> to

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
here i activate the phones of charge to

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.159 
here i activate the phones of charge to
buy<00:04:10.280> me<00:04:10.430> some<00:04:10.609> time<00:04:10.639> until<00:04:11.030> charge<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:11.959> done

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
buy me some time until charge is done

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.530 
buy me some time until charge is done
meanwhile<00:04:13.069> my<00:04:13.220> opponents<00:04:13.669> face<00:04:13.819> nothing<00:04:14.180> but

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
meanwhile my opponents face nothing but

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.630 
meanwhile my opponents face nothing but
high<00:04:14.660> risk<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.109> think<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.380> even<00:04:15.530> lost<00:04:15.799> her<00:04:16.130> oracle

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
high risk I think I even lost her oracle

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.480 
high risk I think I even lost her oracle
or

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:18.490 
or

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.610 
or
micros<00:04:19.490> actually<00:04:19.850> really<00:04:20.060> bad<00:04:20.410> thinking<00:04:21.410> god

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
micros actually really bad thinking god

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.560 
micros actually really bad thinking god
I<00:04:21.980> did<00:04:22.370> actually<00:04:22.490> got<00:04:22.760> great<00:04:22.940> enjoy<00:04:23.180> yourself

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
I did actually got great enjoy yourself

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.280 
I did actually got great enjoy yourself
or<00:04:23.720> speed<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.110> you<00:04:24.140> can<00:04:24.380> streamline<00:04:25.190> hydras

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
or speed so you can streamline hydras

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.470 
or speed so you can streamline hydras
because<00:04:27.290> range<00:04:27.530> doesn't<00:04:27.950> really<00:04:28.300> well<00:04:29.300> maybe

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
because range doesn't really well maybe

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.090 
because range doesn't really well maybe
a<00:04:29.570> bet<00:04:29.720> against<00:04:29.960> voice<00:04:30.170> I<00:04:30.440> guess<00:04:30.770> would<00:04:31.070> be

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
a bet against voice I guess would be

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.400 
a bet against voice I guess would be
nice<00:04:31.460> if<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.700> will<00:04:32.030> have<00:04:32.150> range<00:04:32.390> but<00:04:32.690> my

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
nice if you will have range but my

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.020 
nice if you will have range but my
charge<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.800> about<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.130> complete<00:04:34.430> I'm<00:04:34.670> adding

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
charge is about to complete I'm adding

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.110 
charge is about to complete I'm adding
two<00:04:35.150> more<00:04:35.180> gateways<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:36.610> make<00:04:37.610> more<00:04:37.730> salads

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120

salads and also get in range of the void

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.540 
salads and also get in range of the void
rays<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:11.900> even<00:05:12.440> used<00:05:12.620> a<00:05:12.710> time<00:05:12.890> where<00:05:13.100> be<00:05:13.220> making

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
rays I even used a time where be making

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.970 
rays I even used a time where be making
even<00:05:13.820> slower<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.510> then<00:05:15.230> you<00:05:15.320> can<00:05:15.470> force<00:05:15.770> with

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
even slower and then you can force with

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.920 
even slower and then you can force with
behind<00:05:16.220> them<00:05:16.430> quite<00:05:16.700> comfortably<00:05:17.210> so<00:05:17.780> as<00:05:17.840> you

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
behind them quite comfortably so as you

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.990 
behind them quite comfortably so as you
can<00:05:18.020> see<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.380> salad<00:05:18.650> should<00:05:18.830> help<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.250> lot<00:05:19.400> you

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
can see the salad should help a lot you

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.520 
can see the salad should help a lot you

away<00:05:33.440> I'm<00:05:33.770> safe<00:05:34.040> I<00:05:34.250> take<00:05:34.430> my<00:05:34.580> third<00:05:34.850> base<00:05:35.090> right

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
away I'm safe I take my third base right

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.080 
away I'm safe I take my third base right
away<00:05:35.510> on<00:05:36.170> robotics<00:05:36.470> on<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.860> way<00:05:36.980> it's<00:05:37.850> really

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
away on robotics on the way it's really

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.870 
away on robotics on the way it's really
a<00:05:38.120> function<00:05:38.390> my<00:05:38.720> stomach<00:05:38.990> hates<00:05:39.050> got<00:05:39.350> killed

a function my stomach hates got killed

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.040 
a function my stomach hates got killed
probably<00:05:40.880> oh<00:05:41.000> if<00:05:41.150> my<00:05:41.300> workers<00:05:41.570> actually<00:05:41.750> still

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
probably oh if my workers actually still

probably oh if my workers actually still
alive<00:05:42.260> so<00:05:42.560> I<00:05:43.220> thought<00:05:44.180> I'd<00:05:44.360> lasted<00:05:44.660> but<00:05:44.780> I

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
didn't so I have my robot reestablishing

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.930 
didn't so I have my robot reestablishing

my wall here I'm just gonna head towards
colossi<00:05:50.540> I<00:05:50.810> see<00:05:51.320> he<00:05:51.410> just<00:05:51.440> made<00:05:51.740> some<00:05:51.950> more<00:05:52.070> a

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
colossi I see he just made some more a

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.580 
colossi I see he just made some more a
hydrolase<00:05:52.730> but<00:05:53.000> he<00:05:53.420> gonna<00:05:53.630> had<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:54.050> in<00:05:54.290> case<00:05:54.410> I

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
hydrolase but he gonna had to in case I

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.310 
hydrolase but he gonna had to in case I

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
to say I'm I'm quite head I'm 55 workers

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.940 
to say I'm I'm quite head I'm 55 workers
against<00:06:01.910> 40<00:06:02.240> workers<00:06:02.420> and<00:06:03.260> even<00:06:03.470> get<00:06:03.560> my<00:06:03.680> third

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
against 40 workers and even get my third

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.590 
against 40 workers and even get my third
base<00:06:04.160> faster<00:06:04.520> than<00:06:04.610> my<00:06:04.760> opponent<00:06:04.970> because

base faster than my opponent because

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.630 
base faster than my opponent because
this<00:06:05.930> was<00:06:06.110> kind<00:06:06.350> of<00:06:06.440> a<00:06:06.590> cheesy<00:06:06.860> only<00:06:07.310> build

upgrades at the game continues for about
10<00:06:17.810> more<00:06:17.990> minutes<00:06:18.230> I<00:06:18.650> just<00:06:19.430> played<00:06:19.700> out<00:06:19.910> he

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
10 more minutes I just played out he

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.800 
10 more minutes I just played out he
just<00:06:20.930> laid<00:06:21.140> out<00:06:21.290> normally<00:06:21.650> here<00:06:22.480> I'm<00:06:23.480> taking

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
just laid out normally here I'm taking

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.290 
just laid out normally here I'm taking
upwards<00:06:24.170> colossi<00:06:24.650> and<00:06:24.920> after<00:06:25.790> that<00:06:25.880> I<00:06:25.940> take<00:06:26.180> to

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
upwards colossi and after that I take to

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.730 
upwards colossi and after that I take to
watch<00:06:26.450> storm<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:26.930> don't<00:06:27.110> think<00:06:27.260> I<00:06:27.350> rebuilt<00:06:27.680> my

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
watch storm I don't think I rebuilt my

watch storm I don't think I rebuilt my
stargates<00:06:28.280> I<00:06:28.490> have<00:06:28.610> five<00:06:28.850> Padres

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
stargates I have five Padres

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.480 
stargates I have five Padres
so<00:06:30.370> maybe<00:06:30.850> I'd<00:06:31.000> make<00:06:31.570> a<00:06:31.600> started<00:06:31.960> later<00:06:32.170> but<00:06:32.490> if

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
so maybe I'd make a started later but if

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.650 
so maybe I'd make a started later but if
you<00:06:33.640> really<00:06:33.790> want<00:06:34.000> to<00:06:34.060> see<00:06:34.180> the<00:06:34.300> end<00:06:34.450> of<00:06:34.540> the
