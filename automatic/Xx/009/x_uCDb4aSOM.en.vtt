Minecraft<00:02:34.390> we<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:35.200> beauty<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.120> me

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
Minecraft we have that beauty this is me

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.470 
Minecraft we have that beauty this is me
or<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.680> zombie<00:02:38.830> me<00:02:39.220> or<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.670> wither<00:02:40.000> skeleton

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
or the zombie me or the wither skeleton

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.310 
or the zombie me or the wither skeleton
me<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.370> actually<00:02:42.370> after<00:02:43.180> one<00:02:43.360> minute<00:02:43.540> as

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
me and actually after one minute as

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.050 
me and actually after one minute as
promised<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.040> will<00:02:45.100> get<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.520> wooden<00:02:45.790> sword

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
promised I will get that wooden sword

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.130 
promised I will get that wooden sword
and<00:02:47.400> let<00:02:48.400> me<00:02:48.490> just<00:02:48.520> explain<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.840> how<00:02:50.110> that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
and let me just explain to you how that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.790 
and let me just explain to you how that
works

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
works

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.080 
works
so<00:02:51.460> basically<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.960> not<00:02:53.200> just<00:02:53.760> one<00:02:54.760> single

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
so basically this is not just one single

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.850 
so basically this is not just one single
mob<00:02:55.480> or<00:02:56.280> one<00:02:57.280> single<00:02:57.610> entity<00:02:57.760> these<00:02:58.570> are<00:02:58.860> many

mob or one single entity these are many

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.500 
mob or one single entity these are many
entities<00:03:00.250> stacked<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.940> top<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.150> each<00:03:01.330> other

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
entities stacked on top of each other

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.240 
entities stacked on top of each other
and<00:03:04.440> here<00:03:05.440> we<00:03:05.590> have<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.550> wither<00:03:07.000> skeleton<00:03:08.250> on

up<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.320> five<00:04:41.590> items<00:04:41.880> inside<00:04:42.880> of<00:04:42.940> him<00:04:43.230> four

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
up to five items inside of him four

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.630 
up to five items inside of him four
armor<00:04:44.500> slots<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.010> one<00:04:45.370> hand<00:04:46.210> slot<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:48.460> that's

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
armor slots and one hand slot and that's

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.000 
armor slots and one hand slot and that's
why<00:04:48.850> you<00:04:48.910> should<00:04:49.180> never<00:04:49.630> pick<00:04:50.230> more<00:04:51.750> than<00:04:53.010> five

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
why you should never pick more than five

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.880 
why you should never pick more than five
items<00:04:54.640> without<00:04:55.390> setting<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.350> next<00:04:56.500> clock

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
items without setting the next clock

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.540 
items without setting the next clock
item<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:58.260> items<00:04:59.260> number<00:04:59.770> six<00:05:00.010> seven<00:05:00.400> and

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
item and the items number six seven and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.850 
item and the items number six seven and
so<00:05:00.670> on<00:05:00.820> will<00:05:01.000> just<00:05:01.030> get<00:05:01.300> lost<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:04.200> yeah<00:05:05.200> so

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
so on will just get lost and yeah so

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.690 
so on will just get lost and yeah so
this<00:05:06.790> just<00:05:07.210> continues<00:05:07.450> for<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:09.250> chest<00:05:09.520> plate

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
this just continues for the chest plate

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.140 
this just continues for the chest plate
and<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:11.320> diamond<00:05:11.650> sword<00:05:11.890> until<00:05:12.760> there's

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
and the diamond sword until there's

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.780 
and the diamond sword until there's
nothing<00:05:13.300> left<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:14.340> once<00:05:15.340> there's<00:05:15.520> nothing

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
nothing left and once there's nothing

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.310 
nothing left and once there's nothing
left<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.060> can<00:05:16.210> actually<00:05:16.360> see<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.900> nametag

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
left you can actually see the nametag

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.740 
left you can actually see the nametag
off<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.590> mob<00:05:17.820> it's<00:05:18.820> just<00:05:19.030> invisible<00:05:19.240> because

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
off the mob it's just invisible because

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.400 
off the mob it's just invisible because
there<00:05:20.290> are<00:05:20.410> some<00:05:20.880> some<00:05:21.880> slimes<00:05:22.690> riding<00:05:23.230> and

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
there are some some slimes riding and

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.320 
there are some some slimes riding and
yeah<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.040> makes<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.400> invisible<00:05:24.640> basically

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
yeah that makes it invisible basically

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.840 
yeah that makes it invisible basically
so<00:05:26.200> this<00:05:26.890> is<00:05:27.070> just<00:05:27.280> how<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.460> works

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
so this is just how it works

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.620 
so this is just how it works
I<00:05:27.970> wrote<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.240> simple<00:05:28.510> mcedit<00:05:28.870> filter<00:05:30.600> yeah<00:05:31.600> I

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
I wrote a simple mcedit filter yeah I

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.280 
I wrote a simple mcedit filter yeah I
saw<00:05:31.990> it<00:05:32.130> here<00:05:33.130> he<00:05:33.250> got<00:05:33.370> healed<00:05:33.730> and<00:05:34.290> he

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
saw it here he got healed and he

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.480 
saw it here he got healed and he
actually<00:05:35.410> dropped<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.980> wooden<00:05:36.220> sword<00:05:36.340> he

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
actually dropped the wooden sword he

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.270 
actually dropped the wooden sword he
picked<00:05:36.670> up<00:05:36.790> before<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.450> this<00:05:38.380> is<00:05:38.530> maybe<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:39.100> bit

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
picked up before so this is maybe a bit

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.090 
picked up before so this is maybe a bit
realistic<00:05:39.700> -<00:05:39.850> if<00:05:40.140> his<00:05:41.140> inventory<00:05:41.470> is<00:05:41.770> full<00:05:41.800> he

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
realistic - if his inventory is full he

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.210 
realistic - if his inventory is full he
just<00:05:42.310> drops<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.730> and<00:05:44.220> he<00:05:45.220> hasn't<00:05:45.370> land<00:05:45.970> props<00:05:46.180> -

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
just drops it and he hasn't land props -

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.920 
just drops it and he hasn't land props -
yeah<00:05:48.240> but<00:05:49.240> actually<00:05:49.480> I<00:05:49.990> got<00:05:50.470> the<00:05:50.590> idea<00:05:50.890> from

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
yeah but actually I got the idea from

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.140 
yeah but actually I got the idea from
the<00:05:52.930> subreddit<00:05:53.350> sethbling<00:05:54.190> suggestions<00:05:54.970> and

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
the subreddit sethbling suggestions and

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
the subreddit sethbling suggestions and
somebody<00:05:58.150> suggested<00:05:58.930> there<00:05:59.200> that<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.960> should

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
somebody suggested there that you should

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.060 
somebody suggested there that you should
create<00:06:02.410> a<00:06:03.210> single-player<00:06:04.210> UHC<00:06:05.080> where<00:06:05.770> you<00:06:05.920> do

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
create a single-player UHC where you do

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.330 
create a single-player UHC where you do
not<00:06:06.190> play<00:06:06.520> against<00:06:07.560> players<00:06:08.560> but<00:06:08.980> against

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
not play against players but against

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.080 
not play against players but against
mobs<00:06:09.580> which<00:06:09.910> get<00:06:10.120> stronger<00:06:10.540> and<00:06:10.810> stronger

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
mobs which get stronger and stronger

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.070 
mobs which get stronger and stronger
when<00:06:13.090> times<00:06:13.600> passing<00:06:14.110> so<00:06:14.880> for<00:06:15.880> example<00:06:16.270> yet<00:06:16.690> it
