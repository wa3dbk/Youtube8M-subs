00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.900
 movie about protection against late blight 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.630

 peony grassy peony here look 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.900
 a yellow leaf appeared and needed 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.610
 what kind of action does stop it 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.649
 the disease has not spread further 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.610
 many ask what kind of disease 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.820
 determine it can only specialist 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.609
 because many fungal diseases 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.489
 has very similar symptoms 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.250
 this is both fusarium and wilting gray rot 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.109
 there is something like that and black legs 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.899
 when here is right at the ground level at the leaf 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.449
 blackness appears and he is like this 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.030
 that is, the pylon is bent enough 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.280
 many fungal diseases with all 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.959
 fungal diseases need to fight 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.099
 with the help of fungicides these are drugs 

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:17.649
 chemical here in this case me 

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.410
 foundation 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:26.569
 other means may be used 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:30.319
 for example, there is a maxim drug and other 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:33.709
 you read the instructions on the back 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.800
 against which diseases helps here 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.959
 And here is the drug for the instructions you need 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.679
 dissolve in water and water this plant 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:46.970
 under the root we dissolve in 10 liters 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:52.160
 water here is this sachet 10 grant then so 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.910
 said the instructions begin to water 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.099
 But if you have one plant 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.160
 there is this disease here 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:04.690
 yellowing withering here these leaves i 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.619
 I advise you to shed all the bushes of peonies 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.910
 this is how prevention will be against 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.720
 the disease of others even healthy 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.610
 plants the fact is that spreads 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.080
 these diseases are usually through the soil 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.790
 spreads 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.540
 tool that is when you loosen 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.220
 the soil 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.700
 the same rake say yes here and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.390
 It will even be useful to sing it 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:44.170
 with a solution all your peony checks are poured 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:47.740
 rail this drug can not be used 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 only for aster peonies often suffer 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.330
 from fusarium his wilting prices are not 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.220
 suffers from fu dirty look of her when 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.400
 buds they have here so wilted 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.520
 disease through the roots clogs 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.380
 conducting system of these roots and here 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.800
 whole plant may die 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.220
 Here in this case, the peony is strong 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.110
 this plant is weakened 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.470
 bloom next year may not be 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.290
 have this peony and fight of course with this 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.390
 the disease is necessary here and water in 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:29.020
 root try to shed the soil around 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.360
 on the one plant I have to spend the same 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.190
 just did not eat much pour 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.000

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.200

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.430
 water on the next here I have a whole bucket 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.840
 here is a ten-liter 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.030
 I will also prepare one such bag 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.730
 I use it because I have a lot of pions 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.019
 and since I had a disease of course 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.380
