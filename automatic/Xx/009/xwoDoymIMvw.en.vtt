also holds its charge a little bit

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
also holds its charge a little bit
longer<00:01:42.590> works<00:01:43.590> great<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> flashlight<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
does hold the charge fairly well just

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.319 
does hold the charge fairly well just
won't<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.470> bright<00:01:49.909> but<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.240> really

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
won't be as bright but really really

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
won't be as bright but really really
cool<00:01:51.630> stuff<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.130> hit<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
cool stuff that's when you hit the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.630 
cool stuff that's when you hit the
lights<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.450> pitch<00:01:54.630> black

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
lights you can see this in pitch black

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.319 
lights you can see this in pitch black
be<00:01:56.640> better<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.049> better<00:01:58.049> view<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.439> it

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.289 

all<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:05.369> probably<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.149> see

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.949 
screaming bright it's really really cool
I<00:02:15.690> mean<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.560> not<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:18.300> often<00:02:18.480> eager<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.930> use

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
I mean it's not that often eager to use

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.530 
I mean it's not that often eager to use

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
drop it it will be easy to find but just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.970

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
see the difference freshly charged the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.160 
see the difference freshly charged the
other<00:03:18.030> side<00:03:18.239> starting<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.630> fade<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> little<00:03:18.870> bit

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
other side starting to fade a little bit

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.080 
other side starting to fade a little bit
but<00:03:19.709> they<00:03:19.799> will<00:03:19.980> hold<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.700> while

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
but they will hold for a while

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.470 
but they will hold for a while
very<00:03:21.480> similar<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.139> glow<00:03:22.650> stick<00:03:23.000> not<00:03:24.000> quite

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
very similar to a glow stick not quite

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720 
very similar to a glow stick not quite
as<00:03:24.690> long<00:03:25.380> duration<00:03:26.069> as<00:03:26.220> one<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.430> those<00:03:26.549> glow

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
as long duration as one of those glow

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
sticks but as far as liner material

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.449 
sticks but as far as liner material
synthetics<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.600> use<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:31.019> knives<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:32.220> certainly

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
synthetics to use on knives it certainly

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.610 
synthetics to use on knives it certainly
does<00:03:32.670> hold<00:03:32.880> up<00:03:33.090> very<00:03:33.450> well<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.230> does<00:03:34.380> take

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
does hold up very well and it does take

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.160
