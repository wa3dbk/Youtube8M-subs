00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
later on from the hungry winos but let's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.619 
later on from the hungry winos but let's
open<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.270> see<00:00:39.270> what's<00:00:39.450> inside

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
open this up here and see what's inside

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.530 
open this up here and see what's inside
so<00:00:40.200> getting<00:00:40.739> into<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> box<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.360> have

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
so getting into the box here we do have

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.900 
so getting into the box here we do have
this<00:00:42.660> top<00:00:42.930> foam<00:00:43.260> layer<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.370> underneath<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
this top foam layer and underneath that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
this top foam layer and underneath that
I'm<00:00:45.149> assuming<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> camera<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.230> first<00:00:46.559> up

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
I'm assuming is the camera but first up

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
I'm assuming is the camera but first up
well<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.969> our<00:00:48.360> user<00:00:48.750> manuals<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
well we do have our user manuals and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
well we do have our user manuals and
probably<00:00:50.190> some<00:00:50.789> kind<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.480> wouldn't<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
probably some kind of I wouldn't want to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.630 
probably some kind of I wouldn't want to
call<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> QuickStart<00:00:53.070> guide<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
call it a QuickStart guide because I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
call it a QuickStart guide because I
don't<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> discount<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.539> awesomeness

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
don't want to discount the awesomeness

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.750 
don't want to discount the awesomeness
of<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.410> camera<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.219> guess<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of this camera but I guess I have a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
of this camera but I guess I have a
remote<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.510> well<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.199> let's<00:00:58.410> move<00:00:58.559> along

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
remote here as well so let's move along

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.389 
remote here as well so let's move along
here<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.309> next<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.480> over<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.559> side<00:01:01.620> looks

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
here and next up over on this side looks

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
here and next up over on this side looks
like<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.300> 12<00:01:04.080> volt<00:01:04.199> AC<00:01:04.710> power

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
like we do have a 12 volt AC power

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.510 
like we do have a 12 volt AC power
adapter<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> cable<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
adapter and we also have a cable that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.070 
adapter and we also have a cable that
plugs<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> other<00:01:09.540> side<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.900> looks

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
plugs into the other side of that looks

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
plugs into the other side of that looks
like<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.500> cables<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.340> I'm

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
like we have two cables in here so I'm

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.560 
like we have two cables in here so I'm
assuming<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> other<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.330> goes<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
assuming that the other one goes to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.480 
assuming that the other one goes to
something<00:01:13.020> else<00:01:13.170> inside<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> box<00:01:14.010> up

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
something else inside of this box up

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
something else inside of this box up
here<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.210> metal<00:01:15.810> bracket<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> some

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
here we do have a metal bracket and some

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
here we do have a metal bracket and some
other<00:01:17.009> included<00:01:17.850> accessories<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.930> we'll

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
other included accessories here so we'll

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
other included accessories here so we'll
kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> piece<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.130> together<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.580> we

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

though it definitely feels like it has a
great<00:01:49.680> build<00:01:49.860> quality<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.369> let's<00:01:50.549> go<00:01:50.640> ahead

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
great build quality so let's go ahead

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.490 
great build quality so let's go ahead
and<00:01:50.909> move<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.210> off<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> side<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.470> have

and move that off to the side we do have
our<00:01:52.649> grip<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:53.970> attach<00:01:54.180> also<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
