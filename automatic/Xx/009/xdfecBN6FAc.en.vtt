 Professor Dr-ing 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.650
 I would really be with them in the name of Roth &amp; Rau and Prof so much 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.100
 betrays collaboration between departure from Belfort 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 the editorial team thanks 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.830
 They have their donations 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.120
 for a year 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.120
 Rheine initially avoided developing these works 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.690
 It's about the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.690
 that's how 2020 came to us 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390
 he would like to have a choice from each country 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.760
 also wanted 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.270
 0 succeeded 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 Presentation that weighs in the wind 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.560
 I believe that we are together 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.539
 although working 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.000
 St 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 HJ 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 Stuttgart 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 First of all, we have to become ourselves 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.210
 of course, it would not be risk first, of course, first to masters in 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.300
 Augusta we do not quite know how we like the quality as well 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.700
 but instructors of the proposed collaboration used for their purposes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.850
 do while 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.430
 the pages become in the vegetable coach and I believe the final result only 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.040
 Sensory organ Polanco us, of course 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.090
 even though the second round according to Motorsport it was nice area one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.039
 Waldweg wanted to secure the Bundesliga 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.569
 hear it started haggling 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.659
 to create a car for the Geneva Motor Show 2020 was the task for the 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.490
 students 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.900
 the University of Volkswagen as part of its master's program Alexander Horn 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.929
 let's come up with ideas 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.059
 who the idea was to create a sporty business sedan or with 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.689
 the option for WILEX Inc and I just asked what is eBay what 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.310
 is common 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.690
 For Germanys most of his soldiers pub is the creation it should be very 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.349
 it should only be reduced 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.420
 significant characteristic feature will be seen on this blunder 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.609
 just these 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.609
 because it is simply typical of the Germaniest of his order 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.369
 to see them interested to see us 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.649
 Â«This is a German vehicle and we had very high recognition value 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:57.900
 these days 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.180
 They come from Korea and wanted to bring the tradition of their country into their model 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.519
 Coexistence and have for it 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.479
 the colors black and white are chosen why 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.609
 the color black and white are the right group to get caught 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.809
 Trouble sign 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.409
 more ready to go Korea is then very active and not around 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.530
 I'm planning on coming from OWL, the capital of Korea 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:27.649
 there are many around all menton of 13 time and 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.249
 the test persons today together 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:33.909
 therefore 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.759
 Antic Sum 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:40.579
 there I have the idea the concepts with coexistence percent means so many 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.579
 other things stay together in one 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.939
 4 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:06.419
 century
