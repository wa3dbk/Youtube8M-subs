00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
is only 16 millimeter but I could not

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.589

for<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:14.919> life<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.250> me<00:04:15.310> find<00:04:15.639> 16<00:04:16.090> millimeter

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
for the life of me find 16 millimeter

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.240 
for the life of me find 16 millimeter
glass<00:04:16.870> eyes<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:18.840> it's<00:04:19.840> not<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.229> bad<00:04:20.380> but<00:04:20.739> if

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
glass eyes so it's not that bad but if

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.800 
glass eyes so it's not that bad but if
you<00:04:21.400> hit<00:04:21.579> him<00:04:21.700> at<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.820> certain<00:04:22.090> angle<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.630> looks

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
you hit him at a certain angle it looks

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.110 
you hit him at a certain angle it looks
kind<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.200> funny<00:04:25.050> okay<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:26.889> changed<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.820> I

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
kind of funny okay so changed and I

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.480 
kind of funny okay so changed and I
couldn't<00:04:28.360> decide<00:04:28.570> between<00:04:28.870> these<00:04:29.710> two<00:04:30.010> passes

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
couldn't decide between these two passes

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.930 
couldn't decide between these two passes
so<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.630> one<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.169> think<00:04:32.229> looks<00:04:33.039> cuter<00:04:33.700> but<00:04:33.910> I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
so this one I think looks cuter but I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.580 
so this one I think looks cuter but I
didn't<00:04:34.240> know<00:04:34.360> how<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.660> would<00:04:34.840> feel<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.139> guess<00:04:35.470> if

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
didn't know how it would feel I guess if

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.270 
didn't know how it would feel I guess if
it's<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:36.120> if<00:04:37.120> it's<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.510> pretty<00:04:37.750> good<00:04:38.260> but<00:04:39.130> i<00:04:39.190> also

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
it's it if it's a pretty good but i also

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.790
