00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.549
 Dr. Jose Maria Franco Gongora is 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.040
 plastic surgeon and belongs to the 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.469
 doctors the select circle of doctors from 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.599
 first level of Spain as an expert in 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 gynecomastia will explain the details 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.710
 of this surgery 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.050
 what is gynecomastia 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.150
 Gynecomastia is a process 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.070
 whereby the breast in the male is 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.440
 find this size increased 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.030
 increase in size usually 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.920
 produces at the expense of the gland 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.559
 mammary although sometimes also 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.160
 may be caused by an increase in 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.160
 fatty tissue 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.350
 why this increase occurs 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.469
 the increase in the size of the breasts in 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.379
 the male can be produced by multiple 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.600
 causes although the most frequent thing is that 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.359
 be of idiopathic nature that is to say of 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.070
 cause unknown in most of the 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.580
 males there is an increase in size 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.440
 glandular during adolescence what 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.320
 which ends up disappearing a few months 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.460
 later but it's at 10 percent of 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.149
 the males can remain the gland 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.640
 mammary without evolving in other cases 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.610
 we can also find that this 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.119
 Increased breast size occurs 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.179
 at the expense of fatty tissue this can 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.149
 be more frequent in patients who have 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.310
 had a significant loss of weight and 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.850
 whose fat has remained residual 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.929
 in the breast without disappearing 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.360
 concomitant with that loss of 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.030
 weight is also common in our 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.610
 environment observe increase in the size of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.289
 the breasts in those men who have 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.259
 consumed steroids or anabolics 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.700
 for muscle development and that of 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.710
 secondary form 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.829
 lead to the growth of the gland 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.360
 mammary has also seen that this 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.890
 growth is related to the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.890
 consumption of certain drugs 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.680
 what is an operation of 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.680
 gynecomastia 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.310
 the intervention of gynecomastia goes to 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:17.250
 basically depend 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.860
 I predominantly tissue has increased 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.080
 of size in the male's breast in the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.390
 cases in which patients present 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.130
 an increase in the gland usually 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.440
 a small incision is made in the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.410
 lower edge of the areola through 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.550
 which we performed the removal of the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.140
 excess gland 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.870
 in those patients where the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.900
 predominance of tissue augmentation be 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.780
 fatty type we will carry out a 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.610
 Liposuction however most 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.580
 patients present a component 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.570
 mixed in gynecomastia both glandular 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.280
 as fat so the technique more 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.810
 used is the combined technique of 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.480
 mastectomy 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.209
 and liposuction when we carry out 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.730
 only the liposuction said 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.360
 intervention can be carried out under the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.080
 ambulatory 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.690
 through local anesthesia and sedation 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.370
 however when we carry out a 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.990
 gland ect or mine or mastectomy 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.360
 subcutaneous associated with a liposuction 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.790
 It is recommended that the intervention be 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.460
 carry out under general anesthesia and at 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.050
 less with a night of income in these 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.100
 cases is usually placed a small 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.440
 drainage in the cavity that residual after 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.470
 the gland ect or mine that usually 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.690
 It is removed at 24 or 48 hours and 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.700
 subsequently in any of the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.160
 procedures either mastectomy or 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.530
 of liposuction the patient should carry 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.070
 a pledge of acupressure for 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.830
 promote the reabsorption of edema of the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.830
 inflammation and better result thanks 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.040
 to the retraction of the skin during 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.040
 approximately one month 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.930
 which patient is suitable for this 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.930
 intervention 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.660
 usually the patient who goes the most 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.920
 to benefit from this kind of 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.070
 intervention is usually a young patient 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.980
 whose ability to retract the skin 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.290
 is preserved and that you can get some 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.600
 better results both for the 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.680
 subcutaneous mastectomy as per the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.520
 Liposuction in patients who have suffered 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.960
 an important weight loss are going to 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.030
 experience a marked improvement in the 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.550
 aspect of your breasts but in many 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.860
 occasions auxiliary procedures are 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.850
 necessary to be able to get a good 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.110
 result since this skin has lost 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.110
 retraction capacity and sometimes 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.020
 it is necessary to carry out another type 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.440
 of techniques that involve remodeling 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.440
 of the breast
