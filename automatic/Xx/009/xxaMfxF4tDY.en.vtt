00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.020
 This is the Sony X 4 year Z which has new premium a waterproof top model 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:10.019
 if not with five but two teams your screen is natural 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.900
 the successor of this is based on daring to put it, and you see it too 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.400
 Clearly in the back we are seeing a few minor adjustments so found the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.119
 speakers that are located in other places and look like none at the back 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.109
 there he is again very little difference is still a large glass plate nrc.nl 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.069
 twenty comma seven megapixel camera 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.740
 after what it has really changed is the newspaper 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.490
 both sides we can see that yes is actually still the language 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.790
 that is but he is a bit spheres finished and that makes it 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.050
 device nice in your hand a poetry competition less in your hands 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.220
 as for example for lopez something the shorter the city that was fine was 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.250
 the other in addition, all connections are still with place 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.250
 finished because it is still watertight 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.420
 you can still find points on the corner here 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.400
 a special material that can absorb the shocks so should you unexpectedly 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.389
 fall 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:01.609
 then it is not immediately why or broken so that is a nice addition after it 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.850
 driving range that is on android 4 point 4 the latest version on this one 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.820
 you can play a beautiful sony again 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.409
 diesels recently made the updates which makes them all slightly tighter 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.060
 and that all runs nicely 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.509
 after all it runs very smoothly you can also very fast you also have or close 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.079
 do thanks to the quad core latest version of the star pull a quad core processor 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.320
 And yes like I said you actually have nowhere a moment that you think of that 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.480
 the device tragically 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.180
 so that is really a very nice addition 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.920
 after of course it is also the span year modes again 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.290
 so the so-called energy-saving mode that his son uses in his devices 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.000
 to build in 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.390
 and of course this mode is also further it did 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.360
 I have you the latest version of you can choose which yes which options which 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.710
 wants to turn off energy saving and the point here is 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.900
 but that at the moment that you can do everything with a two-day device 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.440
 so that is very painful 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.720
 even though they are still sitting, the twenty noise nuisance megapixel camera 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.259
 on 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.579
 and who can start arguing or clicking on the room icon 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.539
 those on the side of the device 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.149
 just hold down the camera button and then it will automatically turn on the camera 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.840
 starting up after what to see again is actually an intervention more often 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.260
 have seen sony devices 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.209
 we have different modes that we can use 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.909
 so you can download about additional modes if you for example manually 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.689
 you can set a lot of settings yourself you have the settings menu 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.400
 and you can also go to film and you can do filming in the maximum 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.310
 resolution of 4k so that will really not lay and very very high it has so can 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.770
 you also film a dozen behind p at 60 frames per second and with that 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.200
 all your movements are just a lot smoother now the z3 is available in 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.849
 different colors i got you the black version 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.690
 but also the copper version 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.849
 and it will be available in a number of other colors 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.639
 so there you can always find the model that suits you best 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.370
 does not know any more information or I play you say he or we go right 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:52.089
 to order 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.349
 Then go to a year or PB 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.809
 of course along one of our stores
