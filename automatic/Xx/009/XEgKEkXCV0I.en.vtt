00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.750
 shock 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.130
 I have to leave this helmet so 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.230
 had to sleep that everything tell you I leave 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.740

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.330
 made with the postage the helmet 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.370
 more the adapter because you too 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:09.280
 helmet is also the little headband the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.650
 critically in fact precisely that their 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.670
 rating on your forehead a little 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.750
 disgusting me I also think that there is 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.580
 something else but he did not have any more 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.870
 that's basically it will do you something 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.490
 like 116 dollars 116 euros in all in 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.700
 chests in addition she lives at home 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.330
 what frankly it's too good 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.090
 so nanou sassou thanks grand jacques 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:41.019
 veyrat paul i will stay 20 minutes 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.200
 under this headset and that's so I said 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.650
 basically this case it's actually in twenty 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.320
 minutes 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.980
 he laughs scrapes your driest hair 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.400
 in depth ideal for your pasta 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.080
 dry for the dry scalp and so 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.120
 without this steam and this gentle heat 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.380
 to the bottom of the skull is married 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.720
 frering here are the girls of whom I am 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.690
 leave free to the games of Athens 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.600
 plus it's not brilliant it's not 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.640
 noisy it helps russia 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.860
 a little steam noise I can stay there 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.430
 my darling we watch TV in these 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.320
 hens ok I'm this one managed with 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.220
 my little headband the four little ones 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.360
 halal duvets to go to the bisons and 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.110
 glasses that gives that so I come 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.160
 to just tell you why in fact 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.660
 what why is helmet reporting it 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.590
 a deep rotation 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.830
 basically the water vapor will allow 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.250
 to open the cuticles of the hair so 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.670
 once 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.200
 finally the heat that flows and 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.050
 you it's water vapor it's okay 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.800
 penetrate inside the cuticles and 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.800
 deeply hydrated your hair 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.840
 so that's after this kind of care 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:10.710
 do not forget to close the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:15.150
 scales with an acid ph so between 4.5 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.660
 and 5.5 or just with a jet of water 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.850
 cold 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.330
 here are the girls I tell you later 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.330
 lease 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:32.650
 but you have nothing 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:32.650
 there is no cost or e mail
