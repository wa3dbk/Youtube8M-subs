think this case
here<00:02:14.100> I'm<00:02:14.940> going<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.410> give<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.560> bag<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.220> tick

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
here I'm going to give this bag the tick

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.870 
here I'm going to give this bag the tick
I<00:02:17.730> would<00:02:18.540> say<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.290> real<00:02:19.980> Louis<00:02:20.550> Vuitton

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.500 
I would say this is a real Louis Vuitton
handbag<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:22.980> ruling<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.819> real

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
handbag so that's my ruling on it a real
