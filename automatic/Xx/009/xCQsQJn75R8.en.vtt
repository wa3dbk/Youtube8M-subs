00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.409

 The second village This village is also a big village , and there is a house in such a valley 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.790
 That's why 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.790
 I think this is also a bit unusual 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:10.220
 The village like this is in a very easy-to-understand position. 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.510

 It is said that there is a third village 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:55.090
 It's not such a small village, though 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:03:00.790
