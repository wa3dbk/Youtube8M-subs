00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.290 

what<00:00:01.930> a<00:00:01.960> wonderful<00:00:02.800> opportunity<00:00:03.009> to<00:00:03.699> see

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:04.300 
what a wonderful opportunity to see

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.889 
what a wonderful opportunity to see
almost<00:00:04.630> like<00:00:04.960> like<00:00:05.769> flowing<00:00:06.430> water<00:00:06.779> look<00:00:07.779> at

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899 
almost like like flowing water look at

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.259 
almost like like flowing water look at
these<00:00:08.139> I<00:00:08.470> don't<00:00:08.980> want<00:00:09.250> them<00:00:09.490> to<00:00:09.700> be<00:00:09.790> exactly

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269 
these I don't want them to be exactly

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.640 
these I don't want them to be exactly
the<00:00:10.450> same<00:00:10.480> as<00:00:10.839> this<00:00:10.990> because<00:00:11.200> it's

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
the same as this because it's

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.549 
the same as this because it's
complementary<00:00:12.490> and<00:00:12.610> contour<00:00:13.209> these<00:00:14.049> are<00:00:14.379> are

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
complementary and contour these are are

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.410 
complementary and contour these are are
a<00:00:14.620> little<00:00:15.549> different<00:00:15.940> it's<00:00:16.059> almost<00:00:16.240> like

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
a little different it's almost like

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.930 
a little different it's almost like
grains<00:00:16.780> of<00:00:17.020> wood<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:17.620> you'll<00:00:18.010> see<00:00:18.310> this<00:00:18.520> it's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
grains of wood and you'll see this it's

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.430 
grains of wood and you'll see this it's
just<00:00:19.030> a<00:00:19.240> little<00:00:19.360> bit<00:00:19.540> more<00:00:19.660> evident<00:00:20.110> with<00:00:20.230> him

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
just a little bit more evident with him

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.870 
just a little bit more evident with him
because<00:00:20.740> he's<00:00:20.860> got<00:00:21.010> a<00:00:21.070> little<00:00:21.280> darker<00:00:21.580> skin

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
because he's got a little darker skin

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.700 
because he's got a little darker skin
you<00:00:22.420> know<00:00:22.540> people<00:00:22.840> are<00:00:22.960> just<00:00:22.990> like<00:00:23.440> this

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
you know people are just like this

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.150 
you know people are just like this
everybody<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.880> so<00:00:25.210> different<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:27.130> might

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
everybody is so different and you might

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.800 
everybody is so different and you might
see<00:00:27.490> this<00:00:27.640> on<00:00:27.820> one<00:00:27.970> person<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.450> not<00:00:28.600> on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
see this on one person and not on

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.750 
see this on one person and not on
another<00:00:28.860> but<00:00:29.860> look<00:00:30.100> at<00:00:30.250> these<00:00:30.400> wonderful

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
another but look at these wonderful

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.880 
another but look at these wonderful
swirls<00:00:31.450> and<00:00:31.660> pay<00:00:32.079> attention<00:00:32.649> to<00:00:32.770> the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
swirls and pay attention to the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.729 
swirls and pay attention to the
direction<00:00:33.039> they're<00:00:33.609> going<00:00:33.789> and<00:00:34.589> even<00:00:35.589> though

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
direction they're going and even though

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.220 
direction they're going and even though
these<00:00:35.920> are<00:00:36.160> lines<00:00:36.460> they<00:00:37.120> still<00:00:37.629> have<00:00:37.960> those

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
these are lines they still have those

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.799 
these are lines they still have those
variances<00:00:39.129> and<00:00:39.399> so<00:00:40.030> this<00:00:40.239> becomes<00:00:40.659> a<00:00:40.780> great

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
variances and so this becomes a great

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.110 
variances and so this becomes a great
thing<00:00:41.350> too<00:00:41.649> because<00:00:42.280> just<00:00:42.550> like<00:00:42.909> with

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
thing too because just like with

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.060 
thing too because just like with
material<00:00:43.780> or<00:00:43.870> whatever<00:00:44.050> I<00:00:44.409> don't<00:00:44.679> want<00:00:45.010> to

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
material or whatever I don't want to

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.549 
material or whatever I don't want to
come<00:00:45.280> in<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:45.609> just<00:00:46.059> draw<00:00:46.359> either<00:00:47.289> I<00:00:47.409> don't

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
come in and just draw either I don't

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.899 
come in and just draw either I don't
want<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.890> just<00:00:48.069> draw<00:00:48.280> lines<00:00:48.609> like<00:00:49.030> this<00:00:49.359> and

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
want to just draw lines like this and

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.869 
want to just draw lines like this and
and<00:00:51.909> try<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.749> say<00:00:53.229> okay<00:00:53.890> well<00:00:54.159> that<00:00:54.339> represents

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
and try to say okay well that represents

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.239 
and try to say okay well that represents
my<00:00:54.999> skin<00:00:55.359> and<00:00:55.629> maybe<00:00:56.319> I'll<00:00:56.499> have<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.679> few<00:00:56.979> polka

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
my skin and maybe I'll have a few polka

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.119 
my skin and maybe I'll have a few polka
dots<00:00:57.519> along<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:57.999> way<00:00:58.149> I<00:00:58.420> can<00:00:59.409> come<00:00:59.679> in<00:00:59.859> more

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
dots along the way I can come in more

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.170 
dots along the way I can come in more
like<00:01:00.399> something<00:01:00.729> like<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.969> can

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
like something like this and I can

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.539 
like something like this and I can
create<00:01:04.799> something<00:01:05.799> that's<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.219> little<00:01:06.369> more

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
create something that's a little more

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.969 
create something that's a little more
general<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.240> this<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.380> something<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.799> can

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
general and this is something I can

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.999 
general and this is something I can
build<00:01:09.159> on<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.579> don't<00:01:10.119> have<00:01:10.329> a<00:01:10.479> line<00:01:10.869> but<00:01:11.860> I'm

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
build on I don't have a line but I'm

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.340 
build on I don't have a line but I'm
allowing<00:01:12.399> for<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.450> texture<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.079> all<00:01:14.170> the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
allowing for the texture and all the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.580 
allowing for the texture and all the
different<00:01:14.619> facets<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.310> skin<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.590> then

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
different facets of the skin and then

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.069 
different facets of the skin and then
believe<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.369> or<00:01:18.490> not<00:01:18.579> this<00:01:18.939> is<00:01:19.149> exactly<00:01:19.810> like

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
believe it or not this is exactly like

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.230 
believe it or not this is exactly like
we<00:01:20.289> were<00:01:20.439> addressing<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.979> little<00:01:21.189> bit<00:01:21.310> ago<00:01:21.520> it's

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
we were addressing a little bit ago it's

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.800 
we were addressing a little bit ago it's
the<00:01:22.630> same<00:01:23.289> thing<00:01:23.619> as<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.329> where<00:01:25.329> I<00:01:25.360> have<00:01:25.780> a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
the same thing as this where I have a

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.410 
the same thing as this where I have a
facet<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.619> actually<00:01:26.890> have<00:01:27.490> enough<00:01:28.270> of

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
facet and I actually have enough of

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.270 
facet and I actually have enough of
dimension<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.170> each<00:01:29.350> one<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.649> those<00:01:29.740> facets

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
dimension to each one of those facets

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.980 
dimension to each one of those facets
that<00:01:30.759> there<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.119> light<00:01:31.359> direction<00:01:31.810> there's

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
that there is a light direction there's

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.810 
that there is a light direction there's
a<00:01:32.079> place<00:01:32.380> where<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.710> light<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.950> hitting<00:01:33.280> it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
a place where the light is hitting it

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.090 
a place where the light is hitting it
more<00:01:33.969> intensely<00:01:34.420> on<00:01:34.659> that<00:01:34.840> side<00:01:35.079> on<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.979> other

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
more intensely on that side on the other

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.819 
more intensely on that side on the other
side<00:01:36.399> it's<00:01:36.609> more<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.000> shadow<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.689> there<00:01:38.619> are

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
side it's more of a shadow and there are

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.279 
side it's more of a shadow and there are
actually<00:01:39.609> little<00:01:39.820> shadows<00:01:40.270> within<00:01:40.659> any<00:01:41.140> one

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
actually little shadows within any one

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.969 
actually little shadows within any one
of<00:01:41.469> these<00:01:41.680> facets<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.740> really

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
of these facets and so it's really

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.819 
of these facets and so it's really
important<00:01:45.579> for<00:01:45.759> us<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.450> be<00:01:46.570> able<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.840> realize

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
important for us to be able to realize

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.560 
important for us to be able to realize
that<00:01:48.070> when<00:01:48.219> I'm<00:01:48.340> when<00:01:48.820> I'm<00:01:48.939> doing<00:01:49.329> these

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
that when I'm when I'm doing these

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.459 
that when I'm when I'm doing these
things<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:52.090> want<00:01:52.929> to<00:01:53.020> come<00:01:53.170> up<00:01:53.320> with

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
things and I I want to come up with

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.580 
things and I I want to come up with
something<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.130> shows<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:55.149> an<00:01:55.329> arc<00:01:55.780> oh<00:01:56.079> I

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
something that shows it an arc oh I

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.190 
something that shows it an arc oh I

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
guess oh I'm Way over here I'm showing

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.219 
guess oh I'm Way over here I'm showing
something<00:01:59.710> that<00:02:00.009> has<00:02:00.249> an<00:02:00.549> art<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
something that has an art to it that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.830 
something that has an art to it that
it's<00:02:05.229> random<00:02:05.740> enough<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:06.939> can<00:02:07.179> allow<00:02:07.450> for

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it's random enough that I can allow for

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.649 
it's random enough that I can allow for
skin<00:02:08.229> texture<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:08.800> pores<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.879> all<00:02:10.390> those

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
skin texture and pores and all those

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.240 
skin texture and pores and all those
things<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.140> there<00:02:11.349> some<00:02:11.620> who<00:02:11.830> might<00:02:12.010> be<00:02:12.220> a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
things in there some who might be a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.050 
things in there some who might be a
little<00:02:12.400> larger

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
little larger

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.530 
little larger
but<00:02:13.599> if<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:13.930> some<00:02:14.319> value<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:14.770> here<00:02:15.510> then<00:02:16.510> I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
but if I get some value on here then I

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.120 
but if I get some value on here then I
can<00:02:16.870> start<00:02:17.080> doing<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.440> same<00:02:17.650> thing<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.010> was

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
can start doing the same thing I was

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.130 
can start doing the same thing I was
talking<00:02:18.280> about<00:02:18.730> here<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.599> same<00:02:19.810> thing<00:02:19.840> I'm

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
talking about here I can come in and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.059

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
lift off a little bit of it I don't have

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.740 
lift off a little bit of it I don't have
to<00:02:26.739> get<00:02:27.040> every<00:02:27.489> little<00:02:27.760> thing<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.270> begin<00:02:28.540> with

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
to get every little thing to begin with

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.750 
to get every little thing to begin with
I<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.470> want<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> get<00:02:29.800> something<00:02:30.099> on<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
I just want to get something on the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.330 
I just want to get something on the
paper<00:02:31.050> initially<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.130> start

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
paper initially so that I can start

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.699 
paper initially so that I can start
developing<00:02:33.519> enough<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.420> facet<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.500> can

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
developing enough of a facet that I can

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.490 
developing enough of a facet that I can
start<00:02:35.950> seeing<00:02:36.280> what<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.330> shaded<00:02:37.780> side<00:02:37.810> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
start seeing what is the shaded side and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.610 
start seeing what is the shaded side and
what<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.700> bright<00:02:39.940> side<00:02:40.269> am<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.200> going<00:02:41.410> to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
what is the bright side am I going to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.440 
what is the bright side am I going to
have<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.830> separate<00:02:42.790> these<00:02:42.970> with<00:02:43.180> clean<00:02:43.420> lines

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
have to separate these with clean lines

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.009 
have to separate these with clean lines
boy<00:02:44.440> some<00:02:44.739> of<00:02:44.860> these<00:02:44.980> are<00:02:45.190> pretty<00:02:45.459> clean<00:02:46.019> some

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
boy some of these are pretty clean some

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.130 
boy some of these are pretty clean some
of<00:02:47.049> these<00:02:47.260> are<00:02:47.440> pretty<00:02:47.940> definite<00:02:48.940> here<00:02:49.299> but<00:02:49.840> on

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
of these are pretty definite here but on

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.380 
of these are pretty definite here but on
the<00:02:50.739> other<00:02:50.860> hand<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.489> don't<00:02:51.549> want<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:52.000> get<00:02:52.150> so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
the other hand I don't want to get so

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.680 
the other hand I don't want to get so
carried<00:02:52.630> away<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.299> bunch<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
carried away that I just have a bunch of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
carried away that I just have a bunch of
lines<00:02:55.930> again<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.280> want<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:57.819> very<00:02:57.970> careful

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710
