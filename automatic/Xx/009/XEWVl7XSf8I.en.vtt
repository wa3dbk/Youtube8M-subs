for<00:00:10.930> another<00:00:11.080> minecraft<00:00:11.320> tutorial<00:00:11.680> this<00:00:12.309> time

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
for another minecraft tutorial this time

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.980 
for another minecraft tutorial this time
we're<00:00:12.700> talking<00:00:12.790> about<00:00:13.030> item<00:00:13.389> activated

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
we're talking about item activated

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.170 
we're talking about item activated
redstone<00:00:14.700> that's<00:00:15.700> right<00:00:15.880> we're<00:00:16.029> talking

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
redstone that's right we're talking

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.839 
redstone that's right we're talking
about<00:00:16.390> zelda<00:00:16.779> dungeon<00:00:17.110> keys<00:00:17.349> again<00:00:17.920> that's

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
about zelda dungeon keys again that's

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.640 
about zelda dungeon keys again that's
because<00:00:19.150> my<00:00:19.300> previous<00:00:19.689> design<00:00:20.020> of<00:00:20.290> zelda

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
because my previous design of zelda

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.230 
because my previous design of zelda
dungeon<00:00:20.949> keys<00:00:21.130> were<00:00:21.310> actually<00:00:21.670> patched<00:00:21.939> out

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
dungeon keys were actually patched out

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.609 
dungeon keys were actually patched out
in<00:00:22.570> 1.3<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:23.890> this<00:00:24.730> is<00:00:24.880> just<00:00:25.090> an<00:00:25.210> alternative<00:00:25.810> it

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
in 1.3 so this is just an alternative it

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.730 
in 1.3 so this is just an alternative it
has<00:00:26.800> some<00:00:27.039> pros<00:00:27.340> some<00:00:27.670> cons<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:28.180> it<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:29.439> i

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
has some pros some cons to it but i

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.500 
has some pros some cons to it but i
thought<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.250> know<00:00:30.340> why<00:00:30.580> not<00:00:30.730> make<00:00:31.269> another

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
thought you know why not make another

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.840 
thought you know why not make another
alternative<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:32.349> what<00:00:33.280> i'm<00:00:33.370> gonna<00:00:33.460> do<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:33.699> just

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
alternative so what i'm gonna do is just

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.240 
alternative so what i'm gonna do is just
give<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.390> quick<00:00:34.780> visual<00:00:35.470> of<00:00:35.769> how<00:00:35.890> they<00:00:36.040> work

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
give you a quick visual of how they work

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.219 
give you a quick visual of how they work
again<00:00:36.820> ivory<00:00:37.210> textured<00:00:37.629> some<00:00:37.839> of<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.049> items

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
again ivory textured some of the items

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:39.750 
again ivory textured some of the items
and<00:00:38.589> some<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.949> blocks<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.400> help<00:00:39.549> visualize

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
and some of the blocks to help visualize

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.880 
and some of the blocks to help visualize
it<00:00:40.269> a<00:00:40.449> little<00:00:40.780> bit<00:00:40.960> better<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:41.440> this<00:00:41.620> here<00:00:41.860> is

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
it a little bit better so this here is

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.090 
it a little bit better so this here is
actually<00:00:42.339> coal<00:00:42.720> and<00:00:43.720> this<00:00:44.409> one<00:00:44.620> here<00:00:44.890> is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
actually coal and this one here is

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.210 
actually coal and this one here is
actually<00:00:45.370> an<00:00:45.640> ender<00:00:45.879> eye<00:00:46.470> and<00:00:47.470> that<00:00:48.040> one's

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
actually an ender eye and that one's

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.039 
actually an ender eye and that one's
glitching<00:00:48.549> out<00:00:48.640> that's<00:00:49.360> fun

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
glitching out that's fun

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.350 
glitching out that's fun
okay<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:50.769> first<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.790> all<00:00:52.260> here's<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.500> old<00:00:53.739> coal

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
okay so first of all here's the old coal

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.149 
okay so first of all here's the old coal
activated<00:00:55.360> redstone<00:00:57.330> tada<00:00:58.559> okay<00:00:59.559> so<00:00:59.619> for<00:01:00.040> some

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
activated redstone tada okay so for some

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.859 
activated redstone tada okay so for some
reason<00:01:00.190> i<00:01:00.489> have<00:01:00.519> infinite<00:01:01.059> amount<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.540> coal

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869 
reason i have infinite amount of coal

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:03.869 
reason i have infinite amount of coal
that<00:01:01.900> was<00:01:02.439> supposed<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.860> disappear<00:01:03.159> when<00:01:03.850> i

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
that was supposed to disappear when i

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.460 
that was supposed to disappear when i
used<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.390> but<00:01:04.570> i<00:01:04.629> think<00:01:04.900> because<00:01:05.049> i<00:01:05.290> used

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
used it but i think because i used

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.620 
used it but i think because i used
creative<00:01:05.979> or<00:01:06.159> something<00:01:06.549> and<00:01:07.150> accidentally

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
creative or something and accidentally

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.920 
creative or something and accidentally
glitched<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.620> thats<00:01:08.800> infinite<00:01:09.310> but<00:01:10.210> that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
glitched it so thats infinite but that

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.190 
glitched it so thats infinite but that
coal<00:01:11.200> was<00:01:11.410> supposed<00:01:11.620> to<00:01:11.680> disappear<00:01:11.980> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
coal was supposed to disappear and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.390 
coal was supposed to disappear and
activate<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:14.590> door

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.160 

so<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.540> regular<00:01:24.810> old

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so you think this is just a regular old

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.550 
so you think this is just a regular old
patch<00:01:25.410> of<00:01:25.590> sand<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:26.240> well<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.510> have<00:01:28.290> my

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
patch of sand right well I have my

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
patch of sand right well I have my
trusty<00:01:29.870> secondary<00:01:30.870> key<00:01:31.760> this<00:01:32.760> is<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.060> second

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
trusty secondary key this is my second

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
trusty secondary key this is my second
tier<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.660> key<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.830> ender<00:01:35.640> eye

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
tier of key this is the ender eye

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.210 
tier of key this is the ender eye
version<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.410> this<00:01:37.530> ender<00:01:37.830> eye<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
version if I put this ender eye in the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.280 
version if I put this ender eye in the
end<00:01:38.340> portal<00:01:38.729> watch<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.750> happens

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
end portal watch what happens

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.750 
end portal watch what happens
oh<00:01:43.430> look<00:01:44.430> at<00:01:44.580> that

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
oh look at that

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760 
oh look at that
it<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.660> actually<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.229> kid<00:01:46.410> in<00:01:46.500> staircase

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it was actually a kid in staircase

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.330 
it was actually a kid in staircase
that's<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:47.970> awesome<00:01:48.860> basically<00:01:49.860> both<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that's pretty awesome basically both the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.660 
that's pretty awesome basically both the
systems<00:01:50.729> work<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.300> essentially<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.960> same<00:01:52.080> way

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
systems work in essentially the same way

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.219 
systems work in essentially the same way
insert<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> key<00:01:54.000> into<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.240> designated<00:01:54.479> area

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
insert the key into the designated area

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.520 
insert the key into the designated area
and<00:01:55.530> activate<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.610> sort<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> redstone<00:01:57.530> they

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and activate some sort of redstone they

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.350 
and activate some sort of redstone they
do<00:01:58.590> however<00:01:59.130> use<00:01:59.399> different<00:01:59.820> methods<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
do however use different methods to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.340 
do however use different methods to
achieving<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.930> school

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
achieving the school

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.320 
achieving the school
first<00:02:02.340> let's<00:02:02.550> start<00:02:02.610> off<00:02:02.850> with<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> coal

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
first let's start off with the coal

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.930 
first let's start off with the coal
activated<00:02:03.960> redstone<00:02:04.410> this<00:02:05.130> design<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.670> fairly

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
activated redstone this design is fairly

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.940 
activated redstone this design is fairly
similar<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.720> previous<00:02:06.750> design<00:02:07.440> in<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.830> it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
similar to my previous design in that it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.279 
similar to my previous design in that it
uses<00:02:08.190> both<00:02:08.340> coal<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.000> powered<00:02:09.570> mine<00:02:09.780> carts<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
uses both coal and powered mine carts to

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.130 
uses both coal and powered mine carts to
function<00:02:11.180> aesthetically<00:02:12.180> it's<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.660> quite<00:02:12.989> as

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
function aesthetically it's not quite as

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.500 
function aesthetically it's not quite as
sharp<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.190> also<00:02:14.370> much<00:02:14.730> easier<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.209> set

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
sharp but it's also much easier to set

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.140 
sharp but it's also much easier to set
up<00:02:15.540> requires<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.470> lot<00:02:16.770> less<00:02:16.980> space<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.489> it's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
up requires a lot less space and it's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.590 
up requires a lot less space and it's
quieter<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:20.130> order<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.520> build<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.850> basic<00:02:21.030> module

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
quieter in order to build a basic module

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.130 
quieter in order to build a basic module
you'll<00:02:22.110> need<00:02:22.320> these<00:02:22.650> basic<00:02:23.310> items<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.959> you'll

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
you'll need these basic items so you'll

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.500 
you'll need these basic items so you'll
need<00:02:25.700> some<00:02:26.700> blocks<00:02:27.680> powered<00:02:28.680> my<00:02:29.610> powered<00:02:30.299> rail

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
need some blocks powered my powered rail

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.130 
need some blocks powered my powered rail
a<00:02:30.810> rail<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.070> actually<00:02:32.280> forgot<00:02:32.880> mine<00:02:33.870> cart

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
a rail and I actually forgot mine cart

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.800 
a rail and I actually forgot mine cart
as<00:02:34.230> well<00:02:34.380> minecart<00:02:35.010> with<00:02:35.130> furnace<00:02:35.810> you'll

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
as well minecart with furnace you'll

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.920 
as well minecart with furnace you'll
need<00:02:37.049> as<00:02:37.890> well<00:02:38.250> some<00:02:38.670> redstone<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.600> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
need as well some redstone and a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.280 
need as well some redstone and a
redstone<00:02:40.200> torch<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> what<00:02:42.750> you'll<00:02:42.900> want<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.140> do

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
redstone torch so what you'll want to do

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.560 
redstone torch so what you'll want to do
is<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.860> put<00:02:44.130> two<00:02:44.340> blocks<00:02:44.489> right<00:02:44.820> there<00:02:46.340> some

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
is just put two blocks right there some

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.210 
is just put two blocks right there some
rail<00:02:48.570> there<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.739> going<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.920> be<00:02:50.070> your

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
rail there and this is going to be your

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.080 
rail there and this is going to be your
power<00:02:50.340> block<00:02:50.959> your<00:02:51.959> detector<00:02:52.380> block<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.910> then

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
power block your detector block and then

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.170 
power block your detector block and then
right<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.989> going<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.440> be<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:55.799> evil<00:02:59.180> and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
right here is going to be here evil and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.539 
right here is going to be here evil and
then<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.079> want<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.290> put<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.709> furnace

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
then you just want to put the furnace

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.020 
then you just want to put the furnace
right<00:03:02.700> there<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:04.350> if<00:03:04.860> you'll<00:03:05.130> notice<00:03:05.220> if<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.820> put

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
right there so if you'll notice if I put

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.289 
right there so if you'll notice if I put
my<00:03:06.209> mouse<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:07.230> area<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:08.070> though<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
my mouse in this area here though the

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.000 
my mouse in this area here though the
outline<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.840> block<00:03:10.110> actually<00:03:10.350> disappears

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
outline on the block actually disappears

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.370 
outline on the block actually disappears
because<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:12.269> actually<00:03:12.450> selecting<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
because it's actually selecting the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.740 
because it's actually selecting the
furnace<00:03:13.709> minecart<00:03:14.280> because<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.390> slightly

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
furnace minecart because it's slightly

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.170 
furnace minecart because it's slightly
bigger<00:03:16.079> than<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> block<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.220> protrudes<00:03:17.730> even

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
bigger than a block and protrudes even

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.970 
bigger than a block and protrudes even
though<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.420> not<00:03:18.570> visible<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.530> protrudes

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
though it's not visible it protrudes

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.720 
though it's not visible it protrudes
from<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> block<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.930> way<00:03:22.519> you'll<00:03:23.519> be<00:03:23.579> able

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
from the block that way you'll be able

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.990 
from the block that way you'll be able
to<00:03:24.060> actually<00:03:24.980> activate<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.130> with<00:03:26.280> coal<00:03:26.549> even

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
to actually activate it with coal even

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.400 
to actually activate it with coal even
though<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.180> can't<00:03:27.510> see<00:03:27.600> it

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.100 

and<00:03:30.500> when<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.310> does<00:03:31.490> become<00:03:31.850> active<00:03:32.270> it'll

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
and when it does become active it'll

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.760 
and when it does become active it'll
activate<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.270> line<00:03:35.270> and<00:03:35.630> be<00:03:36.170> power<00:03:36.440> that

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
activate that line and be power that

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.720 
activate that line and be power that
torch<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:38.240> let's<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.410> see<00:03:40.040> what<00:03:40.190> happens

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.260 

there<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.820> go<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:46.610> may<00:03:46.730> be<00:03:46.790> asking<00:03:47.210> yourself

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
there you go you may be asking yourself

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.980 
there you go you may be asking yourself
why<00:03:48.050> does<00:03:48.260> this<00:03:48.410> need<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.680> be<00:03:48.830> inclined<00:03:49.990> that's

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
why does this need to be inclined that's

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.100 
why does this need to be inclined that's
because<00:03:51.500> if<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.400> just<00:03:52.820> have<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.210> flat<00:03:53.540> if<00:03:54.020> you

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
because if you just have it flat if you

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.660 
because if you just have it flat if you
just<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.500> flat<00:03:54.740> with<00:03:54.770> some<00:03:55.220> detector

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
just have it flat with some detector

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.970 
just have it flat with some detector
rail<00:03:55.850> you<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.210> actually<00:03:56.440> push<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:57.680> through

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
rail you can actually push this through

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.420 
rail you can actually push this through
the<00:03:58.130> block<00:03:59.110> so<00:04:00.110> when<00:04:00.260> I'm<00:04:00.410> colliding<00:04:00.980> here<00:04:01.220> I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
the block so when I'm colliding here I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.090 
the block so when I'm colliding here I
could<00:04:01.790> actually<00:04:01.970> be<00:04:02.330> pushing<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.140> minecart

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
could actually be pushing the minecart

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.510 
could actually be pushing the minecart
over<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:04.730> on<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.210> detector<00:04:05.960> rail<00:04:06.140> so

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
over and on to the detector rail so

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.160 
over and on to the detector rail so
having<00:04:07.520> it<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.210> it<00:04:08.540> will<00:04:08.660> always<00:04:08.840> come

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
having it like this it will always come

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.500 
having it like this it will always come
back<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.590> its<00:04:09.710> original<00:04:09.800> position<00:04:10.370> so<00:04:10.850> you'll

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
back to its original position so you'll

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.180 
back to its original position so you'll
still<00:04:11.720> be<00:04:11.900> able<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.170> feed<00:04:12.440> coal<00:04:12.710> through<00:04:13.010> this

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
still be able to feed coal through this

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.560 
still be able to feed coal through this
little<00:04:13.520> slot<00:04:13.760> right<00:04:13.790> here<00:04:16.330> another<00:04:17.330> thing

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
little slot right here another thing

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.240 
little slot right here another thing
when<00:04:17.690> you're<00:04:17.840> building<00:04:18.020> this<00:04:18.320> is<00:04:18.620> if<00:04:18.920> you<00:04:19.040> put

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
when you're building this is if you put

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.729 
when you're building this is if you put
the<00:04:19.370> minecart<00:04:19.820> down<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.360> push<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.780> down<00:04:20.810> often

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
the minecart down and push it down often

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.740 
the minecart down and push it down often
what<00:04:21.890> can<00:04:22.040> happen<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:22.790> you'll<00:04:23.510> have<00:04:23.720> a

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
what can happen is this you'll have a

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.240 
what can happen is this you'll have a
little<00:04:24.020> bit<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.440> minecart<00:04:24.890> actually

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
little bit of the minecart actually

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.220 
little bit of the minecart actually
protruding<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.360> will<00:04:26.450> be<00:04:26.600> visual<00:04:26.990> through

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
protruding and it will be visual through

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.490 
protruding and it will be visual through
the<00:04:27.380> block<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:29.180> what<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.840> need<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.020> do<00:04:30.260> is

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
the block so what you need to do is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.430 
the block so what you need to do is
actually<00:04:30.710> place<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.340> directly<00:04:31.580> on<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.440> block

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
actually place it directly on the block

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.760 
actually place it directly on the block
and<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.220> should<00:04:34.640> oh<00:04:35.030> not<00:04:35.960> always<00:04:36.200> but<00:04:36.650> it

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
and it should oh not always but it

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.080 
and it should oh not always but it
should<00:04:37.070> make<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:39.140> disappear<00:04:39.920> there<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:40.910> go

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
should make it disappear there you go

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.820 
should make it disappear there you go
sometimes<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.110> might<00:04:42.200> have<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.410> try<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.740> a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
sometimes you might have to try it a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.140 
sometimes you might have to try it a
couple<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:43.160> times<00:04:43.340> just<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.700> make<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.880> work

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
couple of times just to make it work

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.310 
couple of times just to make it work
right<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:47.000> ender<00:04:47.300> Aiki<00:04:47.660> system<00:04:48.080> actually

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
right the ender Aiki system actually

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.130 
right the ender Aiki system actually
works<00:04:48.680> off<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.160> bud<00:04:49.340> switch<00:04:49.700> in<00:04:50.480> this<00:04:50.720> case<00:04:50.960> I

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
works off of a bud switch in this case I

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.960 
works off of a bud switch in this case I
just<00:04:51.350> used<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.710> water<00:04:51.890> bud<00:04:52.310> switch<00:04:52.580> because

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
just used a water bud switch because

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.659 
just used a water bud switch because
it's<00:04:53.180> very<00:04:53.390> simple<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.140> it's<00:04:54.890> easy<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.430> fit

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
it's very simple and it's easy to fit

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.900 
it's very simple and it's easy to fit
into<00:04:56.150> small<00:04:56.660> places<00:04:56.980> so<00:04:57.980> I'll<00:04:58.340> quickly<00:04:58.520> show

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
into small places so I'll quickly show

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.600 
into small places so I'll quickly show
you<00:04:58.940> what<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.240> did<00:04:59.540> first<00:05:00.350> just<00:05:00.770> pick<00:05:01.280> out<00:05:01.400> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
you what I did first just pick out the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.830 
you what I did first just pick out the
place<00:05:01.790> that<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.060> want<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.330> put<00:05:02.480> your<00:05:02.570> end<00:05:02.750> of

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
place that you want to put your end of

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.320 
place that you want to put your end of
portal<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.550> directly<00:05:04.550> below<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.300> where

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
portal and directly below that is where

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.080 
portal and directly below that is where
you're<00:05:05.570> going<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.720> put<00:05:05.870> your<00:05:06.020> water<00:05:06.169> so<00:05:07.100> beside

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
you're going to put your water so beside

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.450 
you're going to put your water so beside
it<00:05:08.270> build<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:09.050> hole<00:05:09.260> that's<00:05:09.440> one<00:05:09.680> deep<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.220> then

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
it build a hole that's one deep and then

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.340 
it build a hole that's one deep and then
place<00:05:10.820> your<00:05:10.850> water<00:05:11.150> down<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:11.600> that<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.169> water

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
place your water down so that the water

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.220 
place your water down so that the water
flows<00:05:12.560> into<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.040> hole<00:05:13.690> beside<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.840> water<00:05:15.020> you

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
flows into the hole beside the water you

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.800 
flows into the hole beside the water you
want<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.530> place<00:05:15.980> another<00:05:16.790> hole<00:05:17.210> that's<00:05:17.540> too

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
want to place another hole that's too

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.750 
want to place another hole that's too
deep<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:19.210> that<00:05:20.210> way<00:05:20.419> once<00:05:21.080> this<00:05:21.440> end<00:05:22.340> portal

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
deep and that way once this end portal

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.640 
deep and that way once this end portal
becomes<00:05:23.090> updated<00:05:23.600> it<00:05:23.780> will<00:05:23.900> also<00:05:24.110> update<00:05:24.470> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
becomes updated it will also update the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.470 
becomes updated it will also update the
water<00:05:24.919> causing<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.669> water<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:26.060> flow<00:05:26.210> down<00:05:26.450> the

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
water causing the water to flow down the

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.420 
water causing the water to flow down the
hole<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.020> destroy<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.890> redstone<00:05:28.430> torch<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:30.430> in

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
hole and destroy a redstone torch and in

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.520 
hole and destroy a redstone torch and in
this<00:05:31.640> case<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.210> redstone<00:05:32.600> torch<00:05:32.750> is<00:05:33.230> just

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
this case the redstone torch is just

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.000 
this case the redstone torch is just
going<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:34.000> power<00:05:35.000> this<00:05:35.419> so<00:05:36.200> when<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.710> becomes

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
going to power this so when it becomes

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.940 
going to power this so when it becomes
destroyed<00:05:37.430> this<00:05:37.640> will<00:05:37.850> toggle<00:05:38.060> off<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.950> then

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
destroyed this will toggle off and then

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.879 
destroyed this will toggle off and then
just<00:05:39.979> use<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.460> blocks<00:05:40.729> to<00:05:41.390> decorate<00:05:42.200> around

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.420 

careful<00:05:45.889> not<00:05:46.010> to<00:05:46.280> update<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:47.360> block<00:05:47.630> or

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
careful not to update the block or

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.510 
careful not to update the block or
you'll<00:05:49.430> have<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.760> redo<00:05:50.030> it<00:05:53.830> alright<00:05:54.830> so<00:05:55.070> now

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
you'll have to redo it alright so now

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.219 
you'll have to redo it alright so now
it's<00:05:55.550> all<00:05:55.790> set<00:05:55.970> up<00:05:56.150> and<00:05:56.360> when<00:05:56.690> I<00:05:56.720> put<00:05:57.020> this

under I into the into the pedestal it

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.000 
under I into the into the pedestal it
will<00:06:01.490> cause<00:06:01.760> that<00:06:02.030> torch<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:02.540> go<00:06:02.810> out<00:06:03.760> tada

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
will cause that torch to go out tada

find<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:18.199> stronghold

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
find a stronghold

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.670 
find a stronghold
oh<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:20.240> that<00:06:20.330> one<00:06:20.449> broke<00:06:20.660> so<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.500> can

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
oh and that one broke so you can

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.400 
oh and that one broke so you can
actually<00:06:21.830> lose<00:06:22.130> them<00:06:22.370> permanently<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:24.289> way

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
actually lose them permanently the way

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.529 
actually lose them permanently the way
to<00:06:24.470> get<00:06:24.680> around<00:06:24.770> that<00:06:25.190> is<00:06:25.430> by<00:06:25.510> actually<00:06:26.510> using

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
to get around that is by actually using

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.629 
to get around that is by actually using
a<00:06:26.870> map<00:06:27.050> that<00:06:27.080> doesn't<00:06:27.680> have<00:06:27.830> any<00:06:27.979> strongholds

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
a map that doesn't have any strongholds

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.360 
a map that doesn't have any strongholds
in<00:06:28.729> them<00:06:29.030> so<00:06:29.930> what<00:06:30.590> you<00:06:30.680> need<00:06:30.860> to<00:06:30.979> do<00:06:31.130> is

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
in them so what you need to do is

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.520 
in them so what you need to do is
actually<00:06:31.610> start<00:06:31.850> your<00:06:32.210> map<00:06:32.419> with<00:06:32.870> a<00:06:33.169> place

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
actually start your map with a place

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.969 
actually start your map with a place
basic<00:06:33.949> flat<00:06:34.220> land<00:06:34.490> and<00:06:35.289> the<00:06:36.289> flat<00:06:36.500> lands<00:06:36.770> do

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
basic flat land and the flat lands do

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.950 
basic flat land and the flat lands do
not<00:06:37.130> have<00:06:37.310> any<00:06:37.490> end<00:06:37.789> portals<00:06:38.210> so<00:06:38.360> the<00:06:38.600> end<00:06:38.750> rise

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
not have any end portals so the end rise

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.750 
not have any end portals so the end rise
will<00:06:39.260> not<00:06:39.380> find<00:06:39.620> anything<00:06:39.949> so<00:06:40.280> you<00:06:40.340> won't<00:06:40.610> be

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
will not find anything so you won't be

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.080
