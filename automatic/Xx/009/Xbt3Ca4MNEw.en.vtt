00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
the crime flap sounds surprisingly

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.250 
the crime flap sounds surprisingly
smooth<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:06.910> pretty<00:03:07.910> much<00:03:07.970> any<00:03:08.270> given<00:03:08.990> review

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
think to install on this guitar they're

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.990 
think to install on this guitar they're
not<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.950> much<00:03:16.010> better<00:03:16.490> than<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.760> stock

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
not that much better than the stock

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520 
not that much better than the stock
pickup<00:03:17.420> SEC<00:03:17.570> shows<00:03:17.810> there<00:03:18.020> is<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.170> prize<00:03:18.500> for

pickup SEC shows there is a prize for

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.610 
pickup SEC shows there is a prize for
the<00:03:18.860> quality<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.400> stock<00:03:19.700> pickups<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:21.200> reminds

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
the quality of stock pickups it reminds

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.620 
the quality of stock pickups it reminds
me<00:03:21.710> a<00:03:21.740> lot<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.130> kind<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.550> JD<00:03:23.210> and<00:03:23.420> jazz

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
me a lot of kind of like a JD and jazz

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.840 
me a lot of kind of like a JD and jazz
sort<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.200> combo<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.130> think<00:03:25.370> most<00:03:25.640> people

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
sort of combo and I think most people

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.210 
sort of combo and I think most people
are<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.240> be<00:03:26.330> very<00:03:26.690> happy<00:03:27.050> with<00:03:27.440> these

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
are going to be very happy with these

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.800 
are going to be very happy with these
stock<00:03:28.580> pickups<00:03:29.060> they're<00:03:29.300> they're<00:03:29.600> very

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
stock pickups they're they're very

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.810 
stock pickups they're they're very
modern<00:03:30.290> sounding<00:03:30.740> had<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.040> lot<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.340> clarity<00:03:31.610> a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
modern sounding had a lot of clarity a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.120 
modern sounding had a lot of clarity a
lot<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.150> punch<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.780> they<00:03:33.680> don't<00:03:33.860> have<00:03:33.980> like

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
lot of punch that they don't have like

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.730 
lot of punch that they don't have like
that<00:03:34.870> vintage<00:03:35.870> kind<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.290> tone<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.560> just

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
that vintage kind of tone is just

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.860 
that vintage kind of tone is just
straight-up<00:03:37.370> modern<00:03:38.210> if<00:03:38.420> you're<00:03:38.570> doing<00:03:38.780> just

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
straight-up modern if you're doing just

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.420 
straight-up modern if you're doing just
hard<00:03:39.110> rock<00:03:39.260> or<00:03:39.440> metal<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.770> think<00:03:39.980> we'll<00:03:40.070> be<00:03:40.160> very

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
hard rock or metal I think we'll be very

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.410 
hard rock or metal I think we'll be very
happy<00:03:40.580> with<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.230> anyways<00:03:42.230> as<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:43.060> check<00:03:44.060> out<00:03:44.210> how

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
happy with it anyways as a check out how

00:03:44.420 --> 00:04:27.619 
happy with it anyways as a check out how
this<00:03:44.480> thing<00:03:44.570> sounds<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:45.260> heavy<00:03:45.770> distortion

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.790 

don't<00:04:28.629> even<00:04:28.750> ask<00:04:28.960> me<00:04:29.139> what<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.379> was

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
don't even ask me what that was

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800 
don't even ask me what that was
anyways<00:04:30.250> but<00:04:30.460> uh<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:31.060> crunch<00:04:31.360> lab<00:04:31.599> in<00:04:31.750> the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
anyways but uh the crunch lab in the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.420 
anyways but uh the crunch lab in the
bridge<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.349> think<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.710> really<00:04:33.009> good<00:04:33.129> fit<00:04:33.310> to

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
bridge I think is a really good fit to

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.809 
bridge I think is a really good fit to
this<00:04:33.520> guitar<00:04:34.860> it's<00:04:35.860> got<00:04:36.069> a<00:04:36.099> lot<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.370> Clarisse

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
this guitar it's got a lot of Clarisse

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.460 
this guitar it's got a lot of Clarisse
it's<00:04:37.030> very<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.659> I<00:04:37.690> said<00:04:37.900> before<00:04:38.020> it's<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:38.259> very

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
it's very like I said before it's a very

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.809 
it's very like I said before it's a very
smooth<00:04:38.949> sounding<00:04:39.840> distortion<00:04:40.840> which<00:04:41.819> is

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
smooth sounding distortion which is

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.330 
smooth sounding distortion which is
definitely<00:04:43.620> advantageous<00:04:44.620> for<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.069> kind<00:04:45.250> of

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
definitely advantageous for the kind of

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.439 
definitely advantageous for the kind of
sound<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.520> I'm<00:04:45.699> going<00:04:46.000> for

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
sound that I'm going for

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.749 
sound that I'm going for
it's<00:04:46.900> not<00:04:47.139> over-the-top<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:48.460> something

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
it's not over-the-top like something

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.249 
it's not over-the-top like something
like<00:04:48.909> a<00:04:48.940> dunking<00:04:49.479> distortion<00:04:49.930> is<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.139> actually

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
like a dunking distortion is I actually

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.629 
like a dunking distortion is I actually
have<00:04:50.620> another<00:04:50.830> guitar<00:04:51.190> with<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.370> Duncan

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
have another guitar with a Duncan

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.939 
have another guitar with a Duncan
distortion<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.229> definitely<00:04:53.229> prefer<00:04:53.379> this<00:04:53.770> a

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
distortion I definitely prefer this a

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.950 
distortion I definitely prefer this a
lot<00:04:54.190> better<00:04:54.550> although<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.210> did<00:04:55.389> try<00:04:55.599> the<00:04:55.629> crunch

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
lot better although I did try the crunch

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.100 
lot better although I did try the crunch
let<00:04:56.169> in<00:04:56.409> a<00:04:57.210> guitar<00:04:58.210> with<00:04:58.330> mahogany<00:04:58.659> I'm<00:04:58.930> not

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
let in a guitar with mahogany I'm not

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.129 
let in a guitar with mahogany I'm not
sure<00:04:59.349> how<00:04:59.530> much<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.770> like<00:04:59.949> it<00:05:00.130> with<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:00.580> but

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
sure how much I like it with that but

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.300 
sure how much I like it with that but
that<00:05:02.139> seemed<00:05:02.349> really<00:05:02.560> relevant<00:05:02.919> cuz<00:05:03.159> we're

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
that seemed really relevant cuz we're

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.860 
that seemed really relevant cuz we're
talking<00:05:03.819> about<00:05:03.880> this<00:05:04.090> no<00:05:04.240> are<00:05:04.270> we<00:05:04.419> anyway<00:05:04.780> is
