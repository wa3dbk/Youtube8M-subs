object that you're gluing in this case

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:39.770 
object that you're gluing in this case
we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:28.050> tacky<00:00:28.439> fabric<00:00:29.310> glue

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.760 

to<00:00:40.780> have<00:00:41.020> good<00:00:41.260> success<00:00:41.500> with<00:00:41.710> wet<00:00:42.160> glues<00:00:42.430> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to have good success with wet glues I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.750 
to have good success with wet glues I
recommend<00:00:45.270> putting<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.780> glue<00:00:47.640> squirting<00:00:48.640> the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
recommend putting the glue squirting the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.330 
recommend putting the glue squirting the
glue<00:00:48.940> on<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.600> bolt<00:00:50.110> cardboard<00:00:50.739> or<00:00:51.129> another

glue on a bolt cardboard or another

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.840 
glue on a bolt cardboard or another
paper<00:00:51.670> before<00:00:52.269> applying<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.820> you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
paper before applying it to what you

paper before applying it to what you
want<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.210> glue<00:00:55.449> down<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.800> we<00:00:56.949> want<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.280> get<00:00:57.430> just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
want to glue down so we want to get just

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.689 
want to glue down so we want to get just
enough<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.600> glue<00:00:58.839> on<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.170> back<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.920> adhere

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
enough of the glue on the back to adhere

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.270 
enough of the glue on the back to adhere
the<00:01:03.850> fabric<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.449> then<00:01:05.250> paste<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.460> down<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
the fabric and then paste it down so

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:18.779 
the fabric and then paste it down so
it's<00:01:09.520> made<00:01:09.930> especially<00:01:10.930> for<00:01:11.440> fabric<00:01:12.039> I<00:01:17.789> find

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
it's made especially for fabric I find

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.820 
it's made especially for fabric I find
it<00:01:18.970> helpful<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.420> rule<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:20.050> with<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.259> roller<00:01:20.560> and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
it helpful to rule it with a roller and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.410 
it helpful to rule it with a roller and
make<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.729> bonding<00:01:22.259> strong<00:01:23.259> if<00:01:24.100> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
make the bonding strong if that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.959 
make the bonding strong if that's
screwed<00:01:25.420> down

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.830 

I'll<00:01:32.509> cut<00:01:32.840> off<00:01:32.990> these<00:01:33.259> extra<00:01:33.530> little<00:01:34.840> fabric

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
I'll cut off these extra little fabric

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.690 
I'll cut off these extra little fabric
pieces<00:01:36.850> dries<00:01:38.829> cover<00:01:39.829> up<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.159> book<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:42.890> it's

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
pieces dries cover up the book so it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.240 
pieces dries cover up the book so it's
malleable<00:01:44.390> it's<00:01:45.319> technically<00:01:45.799> as<00:01:45.979> malleable

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
malleable it's technically as malleable

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.999 
malleable it's technically as malleable
kind<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.119> shifted<00:01:47.479> around<00:01:50.259> whereas<00:01:53.979> when<00:01:54.979> I

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
kind of shifted around whereas when I

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.059 
kind of shifted around whereas when I
use<00:01:55.459> the<00:01:55.759> mounting<00:01:56.719> film<00:01:56.899> on<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.469> piece<00:01:57.770> I

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
use the mounting film on this piece I

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.779 
use the mounting film on this piece I
can't<00:01:58.969> really<00:01:59.090> pick<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.539> up<00:01:59.659> and<00:02:00.579> say<00:02:01.579> oh<00:02:01.759> I

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
can't really pick it up and say oh I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:02.919 
can't really pick it up and say oh I
made<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.420> crooked

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
made it crooked

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.770 
made it crooked
I'll<00:02:03.109> rearrange<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:04.069> a<00:02:04.129> little<00:02:04.479> sometimes<00:02:05.479> we

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
I'll rearrange it a little sometimes we

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.719 
I'll rearrange it a little sometimes we
want<00:02:05.989> to<00:02:06.140> glue<00:02:06.319> something<00:02:06.860> that's<00:02:07.039> very<00:02:07.250> filmy

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
want to glue something that's very filmy

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.240 
want to glue something that's very filmy
and<00:02:07.939> lightweight<00:02:08.690> which<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.379> part<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.160> a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and lightweight which is a part of a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.210 
and lightweight which is a part of a
napkin<00:02:10.489> for<00:02:11.269> instance<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.530> I'm<00:02:12.709> going<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.920> peel

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
napkin for instance so I'm going to peel

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.630 
napkin for instance so I'm going to peel
the<00:02:13.489> napkin<00:02:13.940> apart<00:02:14.329> it's<00:02:14.599> three<00:02:14.959> fly<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.640> glue

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the napkin apart it's three fly and glue

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.350 
the napkin apart it's three fly and glue
this<00:02:16.910> down<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:18.890> my<00:02:19.280> piece<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.640> paper<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.239> it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
this down on my piece of paper and it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.979 
this down on my piece of paper and it's
very<00:02:20.629> fragile<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:24.220> guess<00:02:25.220> I'll<00:02:25.430> just<00:02:25.459> use

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
very fragile so I guess I'll just use

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.050 
very fragile so I guess I'll just use
gloss<00:02:26.989> gel<00:02:28.180> soft<00:02:29.180> gel<00:02:30.340> instead<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.519> putting<00:02:31.879> a

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
glue any one of these glues especially a

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.920 
glue any one of these glues especially a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
glue a layer of glue on my foundation

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.890 
glue a layer of glue on my foundation
and<00:02:51.730> then<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:53.060> drop<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.650> very<00:02:54.919> delicate

and then just drop the very delicate
paper<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.709> thee<00:02:57.919> of<00:02:58.220> course<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.090> crooked

paper on to thee of course it's crooked

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.610 
paper on to thee of course it's crooked
and<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.880> can<00:03:02.090> kind<00:03:02.359> of<00:03:02.419> feel<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.720> glue<00:03:03.200> coming

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
and I can kind of feel the glue coming

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.839 
and I can kind of feel the glue coming
through<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.130> I'm<00:03:04.250> going<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.459> roll<00:03:04.669> it<00:03:04.819> anyway

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
through but I'm going to roll it anyway

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.229 
through but I'm going to roll it anyway
so<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.150> adheres<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:09.459> was<00:03:10.459> really<00:03:11.000> going<00:03:11.150> to

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
so that it adheres I was really going to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.720 
so that it adheres I was really going to
be<00:03:11.359> accurate<00:03:11.569> I<00:03:11.900> might<00:03:12.109> draw<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.380> little<00:03:12.620> line

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
be accurate I might draw a little line

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.559 
be accurate I might draw a little line
around<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.690> size<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.349> napkin<00:03:16.069> piece<00:03:16.639> so

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
around the size of this napkin piece so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.839 
around the size of this napkin piece so
that<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.380> glue<00:03:18.590> doesn't<00:03:18.950> come<00:03:19.310> around<00:03:19.430> on<00:03:19.730> the

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
that the glue doesn't come around on the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.930 
that the glue doesn't come around on the
outside<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.569> that<00:03:21.260> there's<00:03:21.470> glue<00:03:21.940> around

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
outside of it that there's glue around

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.110 
outside of it that there's glue around
here<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:25.069> think<00:03:26.470> I'll<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.799> you<00:03:28.760> can<00:03:28.910> either

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
here so I think I'll just you can either

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.740 
here so I think I'll just you can either
just

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
just

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.430 
just
leave<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.680> extra<00:03:32.130> glue<00:03:32.930> or<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.140> can<00:03:34.290> also

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
leave that extra glue or you can also

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.610 
leave that extra glue or you can also
seal<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.250> by<00:03:35.460> putting<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.270> glue<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:37.170> gloss

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
seal it in by putting the glue the gloss

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.660 
seal it in by putting the glue the gloss
gel<00:03:37.980> or<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.550> soft<00:03:39.030> gel<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.540> top<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.370> it

you've<00:03:42.120> made<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.360> sandwich<00:03:42.900> with<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:46.880> glue<00:03:47.880> and

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
you've made a sandwich with the glue and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.300 
you've made a sandwich with the glue and

happens<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:31.140> bond<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.830> good<00:04:32.160> as<00:04:32.790> long

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.520 
happens and so that bond is good as long
as<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.360> enough<00:04:33.390> edge<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.169> flat

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
as you have enough edge to it on a flat

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.460 
as you have enough edge to it on a flat
surface<00:04:37.860> or<00:04:38.660> enough<00:04:39.660> meeting<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.260> both

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
surfaces now they're both clear pretty

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.440 
surfaces now they're both clear pretty
much<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.050> I'm<00:04:46.229> just<00:04:46.440> guessing<00:04:47.090> does<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.240> look

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
much so I'm just guessing does that look

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
much so I'm just guessing does that look
like<00:04:48.479> about<00:04:48.900> equal<00:04:49.350> yes<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:53.850> trick<00:04:54.120> is<00:04:54.330> to

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
like about equal yes the trick is to

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
like about equal yes the trick is to
make<00:04:55.470> sure<00:04:55.979> you<00:04:56.130> mix<00:04:56.460> them<00:04:56.640> up<00:04:56.820> really<00:04:57.390> well<00:04:58.490> so

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
make sure you mix them up really well so

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.300 
make sure you mix them up really well so
I<00:04:59.520> say<00:05:00.030> stir<00:05:00.540> them<00:05:00.690> up<00:05:00.840> first<00:05:01.140> right<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:02.040> count

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
I say stir them up first right and count

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.430 
I say stir them up first right and count
to<00:05:02.520> 50<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.270> I'm<00:05:06.479> just<00:05:06.660> going<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.930> increase<00:05:07.200> the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
to 50 so I'm just going to increase the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.310 
to 50 so I'm just going to increase the
point<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.800> contact<00:05:08.310> kind<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.320> haphazardly

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
point of contact kind of haphazardly

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.240 
point of contact kind of haphazardly
here<00:05:11.000> if<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.180> use<00:05:12.360> an<00:05:12.540> electric<00:05:13.050> sander<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.919> could

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
here if I use an electric sander I could

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.790 
here if I use an electric sander I could
get<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.430> nice<00:05:14.640> really<00:05:15.390> fast<00:05:15.830> help<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.729> so<00:05:18.800> here

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
get a nice really fast help and so here

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:28.130 
get a nice really fast help and so here
we<00:05:19.919> go<00:05:20.070> ready<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:20.460> put<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.600> epoxy<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:23.280> cork

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.460 

now<00:05:29.140> that's<00:05:29.410> plenty<00:05:30.390> any<00:05:31.390> kind<00:05:31.660> of<00:05:31.810> glue<00:05:32.230> that

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
now that's plenty any kind of glue that

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.550 
now that's plenty any kind of glue that
sticks<00:05:32.890> out<00:05:33.730> and<00:05:33.910> gets<00:05:34.800> along<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.980> edges<00:05:37.560> will

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
sticks out and gets along the edges will

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:47.159 
sticks out and gets along the edges will
be<00:05:38.740> shiny

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.229
