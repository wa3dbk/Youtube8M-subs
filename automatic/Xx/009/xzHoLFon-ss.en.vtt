machine that the lambreaux has been on

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.310 
machine that the lambreaux has been on
for<00:00:16.160> well<00:00:17.160> over<00:00:17.190> an<00:00:17.550> hour<00:00:18.050> you've<00:00:19.050> got<00:00:19.230> about

for well over an hour you've got about
five<00:00:20.240> second<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.480> pain<00:00:21.720> threshold<00:00:22.380> there

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
five second to pain threshold there

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.189 
five second to pain threshold there
that's<00:00:22.949> about<00:00:23.070> right<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:24.480> these<00:00:24.810> help

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that's about right on these help

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.189 
that's about right on these help
machines<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.830> totally<00:00:26.099> analog<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.960> just

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
machines of totally analog so you just

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
machines of totally analog so you just
have<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.560> live<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.580> machine<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.090> know

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
have to live with your machine and know

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.179 
have to live with your machine and know
your<00:00:30.449> machine<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:31.380> when<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.740> ready<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.040> use

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
your machine know when it's ready to use

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.340 
your machine know when it's ready to use
the<00:00:32.880> thermo<00:00:33.120> siphon<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.899> keeps<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the thermo siphon on this keeps the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.819 
the thermo siphon on this keeps the
group<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:35.340> stable<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.360> basically

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
group very stable so you basically

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.979 
group very stable so you basically
prepare<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:38.010> portafilter<00:00:38.309> walk<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.450> lock<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
prepare your portafilter walk up lock in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
prepare your portafilter walk up lock in
and<00:00:40.230> pull<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> shot<00:00:40.770> no<00:00:41.520> flushing<00:00:42.030> anything

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and pull the shot no flushing anything

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.040 
and pull the shot no flushing anything
else<00:00:42.570> required<00:00:43.520> this<00:00:44.520> type<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> group<00:00:45.390> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
else required this type of group this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.069 
else required this type of group this
has<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> curved<00:00:47.160> self<00:00:48.090> packing<00:00:48.600> dispersion

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
has a curved self packing dispersion

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.010 
has a curved self packing dispersion
screen<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.579> those<00:00:51.149> pretty<00:00:51.420> high<00:00:51.660> about

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
screen so we those pretty high about

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
screen so we those pretty high about
five<00:00:52.260> millimeters<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> top<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> when

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
five millimeters from the top and when

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119 
five millimeters from the top and when
you<00:00:54.120> walk<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.800> screen

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
you walk in it actually the screen

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
you walk in it actually the screen
kisses<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> top<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> coffee<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.840> makes<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
kisses the top of the coffee it makes it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
kisses the top of the coffee it makes it
a<00:00:58.230> nice<00:00:58.620> compact<00:00:59.489> cylinder<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.600> anyway<00:01:02.030> we're

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a nice compact cylinder so anyway we're

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
a nice compact cylinder so anyway we're
all<00:01:03.149> ready<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> go<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:04.619> come<00:01:04.860> down<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
all ready to go we come down with a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.160 
all ready to go we come down with a
lever<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.830> wait<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.310> little<00:01:08.520> bit

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
lever and we wait just a little bit

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.090 
lever and we wait just a little bit
we're<00:01:10.170> pre<00:01:10.560> infusing<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.720> one<00:01:12.720> bar<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:16.100> with

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
we're pre infusing at one bar and with

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.330 
we're pre infusing at one bar and with
these<00:01:17.250> machines<00:01:17.509> I'd<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.340> passive

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
these machines I'd like to do a passive

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.310 
these machines I'd like to do a passive
pre-infusion<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.630> there's<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> lever<00:01:22.799> goes<00:01:23.009> up

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
pre-infusion and there's a lever goes up

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.679 
pre-infusion and there's a lever goes up
that's<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:25.770> low<00:01:26.220> we'll<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> second

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that's a little low we'll do a second

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
that's a little low we'll do a second
pull<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.229> power<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> power

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
pull for the power we get a power

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.550 
pull for the power we get a power
pre-infusion<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> nice

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
pre-infusion and then we get a nice

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.600 
pre-infusion and then we get a nice
piston<00:01:32.280> pressure<00:01:33.439> for<00:01:34.439> our<00:01:34.530> pull<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
piston pressure for our pull that is the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.469 
piston pressure for our pull that is the
the<00:01:38.610> fame<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> lambreaux<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.890> see

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
the fame of lambreaux as you can see

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:50.160 
the fame of lambreaux as you can see
beautiful<00:01:42.479> crema<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:47.930> think<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
beautiful crema and I think that

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.910 
beautiful crema and I think that
looks<00:01:50.800> just<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:52.540> good<00:01:53.170> enough<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.700> drink
