00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
let's see if and get a shape and it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.830 
let's see if and get a shape and it
opens<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.240> just<00:02:40.270> hold<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.690> and

push right through it's really

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.380 
push right through it's really
convenient<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.700> then<00:02:42.790> once<00:02:42.970> again<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.270> know

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
convenient and then once again you know

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.570 
convenient and then once again you know
you<00:02:43.480> gots<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.720> little<00:02:43.960> lock<00:02:44.110> there<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.590> it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
you gots a little lock there so it's

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.800 
you gots a little lock there so it's
kind<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.850> high-tech<00:02:46.180> design<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.630> rides

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
kind of a high-tech design it rides

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.650 
kind of a high-tech design it rides
pretty<00:02:46.960> low<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.620> your<00:02:47.650> pocket<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.480> got

pretty low in your pocket and it's got
the<00:02:49.810> safety<00:02:50.080> obviously<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.040> want<00:02:51.190> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the safety obviously because you want to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.320 
the safety obviously because you want to
use<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.490> on<00:02:51.610> pretty<00:02:51.850> much<00:02:51.970> any<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.270> these

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
use that on pretty much any of these

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.910 
use that on pretty much any of these
assisted<00:02:53.170> opening<00:02:53.260> mouths<00:02:53.620> because<00:02:53.740> they

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
assisted opening mouths because they

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.160 
assisted opening mouths because they
open<00:02:54.240> almost<00:02:55.240> like<00:02:55.420> an<00:02:55.570> automatic<00:02:55.900> it's

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
open almost like an automatic it's

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.440 
open almost like an automatic it's
really<00:02:56.380> cool<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.120> said<00:02:58.240> there<00:02:58.420> are

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
really cool so like I said there are

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.850 
really cool so like I said there are
three<00:02:58.540> different<00:02:58.960> sizes<00:02:59.020> this<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.830> a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
three different sizes this this is a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.230 
three different sizes this this is a
medium<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.400> come<00:03:00.580> in<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> little<00:03:00.820> bit<00:03:01.000> smaller

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
medium that come in a little bit smaller

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.030 
medium that come in a little bit smaller
size<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> little<00:03:01.630> bit<00:03:01.810> larger<00:03:01.870> size<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.590> couple

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
size a little bit larger size a couple

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.230 
size a little bit larger size a couple
different<00:03:03.280> blade<00:03:03.430> shapes<00:03:03.700> they<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:03.940> spear

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
different blade shapes they have spear

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.360 
different blade shapes they have spear
points<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.780> think<00:03:05.170> drop<00:03:05.380> points<00:03:05.740> in<00:03:05.830> tanto<00:03:06.190> so

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
points I think drop points in tanto so

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.350 
points I think drop points in tanto so
be<00:03:06.520> sure<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.670> check<00:03:06.790> them<00:03:07.060> out<00:03:07.350> but<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:10.030> it's

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
be sure and check them out but it's it's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.510 
be sure and check them out but it's it's
really<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:11.830> everything<00:03:12.220> else<00:03:12.340> went

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
really a like everything else went
