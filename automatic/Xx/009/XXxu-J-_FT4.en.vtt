antennae

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.130 

I'm<00:02:43.140> falling<00:02:43.560> asleep<00:02:43.620> looks<00:02:44.459> like<00:02:44.609> a<00:02:44.640> truck

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
I'm falling asleep looks like a truck

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.860 
I'm falling asleep looks like a truck
one<00:02:46.140> bar<00:02:47.870> now<00:02:48.870> we're<00:02:49.079> on<00:02:49.170> what<00:02:49.379> four<00:02:50.040> bars<00:02:50.870> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
one bar now we're on what four bars and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:09.890 
one bar now we're on what four bars and
only<00:02:52.139> up<00:02:52.230> about<00:02:52.439> 30<00:02:52.680> seconds<00:02:53.719> 8045

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.619 

I<00:03:09.959> figure<00:03:10.920> that's<00:03:10.980> about<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> minute<00:03:11.640> looks

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
I figure that's about a minute looks

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.030 
I figure that's about a minute looks
like<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:12.870> talked<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.140> one<00:03:13.290> bar<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.769> I'm<00:03:13.860> going

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
like we talked to one bar and I'm going

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.800 
like we talked to one bar and I'm going
to<00:03:14.129> let<00:03:14.250> go<00:03:14.400> aside<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.030> let's<00:03:15.209> see<00:03:15.390> if<00:03:15.420> we<00:03:15.689> get

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
to let go aside and let's see if we get

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:28.010 
to let go aside and let's see if we get
that<00:03:15.989> bar<00:03:16.230> back<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.450> it's<00:03:18.629> on<00:03:18.930> back<00:03:19.140> down

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.940 

so<00:03:29.020> this<00:03:29.140> one<00:03:29.320> sitting<00:03:29.710> down<00:03:29.890> right<00:03:30.100> there<00:03:30.430> and

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
so this one sitting down right there and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.190 
so this one sitting down right there and
get<00:03:32.950> on<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.310> bar<00:03:33.520> so<00:03:33.970> looks<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.930> wasn't

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
get on the bar so looks like that wasn't

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.010 
get on the bar so looks like that wasn't
the<00:03:35.410> problems<00:03:35.830> like<00:03:36.070> we<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.630> lost<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.810> dark

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
the problems like we just lost the dark

is 2c minus five bars of that for still
well<00:03:48.700> we<00:03:48.910> know<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.480> not<00:03:49.630> because<00:03:49.990> of<00:03:50.020> me

holding<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.680> slides<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.130> not<00:03:51.280> holding<00:03:51.550> the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
holding the slides and not holding the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.760 
holding the slides and not holding the
side<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:51.970> phone<00:03:52.150> anymore<00:03:52.650> that's<00:03:53.650> just

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
side of the phone anymore that's just

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.040 
side of the phone anymore that's just
the<00:03:53.920> way<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.190> right<00:03:54.370> now<00:03:54.459> um<00:03:55.450> but<00:03:55.900> yeah

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
the way it is right now um but yeah

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.290 
the way it is right now um but yeah
looks<00:03:56.380> like<00:03:56.470> Oh<00:03:59.160> bars<00:04:00.160> back<00:04:00.370> anyway<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.180> it

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
looks like Oh bars back anyway so it

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.510 
looks like Oh bars back anyway so it
looks<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:01.540> i<00:04:02.200> guess<00:04:02.620> i<00:04:02.709> would<00:04:02.830> say<00:04:02.890> neither

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
looks like i guess i would say neither

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.310 
looks like i guess i would say neither
the<00:04:03.760> phones<00:04:03.970> have<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.450> reception<00:04:04.810> problem

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
the phones have the reception problem

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.470 
the phones have the reception problem
unless<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.709> count<00:04:05.890> one<00:04:06.550> bar<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.790> dropping<00:04:07.300> as

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
unless you count one bar of dropping as

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.670 
unless you count one bar of dropping as
the<00:04:08.470> problem<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.880> guess<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.500> well<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.590> don't

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
the problem so I guess that well I don't

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.020 
the problem so I guess that well I don't
know<00:04:11.800> exactly<00:04:12.220> what<00:04:12.400> we've<00:04:12.640> done<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.910> guess

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
know exactly what we've done I guess

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.699 
know exactly what we've done I guess
it's<00:04:13.330> up<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.480> Steve<00:04:13.930> Jobs<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.350> let<00:04:14.470> us<00:04:14.560> know

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
it's up to Steve Jobs and let us know

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.310 
it's up to Steve Jobs and let us know
what<00:04:14.739> exactly<00:04:15.100> going<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:16.140> hopefully<00:04:17.140> next

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
what exactly going on hopefully next

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.650 
what exactly going on hopefully next
week<00:04:17.560> we'll<00:04:17.799> have<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:17.950> fix<00:04:18.340> for<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.579> but<00:04:19.510> I

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
week we'll have a fix for that but I

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.720 
week we'll have a fix for that but I
guess<00:04:19.870> we<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.109> wait<00:04:20.140> until<00:04:20.320> then<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:21.669> is

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
guess we can wait until then this is

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.650 
guess we can wait until then this is
Savior<00:04:22.180> 1mm<00:04:22.660> for<00:04:22.870> Anthony<00:04:23.260> signing<00:04:23.560> out
