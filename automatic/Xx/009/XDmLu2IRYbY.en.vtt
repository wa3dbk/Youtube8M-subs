hearing that rise and again it's not a

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.770 
hearing that rise and again it's not a
very<00:00:57.400> big<00:00:57.430> field<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.150> it<00:00:58.239> doesn't<00:00:58.510> take<00:00:58.629> you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:44.390 

bottleneck

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:57.360 

then<00:03:45.400> too<00:03:55.019> okay<00:03:56.019> well<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> got<00:03:56.890> about<00:03:57.069> another

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
then too okay well I got about another

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.070 
then too okay well I got about another
45<00:03:57.819> minutes<00:03:58.239> here<00:03:58.480> before<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.780> got<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.019> get

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
45 minutes here before I got to get

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.410 
45 minutes here before I got to get
going<00:03:59.640> probably<00:04:00.640> won't<00:04:00.730> get<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.060> whole<00:04:01.239> field

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
going probably won't get the whole field

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.240 
going probably won't get the whole field
looked<00:04:01.750> but<00:04:02.019> hopefully<00:04:02.860> we'll<00:04:03.010> come<00:04:03.130> up<00:04:03.160> with

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
looked but hopefully we'll come up with

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.290 
looked but hopefully we'll come up with
something<00:04:03.489> else<00:04:05.550> okay<00:04:06.550> not<00:04:06.760> sure<00:04:06.819> what<00:04:07.180> I'm

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
something else okay not sure what I'm

very cone-shaped it's kind of pitted in
the<00:04:29.650> bottom<00:04:29.950> maybe<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:30.340> uh<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:32.040> don't<00:04:33.040> know

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
the bottom maybe it's uh I don't know

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.290 
the bottom maybe it's uh I don't know
I'm<00:04:35.110> sort<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.530> pestle<00:04:38.669> okay<00:04:39.669> we're<00:04:39.970> taking

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
I'm sort of a pestle okay we're taking

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.730 
I'm sort of a pestle okay we're taking
home<00:04:40.450> with<00:04:40.570> washing<00:04:40.870> up<00:04:40.990> we'll<00:04:41.350> get<00:04:41.440> back<00:04:41.590> to
