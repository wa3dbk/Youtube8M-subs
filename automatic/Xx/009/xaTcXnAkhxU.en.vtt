00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the armor so a little bit confused about

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.969 
the armor so a little bit confused about
that<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.780> could<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.320> called<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> white

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that one could have called it the white

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.040 
that one could have called it the white
with<00:02:08.250> red<00:02:08.490> bits<00:02:08.819> riding<00:02:09.390> crane<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.899> have

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
with red bits riding crane would have

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.380 
with red bits riding crane would have
made<00:02:10.170> more<00:02:10.289> sense<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.800> then<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
made more sense and then we have the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.720 
made more sense and then we have the
regal<00:02:13.020> riding<00:02:13.770> crane<00:02:14.069> now<00:02:14.250> imagine<00:02:14.640> this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
regal riding crane now imagine this

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.280 
regal riding crane now imagine this
one's<00:02:14.940> called<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.210> Regal<00:02:15.690> because<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
one's called the Regal because of the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.190 
one's called the Regal because of the
purple<00:02:16.830> remember<00:02:17.190> purple<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.930> synonymously<00:02:18.930> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
purple remember purple is synonymously a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.710 
purple remember purple is synonymously a
royal<00:02:20.160> color<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.120> that's<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> vibe

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
royal color so I think that's the vibe

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.300 
royal color so I think that's the vibe
they<00:02:21.960> were<00:02:22.020> going<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.830> speaking<00:02:23.100> of

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
they were going for but speaking of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.020 
they were going for but speaking of
weirdly<00:02:23.670> colored<00:02:24.210> named<00:02:24.690> creatures<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.760> one

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
weirdly colored named creatures this one

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.470 
weirdly colored named creatures this one

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
and it does look really really cool if I

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.420 
and it does look really really cool if I
add<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> little<00:04:54.750> criticism<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:56.039> think<00:04:56.250> it's

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
add a little criticism I just think it's

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.129 
add a little criticism I just think it's
a<00:04:56.490> little<00:04:56.729> bit<00:04:56.849> bland<00:04:57.270> on<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.659> old<00:04:57.810> colour

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
a little bit bland on the old colour

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.839 
a little bit bland on the old colour
scheme<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.530> think<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:59.009> could<00:04:59.190> have<00:04:59.280> done<00:04:59.430> with<00:04:59.639> a

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
scheme I think it could have done with a

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.480 
scheme I think it could have done with a
little<00:05:00.240> bit<00:05:00.599> more<00:05:00.840> vibrancy<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.279> ones

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
little bit more vibrancy to it the ones

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.189 
little bit more vibrancy to it the ones
that<00:05:02.760> go<00:05:02.909> on<00:05:03.029> the<00:05:03.150> flight<00:05:03.389> path<00:05:03.719> are

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
that go on the flight path are

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.770 
that go on the flight path are
absolutely<00:05:04.710> awesome<00:05:04.949> or<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.400> prob
