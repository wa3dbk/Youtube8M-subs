00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.890
 so hello to all today we get 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.220
 found for a royal duo in duo 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.930
 with my two characters expressed to mr so 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.410
 the royal mint is down 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.839
 128 the other monsters his level 114 to 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.000
 128 also so I 'm going to try to 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.860
 do so in duo years minimum in maximum 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.390
 20 turns I first remove the mode 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.890
 tactical it's a lot nicer for 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.160
 filming and now i'm just going pc 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.719
 but perso my sign here a first 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.070
 sacred love behind so for 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.430
 loyal information taste the first 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.510
 boss of frigost it is obligatory of 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.859
 do the kingdom where so his royal 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.149
 to gain access to friot transport 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.750
 support went then to bn the rice 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.920
 pasta with boiling water and so it's 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.379
 to take him away from vulnerable times 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.250
 because like all the frigost bosses he has 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.109
 one is invulnerable 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.089
 you have to push it in a box then 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.500
 you see here I show the resistors 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.500
 different monsters 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.929
 here are mine too and that of mount 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.929
 sacred 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.030
 then if not for the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.430
 monsters the royal mouthe can summon 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.900
 random mouthe redneck and strikes 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.000
 andy andy solution so that is to say 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.759
 all around himself in two matches 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.130
 wants when we take away the Tamils 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.259
 the maple by pushing it into a box there 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.930
 will also win 4 pm see there he has 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.690
 summoned a puff minutes he also 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.820
 earned 4 pm is by cons very careful 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.240
 if you push him and who receives 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.830
 push damage or even if another 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.860
 furniture inflicts thumb damage 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.509
 is saturated to all the characters in 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.590
 his straight lines and in addition with 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.090
 show the damage of all the ends 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.970
 football so you have to do it 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.649
 attention to that it has happened to me that 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.300
 I was going to the royal body-to-body sheep 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.270
 for example ask a team that at 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.519
 a beautiful food all legendary me 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.670
 pushes and therefore inflicts damage 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.220
 to grow royal muthe and that we die 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.470
 so have to pay attention to that then the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.720
 beauf hewitt him at 5pm he hits at at 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.790
 distance by removing the peace and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.290
 melee they also strike at 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.959
 I believe in removing dpa game safer 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.299
 so the redneck mouthe legend has it 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.519
 a lot of resistance fire on all that 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.410
 it's annoying for my biarritz at 6 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.239
 as a focus I push to attack the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.630
 vocation is legendary I do not have 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.769
 hit big thing 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.350
 the beauf montier-en-der strikes 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.359
 ap high with a spell that grows from 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.640
 several boxes 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:52.030
 I do not have a kind of snowball anymore 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.670
 who launches is so there he also 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.359
 received I was sorry that the other 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.579
 football 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 the beautiful simple fashion made him 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.140
 fly road 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.400
 it's a spell that returns from 1 to 50 but 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.070
 as they are higher level it's going 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 easily send 150 to make 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.640
 attention the argument this kind of spell 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.659
 so good it was screaming normally they 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.890
 tunes but too much given that the August beauf 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.540
 45 % of the distance 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.250
 I'm going to attack them and that's more 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.269
 care here is larron it is a pity 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.689
 do not know exactly how much of the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.689
 Last update 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.609
 now what about the food 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.430
 everything is already called 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.280
 the redneck any war comic mode 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.560
 forgiveness war it's a very very very 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.560
 dangerous but also very useful because 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.129
 in fact he's going to make a spell at every 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.970
 critical 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.379
 he's going to do a spell that puts 50% 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.669
 weakness to all the elements on a 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.049
 character but every time he 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.700
 will receive one or more damages to the 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.250
 he will get 50 damage 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.450
 during a turn and so if I attack 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.439
 with a wand ouf christians by 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.329
 example that hits twice he goes 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.319
 receive 50 damage during a turn if 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.840
 I do it three times in a row he goes 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.370
 receive 150 damage tend a turn so 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.739
 it's a great way to boost your 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.389
 characters to leave him alive but 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.329
 you have to be careful because the 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.000
 backlash of weaknesses it inflicts 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:16.010
 it can really hurt even at all 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.030
 beginning you have to be more without damage and 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.949
 I see even more who were doing 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.440
 weakness or only 100% weak 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.669
 are an element I was hitting homo millet 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.130
 vampiric with a dignitary who 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.669
 were not even at the elsewhere it was 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.510
 Funny enough 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.159
 for the anecdote so now I'm going 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.479
 directly push the ol goes up for 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.090
 start attacking him like that he's going 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.470
 earn 4 pm and power matech you see 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.680
 here disables the tables the rabbis 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.870
 turn 4 pm now I can attack him 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.550
 he has a lot of resistance came out 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.550
 for that I put the daring punishment 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.969
 and finally it's about I 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:52.050
 describes all the furniture the boufbowl of 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.629
 striking war is of course 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.520
 I had forgotten the royal mood can 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:00.119
 also attracted 2 one or two boxes I 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.069
 believe on all his straight lines and 

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:03.779
 then typed with a spell 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.129
 equivalent the dissolution is on fire 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:09.479
 but who do not want life points 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:11.099
 so you have to be careful about that and 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.949
 the more he will purposely place himself 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.229
 to attack several characters from 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.909
 on the other hand is recent if you 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.309
 have an old fashioned as sent him a 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.199
 very big red nose he's going to focus little 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:22.559
 near damage per turn so there is 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.939
 margin 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:28.529
 hold that they hit them and the 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:30.120
 Whelp at 89% fire resistance then 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.680
 there I'm going to have to push their state 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.550
 vulnerable has come because it comes back to 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.189
 end of a turn from the moment the 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:43.139
 player he pushed him back to his 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.909
 754 match round 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.369
 I think I'll finish in six laps 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.930
 the fight with my rio bag I can not 

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:52.830
 hitting too much resistance and where 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.020
 I do not see much, so here I go 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.740
 attack him with two say high and 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.209
 then make a release in order to him 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.949
 raise the vulnerable state for my 

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:03.269
 line ritz so we can cumulate the 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.330
 vulnerable states it does not change big 

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:05.330
 thing 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.240
 then I think a release so 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.210
 release now we grow from 3 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.040
 boxes at all levels of the spell for 3 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.780
 then pushed up to four boxes 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.060
 actually release against the 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.970
 stimulus interval of 5th of six rounds 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.950
 even this morning so here I am killing the 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.330
 royal mouthe 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.700
 I hope this video is so royal 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.840
 duo muthe subscribe you leave a 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.139
 comment tell me what you are saying 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.690
 think 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.389
 so here it is, experts a little bit too 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.440
 still a boss low enough level 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.010
 that I was more at scales so it's a 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.380
 not easy 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.090
 and here I was so duo then to 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.290
