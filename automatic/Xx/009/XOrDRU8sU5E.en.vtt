this mod is at
and<00:04:26.800> let's<00:04:27.490> destroy<00:04:27.850> everything<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:28.900> those

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
and let's destroy everything so those

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.140 
and let's destroy everything so those
are<00:04:29.650> all<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.770> dinosaurs<00:04:30.610> adds<00:04:30.850> in<00:04:31.000> but

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
are all the dinosaurs adds in but

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.270 
are all the dinosaurs adds in but
there's<00:04:31.300> also<00:04:31.480> another<00:04:31.660> page<00:04:32.500> Jurassic

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
there's also another page Jurassic

geraci<00:04:33.820> crash<00:04:34.060> I'm<00:04:34.270> not<00:04:34.419> exactly<00:04:34.780> sure<00:04:35.050> what

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
geraci crash I'm not exactly sure what

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.950 
geraci crash I'm not exactly sure what
all<00:04:35.229> this<00:04:35.290> stuff<00:04:35.350> does<00:04:35.669> well<00:04:36.669> um<00:04:36.960> apparently

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
all this stuff does well um apparently

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.840 
all this stuff does well um apparently
these<00:04:38.260> are<00:04:38.320> meats<00:04:38.710> which<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.280> probably<00:04:39.610> what

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
these are meats which is probably what

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.270 
these are meats which is probably what
the<00:04:40.000> certain<00:04:40.270> dinosaurs<00:04:40.660> drop<00:04:41.050> there<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:41.919> um

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
the certain dinosaurs drop there is um

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.610 
the certain dinosaurs drop there is um
DNA<00:04:42.790> right<00:04:43.210> here<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.720> DNA<00:04:43.930> which<00:04:44.410> I'm

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
DNA right here the DNA which I'm

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.780 
DNA right here the DNA which I'm
guessing<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:45.130> stuff<00:04:45.340> you're<00:04:45.430> gonna<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:45.699> to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
guessing is stuff you're gonna have to

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.490 
guessing is stuff you're gonna have to
find<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.300> create<00:04:46.449> these<00:04:46.780> dinosaurs<00:04:47.229> maybe<00:04:47.440> I

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
find to create these dinosaurs maybe I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.870 
find to create these dinosaurs maybe I
guess<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.220> probably<00:04:48.340> wouldn't<00:04:48.669> spawn

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
guess it probably wouldn't spawn

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.850 
guess it probably wouldn't spawn
naturally<00:04:49.120> there's<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:50.020> bone<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.590> we<00:04:50.680> place

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
naturally there's a bone can we place

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.120 
naturally there's a bone can we place
this<00:04:51.010> down<00:04:51.220> please<00:04:51.550> can't<00:04:52.479> place<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.720> down

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
this down please can't place it down

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.370 
this down please can't place it down
yeah<00:04:54.130> we<00:04:54.490> have<00:04:54.699> fossil<00:04:55.389> we<00:04:55.660> have<00:04:55.750> analyzers

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
yeah we have fossil we have analyzers

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.770 
yeah we have fossil we have analyzers
and<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.010> just<00:04:57.190> looks<00:04:57.370> like<00:04:57.460> stuff<00:04:57.760> this<00:04:58.449> looks

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
and it just looks like stuff this looks

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.150 
and it just looks like stuff this looks
like<00:04:58.930> stuff<00:04:59.229> to<00:04:59.440> create<00:04:59.940> whoa<00:05:00.940> what's<00:05:01.510> that<00:05:02.160> so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
like stuff to create whoa what's that so

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.620 
like stuff to create whoa what's that so
I<00:05:03.190> guess<00:05:03.400> this<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.610> stuff<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.030> turn<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.300> DNA

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
I guess this is stuff to turn the DNA

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.930 
I guess this is stuff to turn the DNA
back<00:05:04.930> into<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.320> dinosaurs<00:05:05.800> pretty<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.550> mean

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
back into the dinosaurs pretty I mean

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.360 
back into the dinosaurs pretty I mean
it's<00:05:07.510> pretty<00:05:07.870> complicated<00:05:08.290> but<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:09.010> mean<00:05:09.280> if

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
it's pretty complicated but I mean if

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.430 
it's pretty complicated but I mean if
you<00:05:09.460> figure<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.820> out<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.570> mod<00:05:10.840> this<00:05:11.229> mod

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
you figure it out this mod this mod

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.890 
you figure it out this mod this mod
needs<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.979> be<00:05:12.100> updated<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.610> mean<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:13.360> didn't<00:05:13.750> even

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
needs to be updated I mean I didn't even

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.719 
needs to be updated I mean I didn't even
know<00:05:14.080> what<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.500> actually<00:05:14.530> included<00:05:15.460> but

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
know what it actually included but

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.360 
know what it actually included but
dinosaurs<00:05:16.210> look<00:05:16.630> at<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:16.990> guy<00:05:17.229> when<00:05:18.010> you<00:05:18.100> kill

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370
