00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.870 
very very quick just to get an idea of
where<00:04:51.110> things<00:04:51.260> can<00:04:51.500> go<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:52.220> if<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.430> if<00:04:52.580> you

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
where things can go so if you if you

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.490 
where things can go so if you if you
rewind<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.510> video<00:04:53.600> back<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.140> can<00:04:54.260> see<00:04:54.290> how

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
rewind the video back you can see how

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.990 
rewind the video back you can see how
this<00:04:54.620> kind<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.920> correlates<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.610> what<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.970> just

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
this kind of correlates to what you just

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.360 
this kind of correlates to what you just
saw<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.480> image<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.590> still<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.890> Z

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
saw in the image this is still the Z

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.220 
saw in the image this is still the Z
sketch<00:04:58.700> version<00:04:59.180> so<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.870> cool<00:05:00.020> thing<00:05:00.050> about

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
sketch version so the cool thing about

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.040 
sketch version so the cool thing about
that<00:05:00.500> is<00:05:00.560> we<00:05:00.890> can<00:05:01.130> switch<00:05:01.430> over<00:05:01.580> into<00:05:02.270> awesome

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
that is we can switch over into awesome

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.690 
that is we can switch over into awesome
mode<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.440> let<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.770> awesome<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.430> should<00:05:04.610> have

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
mode to let you awesome I should have

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.890 
mode to let you awesome I should have
called<00:05:04.850> it<00:05:05.060> bind<00:05:05.240> they<00:05:05.420> should<00:05:05.540> just<00:05:05.570> put<00:05:05.840> the

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
called it bind they should just put the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.570 
called it bind they should just put the
word<00:05:06.050> awesome<00:05:06.200> yeah<00:05:06.740> they're<00:05:06.980> just<00:05:07.070> like<00:05:07.370> if

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
word awesome yeah they're just like if

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.400 
word awesome yeah they're just like if
you<00:05:07.610> when<00:05:07.880> you<00:05:07.970> hold<00:05:08.120> control<00:05:08.540> because<00:05:08.780> well

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
you when you hold control because well

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.810 
you when you hold control because well
zbrush<00:05:09.800> does<00:05:09.980> that<00:05:10.160> it<00:05:10.280> teaches<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.670> its

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
zbrush does that it teaches you its

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.550 
zbrush does that it teaches you its
entire<00:05:11.120> interface<00:05:11.390> by<00:05:11.720> holding<00:05:11.990> control<00:05:12.350> it

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
entire interface by holding control it

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.800 
entire interface by holding control it
just<00:05:12.860> should<00:05:13.040> say<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:14.090> bind<00:05:14.300> button<00:05:14.600> the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
just should say the bind button the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.420 
just should say the bind button the
description<00:05:15.290> should<00:05:15.380> be<00:05:15.530> this<00:05:15.890> is<00:05:16.070> awesome

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
description should be this is awesome

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.920 
description should be this is awesome
and<00:05:16.730> that<00:05:17.030> that's<00:05:17.240> really<00:05:17.390> all<00:05:17.570> you<00:05:17.600> need<00:05:17.720> to

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
and that that's really all you need to

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.840 
and that that's really all you need to
know<00:05:18.050> exactly<00:05:18.260> but<00:05:18.920> we<00:05:19.100> can<00:05:19.280> go<00:05:19.400> over<00:05:19.580> here<00:05:19.670> to

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
know exactly but we can go over here to

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.190 
know exactly but we can go over here to
move<00:05:20.300> mode<00:05:20.540> and<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.750> course<00:05:20.900> we<00:05:21.050> could

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
move mode and of course we could

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.260 
move mode and of course we could
reposition<00:05:21.710> him<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.370> we<00:05:22.670> can<00:05:22.820> do<00:05:22.940> all<00:05:23.240> sorts

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
reposition him and we can do all sorts

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.010 
reposition him and we can do all sorts
of<00:05:23.720> adjustments<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.530> proportion<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.930> know

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
of adjustments to proportion to you know

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.450 
of adjustments to proportion to you know
the<00:05:27.140> posing<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.590> his<00:05:27.680> arms<00:05:27.980> then<00:05:28.310> you'll

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
the posing of his arms then you'll

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.070 
the posing of his arms then you'll
notice<00:05:28.700> these<00:05:28.820> little<00:05:28.880> strokes<00:05:29.570> up<00:05:29.750> here<00:05:29.930> that

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
notice these little strokes up here that

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.030 
notice these little strokes up here that
are<00:05:30.170> sticking<00:05:30.380> out<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.590> top<00:05:30.680> of<00:05:30.920> his<00:05:31.010> head

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
are sticking out the top of his head

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.740 
are sticking out the top of his head
they<00:05:31.340> are<00:05:31.370> coming<00:05:31.760> along<00:05:31.850> with<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.450> but

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
they are coming along with that but

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.510 
they are coming along with that but
that's<00:05:33.380> cool<00:05:33.590> these<00:05:33.800> are<00:05:33.860> again<00:05:34.190> we're<00:05:34.340> just

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
that's cool these are again we're just

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.950 
that's cool these are again we're just
kind<00:05:34.640> of<00:05:34.670> thrown<00:05:34.940> in<00:05:35.120> just<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.450> see<00:05:35.630> how<00:05:35.750> things

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
kind of thrown in just to see how things

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.840 
kind of thrown in just to see how things
would<00:05:36.170> work<00:05:36.290> out<00:05:36.500> but<00:05:37.220> you've<00:05:37.340> got<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.490> lot<00:05:37.820> of

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
would work out but you've got a lot of

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.360 
would work out but you've got a lot of
power<00:05:38.240> here<00:05:38.660> over<00:05:39.350> what<00:05:39.800> this<00:05:40.010> guy<00:05:40.160> is<00:05:40.220> going

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
power here over what this guy is going

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.130 
power here over what this guy is going
to<00:05:40.490> look<00:05:40.640> like<00:05:40.670> in<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.000> end<00:05:41.090> result<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:41.780> if<00:05:41.990> we

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
to look like in the end result and if we

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.410 
to look like in the end result and if we
wanted<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.500> we<00:05:42.890> could<00:05:43.190> even<00:05:43.580> go<00:05:43.820> so<00:05:44.000> far<00:05:44.030> as<00:05:44.240> to

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
wanted to we could even go so far as to

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.120 
wanted to we could even go so far as to
killing<00:05:44.900> off<00:05:45.020> symmetry<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.740> start<00:05:45.950> putting

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
killing off symmetry and start putting

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.580 
killing off symmetry and start putting
each<00:05:46.400> individual<00:05:46.970> leg<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.390> a<00:05:47.420> cool<00:05:47.630> pose<00:05:47.900> so

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
each individual leg and a cool pose so

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.470 
each individual leg and a cool pose so
when<00:05:48.830> we<00:05:48.950> got<00:05:49.070> him<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.700> know<00:05:49.790> done<00:05:50.150> we<00:05:50.360> got

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
when we got him you know done we got

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.030 
when we got him you know done we got
these<00:05:50.570> proportions<00:05:50.960> where<00:05:51.410> we<00:05:51.530> wanted<00:05:51.800> him<00:05:51.920> to

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
these proportions where we wanted him to

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.680 
these proportions where we wanted him to
be<00:05:52.220> we<00:05:52.610> could<00:05:52.820> get<00:05:52.970> him<00:05:53.150> in<00:05:53.270> some<00:05:53.420> sort<00:05:53.600> of

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
be we could get him in some sort of

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.900 
be we could get him in some sort of
really<00:05:54.110> cool<00:05:54.320> lined<00:05:54.680> up<00:05:54.860> football<00:05:55.130> pose<00:05:55.580> or

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
really cool lined up football pose or

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.640 
really cool lined up football pose or

awesome and then when we're done of
course<00:06:01.790> we<00:06:01.970> can<00:06:02.090> just<00:06:02.240> convert<00:06:02.570> that<00:06:02.690> out<00:06:02.840> into

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
course we can just convert that out into

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.660 
course we can just convert that out into
a<00:06:03.080> mesh<00:06:03.320> continue<00:06:03.800> sculpting<00:06:04.250> going<00:06:04.520> from

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
a mesh continue sculpting going from

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.920 
a mesh continue sculpting going from
there<00:06:04.760> putting<00:06:05.060> in<00:06:05.150> all<00:06:05.270> of<00:06:05.360> our<00:06:05.420> detail<00:06:05.750> and

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930
