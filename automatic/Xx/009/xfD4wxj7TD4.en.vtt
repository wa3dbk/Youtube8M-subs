00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
in the previous series kept telling me I

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.640 
in the previous series kept telling me I
should<00:04:53.430> have<00:04:53.580> more<00:04:53.819> shots<00:04:54.210> if<00:04:54.449> they<00:04:55.020> rage<00:04:55.289> quit

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
should have more shots if they rage quit

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.710 
should have more shots if they rage quit
and<00:04:55.889> but<00:04:56.550> say<00:04:56.729> I've<00:04:56.910> already<00:04:57.030> scored<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.539> hat

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.029 
trick and then and then they rage quit
it<00:04:59.909> seems<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.479> bit<00:05:00.630> much<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:01.110> have<00:05:01.289> six<00:05:01.650> seven

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
it seems a bit much to have six seven

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.010 
it seems a bit much to have six seven
eight<00:05:02.130> nine<00:05:02.190> ten<00:05:02.639> eleven<00:05:02.970> twelve<00:05:03.020> different

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
eight nine ten eleven twelve different

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.600 
eight nine ten eleven twelve different
shots<00:05:04.500> on<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.770> target<00:05:04.979> it's<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.280> little<00:05:05.490> bit

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
shots on the target it's a little bit

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.279 
shots on the target it's a little bit
too<00:05:05.729> much<00:05:05.880> I've<00:05:06.090> only<00:05:06.240> got<00:05:06.449> like<00:05:06.539> 11<00:05:06.720> bullets

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
too much I've only got like 11 bullets

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.219 
too much I've only got like 11 bullets
and<00:05:07.530> so<00:05:08.430> what<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.610> thought<00:05:08.819> was<00:05:09.060> if<00:05:09.240> maybe<00:05:09.479> if<00:05:09.780> I

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
and so what I thought was if maybe if I

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.809 
and so what I thought was if maybe if I
make<00:05:10.440> them<00:05:10.560> rage<00:05:10.770> quit<00:05:11.039> really<00:05:11.340> early<00:05:11.639> say

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
make them rage quit really early say

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.700 
make them rage quit really early say
it's<00:05:11.970> like<00:05:12.090> nil<00:05:12.300> nil<00:05:12.509> we<00:05:13.020> haven't<00:05:13.319> scored<00:05:13.620> a

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
it's like nil nil we haven't scored a

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.800 
it's like nil nil we haven't scored a
goal<00:05:13.860> with<00:05:14.039> Lao<00:05:14.220> drop<00:05:14.520> but<00:05:14.970> they've<00:05:15.150> rage<00:05:15.419> quit

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
goal with Lao drop but they've rage quit

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.990 
goal with Lao drop but they've rage quit
maybe<00:05:16.409> we<00:05:16.590> should<00:05:16.620> get<00:05:16.889> like<00:05:17.039> three<00:05:17.520> shots<00:05:17.759> on

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
maybe we should get like three shots on

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.790 
maybe we should get like three shots on
the<00:05:18.090> target<00:05:18.330> for<00:05:18.599> that<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.349> longer<00:05:19.560> it

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.290 
the target for that and the longer it
takes<00:05:20.009> for<00:05:20.190> them<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.400> rage<00:05:20.669> quit<00:05:20.909> say<00:05:21.090> we<00:05:21.210> get

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
takes for them to rage quit say we get

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.879 
takes for them to rage quit say we get

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.620 
we're gonna have to shoot their target
in<00:05:49.620> order<00:05:50.009> to<00:05:50.190> try<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:50.490> save<00:05:50.820> them<00:05:51.120> yeah<00:05:51.270> if<00:05:51.539> I

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
in order to try and save them yeah if I

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.939 
in order to try and save them yeah if I
hit<00:05:51.810> anywhere<00:05:52.199> it's<00:05:52.380> going<00:05:52.409> to<00:05:52.560> kind<00:05:52.710> of<00:05:52.800> work

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
hit anywhere it's going to kind of work

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.770 
hit anywhere it's going to kind of work
like<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.250> silver<00:05:53.580> bullet<00:05:53.849> if<00:05:53.969> I<00:05:54.449> hit<00:05:54.630> them

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
like the silver bullet if I hit them

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.839 
like the silver bullet if I hit them
anywhere<00:05:55.259> if<00:05:55.349> I<00:05:55.469> tap<00:05:55.830> them<00:05:56.099> just<00:05:56.340> on<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.639> side

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
anywhere if I tap them just on the side

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.879 
anywhere if I tap them just on the side
if<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.690> hit<00:05:57.900> them<00:05:58.050> with<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.229> times<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:58.800> the

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
if I hit them with the times and the

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.890 
if I hit them with the times and the
bullet<00:05:59.190> falls<00:05:59.370> off<00:05:59.610> if<00:05:59.849> I<00:06:00.270> hid<00:06:00.479> them<00:06:00.630> in<00:06:00.719> any

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
bullet falls off if I hid them in any

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.779 
bullet falls off if I hid them in any
sort<00:06:01.139> of<00:06:01.259> way<00:06:01.319> they're<00:06:02.009> gonna<00:06:02.159> be<00:06:02.340> safe<00:06:02.580> for

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
sort of way they're gonna be safe for

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.760 
sort of way they're gonna be safe for
that<00:06:02.819> next<00:06:03.120> game<00:06:03.419> but<00:06:03.870> if<00:06:03.960> I<00:06:04.050> completely<00:06:04.530> miss

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
that next game but if I completely miss

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.950 
that next game but if I completely miss
then<00:06:05.400> I'm<00:06:05.969> gonna<00:06:06.180> have<00:06:06.330> to<00:06:06.449> replace<00:06:06.719> him<00:06:06.900> with

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
then I'm gonna have to replace him with

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.450 
then I'm gonna have to replace him with
a<00:06:07.050> bronze<00:06:07.289> player<00:06:07.530> as<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:07.919> can<00:06:08.069> see<00:06:08.219> on<00:06:08.250> your

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
a bronze player as you can see on your

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.700 
a bronze player as you can see on your
screens<00:06:08.789> right<00:06:08.969> now<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.719> left<00:06:10.020> picture<00:06:10.229> is

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
screens right now the left picture is

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.890 
screens right now the left picture is
the<00:06:10.770> sort<00:06:11.639> of<00:06:11.759> thing<00:06:11.819> I'm<00:06:12.120> going<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.419> be<00:06:12.479> aiming

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
the sort of thing I'm going to be aiming

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.529 
the sort of thing I'm going to be aiming
out<00:06:12.990> on<00:06:13.110> my<00:06:13.259> crossbow<00:06:13.740> because<00:06:14.699> you've<00:06:15.300> got

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
out on my crossbow because you've got

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.939 
out on my crossbow because you've got
the<00:06:15.719> the<00:06:15.750> more<00:06:16.169> expensive<00:06:16.500> the<00:06:16.919> better

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
the the more expensive the better

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.379 
the the more expensive the better
players<00:06:17.460> like<00:06:17.729> that<00:06:17.880> man<00:06:18.060> of<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.270> match

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
players like that man of the match

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.610 
players like that man of the match
Eriksson<00:06:18.900> in<00:06:18.990> the<00:06:19.080> middle<00:06:19.289> there<00:06:19.409> he's<00:06:19.590> a

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
Eriksson in the middle there he's a

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.610 
Eriksson in the middle there he's a
smaller<00:06:20.159> target<00:06:20.460> is<00:06:20.729> harder<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:21.180> hit<00:06:21.479> and<00:06:22.409> then

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
smaller target is harder to hit and then

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.990 
smaller target is harder to hit and then
of<00:06:22.740> course<00:06:22.770> like<00:06:23.099> the<00:06:23.190> bronze<00:06:23.460> players<00:06:23.759> and

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
of course like the bronze players and

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.339 
of course like the bronze players and
whatnot<00:06:24.300> in<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.509> danish<00:06:24.870> team<00:06:25.080> they're<00:06:25.229> going

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
whatnot in the danish team they're going

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.659 
whatnot in the danish team they're going
to<00:06:25.409> be<00:06:25.500> a<00:06:25.530> lot<00:06:25.680> easier<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:26.190> hit<00:06:26.310> they're<00:06:26.520> not

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
to be a lot easier to hit they're not

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.879 
to be a lot easier to hit they're not
worth<00:06:26.880> as<00:06:27.120> much<00:06:27.150> are<00:06:27.569> they<00:06:27.719> so<00:06:28.229> it's<00:06:28.440> an<00:06:28.530> easier

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
worth as much are they so it's an easier

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.770 
worth as much are they so it's an easier
shot<00:06:28.979> for<00:06:29.460> them<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:29.759> hit<00:06:29.940> and<00:06:30.180> so<00:06:30.630> they're

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
shot for them to hit and so they're

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.689 
shot for them to hit and so they're
slightly<00:06:31.020> bigger<00:06:31.319> in<00:06:32.099> the<00:06:32.219> middle<00:06:32.490> screen

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 
slightly bigger in the middle screen

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.519 
slightly bigger in the middle screen
that<00:06:32.940> you'll<00:06:33.060> see<00:06:33.300> is<00:06:33.539> what<00:06:33.810> i'll<00:06:33.930> post<00:06:34.199> as<00:06:34.469> a

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
that you'll see is what i'll post as a

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.439 
that you'll see is what i'll post as a
little<00:06:34.860> graphic<00:06:35.039> on<00:06:35.370> screen<00:06:35.729> in<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:35.940> videos

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
little graphic on screen in the videos

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.510 
little graphic on screen in the videos
and<00:06:37.380> i'll<00:06:37.500> cover<00:06:37.710> it<00:06:37.800> over<00:06:37.919> with<00:06:38.190> a<00:06:38.250> little<00:06:38.400> bit

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
and i'll cover it over with a little bit

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.640 
and i'll cover it over with a little bit
of<00:06:38.580> a<00:06:38.669> green<00:06:39.000> cover<00:06:39.719> to<00:06:40.020> show<00:06:40.199> if<00:06:40.380> i've<00:06:40.500> already

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
of a green cover to show if i've already

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.350 
of a green cover to show if i've already
unlocked<00:06:41.190> that<00:06:41.370> player<00:06:41.639> and<00:06:41.849> whatnot<00:06:42.180> and

unlocked that player and whatnot and

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.790 
unlocked that player and whatnot and
hopefully<00:06:42.839> you<00:06:42.930> should<00:06:43.110> be<00:06:43.199> able<00:06:43.289> to<00:06:43.440> see<00:06:43.589> that

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
hopefully you should be able to see that

stuff<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.300> little<00:06:45.449> bit<00:06:45.659> later<00:06:45.900> a<00:06:46.110> little<00:06:46.440> bit

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
stuff a little bit later a little bit

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.469 
stuff a little bit later a little bit
better<00:06:46.830> should<00:06:47.099> i<00:06:47.190> say<00:06:47.370> the<00:06:47.580> last<00:06:47.820> series<00:06:48.300> and

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
better should i say the last series and

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.180 
better should i say the last series and
then<00:06:48.779> the<00:06:48.900> one<00:06:49.080> on<00:06:49.169> the<00:06:49.260> right<00:06:49.289> as<00:06:49.740> you<00:06:49.770> can<00:06:50.010> see

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
then the one on the right as you can see

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.740 
then the one on the right as you can see
all<00:06:50.219> of<00:06:50.520> the<00:06:50.639> players<00:06:50.849> are<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.180> exact<00:06:51.659> same

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
all of the players are the exact same

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.529 
all of the players are the exact same
size<00:06:52.139> they're<00:06:52.800> all<00:06:52.949> relatively<00:06:53.400> big<00:06:53.820> that<00:06:54.389> is

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 
size they're all relatively big that is

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.360 
size they're all relatively big that is
the<00:06:54.690> target<00:06:55.080> system<00:06:55.229> that<00:06:55.529> i'll<00:06:55.650> be<00:06:55.770> using<00:06:56.039> if

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
the target system that i'll be using if

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.610 
the target system that i'll be using if
if<00:06:57.120> i<00:06:57.449> lose<00:06:57.659> the<00:06:57.870> match<00:06:58.050> and<00:06:58.320> I've<00:06:58.409> got<00:06:58.589> a

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
if i lose the match and I've got a

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.399 
if i lose the match and I've got a
basically<00:06:59.070> shoot<00:06:59.490> for<00:06:59.789> safety<00:07:00.270> and<00:07:00.449> it<00:07:01.139> should

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409 
basically shoot for safety and it should

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.200 
basically shoot for safety and it should
hopefully<00:07:01.620> be<00:07:01.919> nice<00:07:02.250> and<00:07:02.490> easy<00:07:02.699> to<00:07:02.909> hit<00:07:03.060> every

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
hopefully be nice and easy to hit every

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.969 
hopefully be nice and easy to hit every
single<00:07:03.449> one<00:07:03.690> of<00:07:03.719> those<00:07:03.870> shots<00:07:04.139> there's<00:07:04.740> nine
