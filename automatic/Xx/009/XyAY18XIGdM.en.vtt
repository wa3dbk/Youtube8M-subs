I<00:02:55.330> taste<00:02:56.950> Jagermeister<00:02:57.950> first<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.930> still<00:02:59.930> takes

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
I taste Jagermeister first I still takes

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.420 
I taste Jagermeister first I still takes
the<00:03:00.200> original<00:03:00.349> Jager<00:03:00.800> all<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.099> way<00:03:01.160> in<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
the original Jager all the way in the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.920 
the original Jager all the way in the
back<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.970> my<00:03:02.390> throat<00:03:02.739> but<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.770> really<00:03:04.160> strong

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
back of my throat but a really strong

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.650 
back of my throat but a really strong
cinnamon<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.860> punching<00:03:07.370> through<00:03:07.660> like

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
cinnamon is punching through like

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.440 
cinnamon is punching through like
definitely<00:03:09.020> cinnamon<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:11.239> vanilla

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
definitely cinnamon and then the vanilla

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.660 
definitely cinnamon and then the vanilla
I<00:03:11.780> don't<00:03:11.989> taste<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:12.830> much<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.340> can<00:03:13.520> tell

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
I don't taste it so much but I can tell

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.920 
I don't taste it so much but I can tell
that<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:14.000> there<00:03:14.060> because<00:03:14.360> it's<00:03:14.660> kind<00:03:14.870> of

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
that it's there because it's kind of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.900 
that it's there because it's kind of
softening<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.739> out<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.069> little<00:03:16.340> bit<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
softening it out a little bit like the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.809 
softening it out a little bit like the
tones<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.450> vanilla<00:03:17.720> are<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.890> aftertaste

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
tones of vanilla are in the aftertaste

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.790 
tones of vanilla are in the aftertaste
I<00:03:19.870> think<00:03:20.870> they<00:03:20.930> did<00:03:21.050> a<00:03:21.110> good<00:03:21.230> job<00:03:21.290> with<00:03:21.470> this

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
I think they did a good job with this

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.430 
I think they did a good job with this
because<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:23.209> still<00:03:24.080> tastes<00:03:24.290> like

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
because it still tastes like

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.229 
because it still tastes like
Jagermeister<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.220> me<00:03:25.370> there<00:03:25.910> would<00:03:26.000> be<00:03:26.060> no

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
Jagermeister to me there would be no

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.820 
Jagermeister to me there would be no
point<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.600> labeling<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.019> as<00:03:27.110> Jagermeister<00:03:27.680> if

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
point of labeling it as Jagermeister if

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.170 
point of labeling it as Jagermeister if
they<00:03:27.950> just<00:03:28.100> created<00:03:28.370> something<00:03:28.700> totally<00:03:28.910> new

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
they just created something totally new

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.090 
they just created something totally new
and<00:03:29.209> different<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.590> didn't<00:03:30.799> taste<00:03:30.920> like

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.500 
Jager but at the same time they didn't
change<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.110> much<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:34.700> don't<00:03:34.880> know<00:03:35.000> you
