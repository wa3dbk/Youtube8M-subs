00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
it's very clear on the camera see if I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.180 
it's very clear on the camera see if I
can<00:01:32.420> turn<00:01:32.600> my<00:01:32.660> light<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.650> will<00:01:33.800> help<00:01:34.010> a

before<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.300> do<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.350
