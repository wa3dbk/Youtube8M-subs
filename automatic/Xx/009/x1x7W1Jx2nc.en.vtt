00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
 Argentina 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.340
 argentina a country 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.320
 that we would have to enjoy it very much 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.320
 more than what we enjoyed 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.000
 and what 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.070
 it's good that we could be much more than 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.699
 what we really are 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.789
 is in our way of thinking can 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:34.279
 change this a soccer friend 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.279
 the player to coach as I read astrada 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.870
 impossible to lions of 8 gonzalez leo 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:47.320
 bingo are many and if if you say one 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.600
 it would be wrong with nothing more 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.670
 a book 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.809
 and now I'm reading the biography of 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.850
 guardiola but I read many of all 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.850
 history religion 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 there are a lot of things but good of 71 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.430
 now you do not see any 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.430
 Maradona 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.440
 say as a player I will not say 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.570
 nothing 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.010
 I 'm not even going to say how 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.830
 technical for me I simply say with that 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.510
 I say everything 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.400
 a person who has behaved with me 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.090
 thousand points 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.840
 a place in the world 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840
 colors 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.690
 where are the people what 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.030
 the only thing that one wants 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.020
 the affections the friends 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.570
 a song 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.570
 a song singing 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.070
 if a weirdo listens to music nothing 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.360
 a lot of music 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.930
 note in a song itself 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.930
 you know 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.590
 a coach 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.730
 He is very honest, very serious 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.730
 and above all 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.730
 that has given me back all the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.730
 trust 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.110
 in the selection that has helped me 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 very much for me to be again the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.290
 what was it 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.860
 a header phrase 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.960
 let's not say how to have a phrase, I do not have 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.160
 but 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:49.870
 but good what 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.870
 many times this phrase that one says 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.970
 perhaps it is not important bank account 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.960
 if not 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.960
 get up 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.870
 that ultimately does that beyond 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.310
 of the blows that we have in life what 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.550
 that one has to always do 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.320
 of 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.880
 to go forward to look towards 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.640
 ahead 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.640
 and good and only look back 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.569
 to learn from mistakes does not stop 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.120
 reproach yourself 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.349
 a jade shirt 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.349
 a T-shirt 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.170
 you can choose 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.330
 Ceramic San Lorenzo above the 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.450
 from barcelona the one from argentina are going to 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.450
 anger 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.049
 with 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.049
 but the best recipe 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.180
 the one of the selection 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 leo messi 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.870
 the best player in the world but about 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.599
 a whole boy that even though 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.860
 that everything came to him at a stroke has not 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.860
 changed his way of being 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.730
 it's still as earthy as it has 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.730
 been always and hopefully like that
