 to 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.009
 one of the most successful gaming 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.800
 nets 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.439
 how many tails were 5 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.060
 how many planes of extermination 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.780
 and how many times would the words read 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.660
 in the direction of especially skilled Quakers 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.100
 it is impossible to count 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.350
 will not deal 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.970
 it's better to go back 13 years instead 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.970
 back remember what it all started 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 from the mid nineties genre 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 first-person shooter lived only one 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.830
 by word 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.010
 two gorgeous fans 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.430
 Is the continuation of the banquet partially? 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.910
 But they waited for the table, but they could not even 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.270
 dream 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.420
 twenty second of june 1996 company 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 Odessa pfr made another revolution in 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.250
 shooter genre 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.720
 releasing a sherman version of which 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.450
 first this trip created in Czech 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.310
 three-dimensional engine 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.820
 for this we recall 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.200
 players could only watch 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.620
 pile of plane 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620
 created the release of the three-dimensional world 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.900
 what for example was nuclear 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.080
 blond officials 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.650
 with a famous predecessor 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.030
 the new play software was only heat 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.580
 but also a little plot usual for games of 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.550
 of time 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.750
 designed by the government 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.800
 teleporting this gate led 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.329
 dugout changes with scary monsters 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.870
 staged and globally massacred 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.850
 and now a lonely nameless hero 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.310
 should highlight 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.740
 go through all the circles of this hell and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.860
 stop all nasty creatures 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.050
 interesting fact 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.130
 the main boss Andrei was shape nicora 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.810
 whose name was borrowed 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.070
 developers of works 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.380
 lovecraft 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.819
 unlike other bosses and shooters addition 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.419
 of time 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.229
 to see the final credits in 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.889
 he didn't need to launch hundreds of missiles 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.179
 it was just enough 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.869
 teleport to the body of the Chablis curated them 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.159
 rip it from the inside 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.379
 however, the weak plot did not prevent 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.959
 the game immediately be on the throne 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.199
 king of the genre 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.599
 who and how hit their speed 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.609
 Dumer from the old school banal not 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.060
 managed to keep up with the gameplay 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.669
 enough 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.879
 by the way the world speed record 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.009
 passing game at the highest level 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.439
 the complexity is unthinkable 12 minutes 23 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.869
 seconds 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.299
 besides high speed unexpected 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.349
 for some it turned out 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.749
 multiplayer first to offer 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.889
 gamers biden multi-level cards 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.419
 had to use the mouse 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.189
 constantly otherwise guess where sickened 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.009
 knowledgeable grenade or rocket was 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:59.729
 is impossible 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.639
 gradually thanks to insane 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.909
 popularity as you dynamics 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.859
 The concept of e-sports began to take shape. 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.919
 no doubt the game tournaments were held 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.409
 before but precisely klik became the progenitor 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.209
 that eSports we know 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.999
 now 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.739
 few people know that initially some software 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.319
 planned to create not quite joking and 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.899
 again the game should have been the owner 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.239
 Numerous Pierre Vogel Elements 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.299
 her main boss was supposed to be 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.619
 the monster of his own name 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.899
 handwriting developers came to realize 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.079
 what's in the first game 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.069
 that's not what they really want 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.629
 make conceptual 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.099
 the model of the game turned out to be practically 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.729
 completely redo 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:41.669
 practically 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.799
 because habitual for role-playing games that 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.829
 time entourage of the middle ages 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.199
 what were they all present 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.049
 at the end of February 1997 IT software 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.869
 released the first mishin so for 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:54.599
 your 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.769
 received the name of the house format 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.799
 action supplement proceeded to 15 m new 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:01.639
 levels 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.109
 while the original game 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.599
 held 28 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.160
 and included three new weapons 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.829
 three additional opponents 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.279
 and of course the main brain 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:13.649
 the main feature of the additions was 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.419
 what was released in the week 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.319
 who had no place to enter 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.109
 eg 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.439
 breaking page 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.879
 a month later saw the second home 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.409
 where committed again 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.750
 filling it 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.920
 favorably differed from the first mishin poet 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.000
 because it turned out new products 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.309
 much bigger 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.629
 some bosses in the second antony was 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.939
 three pieces and besides them the players could 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.609
 try out 6 extra 

00:04:39.609 --> 00:04:41.069
 lists 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.740
 these eight new adversary 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.870
 first offered to the players rich 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.169
 weather construction opportunities 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.840
 the game engine was so comfortable that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.800
 even epic licensed works of fighting for 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.669
 halfhaya 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.870
 generally 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.349
 in the first half of December 1997 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.419
 they often released the second part will come out 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.840
 from the first part of the network of the year only 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.229
 name and favorite players 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.599
 Bo Moscow where we 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.249
 periodically meeting on 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.710
 level 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.350
 and seriously increasing 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.889
 inflicted damage 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.560
 weapon setin opponents have changed 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.379
 fully acquiring scientific 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.870
 fantastic on the ice 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.850
 trying to resist 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.060
 alien invasion 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.379
 cybernetic russia strings

 the planet 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.949
 new bank we manage one of 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.750
 such a design whose capsule is under heaven 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.150
 randomness comes off perky trajectories and 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.960
 broken apart from the pre 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.620
 scheduled call site 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.840
 as it turns out later, it saved 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.790
 life to our hero because 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.370
 most of the others are fighting 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.780
 in which the surface passed in 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.860
 normal mode 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.460
 were strictly not paid 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.229
 and neutralized 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.240
 gameplay will go on seemingly 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.729
 not very different from the first part 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.040
 we are still headlong ahead 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.070
 destroying along the way all hostile and 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.169
 Appears available 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.650
 but fresh findings are still present 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.919
 the player was given the task of staffs learned about 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.529
 further development of the plot 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.809
 simply put it was constantly in 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:15.849
 course of events 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.349
 boiling around him will enter 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:20.679
 i.e. 2 once again let go 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.749
 software to produce technology 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:23.610
 revolution 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.569
 new engine could offer players 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:26.509
 many innovations 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.830
 like a large open area plot 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.719
 videos and features 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.809
 return to previously visited level 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:36.849
 the only censure caused 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.469
 system scattering on 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.229
 parts of the enemy 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.059
 if determined bloodied 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:43.749
 heads of opponents from the first part 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:45.599
 remembered with delight 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.979
 who mentioning scraps second usually 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.399
 talked bloody snot 

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:52.149
 multiplayer part of the second cluster 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:54.469
 turned out no worse than the original 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.619
 multiplayer battles got a special 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:58.889
 the sharpness due to the appearance of the royal

 well, the maximum sound

 shells tablet horn true children have become 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.069
 significantly less 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.610
 that not everyone liked it 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.759
 as in the case of the first part go 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.770
 software has released two packs 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.729

 main player in full 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.389
 the redemption engine was used in
