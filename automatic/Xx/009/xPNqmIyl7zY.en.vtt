00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.040 
a quick video on the five best free
video<00:00:06.000> editing<00:00:06.420> applications<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.350> my<00:00:08.220> opinion

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
video editing applications in my opinion

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.509 
video editing applications in my opinion
now<00:00:10.050> when<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.469> first<00:00:10.679> started<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.219> video<00:00:11.460> I

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
now when I first started in video I

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.789 
now when I first started in video I
tried<00:00:12.000> pretty<00:00:12.269> much<00:00:12.420> every<00:00:12.990> free<00:00:13.230> program<00:00:13.650> on

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
tried pretty much every free program on

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.150 
tried pretty much every free program on
the<00:00:13.860> market<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:15.299> I've<00:00:15.719> made<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> list<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.800> it's

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the market so I've made a list and it's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.510 
the market so I've made a list and it's
based<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.970> own<00:00:18.000> experience<00:00:19.100> so<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.340> are

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
based on my own experience so these are

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.790 
based on my own experience so these are
the<00:00:20.609> five<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> personally<00:00:21.720> consider<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the five that I personally consider the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.540 
the five that I personally consider the
best<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> best<00:00:24.710> Windows<00:00:25.710> Movie<00:00:25.949> Maker<00:00:27.050> I

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
best of the best Windows Movie Maker I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.830 
best of the best Windows Movie Maker I
really<00:00:29.550> don't<00:00:29.970> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> include<00:00:30.660> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840

program<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> list<00:00:31.850> but<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.090> would<00:00:33.210> be

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
program on the list but it would be

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.260 
program on the list but it would be
wrong<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.399> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> admit<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.210> the
