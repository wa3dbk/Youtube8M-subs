00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:08.040
 The Olympic screening meeting once in four years is good, but it will start from tomorrow, but now my heart and mind 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.040
 How is it? 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.170
 me 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.010
 It is different at the time of health meeting 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.940
 My goals have also improved 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.840
 To achieve that goal 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:27.250
 I think that this is a good practice 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.700
 We assumed the Olympics this time 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.770
 High good level 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.770
 But as you can from the first game 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.260
 I will do my best 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.350
 Today's practice is for 24 positive jacks 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:49.649
 It's that swimsuit was very impressive again mer porin pick n 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.649
 Let's say it's heavy or approaching 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.050
 I do not put feelings 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.899
 After all that 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.490
 Newsday as the Olympics approach 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:12.280
 See the topic of Mondo 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.720
 True of health meeting Kedomo I have a feeling that I wonder it this offer also have their own feelings 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 Because it is not over 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.830
 So far public 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.060
 It doesn't feel like it's getting too hard, but I still see it from around me 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550
 Listen 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.520
 After all 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:35.899
 Feeling that I wonder What is strong to very gradually Nariki' 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.890
 Again is the and say, point taken, which has been strengthening Well the best way to put a force toward this selection meeting 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.890
 Where will it be 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.980
 This time in the standing meter one side 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.980
 I'm not great 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.070
 I have done a lot of late practice too 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.670
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 Lift it was somethin small part of the word 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 There is little by little but 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.770
 Be careful in the Trey people 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.530
 Because it is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.120
 This time house 6 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.510
 I hope it will appear 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.740
 That squeeze into a single 100m who had Anonima talk 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.530
 We were quite surprised though 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.910
 I think it is a big decision, but what do you think about that 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.910
 Decision to narrow it down to one 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.000
 are you 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.970
 Not 's Olympic preliminary round 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.740
 The 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:45.819
 If you only have a Japan Championship , attach it without passing 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:48.430
 Hey, I'd think it was a feeling-filled I mean we try to work hard with the aim self-best 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.540
 It was nice to have 3 fly companies 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.450
 Considering a schedule for an apple production, my a 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.450
 And the story that says what to do with the entry 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.670
 Become 100 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:09.020
 ｰｰｰthat Do not squeeze the nozzle doctor each 200 F Dorebideo 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:15.250
 Which one do you want to go to in Kyoto 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.250
 It's been a while to say that everything comes out 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.500
 Looking at the liver a little bit more dramatic 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.590
 Say a tough day 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.000
 Nakano will 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.900
 Not that later 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.440
 After all I thought 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.200
 The wife 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.510
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:44.370
 I hit it this way and everyone was strong 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.440
 If I want to get a medal at Ibe, I'm hungry, so I say I'm gone this time 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.000
 I decided to stop 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:57.060
 That 's why I just remember that 100- head medley neo medal against the film 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.340
 I think that it is the reverse of that it is strong, but how about that 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.470
 Of course half-hearted feeling 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.470
 Because I did not give up the sky which is not 200 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.810
 Because it is from the thought that we want to exert power to enslave the part which is not 200m properly 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.430
 There is production properly 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.910
 Results It is not do unless we hurried to prepare to the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.130
 I'm going to head there this time 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.130
 It is most important to be chosen as representative 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.240
 Well now it will be a tournament and well 100m but there is a fit home Olympics 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.980
 On the look 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.550
 U 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.710
 Guess what good result in my own 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.050
 I can feel the response 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.740
 From the approximate line 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.830
 I say the expected time of my own 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.969
 Because I am 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:56.289
 Thought by myself 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:59.889
 I hope it will be better to gradually increase the qualifying semifinals with the race exhibition member 16 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.669
 In the final how many people are supposed 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.669
 desired 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.169
 light 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.390
 Medal in tick reduction 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.510
 I think that I will fight 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.770
 58 seconds Wow 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.930
 Follow 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:21.560
 I think always issued not when the Do not bite the top 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.560
 Publishing is 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.879
 Dispatch 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.879
 the s 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.980
 If the condition is good, the record will grow 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.930
 Because I think 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.930
 I do not see a little high record 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:51.950
 More recently that say strong comment until there 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.480
 Recently of serving flights Well I'd got to come out of the lager's name is quite high strongly 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.320
 But I think the kana not than it was 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.320
 The per was your 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.539
 The winter is quite swimming and 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.910
 practice 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:09.340
 With a standing meal 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.729
 Than I think that is raised to be natural and mental 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.849
 I've done that ah 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.969
 Because I have loaded a lot of practice to endure 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:21.489
 me 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.489
 Sentence properly or put out in subdued Ina' 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.580
 Where do you want to stick most with the race content 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:33.419
 The main issue is in the second half, but still 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.419
 But word order also 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:44.480
 I relax is so much too much to go slowly Kedomo I've been I want to enter the 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:48.220
 I think it will heal with a total xylophone 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.220
 Pansok also thinks by himself 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.919
 It is a TV expression 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.919
 Thank you Thank you Thank you
