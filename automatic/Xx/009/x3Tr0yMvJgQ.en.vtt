00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
could do this been through the weeks now

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.439 
could do this been through the weeks now
it's<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:19.980> touching<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:21.300> so

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
crazy when it's all done you're gonna

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800 
crazy when it's all done you're gonna
feel<00:00:23.430> amazed<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.420> go

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
feel amazed not to go

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.390 
feel amazed not to go
he's<00:00:25.019> never<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.320> lose<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.189> stick

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
he's never gonna lose that's what stick

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.339 
he's never gonna lose that's what stick
yeah<00:00:26.550> your<00:00:26.699> numbers<00:00:26.970> pulled<00:00:27.449> -<00:00:27.660> thanks<00:00:27.990> equals

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
yeah your numbers pulled - thanks equals

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.019 
yeah your numbers pulled - thanks equals
eight<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.710> board<00:00:28.920> need<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> isolate<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
eight on the board need to isolate the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.830 
eight on the board need to isolate the
variable

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
variable

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
variable
you<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.289> X's<00:00:31.769> multiplied<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> opposite

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you see X's multiplied to the opposite

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.569 
you see X's multiplied to the opposite
so<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.570> divide<00:00:34.020> always<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.370> both

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
so I divide always think to do both

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.880 
so I divide always think to do both
sides<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:36.270> zones<00:00:36.510> cancel<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> left<00:00:37.290> eight

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
sides two zones cancel on the left eight

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.280 
sides two zones cancel on the left eight
divided<00:00:38.160> two<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> Paul<00:00:38.850> dancer<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.660> swarm<00:00:40.110> but

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
divided two is Paul dancer and swarm but

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.380 
divided two is Paul dancer and swarm but
I<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> check<00:00:40.950> next<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.640> x<00:00:41.850> over<00:00:42.090> five<00:00:42.270> plus

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I got a check next one x over five plus

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
I got a check next one x over five plus
six<00:00:42.629> division<00:00:43.320> huh<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:43.680> don't<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.160> sick<00:00:44.430> do

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
six division huh now don't get sick do

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.209 
six division huh now don't get sick do
the<00:00:44.969> opposite<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.450> multiply<00:00:46.020> both<00:00:46.500> sides<00:00:46.920> by

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the opposite and multiply both sides by

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.970 
the opposite and multiply both sides by
five<00:00:47.760> fractions<00:00:48.510> dead<00:00:48.719> now<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> left<00:00:49.500> 30

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
five fractions dead now on the left 30

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.770 
five fractions dead now on the left 30
equals<00:00:50.129> product<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> five<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> six<00:00:51.329> mister

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
equals product the five and six mister

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569 
equals product the five and six mister
bunch<00:00:51.930> class<00:00:52.199> you're<00:00:52.379> never<00:00:52.649> done<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.370> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
bunch class you're never done now it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.790 
bunch class you're never done now it's
time<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:53.820> subtraction<00:00:54.360> next<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.379> next<00:00:55.559> -

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
time for subtraction next one next -

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
time for subtraction next one next -
technical<00:00:56.190> three<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> opposite<00:00:57.329> it'll<00:00:57.539> be

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
technical three do the opposite it'll be

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.470 
technical three do the opposite it'll be
easy<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.289> add<00:00:58.770> ten<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.399> three<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.270> it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
easy just add ten and three and it's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.860 
easy just add ten and three and it's
gonna<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.870> 13<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.739> X<00:01:02.010> plus<00:01:02.219> 4<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.730> 11<00:01:03.210> got<00:01:03.719> our

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
gonna be 13 if X plus 4 is 11 got our

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
gonna be 13 if X plus 4 is 11 got our
first<00:01:04.049> operation<00:01:04.589> let<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.129> subtract<00:01:05.489> sure

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
first operation let me subtract sure

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.320 
first operation let me subtract sure
so<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.299> take<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.720> away<00:01:06.930> x<00:01:07.170> equals<00:01:07.799> 7<00:01:08.400> solve<00:01:09.090> X

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
so just take for away x equals 7 solve X

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.890 
so just take for away x equals 7 solve X
a<00:01:09.479> cut<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.990> found<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.400> great

your question sing like algebra Pro 2x

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.130 
your question sing like algebra Pro 2x
plus<00:01:50.430> 6<00:01:50.610> equals<00:01:51.090> 4<00:01:51.300> call<00:01:51.690> these<00:01:51.900> step

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
plus 6 equals 4 call these step

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
plus 6 equals 4 call these step
successes<00:01:52.770> yours<00:01:53.040> subtract<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> six<00:01:53.850> yeah<00:01:54.000> do

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
successes yours subtract the six yeah do

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.150 
successes yours subtract the six yeah do
that<00:01:54.479> first<00:01:54.690> do<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.440> Left<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> on

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
that first do it on the Left do it on

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.850 
that first do it on the Left do it on
the<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.820> you're<00:01:57.060> left<00:01:57.300> with<00:01:57.510> 2x<00:01:57.860> equals

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the right now you're left with 2x equals

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.740 
the right now you're left with 2x equals
2<00:02:02.510> so<00:02:03.510> now<00:02:03.750> we're<00:02:04.200> left<00:02:04.410> with<00:02:05.190> just<00:02:05.490> 2x<00:02:05.880> equals

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
2 so now we're left with just 2x equals

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.949
