00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.139
 for me 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.060
 or more 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.109
 and others 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.069
 and apart 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:27.550
 we play these notes like this 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.740
 I use my thumb because I can not reach 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.740
 hand in another way then so 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.460
 pp 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.460
 or not 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.750
 plus 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.750
 we do not do this 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.930
 all right 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.930
 that is the introduction 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.670
 good as to raise us ornament 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.090
 finally do what you want for nothing 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.090
 interest 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.170
 my smile no longer depends on you 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:46.090
 finally I thank you for the time but 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 it's good that you left live at ease 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.530
 since you're not here 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.310
 and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.310
 do not 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.470
 and finally I remember your kisses 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:18.970
 I'm better than yesterday I'll prove it to you 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:23.700
 yes i will be with you 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.700
 I never liked you so much 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.590
 at the end that I do not hurt your departure that 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:42.280
 I was in love 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:45.660
 and apart you do not like everyone 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.050
 do not lower me to erase 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.390
 at the end it does not hurt that you are not and 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.390
 who would like to be with you 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.280
 at the end that your last name does not remain 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.950
 it was with mine and that's where the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.640
 song again 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.430
 the melody of the song is over 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.810
 in between is going to be a different ornament 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.810
 because he prepares for third 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.170
 it would be something like that we started here again 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.290
 Y 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.500
 d 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.500
 I started to change 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.800
 i 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.840
 and 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.110
 how he prepares for the third and already the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.729
 ornaments repeat the same and now it goes what 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.689
 what is the end 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:51.069
 that in the end is very easy we are here 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.069
 so 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.500
 to me 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.979
 we have a scale of from re 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.979
 until thus 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.580
 and something like that 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.210
