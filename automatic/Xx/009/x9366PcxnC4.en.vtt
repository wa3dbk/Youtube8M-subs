00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.460
 let's go back to question number 143 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.020
 you can define that the files in the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.960
 type jpg 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.630
 are images are opened in a program 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.550
 specific files and gif- type files that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.020
 other types of images are 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.520
 opened by another program 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:40.390
 So here we are a question about 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.640
 standard programs how do I define 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.829
 What is the program that will be the default? 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.330
 of opening a file type 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.030
 come on let's see this in practice there 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.250
 here I am in my work area 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.340
 good people all over my desktop 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.710
 I'm going to zoom in here let's minimize 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.130
 and here I have a file for example 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.409
 some images in png have andré lopes 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.689
 here professor of constitutional law 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.250
 and has luís bívar here professor of 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.820
 criminal proceedings 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.799
 see are png images when click 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.450
 right click on an image 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.880
 people on top of an image on top of 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.659
 a file you have the option to open the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.729
 Image 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.539
 you have the option to edit the file 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.030
 you have several options including options 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.240
 to rename the file also has no 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.189
 name to delete and here below we have 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.200
 file ownership 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.350
 when we go to the property 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.880
 the file automatically appears 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.369
 is the file name giving up to 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.619
 possibility to rename right here 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.359
 the type of file you are viewing 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.209
 Features of Speaking Properties 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.759
 are the characteristics of the file and which 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.249
 is the program that is configured as 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.479
 standard for the opening of this type of 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.240
 png file 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.749
 it is enough that you change your 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.569
 program I will simply modify the 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:07.689
 the opening pattern of that file or 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.360
 either after setting png to open 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.550
 with a specific program I can 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.010
 configure jpg open with other 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.140
 specific program then people 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.400
 question is correct and here it is 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.650
 highlight that when I see the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.420
 properties in addition to viewing the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.370
 type of file and with which program 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.640
 Default I can see a location 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.060
 where the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.250
 size it occupies on the hard disk and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.120
 the day it was created modified and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.390
 accessed 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.069
 Okay, the file's characteristics are good. 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.959
 that I am 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.100
 visualizing at that moment how it is that 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.990
 I got on this screen 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.050
 by right- clicking on the 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.780
 file properties since properties 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.420
 exactly the characteristics of the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.790
 so that this issue is correct 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.350
 I can define that a file type 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 the work with a program of the type of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.790
 open file with another program
