really<00:00:31.470> space<00:00:31.820> if<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.000> attacked<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.750> was

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
really space if I attacked it I was

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.870 
really space if I attacked it I was
probably<00:00:34.469> looking<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.829> at<00:00:35.010> least<00:00:35.100> 200,000

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
probably looking for at least 200,000

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.990 
probably looking for at least 200,000
gold<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.930> yeah<00:00:37.320> maybe<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:38.340> deserve<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
gold so yeah maybe I do deserve the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.889 
gold so yeah maybe I do deserve the
attack<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.890> still<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:42.180> lightning<00:00:42.629> bolts

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
attack but I still think lightning bolts

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.660 
he was stalking me I'm literally within
two<00:01:53.200> minutes<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.740> being<00:01:53.860> offline<00:01:54.250> as<00:01:54.550> I

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
two minutes of being offline as I

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.330 
two minutes of being offline as I
uploaded<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.300> video<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.630> YouTube<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:57.130> was<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
uploaded the video to YouTube it was a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.910 
uploaded the video to YouTube it was a
base<00:01:57.640> review<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.630> he--exactly<00:01:59.140> literally

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
base review and he--exactly literally

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.740 
base review and he--exactly literally
within<00:02:00.070> within<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.000> short<00:02:01.060> space<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.570> time

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
within within that short space of time

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.540 
within within that short space of time
so<00:02:02.110> he<00:02:02.230> must<00:02:02.440> have<00:02:02.500> been<00:02:02.590> watching<00:02:02.980> for<00:02:03.370> when<00:02:03.520> I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
so he must have been watching for when I

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.990 
so he must have been watching for when I
was<00:02:03.730> on<00:02:03.970> an<00:02:04.540> offline<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:06.340> thing<00:02:06.520> he<00:02:06.640> has<00:02:06.790> done

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
was on an offline one thing he has done

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.609 
was on an offline one thing he has done
is<00:02:07.150> show<00:02:07.390> me<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.630> this<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:08.020> bit<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.320> an<00:02:08.410> weak

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
is show me that this a bit of an weak

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.790 
is show me that this a bit of an weak
spot<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.790> that<00:02:09.850> bottom<00:02:10.509> right<00:02:10.690> section<00:02:10.990> for

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
spot in that bottom right section for

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.280 
spot in that bottom right section for
warrior<00:02:12.400> attacks<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.270> maybe<00:02:13.480> I'll<00:02:13.660> move<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
warrior attacks so maybe I'll move the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.860 
warrior attacks so maybe I'll move the
defense<00:02:14.410> which<00:02:14.860> other<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:16.330> protect<00:02:16.630> against

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
defense which other to protect against

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.230 
defense which other to protect against
that<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.140> future<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.040> he<00:02:18.730> did<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.030> same

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
that in the future and he did the same

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.570 
that in the future and he did the same
one<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.720> top<00:02:20.140> left<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.130> failed

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
one for the top left but that failed

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.640 
one for the top left but that failed
because<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.570> can<00:02:22.690> see<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> couple<00:02:23.590> of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
because as you can see a couple of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.460 
because as you can see a couple of
another<00:02:24.010> ten<00:02:24.340> was<00:02:24.610> up<00:02:24.820> there

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
another ten was up there

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.970 
another ten was up there
the<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.610> wall<00:02:27.790> breakers<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.210> no<00:02:28.360> chance<00:02:28.630> so

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the the wall breakers have no chance so

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.820 
the the wall breakers have no chance so
I<00:02:30.480> won<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.600> pond<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.110> fact<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.410> wouldn't<00:02:32.680> have

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
I won the pond in fact I wouldn't have

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.650 
I won the pond in fact I wouldn't have
bothered<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.220> much<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.730> attack<00:02:34.060> maybe

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
bothered that much of this attack maybe

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.060 
bothered that much of this attack maybe
the<00:02:34.840> lightning<00:02:35.020> bolts<00:02:35.320> if<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.620> was<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.920> way

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
the lightning bolts if I was that way

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.090 
the lightning bolts if I was that way
inclined<00:02:36.510> maybe<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.140> Town<00:02:38.380> Hall<00:02:38.650> if<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.980> was

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
inclined maybe the Town Hall if I was

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.440 
inclined maybe the Town Hall if I was
after<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> few<00:02:39.670> champions<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.330> whatever

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
after a few champions for whatever

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.270 
after a few champions for whatever
reason<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> certainly<00:02:41.890> wouldn't<00:02:42.160> have

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
reason but I certainly wouldn't have

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.960 
reason but I certainly wouldn't have
sent<00:02:42.520> in<00:02:42.700> another<00:02:42.850> hundred<00:02:43.240> or<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.720> troops<00:02:44.020> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
sent in another hundred or so troops to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.040 
sent in another hundred or so troops to
try<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.120> take<00:02:46.300> out<00:02:46.560> gold<00:02:47.970> mines<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.330> elixir

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
try and take out gold mines and elixir

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.170 
try and take out gold mines and elixir
ports<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.950> doesn't<00:02:51.640> make<00:02:51.700> sense

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
ports just doesn't make sense

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.000 
ports just doesn't make sense
waste<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.510> time<00:02:52.680> they<00:02:53.680> could<00:02:53.740> have<00:02:53.920> been

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
waste of time they could have been

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.700 
waste of time they could have been
better<00:02:54.190> spent<00:02:54.370> on<00:02:54.640> his<00:02:54.790> next<00:02:55.060> attack<00:02:55.710> so

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
better spent on his next attack so

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.030 
better spent on his next attack so
that's<00:02:56.860> basically<00:02:57.220> it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that's basically it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.440 
that's basically it
failure<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.130> my<00:03:00.250> opinion<00:03:00.670> but<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.120> know<00:03:01.210> he

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
failure in my opinion but you know he

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.720 
failure in my opinion but you know he
got<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.630> stock<00:03:01.870> elixir<00:03:02.230> may<00:03:02.470> be<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:03.400> play<00:03:03.610> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
got a stock elixir may be that play is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.810 
got a stock elixir may be that play is
helping<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.780> rolled<00:03:05.080> up<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.260> Expos<00:03:05.820> and
