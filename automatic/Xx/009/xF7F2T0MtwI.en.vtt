00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
pulled and they're being pulled

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.169 
pulled and they're being pulled
simultaneously<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:26.479> each<00:01:26.660> string<00:01:27.170> as<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:28.460> is

in tune and the cool thing about a
caterer<00:01:35.750> when<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:36.020> pull<00:01:36.289> it<00:01:36.440> up<00:01:36.560> or<00:01:36.860> pull<00:01:37.100> it

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
caterer when you pull it up or pull it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.859 
caterer when you pull it up or pull it
down<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:38.690> hear<00:01:39.020> all<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.530> nuances<00:01:40.869> especially

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
down you hear all the nuances especially

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.630 
down you hear all the nuances especially
when<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.140> hit<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.350> false<00:01:42.740> harmonic<00:01:43.520> or

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
when you hit a false harmonic or

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.630 
when you hit a false harmonic or
whatever<00:01:43.940> like<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.690> hear<00:01:45.429> every<00:01:46.429> nuance

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
whatever like that you hear every nuance

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.779 
whatever like that you hear every nuance
on<00:01:47.090> each<00:01:47.300> string<00:01:48.520> providing<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.670> two

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
on each string providing that two

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.210 
on each string providing that two
guitars<00:01:50.149> set<00:01:50.479> good<00:01:50.810> setup<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:51.979> have<00:01:52.190> a

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
guitars set good setup and you have a

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.419 
guitars set good setup and you have a
quality<00:01:52.700> pickup<00:01:53.149> in<00:01:53.300> there<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.630> just<00:01:53.659> hear

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
quality pickup in there you just hear

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.190 
quality pickup in there you just hear
everything<00:01:55.429> going<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:56.149> coming<00:01:56.630> up<00:01:56.929> or<00:01:57.170> going

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
everything going on coming up or going

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.440 
everything going on coming up or going
down<00:01:57.530> that's<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.670> cool<00:01:58.910> thing<00:01:58.940> about<00:01:59.239> a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
down that's the cool thing about a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.380 
down that's the cool thing about a
character<00:01:59.959> because<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.759> actual<00:02:02.060> bridge

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
character because the actual bridge

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.229 
character because the actual bridge
pieces<00:02:02.690> don't<00:02:03.080> move<00:02:03.319> they<00:02:03.590> were<00:02:03.649> all<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.940> this

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
pieces don't move they were all so this

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.300 
pieces don't move they were all so this
allows<00:02:05.660> for<00:02:06.110> those<00:02:06.229> characters<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.190> really

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
allows for those characters to really

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.210 
allows for those characters to really
pop<00:02:07.700> out<00:02:07.910> even<00:02:08.390> even<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> regular<00:02:09.800> normal

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
pop out even even in a regular normal

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.500 
pop out even even in a regular normal
pickup<00:02:11.379> but<00:02:12.379> a<00:02:12.440> floyd<00:02:14.560> yeah<00:02:16.120> because<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
pickup but a floyd yeah because the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.070 
pickup but a floyd yeah because the
strings<00:02:17.900> go<00:02:18.770> closer<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.300> pickup<00:02:20.900> as

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
strings go closer to the pickup as

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.610 
strings go closer to the pickup as
you're<00:02:21.560> pulling<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.190> floyd<00:02:22.520> up<00:02:22.790> or<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:24.319> you're

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
you're pulling the floyd up or if you're

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.820 
you're pulling the floyd up or if you're
doing<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:25.040> bomb<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:26.629> strings<00:02:27.020> move<00:02:27.440> away<00:02:27.620> from

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
doing a bomb the strings move away from

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.050 
doing a bomb the strings move away from
the<00:02:28.640> pickup<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.650> what<00:02:30.650> happens<00:02:31.069> is<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the pickup and what happens is is the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.860 
the pickup and what happens is is the
pickup<00:02:32.450> will<00:02:32.690> lose<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.819> magnetic<00:02:35.330> field<00:02:35.569> will

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
pickup will lose the magnetic field will

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.500 
pickup will lose the magnetic field will
lose<00:02:36.170> part<00:02:37.099> of<00:02:37.280> what<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.580> string<00:02:37.879> is<00:02:38.030> doing<00:02:38.360> as

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
lose part of what the string is doing as

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.180 
lose part of what the string is doing as
it's<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:39.050> down<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:39.800> moving

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
it's going down because it's moving

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.759 
it's going down because it's moving
farther<00:02:40.459> away<00:02:40.700> now<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.870> but<00:02:42.110> by<00:02:42.500> design

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
farther away now that is but by design

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.350 
farther away now that is but by design
with<00:02:43.370> leo<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:44.060> he<00:02:45.050> wanted<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.560> compensate<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
with leo is he wanted to compensate the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.100 
with leo is he wanted to compensate the
the<00:02:47.690> slack<00:02:47.989> of<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.290> strings<00:02:48.800> as<00:02:49.160> as<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
the slack of the strings as as the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.650 
the slack of the strings as as the
tuning<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.580> low<00:02:52.790> because<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.360> strings

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
tuning is going low because the strings

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.559 
tuning is going low because the strings
are<00:02:53.870> relaxing<00:02:54.550> but<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.879> a<00:02:56.060> high<00:02:56.209> gain

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
are relaxing but in a high gain

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.740 
are relaxing but in a high gain
situation<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:58.550> depending<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.360> pickup

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
situation and depending on the pickup

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.199 
situation and depending on the pickup
you're<00:03:00.590> going<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.890> lose<00:03:01.189> some<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:01.579> that<00:03:01.730> volume

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
you're going to lose some of that volume

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.040 
you're going to lose some of that volume
and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.870 
and
extra<00:03:03.350> everything<00:03:03.920> as<00:03:04.220> you're<00:03:04.490> going<00:03:04.760> down

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
extra everything as you're going down

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.100 
extra everything as you're going down
and<00:03:05.330> relaxing<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.320> springs<00:03:06.620> out<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.900> nice

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
and relaxing the springs out the nice

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.260 
and relaxing the springs out the nice
thing<00:03:09.440> about<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:10.870> pickup<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:13.460> Jim<00:03:14.060> and

thing about the pickup that that Jim and
I<00:03:14.330> had<00:03:14.690> design<00:03:15.350> is<00:03:16.360> I'm<00:03:17.360> still<00:03:17.780> hearing<00:03:18.170> things

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
I had design is I'm still hearing things

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.150 
I had design is I'm still hearing things
as<00:03:19.970> you're<00:03:20.440> pulling<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.470> putting<00:03:22.130> the
