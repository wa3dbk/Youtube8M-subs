00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
put a flash which is again secured by

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.410 
put a flash which is again secured by
that<00:02:16.480> velcro<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.890> plan<00:02:18.159> to<00:02:18.189> put<00:02:18.340> my<00:02:18.459> sb900<00:02:19.299> in

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
that velcro so I plan to put my sb900 in

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.949 
that velcro so I plan to put my sb900 in
there<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.989> another<00:02:21.659> section<00:02:22.659> right<00:02:22.930> here

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
there and another section right here

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.190 
there and another section right here
identical<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.069> another<00:02:24.909> sb900<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:26.019> there

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
identical to that another sb900 in there

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.430 
identical to that another sb900 in there
so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.430 
so
cables<00:02:28.600> getting<00:02:29.600> more<00:02:29.780> than<00:02:29.960> enough<00:02:30.140> room<00:02:30.380> for

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
cables getting more than enough room for

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.410 
cables getting more than enough room for
their<00:02:30.800> maybe<00:02:31.100> put<00:02:31.640> my<00:02:32.330> sekonic<00:02:32.900> light<00:02:33.170> meter

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
their maybe put my sekonic light meter

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.740 
their maybe put my sekonic light meter
because<00:02:35.420> my<00:02:35.720> sekonic<00:02:36.230> el<00:02:37.180> 358<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.240> believe

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
because my sekonic el 358 I believe

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.180 
because my sekonic el 358 I believe
could<00:02:39.530> also<00:02:39.680> meter<00:02:40.640> for<00:02:41.510> video<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.920> will

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
could also meter for video so I will

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.630 
could also meter for video so I will
definitely<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.640> adding<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.330> here
