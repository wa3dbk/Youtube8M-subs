75 80 degrees it's not too bad

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.939 
75 80 degrees it's not too bad
it's<00:00:13.799> been<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> while<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.910> made<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> quick

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
it's been a while so that I made a quick

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:29.620 
it's been a while so that I made a quick
shot<00:00:16.949> video<00:00:17.220> got<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.090> uh<00:00:19.580> oo7<00:00:20.720> Duramax<00:00:23.480> 6.6

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.700 

working<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> check<00:00:31.050> engine<00:00:31.230> light<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
working on a check engine light and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.120 
working on a check engine light and
transmission<00:00:32.579> light<00:00:32.759> being<00:00:33.630> on

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
transmission light being on

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.670 
transmission light being on
so<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:36.320> check<00:00:37.320> codes<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> tech<00:00:38.040> 2<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.520> got<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
so I check codes with a tech 2 and got a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.930 
so I check codes with a tech 2 and got a
code<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.430> believe<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
code I think it was I believe it was a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.610 
code I think it was I believe it was a
p0<00:00:42.809> 960<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> uh<00:00:44.180> still<00:00:45.180> annoyed

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
p0 960 which is uh still annoyed

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.740 
p0 960 which is uh still annoyed
purchasing<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.770> believe<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> PSC<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:49.110> pcs

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.920 

pcs<00:00:57.770> schematics<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.760> was<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> circuit<00:01:00.359> code<00:01:00.570> for

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
pcs schematics it was a circuit code for

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.620 
pcs schematics it was a circuit code for
for<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:04.470> solenoid<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> did<00:01:06.360> was

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
for this the solenoid so what I did was

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990 
for this the solenoid so what I did was
I<00:01:06.689> checked<00:01:07.340> continuity<00:01:08.340> between<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I checked continuity between this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.929 
I checked continuity between this
connect<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.720> connector<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.530> had

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
connect on that connector which I had

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.000 
connect on that connector which I had
between<00:01:11.939> transmission<00:01:12.900> connector<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
between transmission connector and to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.539 
between transmission connector and to
the<00:01:14.159> TCM<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.119> trans<00:01:15.900> control<00:01:16.200> module<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:17.430> was

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the TCM the trans control module it was

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.120 
the TCM the trans control module it was
good<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.320> transmission<00:01:19.770> side

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
good so I got on the transmission side

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
good so I got on the transmission side
and<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:22.290> got<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> well<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> dropped<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.570> pan

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and I got a well so I dropped the pan

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.520 
and I got a well so I dropped the pan
and<00:01:25.110> removed<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.689> wiring<00:01:27.689> harness

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
and removed the the wiring harness

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.080 
and removed the the wiring harness
and<00:01:29.620> try<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.460> look<00:01:30.640> for<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.670> problem<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
and try to look for the problem the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
and try to look for the problem the
wiring<00:01:34.360> problem<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.180> traced<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:39.060> found

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
wiring problem so traced it and found

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.580 
wiring problem so traced it and found
broken<00:01:41.470> work<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.990> if<00:01:47.050> you<00:01:47.110> can<00:01:47.260> see<00:01:47.470> it

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
broken work I know if you can see it

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.560 
broken work I know if you can see it
right<00:01:47.950> there

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.810 

see

right<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.990> Brooklyn<00:02:01.710> water<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.250> actually

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
right there Brooklyn water I actually

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.410 
right there Brooklyn water I actually
opened<00:02:03.480> it<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.870> was<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.080> just<00:02:04.740> broken<00:02:05.420> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
opened it up it was just just broken it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.570 
opened it up it was just just broken it
was<00:02:06.600> intermittent<00:02:07.080> as<00:02:07.170> well<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.310> must<00:02:08.520> be

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
was intermittent as well so I must be

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.250 
was intermittent as well so I must be

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
play-by-play on each one see there's

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.830 
play-by-play on each one see there's
about<00:02:49.830> body

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.760 

ball<00:02:56.380> barking<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.160> pressure<00:02:58.770> solenoids

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
ball barking so the pressure solenoids

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.340 
ball barking so the pressure solenoids
right<00:03:00.010> over<00:03:00.250> there

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.600 

transmission<00:03:05.340> fluid<00:03:05.700> seem<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.210> be<00:03:06.300> okay

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.680 

considering<00:03:10.330> was<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.630> was<00:03:10.750> lacking<00:03:10.960> power<00:03:11.200> in

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
considering was it was lacking power in

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.820 
considering was it was lacking power in
downshifting<00:03:13.690> very<00:03:14.200> funny

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
downshifting very funny

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.930 
downshifting very funny
like<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:19.290> already<00:03:20.290> explained<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:20.740> it<00:03:21.250> was

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
like I already explained but it was

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.340 
like I already explained but it was
acting<00:03:22.180> weird<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.690> he's<00:03:25.810> gonna<00:03:25.930> change<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
acting weird so he's gonna change the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.850 
acting weird so he's gonna change the
harness<00:03:27.120> I've<00:03:28.120> been<00:03:28.270> missing<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.600> lot<00:03:28.780> of

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
harness I've been missing a lot of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.030 
harness I've been missing a lot of
listened<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:30.010> lot<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.630> aftermarket<00:03:31.630> stuff

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
listened to a lot of aftermarket stuff

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.520 
listened to a lot of aftermarket stuff
especially<00:03:33.040> these<00:03:33.160> Chevy's<00:03:34.380> I'm<00:03:35.380> actually

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
especially these Chevy's I'm actually

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.140 
especially these Chevy's I'm actually
starting<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.980> get<00:03:36.040> good<00:03:36.220> at<00:03:36.400> home<00:03:36.550> which<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:36.760> a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
you drop it off the bottom view it's

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.969 
you drop it off the bottom view it's
easier<00:04:48.990> that<00:04:49.110> way<00:04:49.199> it's<00:04:49.349> faster<00:04:49.680> actually

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
easier that way it's faster actually
