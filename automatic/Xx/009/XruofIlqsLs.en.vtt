00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.369
 mh 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.809
 in syria libya the responses that the week 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 This is the emissions piston I recently got a piece of work 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:22.359
 Benedict vacuum cleaner bags pulled out I absolutely can't do it 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.029
 not then 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.599
 how to vacuum cleaner bags 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.339
 needs the unions 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.090
 However, we wish about it 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.300
 stop his investigation 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.640
 for example because 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.899
 set up a working group 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.850
 year on jump 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 I notice that I watch 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.510
 of course you never have the bol simons too old for you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 nevertheless see the sp syria i want 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.270
 i think it is according to simons that in 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.220
 generations 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.059
 because then the agency gets the pro package from my voice we grab 2600 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 have purchased years of young senna from her home 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 this few years 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.570
 I've done 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.570
 the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.410
 I then others 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.410
 that sony has nothing to do with criticism 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.700
 X 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 he is scoring for once 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 we create 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 points up time after time 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.330
 hopefully not either 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 I went after 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.029
 a binding 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.269
 that it won't fit 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 that turned out to be not possible taxi 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.799
 sentiment was depressed by missing a penalty 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.599
 the top salaries 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.599
 it is a familiar face in the player group 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.249
 how high as the teams put on the street 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.959
 much too 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.959
 it is one of the biggest annoyances 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.089
 I lowered the cleaner 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.469
 he was wrong
