00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
parallel with the board this is where

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.510 
parallel with the board this is where
the<00:02:24.480> cleaver<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.870> very<00:02:25.080> good<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.190> want<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
like this with the cleaver and then you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.290 
like this with the cleaver and then you
can<00:02:51.000> quickly<00:02:51.740> chop<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:53.010> core<00:02:53.580> see<00:02:53.730> what's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
can quickly chop this core see what's

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.240 
can quickly chop this core see what's
really<00:02:54.510> important<00:02:55.050> about<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.740> chopping<00:02:56.220> garlic

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
really important about a chopping garlic

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.910 
really important about a chopping garlic
is<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.240> chop<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.690> too<00:02:57.990> fine<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:58.590> if

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
is not to chop it too fine because if

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.710 
is not to chop it too fine because if
you<00:02:59.040> throw<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.520> wok<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.240> very<00:03:00.480> hot

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
you throw it in a wok and it's very hot
