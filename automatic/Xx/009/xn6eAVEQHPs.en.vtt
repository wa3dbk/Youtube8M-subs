00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:05.149
 Jose came to the doctor's office, the brown doctor between the two 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.670
 they are taking my case 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.760
 is a patient the oldest who is 81 years old and who started with the 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.899
 palpitations 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.499
 she about five years ago the initially episodes of 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:21.559
 palpitations was very important costa brava a little time i the amauta 

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:26.310
 limited however with time because the fight began to walk more frequent 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.289
 the something more lasting 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.890
 and that's why we started to treat it with racks 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.260
 and sabin clinical etxea 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 with one that took me several days 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.560
 cardioversion 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.490
 and since then I am in treatment with them I am delighted myself 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.880
 initially we started taking are crazy antiarrhythmic to try 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.729
 avoid 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.490
 episodes of arrhythmia 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.770
 the tolerance the drugs because it was not perfect your some side effects 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.240
 always younger minors 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.839
 so in the end we change strategy 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:00:59.590
 and we have 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.090
 put a treatment that what it does is control the heart rate 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.579
 fabulous 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.310
 that I am very comfortable 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.430
 I have not had problems at the moment I have no opinion I'm sorry 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 little that says nothing less acquires these elections 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.950
 he has noticed again palpitations noted arrhythmia not 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.370
 nothing at all like west wind 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.740
 and everything is going on wheels some problem with the pills that took some of 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.070
 the last hand no any norm and the population that such 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 provides I think it is the best because it highlighted that the United States has grown 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.180
 are contaminated as they are contracts for changes in medication 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.510
 jolie come from the moncloa cameron metro 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.479
 iym 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.140
 the injured but never spent as much as 40 years 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.420
 dizziness or dollars each with another 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.790
 nothing nothing nothing nothing the truth is that there is in the vineyard is very well controlled 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.369
 now 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.310
 with this changes that we made in the current legislation 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.180
 and it seems that things are going very well so I think that for now 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.979
 We will continue with the same treatment and know that you take a pill to 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.979
 to be anticoagulated to protect it from 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.979
 of emboli or thrombi 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 and the other pills to control the fight so that the heart rate and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.760
 the fight is controlled and with that the thing is going very well so let's continue 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.370
 with the same strategy we will not make any change in the medication 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.859
 because I think we have given sector set 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.199
 with the class 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.970
 with this new treatment 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 the truth is that we have gotten a bowl a troll of his symptomatology 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.730
 i good already saw mixed that is very well that is a life completely 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.319
 normal that tolerates the medication well and that there has not been any kind of 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.980
 complication we can not go to venezuela in winter 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.130
 we are cobos this Christmas and from 10 to 12 we are dancing 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.599
 and good we go 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.799
 I would like to emphasize that 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.629
 that atrial fibrillation is a very frequent line 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.920
 Although not all patients are the same, the main message is that it is 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.119
 a fight usually benign 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.810
 i though it can be annoying nowadays 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.850
 or with drugs or even ablation 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.200
 percent we can control the symptoms to a large extent 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.859
 and avoid the complicated ones like embolisms
