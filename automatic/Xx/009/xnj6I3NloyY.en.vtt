00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 House 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.450
 here we have a press 40 by 60 a 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.780
 flat press 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.540
 we have here a kraft paper on top of 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.770
 below, just so you do not have to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.280
 not stain stamp not leave any marks on 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.909
 thermal blanket below and here a blanket 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.060
 That's it, and here we have a 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.060
 silicone cover only for power 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.790
 make this process the best 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.680
 possible 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.599
 I'll warm up here a little bit the role already 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.730
 printed with the image we chose 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.230
 It should be noted that the image has to be 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.050
 in high resolution 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.630
 it is important that it be 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.860
 the resolution there some 300 stands for the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.100
 less ok then we 'll use here 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.890
 this image that has already been mirrored see 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.680
 that it is already mirrored, it is 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.800
 way different from what is original and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.150
 we'll put it on that mouse pad 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.120
 and let's think about the heat needed and the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.770
 temperature needed to work 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.190
 with this product is the temperature of 200 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.210
 degrees and 20 seconds the time of 20 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
 seconds 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.650
 then you can easily configure 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.300
 in your house 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.300
 this time of 20 seconds and the heat of 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:16.020
 200 degrees under attack is correct to place 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:20.660
 here you can use it in the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.970
 your home a crepe tape or a label 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:34.110
 of paper as we are using 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:36.709
 here to make this process easy 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.709
 and succeed 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.020
 placing down here also so that 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.100
 at the time that the low people to the press 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.100
 the paper in the ground 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.220
 So, what to fix, see that it's fixed. 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:06.400
 in well-established law 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.780
 we go then presses to centralize that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:15.040
 this paper 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:17.250
 and then we will then think about that 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.820
 mouse pad 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.280
 the image that we have already printed mirrored 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.080
 on your printer you will see there 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.639
 you have the choice between me and the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.479
 ie does not need to configure 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.580
 this will not reverse the image itself 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.699
 manually in your program from your 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.789
 preference we will not download here the 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.789
 press 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.570
 she already started counting there is fine 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:55.720
 simple procedure 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:59.370
 see that our haste also shows 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.260
 very clear and clear 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.260
 about marcelo tadeu 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:14.139
 we raised the press here for then 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.740
 we see the result of our work in the 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.740
 our stretch 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:27.110
 they will take care of it very carefully 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:33.220
 because it's hot enough that you drop 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:35.990
 here quite calmly on one side only 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.490
 To the other 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.490
 dropping everything 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.050
 useful access very careful when releasing 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:53.180
 because it is very fragile and here is our 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:58.460
