00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 there were androids as you are welcome to 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.609
 a new video in this quick video I'm going 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.230
 to play two songs that are very 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 important and that I want everyone 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.280
 you participate before this 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.049
 I want to say that the video on the subject 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
 today I am going to upload it a little more 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.440
 late than usual usually not 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.390
 I usually go up at the beginning of the afternoon 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 Spanish but there are not many people who 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
 still in america today I'm going to chosen 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.840
 take it out at the beginning of the afternoon 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.210
 American that coincides with the one and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 half an hour Spanish is basically for 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.779
 do a test to see how it goes 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.730
 then let's move on to the important issues 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.469
 today the first thing I want to say is 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 that these last weeks I am 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.100
 developing something very important and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 pretty billet for the community but at 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 see what you will end up liking is outside of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.700
 youtube and notice then basically on 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 youtube we already have almost half a million 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 members in the community but on twitter 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.620
 and Facebook 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.410
 We are on Twitter 20,000 and on Facebook 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 almost 50,000 that are quite more numbers 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 small ones that we have on youtube 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.920
 so today I'm going to ask you something 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 you know that not only ask that all 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.550
 that you see this video independently 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.049
 of whether the jedis or not I would like that is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.320
 an oasis in the community in these two 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.120
 platforms not only to support something 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.640
 for example if you follow me on twitter every 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.620
 day published quite a few tweets that are going 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 to interest as well as the ix pretty 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.460
 recommended so you can be useful 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.990
 so in the description I'll leave you the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.540
 two links so that all of you 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 bound together apart from that I want to comment on a 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.110
 question he has asked me during the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 last months a lot of people and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.410
 I think it's too important 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.970
 like to answer on an android 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.710
 answer that by the way I'm already 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.290
 finishing doing the second chapter 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.300
 that I will upload shortly the question is 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.090
 why have you left undone tops 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.100
 better applications or doing so many 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.220
 as you did before this has a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.869
 very simple explanation everything depends on 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.759
 he is saying these are the quality of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.430
 applications that you can teach and this 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.649
 the quality is not obvious that if you go up 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.840
 many applications the average quality of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.759
 these will be low and if you raise a few you are 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 choosing and sorting a little better 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.040
 then this has been a decision that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.930
 I took a few months ago to do 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.119
 fewer videos but with applications 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.670
 really recommended because if you look 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.860
 a bit on youtube there are many youtubers 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.840
 of android as well as to ask for various 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.390
 things that teach you each 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.599
 few days or every week a top of 10 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.970
 best applications can be free 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.739
 best apps of the week but 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.930
 they really are applications really 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.030
 good is to say these are all 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.099
 applications that google plate these 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.530
 are the ones that you can say strings and these 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.239
 They are very good so I prefer 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.160
 teach only the very good ones because 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.959
 because it can do like the others and every 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.120
 week teach many applications that 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.310
 they are good that is at first sight host 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.989
 it looks cool but after all 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.420
 these youtubers in three months have you 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.989
 taught two hundred applications and if you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.150
 accounts out of a month you have two three 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.739
 four of these applications and they make you 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.870
 somehow wasting time though 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.910
 I also understand that it entertains the fact 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.260
 to watch the video and maybe this is why 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.480
 you catch it in the comments 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.819
 I ended up doing it or not then if I 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.129
 as I tell you, I prefer and teach only 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.930
 the applications that really out of 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.150
 you will keep a time because they are the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.470
 really useful before I did enough 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.360
 more videos because there were these 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.120
 applications schools to cover and clear 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.530
 Well, I had not covered them and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.180
 I'm teaching them until a 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.209
 moment that there was no more obvious 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.680
 every time they come out new and 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.750
 best and really recommended 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.459
 applications in google play as well as in 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.560
 the idea forum that is from where 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.239
 the good ones really come out and that's 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 I'm covering and until now he has preferred 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.010
 teach the good ones that are applications 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.409
 that may be ok but that really 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.030
 you end up uninstalling because they are not 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.799
 really so good then I'm 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.659
 open to leave me in the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.310
 comments your opinion is maybe 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.530
 because I am the kind of person who 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.359
 I want to keep my phone pretty clean 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.400
 in fact they can be enough 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.319
 applications but I have very few and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.659
 every time I change rom and installed the 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.659
 10 months necessary but if all 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.609
 you will be to have 60 100 150 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.829
 applications and I leave it here in the 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.450
 comments I'm open make more tops 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.159
 from weekly applications to your 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.959
 then taste up here a quick 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.579
 take away from today I wanted to comment on this that the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.650
 today's video that you will like very much and 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.810
 it will be quite interesting to receive inside 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.549
 of a few hours and then under the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.760
 description in the description forgiveness os 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.170
 I'll leave in the two kings for 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.760
 so that you can join in the community in the 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.700
 two twitter platforms youtube this 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.500
 it's a favor that I ask of you and finally I 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.480
 I would like you to leave closed comments 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.950
 put to think about it on whether 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.750
 you want me to continue teaching 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.580
 applications as I have done so far or 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.610
 move on to teach more applications not 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.870
 would teach 10 a week or 20 but 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.550
 simply if the 5 or already having 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.860
 rated a little but teaching more 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.720
 with which I am teaching so far 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.160
 so here's the video today I hope 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.020
 that you liked it and if so, no 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.820
 forget to give him a good like to help 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.010
 the community but android to following 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.010
 day after day until the next androids
