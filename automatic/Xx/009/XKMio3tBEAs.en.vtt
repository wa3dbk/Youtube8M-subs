his experience until his next level was
level<00:02:21.060> is

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
level is

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.730 
level is
scouting<00:02:22.940> report

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
scouting report

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.950 
scouting report
and<00:02:24.830> all<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.520> great<00:02:25.670> stuff<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.570> here<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
and all that great stuff and here is the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.280 
and all that great stuff and here is the
attributes<00:02:29.960> screen<00:02:30.440> basically<00:02:31.400> um<00:02:32.470> here<00:02:33.470> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
attributes screen basically um here is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.030 
attributes screen basically um here is
is<00:02:34.379> where<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.769> can't<00:02:35.010> apply<00:02:35.780> skill<00:02:36.780> points<00:02:37.319> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
is where you can't apply skill points to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.149 
is where you can't apply skill points to
increase<00:02:38.489> your<00:02:38.519> attributes<00:02:39.530> over<00:02:40.530> time<00:02:40.799> it's

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
increase your attributes over time it's

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.040 
increase your attributes over time it's
still<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.700> will<00:02:41.969> cost<00:02:42.269> more

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
still it will cost more

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.990 
still it will cost more
and<00:02:44.140> there<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.860> term<00:02:45.250> for<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:45.850> called

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
and there is a term for it it's called

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.300 
and there is a term for it it's called
soft<00:02:46.330> capping<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.410> can<00:02:47.650> look<00:02:47.830> at<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.010> in

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
soft capping but you can look at that in

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.600 
soft capping but you can look at that in
the<00:02:48.430> guide<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:50.110> right<00:02:50.320> now

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
the guide all right now

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.380 
the guide all right now
back<00:02:52.210> on<00:02:52.390> track<00:02:52.750> yeah<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.440> add<00:02:54.000> any<00:02:55.000> skill

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
back on track yeah you add any skill

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.050 
back on track yeah you add any skill
points<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.720> want<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.170> reunit<00:02:56.470> desire<00:02:56.830> now<00:02:57.790> i'm

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
points you want to reunit desire now i'm

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.360 
points you want to reunit desire now i'm
going<00:02:58.240> to<00:02:58.300> show<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.420> about<00:02:58.720> training<00:02:59.370> all

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
going to show you about training all

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.980 
going to show you about training all
right<00:03:00.580> there<00:03:00.910> are<00:03:01.060> two<00:03:01.300> types<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.720> training

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
right there are two types of training

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.630 
right there are two types of training
there<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.560> no<00:03:02.740> more<00:03:02.890> training<00:03:03.250> there's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
there is no more training there's

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.480 
there is no more training there's
intense<00:03:04.000> training<00:03:04.440> each<00:03:05.440> cost<00:03:05.860> training

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
intense training each cost training

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.750 
intense training each cost training
points<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:07.420> gauge<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:08.470> training<00:03:08.950> points<00:03:09.220> each

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
points you gauge to training points each

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.410 
points you gauge to training points each
day<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:11.280> now<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.340> difference<00:03:12.580> about<00:03:13.000> normal

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
day and now the difference about normal

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.660 
day and now the difference about normal
and<00:03:13.630> intense<00:03:14.220> normal<00:03:15.510> takes<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:17.670> training

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
and intense normal takes to training

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.260 
and intense normal takes to training
points<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.209> intense<00:03:19.990> 65<00:03:20.700> but<00:03:21.700> normally<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
points and intense 65 but normally you

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.020 
points and intense 65 but normally you
only<00:03:22.330> train<00:03:22.870> one<00:03:23.410> attribute<00:03:23.800> but<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.820> gain<00:03:25.000> a

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
only train one attribute but you gain a

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.840 
only train one attribute but you gain a
little<00:03:25.390> activity<00:03:26.020> after<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.010> with<00:03:27.430> intense

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
little activity after and with intense

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.720 
little activity after and with intense
you<00:03:28.300> train<00:03:28.720> two<00:03:29.200> attributes<00:03:29.860> but<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.520> don't

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
you train two attributes but you don't

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.090 
you train two attributes but you don't
get<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:30.880> activity<00:03:31.239> but<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.440> intense<00:03:32.890> you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
get that activity but with intense you

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.370 
get that activity but with intense you
gain<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.280> bonus<00:03:33.670> token<00:03:34.000> after<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.840> gain<00:03:35.080> for

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
gain a bonus token after you gain for

gain a bonus token after you gain for
bonus<00:03:35.650> tokens<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:36.220> get<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.930> plus-5<00:03:37.930> temporary

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
bonus tokens you get a plus-5 temporary

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.320 
bonus tokens you get a plus-5 temporary
boost<00:03:38.530> an<00:03:38.800> attribute<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.760> gain<00:03:40.000> one
