00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.199 
stick but we'll see how we get on with
this<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.409> was<00:03:05.069> going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.280> try<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> q10<00:03:05.970> but

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
this one I was going to try the q10 but

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.490 
this one I was going to try the q10 but
after<00:03:06.450> having<00:03:06.569> buddy<00:03:06.810> experience<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.439> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
after having buddy experience with the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.309 
after having buddy experience with the
z10<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.159> decided<00:03:08.879> against<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.389> so<00:03:09.989> we'll<00:03:10.170> see

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
z10 I decided against it so we'll see

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.520 
z10 I decided against it so we'll see
how<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.439> q5<00:03:11.310> works<00:03:11.609> out<00:03:12.409> hopefully<00:03:13.409> it's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
how the q5 works out hopefully it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.440 
how the q5 works out hopefully it's
pretty<00:03:13.739> decent<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.280> littler<00:03:15.000> thing<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.420> that

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450
