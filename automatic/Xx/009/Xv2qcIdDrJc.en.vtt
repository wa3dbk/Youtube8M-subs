today is that this update is for the
players<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.559> perhaps<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.610> may<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.030> accurate<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
players or perhaps it may be accurate to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.290 
players or perhaps it may be accurate to
say<00:00:54.840> against<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> actually<00:00:56.640> goes<00:00:57.030> back

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
kind of have a theory about the red

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160

dragon<00:01:02.219> being<00:01:02.520> added<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.059> some<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
dragon being added and some of that you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
dragon being added and some of that you
know<00:01:04.290> maybe<00:01:04.589> confirmed<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> later<00:01:05.670> update<00:01:06.119> or

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
know maybe confirmed and later update or

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.469

whatever<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.680> uh<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.640> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.939> goes<00:01:09.060> back<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
whatever but uh it kind of goes back to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
whatever but uh it kind of goes back to
the<00:01:09.630> screenshot<00:01:10.409> also<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> talked<00:01:11.490> about

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the screenshot also that I talked about

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880 
the screenshot also that I talked about
green<00:01:12.240> shot<00:01:12.540> goes<00:01:12.900> back<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> tweet<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.770> was

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
green shot goes back to a tweet that was

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
green shot goes back to a tweet that was
made<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> few<00:01:14.340> days<00:01:14.520> earlier<00:01:15.030> than<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
made a few days earlier than that and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.140 
made a few days earlier than that and
the<00:01:16.049> tweets<00:01:16.350> dated<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.220> may<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.729> seem<00:01:18.090> like

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the tweets dated this may not seem like

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.960 
the tweets dated this may not seem like
anything<00:01:18.659> significant<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.830> trust<00:01:20.159> me<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
anything significant but trust me it is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.730 
anything significant but trust me it is
so<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> screenshot<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> says

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
can have that when you're writing code

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.130 
can have that when you're writing code
from<00:02:53.200> scratch<00:02:53.350> but<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.730> circular<00:02:55.630> motion

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.810 
from scratch but that circular motion
that<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.320> Enderdragon<00:02:57.010> does<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.520> something

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
that the Enderdragon does is something

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.970 
that the Enderdragon does is something
that<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.120> witnessed<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.750> lot<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.410> console

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that is witnessed a lot in console

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.840 
that is witnessed a lot in console
addition<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.780> that's<00:03:01.780> kind<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.580> where<00:03:03.580> we

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
addition and that's kind of where we

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.050 
addition and that's kind of where we
lead<00:03:04.060> off<00:03:04.209> right<00:03:04.450> now<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.790> they<00:03:06.790> are

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
lead off right now is that they are

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.370 
lead off right now is that they are
updating<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:08.730> Enderdragon<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:10.209> us<00:03:10.630> how

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
updating the Enderdragon to us how

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.550 
updating the Enderdragon to us how
similar<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.100> on<00:03:12.580> console<00:03:13.180> addition<00:03:13.600> now

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
similar it is to on console addition now

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.830 
similar it is to on console addition now
as<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.520> now<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:16.030> am<00:03:16.480> still<00:03:17.320> skeptical<00:03:18.010> about

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
as of now I am still skeptical about

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.509 
as of now I am still skeptical about
that's<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.200> being<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.739> that's<00:03:20.980> all<00:03:21.220> they're

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
that's just being it that's all they're

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.520 
that's just being it that's all they're
doing<00:03:21.550> I<00:03:21.940> am<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.420> do<00:03:22.870> think<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.260> there's<00:03:23.470> gonna

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
doing I am I do think that there's gonna

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.310 
doing I am I do think that there's gonna
be<00:03:23.680> more<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.190> than<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.489> making<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.750> how<00:03:26.050> it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
be more to it than just making it how it

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.340 
be more to it than just making it how it
is<00:03:26.350> on<00:03:26.709> minecraft<00:03:27.489> console<00:03:28.140> one<00:03:29.140> of<00:03:29.230> those

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.050 
is on minecraft console one of those
things<00:03:29.500> I'm<00:03:29.890> still<00:03:30.130> holding<00:03:30.580> onto<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.910> that

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
things I'm still holding onto is that

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.820 
things I'm still holding onto is that
they<00:03:31.180> might<00:03:31.330> be<00:03:31.480> adding<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.840> new<00:03:32.050> boss<00:03:32.290> or<00:03:32.650> the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
they might be adding a new boss or the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.280 
they might be adding a new boss or the
red<00:03:33.010> dragon<00:03:33.250> or<00:03:33.670> whatever<00:03:34.360> there's<00:03:34.959> gonna<00:03:35.110> be

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
red dragon or whatever there's gonna be

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.900 
red dragon or whatever there's gonna be
more<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:35.830> than<00:03:36.100> just<00:03:36.160> adding<00:03:36.640> different

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
more to it than just adding different

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.550 
more to it than just adding different
movement<00:03:37.750> tracking<00:03:38.709> um<00:03:39.630> stuff<00:03:40.630> or<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:40.989> know

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
movement tracking um stuff or you know

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.400 
movement tracking um stuff or you know
making<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.519> there's<00:03:43.420> an<00:03:43.630> animation<00:03:44.019> at<00:03:44.290> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
making it so there's an animation at the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.720 
making it so there's an animation at the
end<00:03:44.560> when<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.799> blows<00:03:44.950> up<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:45.610> there's

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
end when it blows up I think there's

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.300 
end when it blows up I think there's
going<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.940> be<00:03:46.000> more<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.440> um<00:03:47.709> that's
