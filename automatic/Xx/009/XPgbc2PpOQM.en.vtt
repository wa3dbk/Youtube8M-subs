00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 in the end reflects a scope 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.960
 neeman lawyer phil sports paris 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.269
 except that our leader Eric 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 hammer and a late winter so the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.510
 happiness is the person who is on board 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.330
 of the helicopter that is responsible for 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.119
 arming so in this case the mac 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.480
 like the one here in front of me who 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.429
 serves for protection and is two people 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.579
 on the ground is the only protection 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.829
 the device and we are still working on 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.710
 the orders of course the commander of 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.850
 photo edge that one hour centris that is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.030
 of his six who plant innovative taxes at the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.469
 level of night vision one at the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 torture cat hours of light that is 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.430
 adapted on the headphones and we also have on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.840
 the mag night sighting system 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.760
 holographic and laser beam which 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.260
 allows us to make a destination the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.710
 more precise possible from the goal to 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.070
 reach 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 when one has to draw international 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.340
 final this is reflected in the rucks and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.840
 eric spinning to an antenna in the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.540
 exercise framework here what is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.920
 interesting for us is that there is the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.780
 first thing is the climate so we 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.299
 can work in a very climate 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.220
 hot to get used a bit because 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 despite everything he is still very 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.939
 hot on board the aircraft we have a whole 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
 pretty heavy equipment on us so what 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.240
 which makes it necessary to have a little bit 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.540
 the habit we have the opportunity to train 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.390
 this here and eventually would proceed 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.280
 to shots at sea which is a small 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.189
 little more difficult especially at the level 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 versions of distances in the lead and this 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.009
 is not dallas one has the opportunity to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.689
 meet colleagues from other 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.149
 nations and to make exchanges with 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.049
 them at the level of working methods 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.310
 which are very interesting and my faith 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.630
 with that I think we are able to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.759
 do a good job with all 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.219
 all the other nations and between

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.770
 diagonally active and so here are fruits
