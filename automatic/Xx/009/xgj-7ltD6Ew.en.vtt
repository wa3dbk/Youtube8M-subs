polish out the concrete and so that you

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.959 
polish out the concrete and so that you
get<00:00:52.239> these<00:00:52.449> exposed<00:00:53.289> aggregates<00:00:53.920> where<00:00:54.460> you

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
get these exposed aggregates where you

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.560 
get these exposed aggregates where you
placed<00:00:55.570> let's<00:00:55.809> say<00:00:55.929> glass<00:00:56.260> in<00:00:56.530> this<00:00:56.649> case<00:00:56.920> and

placed let's say glass in this case and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.240 
placed let's say glass in this case and
expose<00:00:58.570> some<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.899> aggregate<00:00:59.289> this<00:00:59.920> is<00:01:00.129> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
expose some of the aggregate this is the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.849 
expose some of the aggregate this is the
tool<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.699> does<00:01:00.910> that<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.359> then<00:01:01.929> takes<00:01:02.499> it<00:01:02.679> up

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
tool that does that and then takes it up

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.520 
tool that does that and then takes it up
and<00:01:03.129> polishes<00:01:03.910> it<00:01:04.089> out<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.869> it's<00:01:05.019> smooth

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
and polishes it out so that it's smooth

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.950 
and polishes it out so that it's smooth
is<00:01:05.940> polished<00:01:06.940> granite<00:01:09.300> these<00:01:10.300> are<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.600> pads

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
is polished granite these are the pads

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.649 
is polished granite these are the pads
that<00:01:11.289> are<00:01:11.380> used<00:01:11.649> with<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.039> polisher<00:01:12.640> okay<00:01:13.479> I

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
that are used with this polisher okay I

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.580 
that are used with this polisher okay I
have<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.590> here<00:01:15.039> a<00:01:15.179> 50<00:01:16.179> grit<00:01:16.390> pad<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.960> it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
have on here a 50 grit pad and it's

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.219 
have on here a 50 grit pad and it's
adhered<00:01:18.190> with<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:18.429> hook<00:01:18.789> and<00:01:19.000> loop<00:01:19.060> system<00:01:19.840> this

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
adhered with a hook and loop system this

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.999 
adhered with a hook and loop system this
quick-release<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.490> so<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.180> can<00:01:22.360> take<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.780> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
quick-release and so you can take this a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.190 
quick-release and so you can take this a
50<00:01:24.009> grit<00:01:24.280> which<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.829> corss<00:01:26.829> pad<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
50 grit which is the corss pad and you

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.620 
50 grit which is the corss pad and you
put<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:29.860> here<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.340> there's<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.119> hole<00:01:31.329> in<00:01:31.540> it

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
put it on here and there's a hole in it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.690 
put it on here and there's a hole in it
and<00:01:31.840> what<00:01:32.680> does<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.920> hold<00:01:33.159> for<00:01:33.219> it's<00:01:33.549> a

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
and what does that hold for it's a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.550 
and what does that hold for it's a
central<00:01:34.420> water<00:01:34.659> feed<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:35.320> goes<00:01:35.439> through

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
central water feed so it goes through

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.510 
central water feed so it goes through
that<00:01:35.740> hole<00:01:35.950> now<00:01:37.320> once<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.469> go<00:01:38.680> with<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> 50<00:01:39.340> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
that hole now once I go with a 50 and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.490 
that hole now once I go with a 50 and
I've<00:01:39.579> polished<00:01:39.880> them<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.479> polished<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.380> out

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
I've polished them and polished it out

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.740 
I've polished them and polished it out
and<00:01:41.680> I'm<00:01:41.770> exposing<00:01:42.310> some<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.880> aggregate

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
and I'm exposing some of the aggregate

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.020 
and I'm exposing some of the aggregate
to<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.409> level<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.920> want<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.520> would

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
to the level that I want I would

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.020 
to the level that I want I would
transfer<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.229> hundred<00:01:48.009> grit<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.490> then<00:01:49.000> I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
transfer to a hundred grit and then I

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.660 
transfer to a hundred grit and then I
would<00:01:49.240> go<00:01:49.390> up<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.869> polish<00:01:50.259> out<00:01:50.469> and<00:01:50.770> go<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.950> 200

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
would go up and polish out and go to 200

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.480 
would go up and polish out and go to 200
400<00:01:52.570> 800<00:01:53.880> 1500<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.030> at<00:01:55.860> 1500<00:01:56.860> you're<00:01:57.250> going<00:01:57.430> to

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
400 800 1500 and at 1500 you're going to

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.429 
400 800 1500 and at 1500 you're going to
start<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.850> get<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.060> sheen<00:01:58.539> on<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.860> surface<00:02:01.439> what

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
start to get a sheen on the surface what

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.620 
start to get a sheen on the surface what
is<00:02:02.469> essential<00:02:02.979> about<00:02:03.219> this<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.420> can

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
is essential about this is that you can

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.870 
is essential about this is that you can
see<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.049> almost<00:02:05.350> like<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> tire<00:02:06.100> tread<00:02:06.549> here
