00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.009
 good afternoon dear friends today we are 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.130
 talk about how to check 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:11.280
 video card performance for example 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.080
 we want to buy a video card with hands and not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.800
 I would like to buy a cat in a bag 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.779
 here we can test it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.170
 and be sure that this video card is still 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.630
 long serve you or we want to sell 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.359
 your computer and also want to be 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 confident that he is still in 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 good condition and even require 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.960
 good price for it and so for us for 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.190
 you need it below this video you will find 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.989
 link to the site ozon 3d. no where are we 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.110
 we can download a program called 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.750
 Full mark below on the page we find 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.140
 here we press the latest version 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.140
 move on 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 download here 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.970
 here and click on the dollar button after 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.510
 how the program downloaded our 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.460
 the computer here we see I excluded on 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.100
 desktop 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.100
 run and continue to set next 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.130
 further further 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.100
 Further 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.000
 and installation 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.390
 here is the finish line after installation opens 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.340
 here is a window here we choose 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.440
 resolution 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.920
 screen resolution is my case to me here 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.630
 such permission and here below about the chance 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.890
 or settings 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.950
 very carefully put ticks here 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.170
 we are interested in the first and third tick 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.619
 in no case do not put 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.060
 extreme birth is very dangerous in essence 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.399
 You can even burn your video card here 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.039
 first we set the resolution here these two 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.000
 checkboxes they essentially cost and click 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.619
 bird in test warning that 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.459
 the computer may shut down 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 reboot 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.300
 we press go and before us appears here 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.660
 such a lovely striped bagel and how 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.400
 we see our video card is exposed 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.110
 incredible loads and we can 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.070
 watch as it rises 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.340
 temperature after 8 minutes 20 seconds we 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.820
 we see that the temperature of our video card is not 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.739
 exceeds 70 degrees is very good 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.640
 figure it says that our 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 the graphics card is very well maintained and so 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.020
 dear friends here so we can 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.640
 test our video card if 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.980
 we have a temperature range up to 95 degrees 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.130
 this is a very good indicator of good 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.650
 video cards if higher then you need to do 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.730
 respectively, and the conclusions on this all 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.730
 good luck bye
