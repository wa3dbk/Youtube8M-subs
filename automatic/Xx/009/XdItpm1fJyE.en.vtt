00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
does a lot of work and because it is a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.959 
does a lot of work and because it is a
slight<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.649> better<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.640> when<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.939> comes

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
slight bit better you know when it comes

slight bit better you know when it comes
down<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> firing<00:02:00.659> rate<00:02:00.990> than<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> 870<00:02:01.799> at

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
down to firing rate than the 870 at

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
down to firing rate than the 870 at
least<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.280> opinion<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.759> find<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.180> it's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
least in my opinion I find out that it's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
least in my opinion I find out that it's
a<00:02:03.479> lot<00:02:03.630> easier<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.079> deal<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> 870<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
a lot easier to deal with in the 870 it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520 
a lot easier to deal with in the 870 it
doesn't<00:02:05.909> mean<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.180> better<00:02:06.360> than<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> 870<00:02:07.380> at

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
doesn't mean it's better than the 870 at

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.169 
doesn't mean it's better than the 870 at
all<00:02:08.069> means<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.849> saying<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
all means and I'm not just saying it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.669 
all means and I'm not just saying it
because<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:09.840> pump<00:02:10.080> action<00:02:10.289> is

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
because you know it's pump action is

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.730 
because you know it's pump action is
pretty<00:02:10.890> badass<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.459> snipers<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:12.140> trololo
