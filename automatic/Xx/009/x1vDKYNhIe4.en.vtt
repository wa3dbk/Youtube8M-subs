00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello to all of you guys as usual 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.539
 they are basic and welcome on spaces and techs 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.160
 today I want to show you how to replace the 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.529
 thermal paste of your video card 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.179
 this is an operation that I recommend 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.470
 do since in many cases pasta 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.660
 thermal that is put by the houses 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.550
 producing and of low quality and not 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.109
 plays at work as it should 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.929
 in fact it happened to me some time ago with the 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.129
 my old zotac gtx 550 ti ai che 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.260
 during the game sessions la 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.270
 temperature also reaches 90 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.030
 degrees is an autosilo of thermal paste 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.030
 the temperature has stabilized at 65 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.140
 so I gained a good 25 degrees of course 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.210
 with this I am not telling you that 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.620
 by doing this you will recover 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.820
 of 25 degrees 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.980
 also because mine was a case 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.620
 isolated but still better than 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.879
 your temperatures definitely for 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.309
 start this operation you need 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.510
 of a star screwdriver to be able to 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.179
 unscrew the screws that hold the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.859
 heatsink attached to the board a 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.570
 cloth a tablecloth or anything 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.790
 soft where to place the video card 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.440
 to do this so 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.120
 not to damage the circuits and to 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.480
 example I will use an old mat 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.530
 of the mouse and finally the thermal paste 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.790
 seen using what I was 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.780
 supplied with the heat sink of the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.340
 processor 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.230
 in case you are lacking you can 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.220
 buying it online on sites like amazon is 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.980
 nice so on 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.920
 at just under 10 euros we can well 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.810
 first of all let's place the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.850
 our video card with the plate towards 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.760
 up to locate the four screws 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.500
 that keep the heat sink connected 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.600
 once identified we proceed to challenge them 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.580
 it is little by little with the medium from ics 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.990
 that is, how you are seeing in the video if 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.880
 first started with those at the top a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.980
 right after previous with those in 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.360
 bottom left, and so on in such a way 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.320
 to avoid that the square can be in 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.320
 somehow hurt 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.930
 once ready to the four videos vi 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.300
 you will realize that you can give it to yourself 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.740
 unplugged now you need to disconnect the plug 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.600
 fan power supply 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:36.410
 I recommend gently to avoid 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.850
 to damage it may have done this 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.470
 you have removed the sink you can 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.200
 see the gpu covered with the old one 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.660
 thermal switch you will have to remove it 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.100
 I use a common soft handkerchief 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.690
 new you could also use 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.460
 cotton soaked in some calculation for 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.840
 do a more precise and non- precise job 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.320
 leave no institution of the old 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.320
 that's enough 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.750
 Well 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.660
 after cleaning to drink read more with 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.900
 the same method also polishes the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.900
 heatsink 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.690
 well it is not that there are no more residues 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.100
 of vast thermal on all the two 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.180
 components we can apply that 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.830
 new 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.570
 there are various methods to apply it myself 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.910
 I consider the method of the more effective 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.710
 rice grain the method of which 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.750
 shared consists in applying to 100 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.130
 and the gpu a big drop when a 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.600
 grain of disappointment 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.280
 doing so when we will avoid them 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.260
 team in the card will be the pressure 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.740
 extended to spread the dough in a way 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.000
 homogeneous and without unnecessary waste and after 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.310
 having folded the dough we can 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.750
 then reattach the heatsink 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.820
 proceed to reconnect the connector 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.540
 of the food and we position the 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.540
 card on the heatsink 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.520
 on screen of the screws always using the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.170
 half by hicks is a very thing 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.850
 important when habitat and vines is of 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.590
 don't tighten too strong because this is the case 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.459
 doing so could damage the gastro or 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.459
 even worse 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.040
 done this you have finished the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.540
 replacement of thermal paste e 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.780
 you can send names in the video cards 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.070
 on your pc 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.840
 well i hope this tutorial is there 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.920
 it was useful maybe to register June i 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.170
 comments it was decided to carry out 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.120
 this operation or if he already had it 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.950
 made in case let me know though 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.120
 have you noticed any improvements or 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.350
 nothing has changed 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.300
 if it is the need I liked it 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.410
 leave out a nice I like to write 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.630
 on my channel in case you didn't 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.550
 still done to not get lost in the future 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.920
 video of an inscription found lyngby 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.150
 I bring it to the facebook page and we do 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.110
 peck in 12 days with a neighbor 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.110
 video bye bye
