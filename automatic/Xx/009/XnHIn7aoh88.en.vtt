to watch through out of this but this is
a<00:00:25.590> great<00:00:26.070> example<00:00:26.189> scripting<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.269> guy<00:00:27.480> goes

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
a great example scripting this guy goes

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
a great example scripting this guy goes
goes<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> short<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.039> after<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> show<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
goes for a short and after the show I

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.500 
goes for a short and after the show I
run<00:00:31.050> against<00:00:31.500> him<00:00:31.619> he<00:00:32.219> completely<00:00:32.910> misses<00:00:33.360> his

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
run against him he completely misses his

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380 
run against him he completely misses his
shot<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.980> he<00:00:35.130> gets<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.460> penalty<00:00:35.790> around

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
shot and then he gets a penalty around

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.490 
shot and then he gets a penalty around
the<00:00:36.510> 90<00:00:36.899> minute<00:00:37.079> mark<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:38.309> course<00:00:39.500> this

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the 90 minute mark and of course this

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
the 90 minute mark and of course this
happens<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.160> managed<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> save<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:42.360> he

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
happens I managed to save it and then he

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750 
happens I managed to save it and then he
gets<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> rebound<00:00:42.989> which<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.920> never<00:00:44.160> saw<00:00:44.520> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
gets the rebound which I never saw on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.619 
gets the rebound which I never saw on
fifa<00:00:45.149> 12<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:46.289> he<00:00:46.440> scores<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
fifa 12 and then he scores it so you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
fifa 12 and then he scores it so you
decide<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.530> scripting<00:00:50.370> or<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.789> is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
decide if this is scripting or this is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
decide if this is scripting or this is
just<00:00:51.149> bad<00:00:51.329> luck<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> only

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
just bad luck but this is not the only

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.160 
just bad luck but this is not the only
time<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.120> happened<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.140> just

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
time it happened to me but this is just

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
time it happened to me but this is just
a<00:00:55.379> random<00:00:55.649> time<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.399> wanted<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
a random time it I just wanted to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
a random time it I just wanted to
capture<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> guys<00:00:58.079> could<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> look

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
a look how long the extra time is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.149 
a look how long the extra time is
lasting<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.670> even<00:01:15.409> believable<00:01:16.409> it's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
lasting it's not even believable it's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.550 
lasting it's not even believable it's
around<00:01:17.430> 15<00:01:18.180> minutes<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.659> game<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> not

around 15 minutes in game time and not

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
around 15 minutes in game time and not
three<00:01:19.830> minutes<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> complete

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
three minutes so that is a complete

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.870 
three minutes so that is a complete
 also<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> chances

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
 also have a look at the chances

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.429 
 also have a look at the chances
I'm<00:01:24.060> getting<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> last<00:01:24.720> minutes<00:01:25.080> also

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.170 
I'm getting in the last minutes also
just<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.799> managed<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.430> cheeky

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
just going managed to get one cheeky

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
just going managed to get one cheeky
chance<00:01:27.710> but<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.860> was<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.220> good<00:01:29.460> enough<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
chance but that was not good enough to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.410 
chance but that was not good enough to
defeat<00:01:30.240> Diego<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.290> us<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.650> target<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.700> that's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
defeat Diego of us on target so that's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
defeat Diego of us on target so that's
just<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.930> normal<00:01:34.229> everything<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.860> going

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
just going normal everything is going

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.490 
just going normal everything is going
normal<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> managed<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> good

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.420 
defendant blocks it is not a problem at
all<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> managed<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> normal

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.760 
the header but it is topped by the
goalkeeper<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.049> no<00:01:58.229> problem<00:01:58.469> at<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.710> i

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
goalkeeper so that's no problem at all i

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.490 
goalkeeper so that's no problem at all i
got<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.219> second<00:01:59.729> corner<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.840> hopefully<00:02:01.350> i<00:02:01.380> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
got the second corner so hopefully i can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.130 
got the second corner so hopefully i can
get<00:02:01.770> something<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:03.360> again<00:02:03.600> note

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
get something out of this but again note

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.810 
get something out of this but again note
the<00:02:04.380> goalkeeper<00:02:04.890> has<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:05.549> i<00:02:05.579> got<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the goalkeeper has it and then i got the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
the goalkeeper has it and then i got the
rebound<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.540> sanchez<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.350> completely

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
rebound with sanchez and it's completely

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.369 
rebound with sanchez and it's completely
off<00:02:08.369> target<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.270> now<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> decide<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:10.200> it's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
off target so now you decide if it's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.100 
off target so now you decide if it's
creating<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.069> not

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
creating or not

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.010 
creating or not
and<00:02:12.410> now<00:02:12.650> at<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.950> second<00:02:13.370> clip<00:02:13.550> also<00:02:13.820> an<00:02:14.390> extra

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
and now at the second clip also an extra

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.470 
and now at the second clip also an extra
time<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.710> got<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.070> amazing<00:02:16.280> clip<00:02:16.820> while<00:02:17.240> my

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
time we got this amazing clip while my

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.150 
time we got this amazing clip while my
goalkeeper<00:02:18.020> just<00:02:18.230> managed<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.590> punch<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
goalkeeper just managed to punch the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.580 
goalkeeper just managed to punch the
ball<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.580> his<00:02:19.610> own<00:02:19.940> goal<00:02:20.180> while<00:02:20.810> about<00:02:21.110> was<00:02:21.350> not

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
ball in his own goal while about was not

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.520 
ball in his own goal while about was not
even<00:02:21.920> going<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.190> target<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.960> a<00:02:24.080> look<00:02:24.230> at<00:02:24.500> a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
even going to target so have a look at a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.470 
even going to target so have a look at a
replay<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.490> goalkeeper<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.180> managed<00:02:26.450> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
replay the goalkeeper just managed to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.110 
replay the goalkeeper just managed to
punch<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.350> then<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.310> decide<00:02:28.670> if<00:02:28.850> it's

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
punch it in and then you decide if it's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.270 
punch it in and then you decide if it's
scripted<00:02:29.390> or<00:02:29.570> not<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:29.990> i<00:02:30.020> think<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.770> is<00:02:31.040> not

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
scripted or not but i think that is not

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.640 
scripted or not but i think that is not
normal<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.660> could<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:33.080> bad<00:02:33.230> luck<00:02:33.290> but

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
normal is it it could be bad luck but

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.380 
normal is it it could be bad luck but
it's<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.220> strange<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.030> many<00:02:35.240> people

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.010 
it's just so strange that so many people
are<00:02:36.200> having<00:02:36.740> this<00:02:37.010> problem<00:02:37.340> not<00:02:37.730> only<00:02:37.760> me<00:02:38.270> not
