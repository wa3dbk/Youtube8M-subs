at<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.990> over<00:00:22.170> here<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:24.140> if<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> next

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
at it over here so if I can see the next

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.380 
at it over here so if I can see the next
information<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.340> don't<00:00:26.490> come<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.150> tell<00:00:27.330> me

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
information I don't come on to tell me

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.839 
information I don't come on to tell me
the<00:00:27.480> knife<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.990> these<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.340> new<00:00:29.580> leaked

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the knife and these are the new leaked

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.630 
the knife and these are the new leaked
the<00:00:30.179> pictures<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.769> looks<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.610> looks

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the pictures here it looks like it looks

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
the pictures here it looks like it looks
a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.210> bit<00:00:33.390> too<00:00:33.540> much<00:00:33.690> plasticky<00:00:34.469> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
a little bit too much plasticky so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.830 
a little bit too much plasticky so
probably<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.760> shell<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.809> top

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
of it and it's probably probably not the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.510 
of it and it's probably probably not the
real<00:00:40.920> deal<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.660> never<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:44.190> hundred

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
real deal but you never know one hundred

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940
