is<00:00:12.809> $15<00:00:13.559> from<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> cubicle<00:00:14.219> US<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.059> has<00:00:15.480> a

57-millimeter<00:00:16.170> body<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:17.070> usual<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.210> did

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
57-millimeter body as usual and I did

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.720 
57-millimeter body as usual and I did
find<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> stock<00:00:19.230> shades<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.770> usable<00:00:20.220> but

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
find the stock shades to be usable but

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.340 
find the stock shades to be usable but
they<00:00:20.970> did<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.420> replace<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.869> my<00:00:21.990> custom

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
they did get replace with my custom

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
they did get replace with my custom

Yi<00:00:24.539> really<00:00:25.109> feels<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.470> cube<00:00:25.859> they'll<00:00:26.039> be

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
Yi really feels like cube they'll be

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.880 
Yi really feels like cube they'll be
made<00:00:26.340> by<00:00:26.490> Fang<00:00:26.760> Chi<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> slight<00:00:28.349> sandy

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
made by Fang Chi it's got a slight sandy

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
made by Fang Chi it's got a slight sandy
feel<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> strong<00:00:29.970> ran<00:00:30.210> version

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
feel just like the strong ran version

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380 
feel just like the strong ran version
one<00:00:30.929> however<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.130> cube<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.489> insanely<00:00:33.030> fast

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
one however this cube is insanely fast

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.900 
one however this cube is insanely fast
like<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.320> fastest<00:00:34.920> Q<00:00:35.100> I've<00:00:35.190> ever<00:00:35.340> used<00:00:35.670> I'm

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
like the fastest Q I've ever used I'm

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.970 
like the fastest Q I've ever used I'm
not<00:00:35.940> kidding<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.710> find

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
not kidding and because of that I find

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
not kidding and because of that I find
it<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.399> hard<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.730> control<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.210> cube<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it really hard to control this cube a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.299 
it really hard to control this cube a
lot<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> time<00:00:40.140> I've<00:00:40.620> tried<00:00:40.770> putting<00:00:41.010> more

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
lot of the time I've tried putting more

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.770 
lot of the time I've tried putting more
lube<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.940> slow<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
lube in it to slow it down but it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.330 
lube in it to slow it down but it
doesn't<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.140> make<00:00:43.410> any<00:00:43.620> difference<00:00:43.829> no

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
doesn't really make any difference no

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
doesn't really make any difference no
matter<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.610> much<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.879> put<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.719> also<00:00:45.899> doesn't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
matter how much I put in it also doesn't

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.420 
matter how much I put in it also doesn't
help<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> cube<00:00:46.829> has<00:00:46.980> below<00:00:47.280> average

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
help that the cube has below average

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.580 
help that the cube has below average
corner<00:00:47.910> cutting<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.960> piece<00:00:49.230> with

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
corner cutting at about one piece with

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
corner cutting at about one piece with
half<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> piece<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.340> reverse<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.210> paired<00:00:51.510> with

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
half a piece of reverse this paired with

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.090 
half a piece of reverse this paired with
the<00:00:51.719> over<00:00:51.960> shooting<00:00:52.199> problem<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the over shooting problem because of the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.670 
the over shooting problem because of the
speed<00:00:53.370> causes<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> lock<00:00:54.750> ups<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
speed causes a lot of lock ups this is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.380 
speed causes a lot of lock ups this is
the<00:00:55.829> main<00:00:55.980> problem<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> cube<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.149> it's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the main problem of the cube but it's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
the main problem of the cube but it's
not<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> only<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.260> another<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.399> found

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
not the only one another thing I found

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
not the only one another thing I found
is<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> caps<00:01:00.180> fall<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:00.690> quite<00:01:01.109> often

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
is that the caps fall off quite often

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
is that the caps fall off quite often
and<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.550> annoying

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and it's really annoying

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.490 
and it's really annoying
however<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> simple<00:01:03.780> solution<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.320> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
however a simple solution to this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
however a simple solution to this
problem<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.339> glue<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> caps

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
problem is to just glue on the caps

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
problem is to just glue on the caps
which<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.750> yet<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.290> also<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
which I have yet to do also and this

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
which I have yet to do also and this
seems<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.060> inherent<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.720> fangshi<00:01:10.110> puzzles

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
seems really inherent of fangshi puzzles

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.830 
seems really inherent of fangshi puzzles
the<00:01:10.890> cube<00:01:11.130> does<00:01:11.369> corner<00:01:11.790> twist<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.720> as

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the cube does corner twist it's not as

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
the cube does corner twist it's not as
bad<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> strong<00:01:13.560> run<00:01:13.740> v2<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.760> still

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bad as a strong run v2 but it's still

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.499 
bad as a strong run v2 but it's still
there

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
there

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.420 
there
so<00:01:15.780> overall<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.439> Gwangyang<00:01:16.890> seems<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> be

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so overall the Gwangyang seems to be

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
so overall the Gwangyang seems to be
geared<00:01:17.610> towards<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:18.210> faster<00:01:18.659> cubers<00:01:19.140> but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
geared towards much faster cubers but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
geared towards much faster cubers but
for<00:01:19.950> me<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.159> least<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.700> cube<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.180> overkill<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
for me at least this cube is overkill in

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.899 
for me at least this cube is overkill in
terms<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.380> speed<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.520> well<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
terms of speed this as well as the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.460 
terms of speed this as well as the
subpar<00:01:24.330> corner<00:01:24.630> cutting<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> corner

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
subpar corner cutting and the corner

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.200 
subpar corner cutting and the corner
twisting<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> caps<00:01:26.520> falling<00:01:26.909> off<00:01:27.030> all

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
twisting and the caps falling off all

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
twisting and the caps falling off all
the<00:01:27.299> time<00:01:27.509> make<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> troublesome<00:01:28.650> cube<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the time make for a troublesome cube the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
the time make for a troublesome cube the
anti<00:01:30.000> popping<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.600> solid<00:01:31.079> though<00:01:31.229> even<00:01:31.470> though

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
anti popping is solid though even though

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.260 
anti popping is solid though even though
I<00:01:31.680> didn't<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:31.920> talk<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.790> it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
I didn't really talk about that it's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
I didn't really talk about that it's
probably<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> best<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.290> any<00:01:34.470> cube<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.070> I'll

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
probably the best of any cube and I'll

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.810 
probably the best of any cube and I'll
give<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
give it that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.730 
give it that
so<00:01:36.299> if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> strong<00:01:37.020> run<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.439> just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
so if you like the strong run and just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
so if you like the strong run and just
wanted<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.340> faster<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
wanted it to be faster this is the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
wanted it to be faster this is the
perfect<00:01:39.659> cube<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.560> personally<00:01:41.189> don't

perfect cube for you I personally don't

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.429

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
on how fast you want your cubes for the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
on how fast you want your cubes for the
majority<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.899> people<00:01:46.020> though<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.799> just

majority of people though this is just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.429 
majority of people though this is just
gonna<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.430> too<00:01:47.610> fast<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> I'll<00:01:49.259> give

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
gonna be too fast so with that I'll give

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.950 
gonna be too fast so with that I'll give
this<00:01:49.649> cube<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.100> 6<00:01:50.460> out<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.670> 10<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.780> about

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
