00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
load think of a pendulum and you think

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.340 
load think of a pendulum and you think
of<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.190> swing<00:04:27.460> set<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.750> think<00:04:28.990> about<00:04:29.140> how

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
of a swing set and you think about how

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.420 
of a swing set and you think about how
are<00:04:29.440> you<00:04:29.530> gonna<00:04:29.620> get<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:29.980> person<00:04:30.370> that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
are you gonna get that person that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.770 
are you gonna get that person that
you're<00:04:30.580> pushing<00:04:30.790> on<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.120> swing<00:04:31.330> set<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.660> go

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
you're pushing on the swing set to go

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.050 
you're pushing on the swing set to go
higher<00:04:32.190> well<00:04:33.190> you're<00:04:33.370> gonna<00:04:33.460> have<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.730> push

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
higher well you're gonna have to push

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.790 
higher well you're gonna have to push
them<00:04:34.210> later<00:04:34.510> load<00:04:35.140> later

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
them later load later

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.210 
them later load later
and<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:36.669> I'm<00:04:36.850> skiing<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.630> rotation<00:04:38.200> so<00:04:39.100> we

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
and so I'm skiing the rotation so we

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.480 
and so I'm skiing the rotation so we
have<00:04:39.400> with<00:04:39.910> our<00:04:40.090> upper<00:04:40.720> bodies<00:04:41.130> translates<00:04:42.130> to

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
have with our upper bodies translates to

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.780 
have with our upper bodies translates to
load<00:04:42.730> so<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.660> later<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.290> you<00:04:44.440> can<00:04:44.790> delay

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
load so the later that you can delay

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.470 
load so the later that you can delay
that<00:04:46.060> rotation<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.650> later<00:04:47.919> load<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:49.270> you're

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
that rotation the later load that you're

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.420 
that rotation the later load that you're
gonna<00:04:49.600> have<00:04:50.350> miss<00:04:50.590> long<00:04:50.800> for<00:04:51.100> us<00:04:51.190> therefore

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
gonna have miss long for us therefore

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.730 
gonna have miss long for us therefore
