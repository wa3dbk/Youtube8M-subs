00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.860
 and I say 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.270
 preparing for turkey one day in 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.370
 jumps the light is cut off and there was no light 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.019
 and it was seven o'clock at night and it was not 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.090
 night was still falling the 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.760
 sun today jumps and we train up 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.960
 that the sun gave us light in stadiums and 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.430
 we train so far already 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.500
 we throw a shot and pass the hoop 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.900
 you could see the hoop and we were sticking and we 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.970
 we stung the ball and we could not enter 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.320
 more but I remember letting him say 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.750
 guys are going to do badly 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.550
 let's go we do not have to 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.829
 train we have to squeeze the maximum 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.840
 possible the time to improve in this 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.420
 group like that and there are many anecdotes like 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.850
 this is what this thing is but I do not know 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.519
 they count but what 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.989
 are examples of how one grows and how 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.859
 one is hungry to continue improving 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.859
 and winning things 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.070
 the narigÃ³n was selected 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.500
 we are filled with questions at that time 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.120
 and good as every time it happens either 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.850
 by absence or populations always 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 we try after the use the word of 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.070
 mutating or continue producing is 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.230
 changing faces and the team mutates and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.600
 because it is in our ginobili but 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.420
 good thing is that we do not have a left-handed videos 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.370
 or that penetrates and that is as he thinks 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.800
 but the hands we adapt to follow 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.950
 producing for the team yes 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.000
 and it's not that delfino destitute or 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.760
 I did what I did 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.810
 but the team adapted to follow 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.710
 producing and to continue generating 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.710
 positive things 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.479
 yes 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850
 yes 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.159
 yes 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.600
 yes 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.540
 Y 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.980
 so he suffered from the progression 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.810
 because before the game it was very bad 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.680
 that I wanted to be in the game for the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.680
 for the medal 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.870
 because as a group we've done I think 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.500
 that as a figure of him had been the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.569
 standard - bearer for all throughout Argentina 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.939
 the flag in the parade and others but 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.400
 who deserved it and if it was not collection 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:51.060
 I had not played 11 points so I think 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.200
 that this one came out to me at that moment and I think 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.200
 that was as fair as it is going to be
