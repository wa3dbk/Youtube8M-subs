something that was already taken the
Sidewinder<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.330> wanted<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> post<00:00:16.020> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
Sidewinder so I just wanted to post a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.590 
Sidewinder so I just wanted to post a
remake<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.310> there's<00:00:17.820> no<00:00:17.970> confusion<00:00:18.150> with

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
remake so that there's no confusion with

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
remake so that there's no confusion with
which<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> which<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> also<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.189> didn't<00:00:20.460> know

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
which is which and also I didn't know

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.980 
which is which and also I didn't know
like<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.300> came<00:00:21.480> out<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.840> kind

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
like how the first one came out it kind

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.060 
like how the first one came out it kind
of<00:00:22.050> ran<00:00:22.170> long<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.680> little<00:00:22.859> hard<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
of ran long it was a little hard to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.140 
of ran long it was a little hard to
follow<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.199> third<00:00:25.920> try<00:00:26.250> because

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
follow so this is the third try because

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.849 
follow so this is the third try because
I<00:00:27.240> actually<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.779> shot<00:00:28.170> another<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.619> and

I actually just shot another one and
accidentally<00:00:29.640> erased<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.920> called

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
accidentally erased it so this is called

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
accidentally erased it so this is called
the<00:00:32.189> Viper<00:00:32.340> nut<00:00:32.610> without<00:00:33.000> further<00:00:33.360> ado<00:00:33.690> I'll

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
with a little end so my big end is where

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
with a little end so my big end is where
I<00:01:01.050> wanted<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.949> made<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> dimple<00:01:02.609> which<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
I wanted and I made the dimple which is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.870 
I wanted and I made the dimple which is
what<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> reverse<00:01:04.409> dimple<00:01:04.880> cross

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
what I like the reverse dimple cross

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
what I like the reverse dimple cross
over<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> go<00:01:08.790> around<00:01:09.950> underneath<00:01:11.960> now<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
over and go around underneath now this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.620 
over and go around underneath now this
part<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.590> want<00:01:13.830> tight<00:01:14.330> everything<00:01:15.330> after

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
part you want tight everything after

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
part you want tight everything after
this<00:01:15.750> keep<00:01:16.470> relatively<00:01:17.130> loose<00:01:17.310> you'll<00:01:17.640> see

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
this keep relatively loose you'll see

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.030 
this keep relatively loose you'll see
why

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
why

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.190 
why
so<00:01:20.040> again<00:01:20.310> tight<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.630> you're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> go

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so again tight then you're going to go

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.719 
so again tight then you're going to go
around<00:01:22.470> again<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:23.460> through<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> neck<00:01:24.210> hole

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
around again up through the neck hole

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
around again up through the neck hole
and<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> opposite<00:01:27.299> side<00:01:27.650> keep<00:01:28.650> that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and now the opposite side keep that

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.350 
and now the opposite side keep that
relatively<00:01:29.189> loose<00:01:29.689> you'll<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.869> why<00:01:31.020> now

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
relatively loose you'll see why now

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.219 
relatively loose you'll see why now
hold<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.630> seat<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.110> bit

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
hold on to your seat a little bit

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.569 
hold on to your seat a little bit
because<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.770> where<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.070> gets<00:01:35.189> somewhat

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because this is where it gets somewhat

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.880 
because this is where it gets somewhat
complicated<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.140> hard<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> explain

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
complicated it's very hard to explain

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
complicated it's very hard to explain
so<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.610> watch<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so just watch what I do but I'm going to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
so just watch what I do but I'm going to
take<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.799> tail<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.970> behind<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:44.060> in

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
take this tail and go behind this and in

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.149 
take this tail and go behind this and in
front<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.530> where<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.829> finger<00:01:47.130> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
front of this like where my finger is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.649 
front of this like where my finger is
right<00:01:47.310> now

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.020 

so<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> should<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:54.469> okay<00:01:56.030> again

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
so that you should have this okay again

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
so that you should have this okay again
keeping<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> loose<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:59.100> take<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.680> go

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
keeping it loose now take this and go

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.370 
keeping it loose now take this and go
down<00:02:01.890> through<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> bottom<00:02:03.000> loop<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
down through the bottom loop so you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560 
down through the bottom loop so you
should<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.179> this<00:02:06.179> is<00:02:06.329> what's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
should have that and this is what's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.059 
should have that and this is what's
going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.929> be<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> anchor<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.950> makes

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
going to be the anchor point that makes

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.400 
going to be the anchor point that makes
this<00:02:08.280> not<00:02:08.489> possible<00:02:09.030> I've<00:02:09.599> been<00:02:09.780> trying<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this not possible I've been trying to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.050 
this not possible I've been trying to
come<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.280> way<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> make<00:02:11.610> us<00:02:11.849> a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
come up with a way to make us a

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.180 
come up with a way to make us a
symmetrical<00:02:12.780> knot<00:02:12.930> for<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> while<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> thought

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
symmetrical knot for a while I thought

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.440 
symmetrical knot for a while I thought
it<00:02:14.280> would<00:02:14.400> look<00:02:14.489> pretty<00:02:14.670> cool<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.180> could<00:02:15.239> do

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it would look pretty cool if I could do

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.870 
it would look pretty cool if I could do
it<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> could<00:02:16.830> never<00:02:16.920> find<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.340> way<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.519> make

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
it but I could never find a way to make

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.900 
it but I could never find a way to make
this<00:02:18.780> layer<00:02:19.110> go<00:02:19.709> here<00:02:20.069> because<00:02:20.340> usually<00:02:20.819> this

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
this layer go here because usually this

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.370 
this layer go here because usually this
is<00:02:21.060> where<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.420> tie<00:02:21.630> comes<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.050> from<00:02:22.260> your

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
is where the tie comes in from your

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.949 
is where the tie comes in from your
collar<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:23.580> until<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.150> found<00:02:24.390> out<00:02:24.569> how<00:02:24.690> I

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
collar but until I found out how I

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.250 
collar but until I found out how I
thought<00:02:25.349> of<00:02:25.470> doing<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.830> alright<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.260> right

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
thought of doing this alright so right

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.309 
thought of doing this alright so right
now<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:29.930> what<00:02:30.930> you're<00:02:31.049> going<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
now you have this what you're going to

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.729 
now you have this what you're going to
want<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.890> take<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.880> way<00:02:33.150> and

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
want to do is take it up this way and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.920 
want to do is take it up this way and
you<00:02:34.739> see<00:02:34.950> where<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
you see where it's kind of like a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.420 
you see where it's kind of like a
Harlequin<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.410> see<00:02:37.590> where<00:02:37.739> these<00:02:37.860> two<00:02:38.190> are

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
Harlequin you see where these two are

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.100 
Harlequin you see where these two are
making<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.330> front<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.690> at<00:02:39.780> least<00:02:39.959> two

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
making the front of it at least two

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.140 
making the front of it at least two
loops<00:02:40.319> if<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.130> see<00:02:41.370> where<00:02:41.610> my<00:02:41.730> finger<00:02:41.760> is

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
loops if you see where my finger is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970 
loops if you see where my finger is
you're<00:02:42.540> going<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.810> want<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.049> go<00:02:43.200> through<00:02:43.440> that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
you're going to want to go through that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.259 
you're going to want to go through that
hole<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.970> under<00:02:45.510> both<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.470> these<00:02:46.860> loops<00:02:47.269> but

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
hole so under both of these loops but

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.089 
hole so under both of these loops but
making<00:02:48.540> sure<00:02:48.569> it's<00:02:48.840> turned<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.290> way<00:02:49.349> of

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
making sure it's turned the right way of

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.729 
making sure it's turned the right way of
course<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:51.239> like<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.569> Harlequin<00:02:52.019> you

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
course and just like the Harlequin you

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.530 
course and just like the Harlequin you
will<00:02:52.920> fit<00:02:53.160> fish<00:02:53.579> through<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:54.239> with<00:02:54.390> your

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
will fit fish through there with your

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.509 
will fit fish through there with your
fingers<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.049> get<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> tip<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.709> then<00:02:56.310> just

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
fingers and get the tip and then just

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.960 
fingers and get the tip and then just
pull<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.760> whole<00:02:57.090> thing<00:02:57.720> all<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.440> way<00:02:58.530> through

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
pull the whole thing all the way through

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.370 
pull the whole thing all the way through
all<00:02:59.970> right

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
all right

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.470 
all right
making<00:03:01.380> sure<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.709> layers<00:03:01.950> are<00:03:02.310> all<00:03:02.480> where

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
making sure the layers are all where

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.910 
making sure the layers are all where
they<00:03:03.600> should<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:04.069> right<00:03:08.720> there<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:10.290> it's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
they should be right there now it's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.690 
they should be right there now it's
pretty<00:03:11.250> much<00:03:11.370> done<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:12.209> just<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.569> matter<00:03:12.750> of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
pretty much done it's just a matter of

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.599 
pretty much done it's just a matter of
tightening<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:16.010> adjusting<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.100> now

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
tightening it and and adjusting it now

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.759 
tightening it and and adjusting it now
since<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.090> was<00:03:18.359> so<00:03:18.540> intricate<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.410> kind<00:03:19.650> of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
since it was so intricate and it kind of

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.729 
since it was so intricate and it kind of
entered<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.519> bits<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.090> itself<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.750> kind<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
entered in bits in itself you kind of

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.229 
entered in bits in itself you kind of
need<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:22.889> tighten<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.489> in<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.790> order<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.120> you

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
need to tighten it in the order that you

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.360 
need to tighten it in the order that you
tied<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:24.840> if<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.590> remember<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:25.950> bottom

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
tied it so if you remember this bottom

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.610 
tied it so if you remember this bottom
part<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.700> already<00:03:27.060> tight<00:03:27.299> but<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.470> you

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
part is already tight but if you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.099 
part is already tight but if you
remember<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.859> next<00:03:29.069> step<00:03:29.370> was<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:31.049> to

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
remember the next step was this so to

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.550 
remember the next step was this so to
tighten<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.829> pull<00:03:32.040> on<00:03:32.130> up<00:03:33.030> there<00:03:33.690> right

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
tighten it you pull on up there right

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.180 
tighten it you pull on up there right
and<00:03:34.910> tighten<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.680> either<00:03:37.829> pull<00:03:38.100> on

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
and tighten this you can either pull on

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.039 
and tighten this you can either pull on
that<00:03:38.310> inside<00:03:38.730> loop<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.720> gets<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.989> little

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
that inside loop but that gets a little

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.050 
that inside loop but that gets a little
hard<00:03:40.350> once<00:03:40.560> everything<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.010> tight<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.850> just

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
hard once everything is tight so I just

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.390 
hard once everything is tight so I just
grab<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.269> bottom<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:44.160> pull

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
grab the bottom of this and that pull

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.789 
grab the bottom of this and that pull
the<00:03:44.579> inside<00:03:44.880> loop<00:03:45.120> which<00:03:45.870> tightens<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> top

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
the inside loop which tightens the top

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.710 
the inside loop which tightens the top
layer<00:03:47.389> alright<00:03:49.340> again<00:03:50.340> these<00:03:50.970> all<00:03:51.209> should<00:03:51.510> lay

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
layer alright again these all should lay

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.330 
layer alright again these all should lay
right<00:03:52.139> on<00:03:52.260> top<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.470> each<00:03:52.680> other<00:03:52.829> because

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
right on top of each other because

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.069 
right on top of each other because
that's<00:03:53.489> how<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.700> knot<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.030> constructed<00:03:54.599> but

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
that's how the knot is constructed but

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.569 
that's how the knot is constructed but
sometimes<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> just<00:03:55.799> need<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.130> convince<00:03:56.310> them

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
sometimes you just need to convince them

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.140 
sometimes you just need to convince them
to<00:03:56.609> do<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.230> alright<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:58.820> to<00:03:59.820> tighten<00:04:00.090> it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
to do that alright then to tighten it
