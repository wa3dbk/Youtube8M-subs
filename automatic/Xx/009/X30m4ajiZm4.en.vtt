00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
their secondary has been kind of a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.140 
their secondary has been kind of a
nightmare<00:00:24.050> all<00:00:24.499> season<00:00:24.890> rotating<00:00:25.699> safeties

they're<00:00:47.809> really<00:00:47.870> gonna<00:00:48.019> want<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.289> confuse<00:00:48.710> Tim

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
they're really gonna want to confuse Tim

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.069

Tebow<00:00:49.460> get<00:00:50.030> him<00:00:50.239> into<00:00:50.449> throwing<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:50.899> ball

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
Tebow get him into throwing the ball

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.169 
Tebow get him into throwing the ball
away<00:00:51.199> he's<00:00:51.769> not<00:00:52.250> a<00:00:52.280> very<00:00:52.670> good<00:00:52.699> thrower<00:00:52.940> but

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
away he's not a very good thrower but

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:53.919 
away he's not a very good thrower but
he's<00:00:53.390> only<00:00:53.480> thrown<00:00:53.719> two<00:00:53.899> interceptions

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
he's only thrown two interceptions

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.259 
he's only thrown two interceptions
entire<00:00:54.769> season<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:55.670> it's<00:00:55.820> gonna<00:00:55.910> be<00:00:56.000> tough<00:00:56.210> to

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
entire season so it's gonna be tough to

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.759 
entire season so it's gonna be tough to
really<00:00:56.539> get<00:00:56.750> him<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:57.019> turn<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.320> ball<00:00:57.469> over<00:00:57.500> my

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
really get him to turn the ball over my

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.079 
really get him to turn the ball over my
think<00:00:57.980> it's<00:00:58.100> going<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.250> be<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.399> big<00:00:58.640> key<00:00:58.879> for

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
think it's going to be a big key for

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.669 
think it's going to be a big key for
belching<00:00:59.629> Stevens<00:00:59.929> because<00:01:00.050> we've<00:01:00.379> seen<00:01:00.589> that

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
belching Stevens because we've seen that

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.319 
belching Stevens because we've seen that
secondary<00:01:01.100> breakdown<00:01:01.609> so<00:01:01.850> often<00:01:02.179> this<00:01:02.269> year

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
secondary breakdown so often this year

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.729 
secondary breakdown so often this year
almost<00:01:02.899> seems<00:01:03.140> like<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:03.350> needed<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.620> have

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
almost seems like you needed to have

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.830 
almost seems like you needed to have
some<00:01:04.129> just<00:01:04.910> just<00:01:05.120> figure<00:01:05.330> things<00:01:05.510> out<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
kept them in the games for Tebow to make

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.060 
kept them in the games for Tebow to make
those<00:01:14.630> great<00:01:14.840> comebacks<00:01:15.230> mostly<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:15.950> been

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
those great comebacks mostly it's been

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.920 
those great comebacks mostly it's been
against<00:01:16.250> pretty<00:01:16.400> bad<00:01:16.670> offenses<00:01:17.360> can<00:01:17.780> they

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
against pretty bad offenses can they

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.150 
against pretty bad offenses can they
keep<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.290> up<00:01:18.410> against<00:01:18.800> a<00:01:18.860> really<00:01:19.040> good

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
keep it up against a really good

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.830 
keep it up against a really good
Patriots<00:01:19.700> office<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:20.060> think<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.480> Patriots

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
Patriots office I think the Patriots

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.330 
Patriots office I think the Patriots
have<00:01:21.020> put<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.200> lot<00:01:21.230> of<00:01:21.410> stress<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:21.950> them<00:01:22.160> early

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
have put a lot of stress on them early

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.980 
have put a lot of stress on them early
you<00:01:22.640> know<00:01:22.730> try<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.000> stop<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.450> playmakers

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
you know try to stop the playmakers

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.050 
you know try to stop the playmakers
welker<00:01:24.410> Gronkowski<00:01:25.160> you<00:01:25.550> know<00:01:25.640> maybe<00:01:25.760> get

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
welker Gronkowski you know maybe get

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.520 
welker Gronkowski you know maybe get
Deion<00:01:26.300> Branch<00:01:26.480> back<00:01:26.840> into<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.170> action<00:01:27.440> a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
Deion Branch back into the action a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.530 
Deion Branch back into the action a
little<00:01:27.560> bit<00:01:27.890> more<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.670> diverse<00:01:28.970> passing

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
little bit more of a diverse passing

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.060 
little bit more of a diverse passing
game<00:01:29.690> in<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.930> first<00:01:30.110> half<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.770> then<00:01:30.890> maybe

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
game in the first half and then maybe

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.170 
game in the first half and then maybe
try<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.310> take<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.640> air<00:01:31.760> out<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.030> ball<00:01:32.150> a

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
try to take the air out of the ball a

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.460 
try to take the air out of the ball a
little<00:01:32.330> bit<00:01:32.540> in<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.690> second<00:01:33.050> half<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.350> may

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
little bit in the second half that may

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.230 
little bit in the second half that may
be<00:01:33.530> one<00:01:33.770> way<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.980> attack<00:01:34.370> this<00:01:34.550> defense<00:01:34.970> yeah<00:01:35.210> I

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
be one way to attack this defense yeah I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.730 
be one way to attack this defense yeah I
expect<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.690> Patriots<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.200> really<00:01:36.440> just<00:01:36.620> try

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
expect the Patriots to really just try

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.200 
expect the Patriots to really just try
to<00:01:36.800> light<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:37.070> up<00:01:37.250> put<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> lot<00:01:37.730> of<00:01:37.760> pressure<00:01:38.060> on

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
to light it up put a lot of pressure on

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.880 
to light it up put a lot of pressure on
Tim<00:01:38.480> Tebow<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> get<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.440> maybe<00:01:39.650> if<00:01:39.800> they

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
Tim Tebow to get going and maybe if they

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.200 
Tim Tebow to get going and maybe if they
get<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.070> lead<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.430> second<00:01:40.700> half<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:40.970> run

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
get a lead in the second half that run

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.430 
get a lead in the second half that run
game<00:01:41.420> for<00:01:41.630> New<00:01:41.690> England<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.050> haven't<00:01:42.260> seen<00:01:42.380> a

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
game for New England we haven't seen a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.140 
game for New England we haven't seen a
whole<00:01:42.500> lot<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.130> all<00:01:43.280> season<00:01:43.490> long<00:01:43.730> when

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
whole lot of it all season long when

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.520 
whole lot of it all season long when
they've<00:01:44.360> needed<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.780> just<00:01:44.960> pound<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.320> ball

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
they've needed to just pound the ball

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.080 
they've needed to just pound the ball
chew<00:01:46.100> up<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.220> clock<00:01:46.520> they've<00:01:46.730> been<00:01:46.820> able<00:01:46.880> do

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
chew up the clock they've been able do

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.790 
chew up the clock they've been able do
so<00:01:47.270> pretty<00:01:47.540> successfully<00:01:48.110> can<00:01:48.560> they<00:01:48.680> do<00:01:48.770> it

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
so pretty successfully can they do it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.050 
so pretty successfully can they do it
against<00:01:49.040> Denver<00:01:49.370> can<00:01:49.580> they<00:01:49.700> put<00:01:49.880> up<00:01:49.970> the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
against Denver can they put up the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.910 
against Denver can they put up the
points<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.750> get<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.200> point<00:01:51.380> wolf<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.740> see

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
points to get to that point wolf to see

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.620 
points to get to that point wolf to see
so<00:01:52.400> what<00:01:52.550> do<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.670> think<00:01:52.910> can<00:01:53.150> they<00:01:53.240> get<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.480> win

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
so what do you think can they get to win

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.330 
so what do you think can they get to win
the<00:01:53.720> Patriots<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.260> think<00:01:54.620> they<00:01:54.740> will<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:54.980> just

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
the Patriots I think they will I just

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.650 
the Patriots I think they will I just
don't<00:01:55.520> think<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.850> good<00:01:55.880> matchup<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.480> put

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
don't think it's a good matchup to put

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.810 
don't think it's a good matchup to put
the<00:01:56.750> pressure<00:01:56.870> on<00:01:57.080> Tim<00:01:57.260> Tebow<00:01:57.530> early<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.580> score

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
the pressure on Tim Tebow early to score

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.160 
the pressure on Tim Tebow early to score
so<00:01:58.970> many<00:01:59.150> points<00:01:59.300> because<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> Patriots<00:02:00.080> are

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
so many points because the Patriots are

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.780 
so many points because the Patriots are
going<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.380> be<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.920> know<00:02:01.010> I<00:02:01.040> expect<00:02:01.190> no<00:02:01.580> huddle

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
going to be you know I expect no huddle

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.040 
going to be you know I expect no huddle
pretty<00:02:02.060> early<00:02:02.330> on<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.690> game<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:02.930> think

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
pretty early on in this game I think

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.450 
pretty early on in this game I think
they<00:02:03.320> know<00:02:03.470> they<00:02:03.620> need<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.830> score<00:02:03.950> early<00:02:04.250> and

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
they know they need to score early and

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.980 
they know they need to score early and
often<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.030> think<00:02:05.390> it's<00:02:05.510> going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.720> be<00:02:05.780> too<00:02:05.960> much

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
often I think it's going to be too much

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.680 
often I think it's going to be too much
for<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.190> tea<00:02:07.370> bows<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.090> see<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.330> Patriots

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
for the tea bows and I see the Patriots

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.539 
for the tea bows and I see the Patriots
are<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:08.869> at<00:02:08.959> least<00:02:09.079> 30<00:02:09.409> points<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.920> broccoli

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
are in at least 30 points and broccoli

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.040 
are in at least 30 points and broccoli
not<00:02:10.670> being<00:02:10.849> able<00:02:10.909> to<00:02:11.120> put<00:02:11.299> put<00:02:11.480> up<00:02:11.599> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
not being able to put put up a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.030 
not being able to put put up a
you<00:02:12.110> know<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:12.410> thing<00:02:12.560> they<00:02:12.710> can<00:02:12.920> do<00:02:13.010> is

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
you know the one thing they can do is

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.620 
you know the one thing they can do is
counteract<00:02:13.550> with<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> great<00:02:13.880> pass<00:02:14.120> rush<00:02:14.450> we've

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
counteract with a great pass rush we've

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.360 
counteract with a great pass rush we've
seen<00:02:14.840> Elvis<00:02:14.990> Dumervil<00:02:15.260> having<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.890> comeback

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
seen Elvis Dumervil having a comeback

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.130 
seen Elvis Dumervil having a comeback
season<00:02:16.610> von<00:02:16.910> Miller's<00:02:17.270> been<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.600> probably

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
season von Miller's been the probably

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.420 
season von Miller's been the probably
the<00:02:18.200> undisputed<00:02:18.770> rookie<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.160> year<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
the undisputed rookie of the year on the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.100 
the undisputed rookie of the year on the
defensive<00:02:19.970> side<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.360> ball<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.990> they're

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
defensive side of the ball so they're

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.240 
defensive side of the ball so they're
going<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.380> ready<00:02:21.560> for<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.770> don't<00:02:22.100> well

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
going to be ready for that don't well

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.770 
going to be ready for that don't well
pin<00:02:22.460> their<00:02:22.610> ears<00:02:22.640> back<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.180> expect<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.600> few

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
pin their ears back so I expect a few

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.720 
pin their ears back so I expect a few
sacks<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.230> first<00:02:24.320> half<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:24.920> ultimately<00:02:25.640> I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
sacks in the first half but ultimately I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.100 
sacks in the first half but ultimately I
think<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.940> Patriots<00:02:26.240> come<00:02:26.480> out<00:02:26.600> ahead<00:02:26.690> we

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
think the Patriots come out ahead we

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.150 
think the Patriots come out ahead we
haven't<00:02:27.320> really<00:02:27.440> seen<00:02:27.560> outside<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
haven't really seen outside of the
