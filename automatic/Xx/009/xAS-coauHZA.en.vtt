00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.090
 a new video from computer artist 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.130
 today with another unboxing of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.880
 asus geforce gtx 660 again with 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.740
 a dunk co2 cooler 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.269
 this is the red variant of the empire 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.779
 from asus already overclocked biotope like 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:36.739
 always two percent cooler so cows and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:46.500
 much quieter yes we have two 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:49.410
 gigabyte gddr5 memory gpu tweak the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.020
 It is now 9000 cards so you 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 For example, you can not do ours anymore 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.170
 first berner use but only 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.570
 the plaster away but the same looks 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.210
 We actually looked at it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.229
 also nice and easier to use 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.590
 yes here again kiefers gtx 60 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.220
 the packaging from borderlands 2 insight 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.439
 that means you got a tip 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.439
 or sent a team for 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.270
 borderlands 2 interactions that applies 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.979
 but not forever but only 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.130
 for a certain time it covers briefly 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130
 accept 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.670
 we have the picture of the first behind 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.680
 card then the individual connections we 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.820
 have two dvi connections 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.810
 or with adapter of course 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.690
 a vga connection 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 we have a hdmi connection and a 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:57.930
 displayport the repeated explanations 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:03.210
 what does the dt mean two has the dtv 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.300
 ram and super alloy power explanation can 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.850
 i told you i dont say what it is 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.190
 means leaving a lot with 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.920
 to do performance upgrades 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.590
 gpu tweak as pictured here pictured 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.820
 small program thereby to regulate the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 Grapher to contact temperatures of the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.120
 Koran to ask as actually 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.160
 known by africa 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:33.840
 then here again briefly that is already in 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:40.400
 Halver is doing is nepo features rather 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:43.050
 unimportant we have three years warranty 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.900
 in the wdr for the vision ready 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.320
 that means you can do that in europe 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.150
 six months row with a three card 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.160
 screens do that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.160
 try the gpu russ ye 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.420
 the beautiful asus carton with gold on 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.349
 something we continue ago 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.819
 again a small box with asus 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:34.940
 known to see the accessories in it 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.459
 First of all, here comes the 3 disc and 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.290
 gpu tweak on it are there and there 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.360
 riders on it 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.090
 they are outdated drivers on that 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.500
 I always like the new ones 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.330
 but drivers from the wiener side 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.730
 finally this before you and then 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.100
 Update next speed up short 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.260
 explaining a tree beautiful colors 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.829
 images 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:08.000
 we have a 6 2 moritz connections 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:19.600
 adapter dvi vga adapter your 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:21.730
 borderlands 2 peep 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:29.470
 as always from bunny to pack very well 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:50.350
 and beautifully expresses this card same 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:52.660
 antistatic burkhard has that out 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.450
 typical detail design two fans in the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.540
 occasion of the 80 90 somehow like that 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.510
 be aligned 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.570
 the pc 3.0 connector then how beautiful 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.650
 that there is such a good mood 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.420
 this three stroke design 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.030
 we have three really big ones here 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.270
 heatpipes cooler depart this 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:23.670
 the two connections power connections 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:26.170
 at that time as logo graphics card as pcb 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.540
 nice matte black maybe to recognize 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.480
 is the two fingers 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.530
 I miss it for sure I suppose 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.630
 that hereby only two or three 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.310
 let it be possible for me to be my three 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.310
 You can do wgs live with the map 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:49.810
 yes then as just addressed the 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.000
 We have two dvi connections to it 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:58.690
 can be talked with adapters 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:04.770
 who times a hdmi sees a displayport 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.770
 you also give two more than usual 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:12.880
 seven corpses cool very nice card 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.580
 In any case, the one more time 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.370
 for you also test like that with the 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.480
 triple monitor works as we yes 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.740
 have possibility to test it 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.740
 to become benchmark with the map 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.730
