00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
made noise like that before but I'd

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.399 
made noise like that before but I'd
still<00:03:10.909> kind<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.269> lame<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.290> know

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
still kind of lame and you know

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.929 
still kind of lame and you know
definitely<00:03:12.709> for<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:13.099> game<00:03:13.250> like<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.459> which<00:03:13.790> is

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
definitely for a game like this which is

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.629 
definitely for a game like this which is
somewhat<00:03:14.659> complicated<00:03:15.370> definitely<00:03:16.370> with<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
somewhat complicated definitely with the

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.129 
somewhat complicated definitely with the
whole<00:03:16.819> broilers<00:03:17.180> hood<00:03:17.419> system<00:03:17.659> you<00:03:17.989> would

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
whole broilers hood system you would

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.420 
whole broilers hood system you would
think<00:03:18.349> that<00:03:18.500> they<00:03:18.709> would<00:03:18.739> actually<00:03:18.949> explain

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
think that they would actually explain

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.649 
think that they would actually explain
it<00:03:19.549> may<00:03:19.669> be<00:03:19.729> in<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:20.000> manual<00:03:20.470> but<00:03:21.470> i<00:03:21.709> guess<00:03:22.220> not

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
it may be in the manual but i guess not

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.170 
it may be in the manual but i guess not
here<00:03:23.659> is<00:03:24.459> exclusive<00:03:25.459> stuff<00:03:25.699> i'll<00:03:25.879> read<00:03:26.060> off

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
here is exclusive stuff i'll read off

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.520 
here is exclusive stuff i'll read off
the<00:03:26.389> back<00:03:26.540> i<00:03:26.569> won't<00:03:26.870> let<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.079> see<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.349> though

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
the back i won't let you see it though

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.649 
the back i won't let you see it though
because<00:03:28.040> i<00:03:28.310> don't<00:03:28.459> know<00:03:28.489> when<00:03:28.699> our<00:03:28.729> unlock

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
because i don't know when our unlock

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.240 
because i don't know when our unlock
this<00:03:29.840> stuff<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:31.129> he'll<00:03:31.340> oh<00:03:32.889> they<00:03:33.889> screwed

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
this stuff so that he'll oh they screwed

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.289 
this stuff so that he'll oh they screwed
up<00:03:34.400> i<00:03:34.699> think<00:03:37.150> for<00:03:38.150> some<00:03:38.329> reason<00:03:38.629> my<00:03:38.750> code<00:03:39.049> has

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
up i think for some reason my code has

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.309 
up i think for some reason my code has
three<00:03:41.979> characters<00:03:42.979> like<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.629> a<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:45.169> a

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
three characters like that it's a it's a

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.460 
three characters like that it's a it's a
code<00:03:45.769> for<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.760> they<00:03:47.000> have<00:03:47.090> fork<00:03:47.510> characters

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
code for that they have fork characters

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.550 
code for that they have fork characters
in<00:03:48.680> each<00:03:49.930> part<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:51.260> there's<00:03:51.500> four

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
in each part of it there's four

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.619 
in each part of it there's four
characters<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.430> each<00:03:52.549> part<00:03:52.909> and<00:03:53.120> there's<00:03:53.269> five

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
characters in each part and there's five

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.960 
characters in each part and there's five
parts<00:03:54.109> so<00:03:54.260> it's<00:03:54.409> like<00:03:54.530> 20<00:03:55.010> characters<00:03:55.310> mine

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
parts so it's like 20 characters mine

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.530 
parts so it's like 20 characters mine
