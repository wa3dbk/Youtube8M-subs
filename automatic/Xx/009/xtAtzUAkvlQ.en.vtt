00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
realistic but I mean there's a level of

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.030 
realistic but I mean there's a level of
realism<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.990> just<00:01:56.290> took<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.650> too

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
realism that just took on this too

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.770 
realism that just took on this too
tedious<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.730> games<00:01:57.880> not<00:01:58.030> fun<00:01:58.240> anymore<00:01:58.480> and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
tedious and it games not fun anymore and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.460 
tedious and it games not fun anymore and
that's<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.110> driving<00:01:59.560> part<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.830> it<00:01:59.950> definitely

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
that's the driving part of it definitely

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.180 
that's the driving part of it definitely
part<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.190> that<00:02:02.310> great<00:02:02.550> for<00:02:02.820> me<00:02:03.920> another<00:02:04.920> thing

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.690 
that I really didn't like is the fact
that<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.160> game's<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.520> very

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that it's the game's not very

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.310 
that it's the game's not very
self-explanatory<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.960> comes<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
self-explanatory when it comes to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.560 
self-explanatory when it comes to
weapons<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.310> how<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.550> buy<00:02:11.790> them<00:02:12.120> how<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> get

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
weapons and how to buy them how to get

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.980 
weapons and how to buy them how to get
the<00:02:12.750> bat<00:02:13.020> how<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> store<00:02:13.770> them

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
the bat how to store them

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.660 
the bat how to store them
so<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.530> end<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.770> driving<00:02:16.040> back<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.460> forth

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
so you end up driving back and forth

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.910 
so you end up driving back and forth
from<00:02:16.970> us<00:02:17.090> let<00:02:17.480> certain<00:02:17.660> places<00:02:17.990> like<00:02:18.350> Mike's

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
from us let certain places like Mike's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.560 
from us let certain places like Mike's
bar<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.640> weapon<00:02:19.940> shop<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.330> all<00:02:20.390> that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
right in front

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.440 
right in front
try<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.590> make<00:03:06.769> a<00:03:06.799> run<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:07.340> it

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.320

actually<00:03:16.420> wasn't<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.720> bad<00:03:16.990> I<00:03:17.320> don't<00:03:17.770> think

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
actually wasn't that bad I don't think

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:28.940 
actually wasn't that bad I don't think
they<00:03:17.950> actually<00:03:17.980> hit<00:03:18.310> my<00:03:18.430> car<00:03:18.640> which<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:18.940> good

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.260 

to<00:03:29.190> my<00:03:29.310> right

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.480 

now<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.620> actually<00:03:33.800> get<00:03:34.010> out<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.280> car

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.820 
now you can actually get out of the car
and<00:03:34.520> fix<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.970> which<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:35.180> going<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.360> try<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.540> do

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
and fix it which I'm going to try to do

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:44.970 
and fix it which I'm going to try to do
hopefully<00:03:36.830> that<00:03:37.130> guy<00:03:37.250> didn't<00:03:37.520> follow<00:03:37.700> me

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.140 

there<00:03:45.640> we<00:03:45.760> go<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.550> not<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.849> bad<00:03:48.970> it's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
there we go so it's not that bad it's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.339 
there we go so it's not that bad it's
not<00:03:49.239> like<00:03:49.360> every<00:03:49.540> five<00:03:49.690> seconds<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.200> to

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
not like every five seconds you have to

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.720 
not like every five seconds you have to
jump<00:03:50.530> out<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.709> cars<00:03:50.980> but<00:03:51.159> they're<00:03:51.310> blowing<00:03:51.610> up

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
jump out of cars but they're blowing up

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.190 
jump out of cars but they're blowing up
like<00:03:51.819> you<00:03:52.030> know<00:03:52.420> brands<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.750> thought<00:03:53.019> or

like you know brands that thought or

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.380 
like you know brands that thought or
anything<00:03:53.620> like<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:55.000> can't<00:03:55.180> actually

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
anything like that you can't actually

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.520 
anything like that you can't actually
repair<00:03:55.810> them<00:03:55.959> which<00:03:56.080> is<00:03:56.230> cool

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.900 

all<00:04:00.040> right<00:04:01.230> here<00:04:02.230> we<00:04:02.260> go<00:04:02.319> again<00:04:02.670> radical<00:04:03.670> she

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
followed a sign something going this way

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.010 
followed a sign something going this way
another<00:04:07.150> thing<00:04:07.360> that's<00:04:07.510> annoying<00:04:07.720> is<00:04:07.900> you

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
another thing that's annoying is you

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.450 
another thing that's annoying is you
can't<00:04:08.230> put<00:04:08.380> weight<00:04:08.560> phone<00:04:08.800> it's<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.070> your<00:04:09.220> map

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
can't put weight phone it's on your map

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.710 
can't put weight phone it's on your map
like

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
like

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.450 
like
in<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.140> lot<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.470> these<00:04:12.560> games<00:04:12.830> these<00:04:13.010> days<00:04:13.070> where

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
in a lot of these games these days where

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.680 
in a lot of these games these days where
there's<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.640> lot<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.760> drive<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.390> can<00:04:14.540> just

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
there's a lot of drive and you can just

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.850 
there's a lot of drive and you can just
use<00:04:14.780> wait<00:04:15.080> points<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.560> then<00:04:15.620> you'll<00:04:15.800> have

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
use wait points and then you'll have

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.740 
use wait points and then you'll have
like<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.040> GPS<00:04:16.340> trail<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.390> game<00:04:17.570> doesn't

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
like a GPS trail and this game doesn't

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.480 
like a GPS trail and this game doesn't
have<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:18.410> yeah<00:04:18.530> kind<00:04:18.829> of<00:04:18.890> end<00:04:19.040> up<00:04:19.190> just

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.530 

following<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.520> street<00:04:22.790> signs<00:04:23.090> rather<00:04:23.390> than

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
following the street signs rather than

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.400 
following the street signs rather than
anything<00:04:23.870> else<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.110> just<00:04:24.140> kind<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.590> stupid

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
anything else you just kind of stupid

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.900 
anything else you just kind of stupid
so<00:04:26.920> looks<00:04:27.070> like<00:04:27.130> i<00:04:27.250> have<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.430> drive<00:04:27.640> prices

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
so looks like i have to drive prices

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.880 
so looks like i have to drive prices
camp<00:04:28.390> again<00:04:28.720> where<00:04:29.110> every<00:04:29.410> time<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.650> Drive<00:04:29.830> past
