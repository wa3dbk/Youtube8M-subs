 Hello dear fishermen in this 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.530
 The video will be about such bait as 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.540
 terminal crust what fish can it 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.699
 catch and like this crust 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.570
 implant, I'll show you later here we 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.050
 need to cook on the left cut such 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.050
 squares 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:36.910
 but by the edge we see a square crust 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:41.690
 must fit a handful of size 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.409
 since i have hooks now big i 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.650
 cut squares bigger 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:57.939
 where there are two ways to hook 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:01:07.210
 crust the first way with the edge punched 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:07.210
 hook the flesh then the crust itself 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.090
 that's how we turn the hook 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.090
 we'll get it 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.420
 turn and pull up 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.939

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.939
 sting . 5 bread flesh and 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.640
 keeps well on the hook so for 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.830
 popovka

 for privoch fishing rods so for donkey and 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:07.780
