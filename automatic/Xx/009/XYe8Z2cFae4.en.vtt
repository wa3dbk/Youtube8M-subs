00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.450
 when we go out it's always when we have 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.469
 last minute plans and the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.639
 three quarters of the time when we do 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.269
 last minute plans we're never 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.830
 ready to go out 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.260

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.329
 since yesterday there is nothing in it 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.270
 here you can also do it with the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.559
 dry 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.180
 the first league this will be a hairstyle 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.260
 we will use two products the first 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.129

 keeping it a little bit 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.449
 few ideas to be able to better 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.570
 work so we took up arms 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:16.720
 foam all over the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:18.220

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.000
 this brand 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.530
 because it's pros this age real 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.690
 and they are very good projects are 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.010

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.440
 this time I'm going to use to 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.820
