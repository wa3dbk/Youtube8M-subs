lovely blip on the downshift and that's
with<00:02:20.030> every<00:02:20.270> other<00:02:20.390> Ferrari<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.930> range<00:02:21.260> of

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
with every other Ferrari in the range of

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.350 
with every other Ferrari in the range of
the<00:02:21.440> moment<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.890> gearbox<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.400> pretty<00:02:23.060> much

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the moment the gearbox is pretty much

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.460 
the moment the gearbox is pretty much
perfect

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
perfect

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.840 
perfect
I've<00:02:24.740> changed<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.190> steering<00:02:25.580> wheel<00:02:25.700> as<00:02:25.820> well

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
I've changed the steering wheel as well

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.180 
I've changed the steering wheel as well
so<00:02:26.210> you've<00:02:26.390> got<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.350> paddles<00:02:27.740> are<00:02:27.860> being<00:02:28.040> only

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
so you've got the paddles are being only

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.770 
so you've got the paddles are being only
easier<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.580> reach<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.210> it's<00:02:29.360> pretty<00:02:29.540> much<00:02:29.660> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
easier to reach so it's pretty much the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.590 
easier to reach so it's pretty much the
same<00:02:30.050> as<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.410> four<00:02:30.980> five<00:02:31.220> eight

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.360 

it's<00:02:36.600> an<00:02:36.690> interesting<00:02:36.930> statistic<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.770> 70%

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
it's an interesting statistic that 70%

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.520 
it's an interesting statistic that 70%
of<00:02:38.610> people<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.030> bought<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.810> California

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
of people that bought the California

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.280 
of people that bought the California
were<00:02:41.250> new<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.550> Ferrari<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.480> their<00:02:42.840> first<00:02:43.080> ever

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290

their customer base of this car is very

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.110 
their customer base of this car is very

different from any of their other models

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.850 
different from any of their other models
it's<00:02:48.870> really<00:02:49.110> been<00:02:49.290> designed<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.740> be<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
bit softer a little bit easier to live

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.710 
bit softer a little bit easier to live
with<00:02:53.520> in<00:02:53.640> some<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.910> their<00:02:54.000> other<00:02:54.090> sports<00:02:54.420> cars

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
with in some of their other sports cars

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.200 
with in some of their other sports cars
a<00:02:55.050> nice<00:02:55.650> blend<00:02:56.070> between<00:02:56.250> open-top<00:02:56.940> grand

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.510 
tourer and of pure thoroughbred sports
car<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.870> last<00:03:01.050> California<00:03:01.770> was<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> little

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
car but the last California was a little

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.250 
car but the last California was a little
bit<00:03:02.640> disappointing<00:03:03.240> dynamically<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.140> was

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
bit disappointing dynamically so it was

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.660 
bit disappointing dynamically so it was
quite<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:04.530> roll<00:03:04.830> over<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.280> rear<00:03:05.460> of<00:03:05.490> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
quite a little roll over the rear of the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.180 
quite a little roll over the rear of the
car<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.420> weight<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.020> hardtop<00:03:07.470> roof<00:03:07.680> was

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
car the weight of the hardtop roof was

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.830 
car the weight of the hardtop roof was
really<00:03:08.460> felt<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.910> way<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> car<00:03:09.300> handled

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
really felt with the way the car handled

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.960 
really felt with the way the car handled
so<00:03:10.560> far<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.890> made<00:03:11.040> quite<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> lot<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.520> changes

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
so far it made quite a lot of changes

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.020 
so far it made quite a lot of changes
the<00:03:12.930> chassis<00:03:13.320> stays<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.770> same<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.280> same

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the chassis stays the same and same

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.430 
the chassis stays the same and same
wheelbase<00:03:15.270> same<00:03:15.660> dimensions<00:03:16.140> everything's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
wheelbase same dimensions everything's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.480 
wheelbase same dimensions everything's
the<00:03:16.560> same<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:16.950> they've<00:03:17.100> made<00:03:17.280> some<00:03:17.430> changes

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
the same but they've made some changes

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.890 
the same but they've made some changes
in<00:03:17.940> suspension<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:20.190> damping<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:20.850> 11%<00:03:21.630> in

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
in suspension so the damping is 11% in

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.850 
in suspension so the damping is 11% in
that

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.780 
that
the<00:03:24.340> steering<00:03:24.790> has<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:24.940> 10%<00:03:25.210> faster<00:03:25.690> ratio<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
the steering has a 10% faster ratio and

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.460 
the steering has a 10% faster ratio and
it's<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.000> sharpen<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.630> upper<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.990> can<00:03:29.200> feel

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
it's a sharpen the upper you can feel

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.710 
it's a sharpen the upper you can feel
that<00:03:29.500> when<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:29.830> drive<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.600> California<00:03:31.600> now

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
that when you drive the California now

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.050 
that when you drive the California now
it<00:03:31.840> does<00:03:32.020> feel<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.650> little<00:03:32.890> bit<00:03:33.310> sharper<00:03:33.790> than

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
it does feel a little bit sharper than

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.020 
it does feel a little bit sharper than
the<00:03:34.210> old<00:03:34.390> car<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:38.310> Cummings<00:03:39.310> Ward's<00:03:39.640> at<00:03:39.760> five

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the old car so Cummings Ward's at five

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.080 
the old car so Cummings Ward's at five
quite<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.360> fairly<00:03:40.720> fast<00:03:41.070> sweeping<00:03:42.070> corner<00:03:42.460> as

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
quite a fairly fast sweeping corner as

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
you never get a sense of being next

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.150 
you never get a sense of being next
meeting<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.350> little<00:04:05.500> bit<00:04:05.590> uncomfortable<00:04:05.860> in

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
meeting a little bit uncomfortable in

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.850 
meeting a little bit uncomfortable in
this<00:04:06.310> car<00:04:06.520> it<00:04:06.610> feels<00:04:06.850> pretty<00:04:07.480> well<00:04:07.860> planty

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
this car it feels pretty well planty

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.800 
this car it feels pretty well planty
that<00:04:09.040> much<00:04:09.310> more<00:04:09.580> confident<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.330> corners<00:04:10.690> in

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
that much more confident the corners in

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:19.710 
that much more confident the corners in
the<00:04:10.900> old<00:04:11.050> car<00:04:17.880> traction<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.150> stone<00:04:19.420> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
the old car traction on the stone the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.300 
the old car traction on the stone the
except<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.230> slowest<00:04:20.620> being<00:04:20.859> honest<00:04:21.160> isn't

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
except the slowest being honest isn't

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.280 
except the slowest being honest isn't
bad<00:04:21.580> either<00:04:22.110> helped<00:04:23.110> by<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.350> fact<00:04:23.620> that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
bad either helped by the fact that

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.830 
bad either helped by the fact that
get<00:04:24.530> all<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.950> talk<00:04:25.190> in<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.400> lower<00:04:25.640> gears

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.570 

so<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.960> California<00:04:30.440> T's<00:04:30.650> got<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:30.950> three-stage

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
so the California T's got a three-stage

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.100 
so the California T's got a three-stage
manettino<00:04:32.120> button<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.750> steering<00:04:32.930> wheel

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
manettino button on the steering wheel

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.950 
manettino button on the steering wheel
so<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:33.470> can<00:04:33.620> have<00:04:34.240> comfort<00:04:35.240> sports<00:04:35.630> and

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
so you can have comfort sports and

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.680 
so you can have comfort sports and
stability<00:04:36.470> control<00:04:36.800> off<00:04:37.480> driving<00:04:38.480> in<00:04:38.600> the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
stability control off driving in the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.060 
stability control off driving in the
sport<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.020> get<00:04:39.170> a<00:04:39.230> much<00:04:39.620> sharper<00:04:39.860> throttle

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
sport you get a much sharper throttle

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.450 
sport you get a much sharper throttle
response<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:42.320> steering<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.860> quicker<00:04:43.190> and

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
response and the steering is quicker and

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.120 
response and the steering is quicker and
bit<00:04:44.060> weightier<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:45.500> I've<00:04:45.620> got<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.860> say<00:04:45.980> the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
bit weightier and I've got to say the

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.590 
bit weightier and I've got to say the
steering<00:04:46.520> isn't<00:04:46.640> bad<00:04:46.940> in<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:47.210> car<00:04:47.420> they've

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
steering isn't bad in this car they've

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.260 
steering isn't bad in this car they've
improved<00:04:48.040> spread<00:04:49.040> out<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.250> ratio<00:04:49.670> but<00:04:49.940> it's

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
improved spread out the ratio but it's

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.420 
improved spread out the ratio but it's
fast<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.930> it's<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.590> positive<00:04:51.770> turning<00:04:52.370> but

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
fast and it's a positive turning but

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.520 
fast and it's a positive turning but
it's<00:04:52.580> not<00:04:52.760> sometimes<00:04:53.600> they're<00:04:53.900> steering<00:04:54.200> so

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
it's not sometimes they're steering so

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.890 
it's not sometimes they're steering so
fast

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
fast

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.450 

which<00:04:57.900> combined<00:04:58.289> with<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.650> slightly<00:04:58.919> softer

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
which combined with the slightly softer

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.090 
which combined with the slightly softer
setup<00:05:00.270> with<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.570> California<00:05:01.229> could<00:05:01.380> be<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.949> bit

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
setup with the California could be a bit

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.590 
setup with the California could be a bit
of<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.190> problem<00:05:02.370> but<00:05:02.699> actually<00:05:02.850> in<00:05:03.539> reality

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
of a problem but actually in reality

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.320 
of a problem but actually in reality
it's<00:05:04.199> not<00:05:04.380> too<00:05:04.650> fast<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.430> think<00:05:06.060> pretty<00:05:06.240> much

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
it's not too fast I think pretty much

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.000 
it's not too fast I think pretty much
right<00:05:07.080> there

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.110 

the<00:05:11.010> other<00:05:11.130> new<00:05:11.310> feature<00:05:11.610> that's<00:05:11.850> carried

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
the other new feature that's carried

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.430 
the other new feature that's carried
across<00:05:12.210> from<00:05:12.480> other<00:05:12.600> Ferraris<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.260> fact

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
across from other Ferraris is the fact

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.960 
across from other Ferraris is the fact
you<00:05:13.500> can<00:05:13.710> unhook<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.250> dampers<00:05:14.670> from<00:05:14.850> the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
you can unhook the dampers from the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.910 
you can unhook the dampers from the
manettino<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:15.720> that<00:05:15.840> means<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.200> can<00:05:16.350> have<00:05:16.530> the

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
manettino so that means you can have the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.640 
manettino so that means you can have the
throttle<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.480> engine<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.140> steering<00:05:19.350> in

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
throttle and the engine and steering in

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.650 
throttle and the engine and steering in
a<00:05:19.740> sport<00:05:20.010> setting<00:05:20.250> but<00:05:20.970> pressing<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.510> little

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
a sport setting but pressing the little

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
a sport setting but pressing the little
damper<00:05:21.960> button<00:05:22.140> here<00:05:22.290> on<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.440> steering<00:05:22.590> wheel

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
damper button here on the steering wheel

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.700 
damper button here on the steering wheel
means<00:05:22.890> you<00:05:22.980> can<00:05:23.100> have<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.300> softer<00:05:24.300> ride

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
means you can have the softer ride

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.930 
means you can have the softer ride
whilst<00:05:25.710> you've<00:05:25.950> got<00:05:26.100> sporty<00:05:26.490> for<00:05:26.700> everything

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
whilst you've got sporty for everything

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.370 
whilst you've got sporty for everything
else<00:05:29.360> okay<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.570> california's<00:05:31.050> improved

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
else okay so the california's improved

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.800 
else okay so the california's improved
dynamically<00:05:32.040> this<00:05:32.580> car<00:05:32.790> is<00:05:32.910> also<00:05:33.060> about<00:05:33.510> long

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.350 
thing that hasn't changed far we haven't
touched<00:05:38.400> though<00:05:38.640> it's<00:05:38.760> exactly<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.180> same<00:05:39.300> as

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
touched though it's exactly the same as

the old car so if comes up in 14 seconds
you<00:05:42.600> can't<00:05:42.810> do<00:05:42.960> it<00:05:43.020> when<00:05:43.110> you're<00:05:43.230> on<00:05:43.320> when<00:05:43.560> the
