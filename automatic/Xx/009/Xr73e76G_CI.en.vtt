00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.833
[cheers and applause]

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:02.866
Can't believe it's May.

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.233
We don't have seasons in L.A.,

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.866
but I can always tell
when May is here,

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.900
because all the Uber drivers
switch their cologne

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.900
to the summer blend.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.533
[audience laughter]

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.900
[inhales]
Ah!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.566
[audience laughter]

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.800
It's nice to have an Uber,
but I prefer to drive myself.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.066
I really like to drive.
I may be a celebrity,

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.200
but I drive my own car
to work every morning,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.766
and then I'm placed
in a golden chair

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.166
and carried
to my dressing room.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.500
[audience laughter]

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.566
I think I'm a good driver, I do.
I think--

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.833
I wear my seat belt.
I use my turn signals.

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.933
I check my mirrors--
and I like what I see.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.700
[audience laughter]

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400
I do everything
that they taught us.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.266
I put my hands on
the steering wheel.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.300
I always put them at--
say it with me:

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.200
(all)
Ten and two.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.433
- Guess what?
We've been doing it wrong.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.366
[audience laughter]
According to the people

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.466
at the American Automobile
Association, or as I call it,

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.500
"Aah..."

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.966
[audience laughter]

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.033
They say it's dangerous to drive
with your hands at ten and two,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.666
because, uh--
you can't do it anymore,

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.966
because now, the new cars have
air bags in the steering wheels,

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.800
and if your hands are
at ten and two,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.866
if you get in an accident, it'll
blow your hands into your face.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.100
[audience murmurs and laughs]
Now this is serious.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.733
I'm a Cover Girl.

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.200
I can't break this money maker.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.900
[laughter and applause]

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.133
I can't afford it.
[cheers and applause]

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:22.900
[cheers and applause]

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.400
Originally, you were supposed to
put your hands at ten and two,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.000
because cars didn't have
power steering,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.433
so it made it easier
to turn the wheel,

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:32.300
and it made it easier for you
to hold your cigarette,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.966
and--
[audience laughter]

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.766
and your martini
in your other hand.

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:37.800
[audience laughter]
Ah, those were the days, huh?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100
[audience laughter]
So now there's new rules

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.433
for putting your hands
lower on the steering wheel,

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.600
and they say it can be between
eight and four,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.533
or nine and three.

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.533
Which is a big window.
It sounds like the new rules

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.333
are being written by the cable
guy, or something like that.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.333
[audience laughter]

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.733
If it's too hard to remember,

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:56.866
just do what I do:
let Jesus take the wheel.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.466
[cheers and applause]

00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.800
That's what you do.
[cheers and applause]

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.433
[cheers and applause]

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.633
You take it.
[cheers and applause]

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:06.900
Right now, I recommend that
you throw your hands in the air

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.733
like you just don't care, 'cause
we're about to dance, now.
