00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.180
 in this video I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.410
 this type of wave without needing 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.809
 no special template is to say 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.460
 simply the normal without having to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:25.920
 have without having without good without having 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.370
 why have the other special plate 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.140
 for waves 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.930
 and good 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.600
 So go ahead with the video according to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.300
 size we want the wave to have 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.350
 We will divide our hair into more parts or 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 less to fill it with braid 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.199
 I do not like the wave very very 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.199
 small I will do 42 for each side 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.570
 it's good once we've done it 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.990
 our braids we will take the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.990
 plates 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.440
 normal 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 and we will go through it 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.690
 as if we were not doing the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.690
 hair but by the braid 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.790
 and now with lacquer 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.150
 and so also with the rest of the stress 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.700
 Well, once we 've done it with 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.660
 all the braids as nothing to undo 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.660
 to see how 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.780
 Well, this would be the result of 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.200
 how would these pretty 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.099
 yes 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.810
 no need for some type of iron 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.330
 pressure to do it simply with the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.130
 normal and a dexterity is also a 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.500
 way to make it very fast 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.900
 and well it was not too bad if 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.480
 I wanted them to be branded more 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.160
 I suppose I raise it gps I do not know why 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.410
 the truth that I am experiencing in the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.350
 first of this vague really what 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.210
 I do is make braids at night 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.620
 next day take off the iata but 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.480
 Of course, if we want it for that same day 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.730
 Well, we do not do our braids 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.220
 we passed the iron and without needing 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.940
 all kinds of special iron 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.940
 we can have 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.500
 these waves if we want them bigger 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.590
 because it would be a matter of a braid nothing 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.590
 plus 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.460
 and well I hope you liked the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.460
 video see you in the next
