we're gonna take our regular fishing
pole<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.920> we're<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.220> attach<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
pole right and we're going to attach it

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.850

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
normally cast so it took a coat hanger

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.260 
normally cast so it took a coat hanger
and<00:01:20.550> heated<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.480> up<00:01:21.630> came<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> gizmo

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and heated it up came up with a gizmo

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.130 
and heated it up came up with a gizmo
called<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.840> RC<00:01:25.200> fishing<00:01:25.620> pole<00:01:25.830> we're<00:01:26.610> taking

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140
