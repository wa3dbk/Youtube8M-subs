00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
stretch outside of the design here to

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.809 
stretch outside of the design here to
really<00:01:41.409> get<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.740> animation<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.520> way<00:01:42.640> that

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
layer there so let's go ahead and try

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.810 
layer there so let's go ahead and try
that<00:02:22.660> one<00:02:22.780> more<00:02:22.930> time<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.470> if<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.400> zooming

to come right down here to this button
and<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.090> says<00:03:13.300> duplicate<00:03:13.870> selected<00:03:14.170> frames<00:03:14.890> so

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
and it says duplicate selected frames so

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.250 
and it says duplicate selected frames so
when<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.730> hit<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> duplicate<00:03:16.540> selected<00:03:16.959> frames

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
when I hit the duplicate selected frames

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.229 
when I hit the duplicate selected frames
there<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:18.100> can<00:03:18.280> see<00:03:18.459> right<00:03:18.610> there<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.910> made<00:03:19.090> of

there you can see right there it made of

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.420 
there you can see right there it made of
frame<00:03:19.510> two<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.020> I<00:03:20.080> have<00:03:20.260> mine<00:03:20.530> set<00:03:20.560> at<00:03:21.010> zero

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
frame two and I have mine set at zero

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.060 
frame two and I have mine set at zero
and<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.300> can<00:03:22.450> set<00:03:22.690> yours<00:03:22.930> any<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.709> know<00:03:23.830> any

move that in by holding shift it's gonna

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.530 
move that in by holding shift it's gonna
constrain<00:03:38.470> on<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.680> same<00:03:38.890> axis<00:03:39.430> here<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.239> right

the right there and I just want that to

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.280 
the right there and I just want that to
just<00:03:48.910> come<00:03:49.090> right<00:03:49.269> in<00:03:49.420> here<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.930> didn't

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
just come right in here I didn't

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.660 
just come right in here I didn't
necessarily<00:03:50.410> want<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:51.100> be<00:03:51.280> too<00:03:51.489> concerned

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
necessarily want to be too concerned

necessarily want to be too concerned
we're<00:03:52.570> trying<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.019> grab<00:03:53.380> these<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.130> missing

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
we're trying to grab these and missing

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880 
we're trying to grab these and missing
because<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:56.019> know<00:03:56.140> kind<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.500> look<00:03:56.650> at<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.799> like

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
because you know kind of look at it like

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.830 
because you know kind of look at it like
this<00:03:57.220> things<00:03:57.640> are<00:03:57.760> being<00:03:57.940> recorded<00:03:58.450> right<00:03:58.810> now

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
this things are being recorded right now

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.050 
this things are being recorded right now
and<00:03:59.380> as<00:03:59.829> you<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.010> see<00:04:00.070> that<00:04:00.370> bounced<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.850> there

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
and as you can see that bounced in there

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.580 
and as you can see that bounced in there
that<00:04:01.329> might<00:04:01.480> be<00:04:01.600> kind<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.870> cool<00:04:02.049> in<00:04:02.230> reference

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
that might be kind of cool in reference

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.620 
that might be kind of cool in reference
to<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.769> animation<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:03.940> don't<00:04:04.150> necessarily

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
to the animation so don't necessarily

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.930 
to the animation so don't necessarily
worry<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.260> went<00:04:05.440> too<00:04:05.590> far<00:04:05.620> there<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.790> the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
worry that you went too far there so the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.550 
worry that you went too far there so the
next<00:04:07.150> step<00:04:07.510> we're<00:04:07.660> going<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.870> take<00:04:08.049> here<00:04:08.410> is

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
next step we're going to take here is

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.960 
next step we're going to take here is
we're<00:04:08.799> going<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.980> just<00:04:09.040> mouse<00:04:09.370> over<00:04:09.670> here<00:04:09.700> and

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you can see the tweens animation frames

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.220 
you can see the tweens animation frames
here<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.450> when<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.600> click<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.959> tweens

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
higher the frames the slower is gonna be

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.400 
higher the frames the slower is gonna be
the<00:04:27.130> lower<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.520> frames<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.930> better<00:04:29.140> the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
the lower the frames the better the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.170 
the lower the frames the better the
faster<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:29.830> gonna<00:04:29.979> be<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.490> kind<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.090> want

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
faster is gonna be and you kind of want

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.270 
faster is gonna be and you kind of want
to<00:04:31.270> make<00:04:31.390> it<00:04:31.450> with<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.900> you<00:04:32.560> know<00:04:32.590> somewhat<00:04:33.099> of

to make it with a you know somewhat of
some<00:04:33.460> speed<00:04:33.789> here<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.210> don't<00:04:34.300> want<00:04:34.510> it<00:04:34.570> to

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
some speed here you don't want it to

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.390 
some speed here you don't want it to
move<00:04:34.750> really<00:04:35.020> slow<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.740> I'm<00:04:36.130> gonna<00:04:36.220> tell<00:04:36.370> you

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.260 
when I get over here to save for the web
the<00:05:22.330> reason<00:05:22.630> why<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:23.050> only<00:05:23.259> have<00:05:23.530> 6<00:05:23.860> frames

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
the reason why I only have 6 frames

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.029 
the reason why I only have 6 frames
versus<00:05:25.270> 12<00:05:25.630> or<00:05:25.900> 20<00:05:26.289> and<00:05:26.409> have<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:26.740> moving

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
versus 12 or 20 and have it moving

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.070 
versus 12 or 20 and have it moving
really<00:05:27.250> slow<00:05:27.639> there<00:05:27.909> it's<00:05:28.509> for<00:05:28.659> the<00:05:28.780> simple

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
really slow there it's for the simple

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.260 
really slow there it's for the simple
fact<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.440> YouTube<00:05:30.099> only<00:05:30.370> allows<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:31.090> to
