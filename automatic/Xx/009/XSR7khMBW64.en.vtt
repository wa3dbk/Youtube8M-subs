why is that well momentum measures how

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.709 
why is that well momentum measures how
hard<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.550> stop<00:00:38.760> an<00:00:38.910> object<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> car

times meters per second which is the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.610 
times meters per second which is the

the formula for momentum is very

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.869 
the formula for momentum is very
straight<00:00:54.510> forward<00:00:54.980> momentum<00:00:55.980> equals<00:00:56.610> mass

times<00:00:57.360> velocity<00:00:58.160> let's<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.340> how<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.520> could

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
times velocity let's see how we could

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
times velocity let's see how we could
apply<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.480> our<00:01:01.079> sample<00:01:01.500> problem<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
apply that in our sample problem to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
apply that in our sample problem to
trains<00:01:02.489> big<00:01:02.820> red<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.239> blue<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
trains big red and little blue have the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
trains big red and little blue have the
same<00:01:04.170> velocity<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.129> big<00:01:05.339> red<00:01:05.369> has<00:01:05.700> twice<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
same velocity but big red has twice the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
same velocity but big red has twice the
mass<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.990> blue<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.100> say

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
mass of little blue what can you say

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.730 
mass of little blue what can you say
about<00:01:08.310> their<00:01:08.729> momenta<00:01:09.320> well<00:01:10.320> since<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.619> have

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
about their momenta well since they have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
about their momenta well since they have
the<00:01:10.830> same<00:01:10.860> velocity<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.640> big<00:01:11.850> red<00:01:11.880> has<00:01:12.150> twice

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the same velocity in big red has twice

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780 
the same velocity in big red has twice
the<00:01:12.510> mass<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.260> must<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.650> twice<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> momentum

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the mass it must have twice the momentum

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.370 
the mass it must have twice the momentum
therefore<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> momentum<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.409> big<00:01:16.740> red<00:01:18.380> must

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
therefore the momentum of big red must

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.880 
therefore the momentum of big red must
be<00:01:19.590> twice<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.280> big<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> momentum<00:01:21.890> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
be twice as big as the momentum of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.749 
be twice as big as the momentum of
little<00:01:23.310> blue<00:01:24.350> very<00:01:25.350> straightforward<00:01:26.130> let's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
little blue very straightforward let's

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.499 
little blue very straightforward let's
look<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.060> another<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.610> magnitude<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
look at another one the magnitude of the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
look at another one the magnitude of the
momentum<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> an<00:01:31.110> object<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> 64<00:01:32.189> kilogram

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
momentum of an object is 64 kilogram

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.280 
momentum of an object is 64 kilogram
meters<00:01:33.030> per<00:01:33.060> second<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:34.110> it's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
meters per second so we know it's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.130 
meters per second so we know it's
momentum<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.920> 64<00:01:35.610> kilograms<00:01:36.360> times<00:01:36.900> meters

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
momentum is 64 kilograms times meters

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.249 
momentum is 64 kilograms times meters
per<00:01:37.439> second<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:39.060> also<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.600> momentum<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.229> mass

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
per second we also know momentum is mass

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.940 
per second we also know momentum is mass
times<00:01:40.560> velocity<00:01:41.180> if<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.810> velocity<00:01:43.079> is
