here<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> opened<00:02:13.170> up<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.439> work<00:02:13.620> pot<00:02:13.829> of<00:02:14.150> rook<00:02:15.150> to

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
here I opened up my work pot of rook to

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.330 
here I opened up my work pot of rook to
attack<00:02:15.629> from<00:02:15.779> the<00:02:15.870> bishop<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.499> thinking<00:02:17.129> at<00:02:17.249> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
attack from the bishop I thinking at the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.430 
attack from the bishop I thinking at the
time<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.790> as<00:02:17.969> if<00:02:18.120> he

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
time was as if he

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.260 
time was as if he
down<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.450> would<00:02:20.660> capture<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.060> Queen

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
down that I would capture with the Queen

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.840 
down that I would capture with the Queen
giving<00:02:23.720> her<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.870> nice<00:02:24.080> open<00:02:25.070> path<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
giving her a nice open path to the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.050 
giving her a nice open path to the
castle<00:02:26.450> king<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.100> my<00:02:28.100> dark<00:02:28.340> Bishop<00:02:28.700> was<00:02:28.850> close

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
castle king and my dark Bishop was close

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.270 
castle king and my dark Bishop was close
by<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:29.720> actually<00:02:29.870> thinking<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.440> getting

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
by so I was actually thinking of getting

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.070 
by so I was actually thinking of getting
something<00:02:31.670> together<00:02:32.030> along<00:02:32.510> those<00:02:32.750> lines

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
something together along those lines

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.100 
something together along those lines
however<00:02:33.920> my<00:02:34.340> opponent<00:02:34.730> doesn't<00:02:34.850> play<00:02:35.180> Bishop

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
however my opponent doesn't play Bishop

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.200 
however my opponent doesn't play Bishop
takes<00:02:36.470> he<00:02:37.400> goes<00:02:37.820> pawn<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.600> g4<00:02:40.060> threatening<00:02:41.060> my

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
takes he goes pawn to g4 threatening my

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.420 
takes he goes pawn to g4 threatening my
night<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.690> at<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> time<00:02:42.680> i<00:02:42.740> looked<00:02:43.190> at<00:02:43.310> my

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
night and at the time i looked at my

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.020 
night and at the time i looked at my
night<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.030> could<00:02:44.270> have<00:02:44.360> moved<00:02:44.480> him<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.750> h4

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
night and I could have moved him to h4

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.520 
night and I could have moved him to h4
which<00:02:47.030> was<00:02:47.240> really<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.630> only<00:02:47.660> safe<00:02:48.140> square<00:02:48.440> he

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
which was really the only safe square he

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.070 
which was really the only safe square he
had<00:02:48.710> other<00:02:48.890> than<00:02:49.160> coming<00:02:49.550> back<00:02:49.730> down<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.590> D<00:02:51.590> 2

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
had other than coming back down to D 2

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.120 
had other than coming back down to D 2
which<00:02:54.080> would<00:02:54.230> have<00:02:54.290> blocked<00:02:54.500> my<00:02:54.800> Queens

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
which would have blocked my Queens

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.250 
which would have blocked my Queens
access<00:02:55.670> along<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> D<00:02:56.270> file<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.930> just

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
access along the D file so I just

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.590 
access along the D file so I just
actually<00:02:57.500> let<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.040> what<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.880> night<00:02:59.060> go<00:02:59.300> and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
actually let the what the night go and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.860 
actually let the what the night go and
move<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.680> rock<00:03:00.860> out<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.190> harm's<00:03:01.760> way<00:03:01.850> he<00:03:02.570> takes

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
move the rock out of harm's way he takes

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.440 
move the rock out of harm's way he takes
the<00:03:03.080> night<00:03:03.550> when<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.640> take<00:03:04.880> back<00:03:05.060> with<00:03:05.240> my

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the night when I take back with my

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.970 
the night when I take back with my
bishop<00:03:06.940> now<00:03:07.940> he<00:03:08.000> brings<00:03:08.270> his<00:03:08.540> night<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:09.110> d4

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
bishop now he brings his night to d4

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.400 
bishop now he brings his night to d4
which<00:03:10.220> was<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.780> pretty<00:03:11.780> good<00:03:11.840> move<00:03:12.110> for<00:03:12.290> his

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
which was a pretty good move for his

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.680 
which was a pretty good move for his
night<00:03:13.060> obviously<00:03:14.060> I'm<00:03:14.150> not<00:03:14.180> going<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.510> take

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
on his castle side and I still have this

on his castle side and I still have this
dark<00:03:33.920> Bishop<00:03:34.280> over<00:03:34.520> here<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.880> can<00:03:35.000> bring

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
dark Bishop over here that I can bring

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.460 
dark Bishop over here that I can bring
into<00:03:35.420> play<00:03:35.860> he<00:03:36.860> takes<00:03:37.160> on<00:03:37.720> e6<00:03:38.720> opening<00:03:39.290> his

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
into play he takes on e6 opening his

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.490 
into play he takes on e6 opening his
rook<00:03:39.650> up<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.980> attack<00:03:40.220> my<00:03:40.400> queen<00:03:41.260> but<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.290> just

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
rook up to attack my queen but I just

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.990 
rook up to attack my queen but I just
move<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.770> over<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.010> pitting<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> mission

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.160 

opponent<00:03:47.000> moves<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.239> King<00:03:47.450> over<00:03:47.750> um<00:03:50.170> it's

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
opponent moves the King over um it's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.449 
opponent moves the King over um it's
probably<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.650> good<00:03:51.709> move<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.040> he<00:03:52.220> did<00:03:52.430> that

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
probably a good move that he did that

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.520 
probably a good move that he did that
because<00:03:52.790> what<00:03:53.120> would<00:03:53.239> happened<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:54.019> he<00:03:54.200> didn't

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
because what would happened if he didn't

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.930 
because what would happened if he didn't
let's<00:03:54.830> say<00:03:54.980> he<00:03:55.100> makes<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.400> push<00:03:55.610> for<00:03:55.790> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
let's say he makes a push for the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.020 
let's say he makes a push for the
strength<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:56.989> his<00:03:57.110> pawn<00:03:57.519> structure<00:03:58.519> here<00:03:58.760> I

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
strength in his pawn structure here I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.320 
strength in his pawn structure here I
just<00:03:59.360> come<00:03:59.570> down<00:03:59.750> here<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:01.840> from<00:04:02.840> this<00:04:02.989> point

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
just come down here and from this point

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.370 
just come down here and from this point
he's<00:04:05.330> really<00:04:05.570> going<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.750> have<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.930> think<00:04:06.019> of<00:04:06.320> a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
he's really going to have to think of a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.320 
he's really going to have to think of a
lot<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.650> stuff<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.890> stop<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.700> checkmate<00:04:08.120> from

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
lot of stuff to stop the checkmate from

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.750 
lot of stuff to stop the checkmate from
happening<00:04:08.950> let's<00:04:09.950> just<00:04:10.160> say<00:04:10.280> he<00:04:10.430> moves<00:04:10.610> his

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
happening let's just say he moves his

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.470 
happening let's just say he moves his
King<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.630> know<00:04:11.750> what<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:12.260> game<00:04:12.500> over<00:04:13.480> so

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
King you know what it's game over so

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.970 
King you know what it's game over so
what<00:04:15.019> he<00:04:15.220> played<00:04:16.220> in<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> game<00:04:20.620> was<00:04:21.620> King

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
what he played in the game was King

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.550 
what he played in the game was King

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
moves over 2 h8 now his Bishop is able

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.550 
moves over 2 h8 now his Bishop is able
to<00:04:27.770> move<00:04:28.220> again<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:29.750> I'm<00:04:29.900> going<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.140> offer<00:04:30.320> up

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
to move again so I'm going to offer up

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.580 
to move again so I'm going to offer up
as<00:04:30.740> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
as a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.710 
as a
sacrifice<00:04:32.280> here<00:04:32.780> see<00:04:33.780> if<00:04:33.810> he<00:04:33.960> falls<00:04:34.200> for<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:35.720> my

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
sacrifice here see if he falls for it my

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.800 
sacrifice here see if he falls for it my
thinking<00:04:36.960> was<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.530> if<00:04:37.740> he<00:04:37.980> does<00:04:38.130> come<00:04:38.370> down

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
thinking was that if he does come down

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:49.990 
thinking was that if he does come down
take<00:04:41.090> check<00:04:45.290> checkmate<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:48.060> he<00:04:48.150> saw<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.570> and

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
take check checkmate but he saw that and

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.040 
take check checkmate but he saw that and
opted<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.060> go<00:04:51.090> for<00:04:51.240> pawn<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.290> d5<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:53.540> take<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:54.900> he

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
opted to go for pawn to d5 I take and he

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.770 
opted to go for pawn to d5 I take and he
takes<00:04:55.320> with<00:04:55.440> his<00:04:55.620> queen<00:04:56.450> from<00:04:57.450> this<00:04:57.570> position

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
takes with his queen from this position

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.310 
takes with his queen from this position
I<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.620> push<00:04:59.070> my<00:04:59.250> pawn<00:04:59.520> up<00:04:59.700> to<00:04:59.850> f3<00:05:00.320> protecting

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
I just push my pawn up to f3 protecting

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.850 
I just push my pawn up to f3 protecting
the<00:05:01.410> night<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:03.270> he<00:05:04.020> brings<00:05:04.260> his<00:05:04.380> Bishop<00:05:04.710> down

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
the night and he brings his Bishop down

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.690 
the night and he brings his Bishop down
and<00:05:05.040> puts<00:05:05.220> me<00:05:05.340> in<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.580> check<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:08.310> could<00:05:08.550> have

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
and puts me in to check it could have

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.520 
and puts me in to check it could have
done<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:08.940> couple<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.480> things<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.080> guess<00:05:10.350> I

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
done a couple of things here I guess I

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.890 
done a couple of things here I guess I
could<00:05:10.710> have<00:05:11.030> brought<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.270> night<00:05:12.420> back<00:05:12.660> down

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
could have brought the night back down

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.290 
could have brought the night back down
to<00:05:13.110> protect<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.890> could<00:05:14.880> have<00:05:14.970> brought<00:05:15.090> this

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
to protect I could have brought this

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.690 
to protect I could have brought this
rook<00:05:15.600> up<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.990> protect<00:05:16.380> but<00:05:16.920> what<00:05:17.040> I<00:05:17.070> decided<00:05:17.490> to

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
rook up to protect but what I decided to

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.450 
rook up to protect but what I decided to
just<00:05:17.970> pair<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.840> rooks<00:05:19.050> up<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:19.650> i<00:05:19.710> went<00:05:19.980> to<00:05:20.160> rook

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
just pair the rooks up so i went to rook

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.910 
just pair the rooks up so i went to rook
f2<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:22.140> i<00:05:22.830> was<00:05:22.980> really<00:05:23.730> liked<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.740> strength<00:05:25.740> i

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
bear on various strategies so he

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.320 
bear on various strategies so he
actually<00:05:34.920> offers<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.370> queen<00:05:35.670> sack<00:05:35.910> voice<00:05:36.150> at

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
actually offers a queen sack voice at

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.120 
actually offers a queen sack voice at
this<00:05:36.450> point<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.870> i<00:05:37.140> thought<00:05:37.740> about<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.100> for

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
this point and i thought about it for

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.590 
this point and i thought about it for
four<00:05:38.640> men<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:38.940> i<00:05:39.000> was<00:05:39.120> trying<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.390> think

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
four men and i was trying to think

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.120 
four men and i was trying to think
exactly<00:05:39.840> what<00:05:40.320> he<00:05:40.440> was<00:05:40.500> trying<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:40.860> do

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
exactly what he was trying to do

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.490 
exactly what he was trying to do
generally<00:05:42.090> when<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.270> see<00:05:42.540> a<00:05:42.570> queen<00:05:42.870> sacrifice

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
generally when I see a queen sacrifice

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.370 
generally when I see a queen sacrifice
it<00:05:43.710> means<00:05:43.920> a<00:05:44.450> dark<00:05:45.450> things<00:05:45.720> are<00:05:45.870> coming<00:05:46.080> on<00:05:46.290> the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
it means a dark things are coming on the

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.700 
it means a dark things are coming on the
horizon<00:05:47.510> so<00:05:48.510> I<00:05:48.540> thought<00:05:49.290> about<00:05:49.410> it<00:05:49.590> but<00:05:49.650> I

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
horizon so I thought about it but I

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.840 
horizon so I thought about it but I
think<00:05:49.920> he<00:05:50.040> just<00:05:50.070> made<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.430> mistake<00:05:50.820> and

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
think he just made a mistake and

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.630 
think he just made a mistake and
underestimated<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:52.740> strength<00:05:52.950> I<00:05:53.220> had<00:05:53.400> in<00:05:53.550> my

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
underestimated the strength I had in my

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.370 
underestimated the strength I had in my
castle<00:05:53.910> position<00:05:54.480> here<00:05:54.630> so<00:05:54.780> i<00:05:54.840> just<00:05:54.870> take<00:05:55.140> with

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
castle position here so i just take with

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.610

the pond he takes my ruck and i take his
bishop<00:05:59.040> and<00:06:00.000> now<00:06:00.720> he<00:06:00.780> pulls<00:06:01.500> his<00:06:01.620> rook<00:06:01.860> out<00:06:02.010> of

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
bishop and now he pulls his rook out of

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.630 
bishop and now he pulls his rook out of
the<00:06:02.250> way<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:03.840> from<00:06:04.050> here<00:06:04.380> I<00:06:04.560> go<00:06:04.980> check<00:06:05.310> with<00:06:05.370> the

the bishop I love I like this position

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.350 
the bishop I love I like this position
of<00:06:12.930> my<00:06:13.020> bishop<00:06:13.380> here<00:06:13.620> it<00:06:14.550> really<00:06:14.760> puts<00:06:15.090> a<00:06:15.180> lot

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
of my bishop here it really puts a lot

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.940 
of my bishop here it really puts a lot
of<00:06:15.390> limitations<00:06:16.110> on<00:06:16.260> what<00:06:16.290> he<00:06:16.560> can<00:06:16.740> do<00:06:16.830> with

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
of limitations on what he can do with

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.870 
of limitations on what he can do with
his<00:06:17.010> eight<00:06:17.310> rook<00:06:19.220> pushes<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.370> pawn<00:06:20.550> up<00:06:20.730> to

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
his eight rook pushes the pawn up to

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.460 
his eight rook pushes the pawn up to
block<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.300> rook<00:06:21.480> but<00:06:22.020> without<00:06:22.230> any

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
block the rook but without any

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.620 
block the rook but without any
protection<00:06:22.620> it's<00:06:23.130> a<00:06:23.280> quick<00:06:23.460> take<00:06:23.730> and<00:06:24.000> still

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
protection it's a quick take and still

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.540 
protection it's a quick take and still
the<00:06:24.810> works<00:06:25.080> and<00:06:26.150> moves<00:06:27.150> his<00:06:27.300> rook<00:06:27.540> to<00:06:27.780> e8<00:06:28.470> and<00:06:29.040> I

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
the works and moves his rook to e8 and I

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.460 
the works and moves his rook to e8 and I
come<00:06:29.790> in<00:06:29.910> with<00:06:30.060> a<00:06:30.090> check<00:06:30.480> now<00:06:30.930> if<00:06:30.960> he<00:06:31.290> would

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
come in with a check now if he would

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.090
