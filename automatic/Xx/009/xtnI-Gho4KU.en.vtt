00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
bisexual people who do like both then

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.210 
bisexual people who do like both then
it's<00:02:35.530> logically<00:02:36.530> follows<00:02:36.859> that<00:02:36.950> there<00:02:37.099> must

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
it's logically follows that there must

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.009 
it's logically follows that there must
be<00:02:37.370> people<00:02:37.790> who<00:02:37.940> don't<00:02:38.180> find<00:02:38.389> either<00:02:38.660> gender

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
be people who don't find either gender

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.110 
be people who don't find either gender
to<00:02:39.200> be<00:02:39.290> sexually<00:02:39.709> attractive<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.849> is<00:02:41.000> in

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
fact the case a biochemical reason for

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.520 
fact the case a biochemical reason for
this<00:02:43.910> because<00:02:44.090> we're<00:02:44.299> all<00:02:44.450> are<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.079> wired

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
this because we're all are we not wired
