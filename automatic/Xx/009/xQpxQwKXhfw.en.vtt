00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.299
 we're just going to have another question 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.000
 involving the complex number 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.060
 Look, this question has only been 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 vestibular of the mackenzie in accompanying the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.660
 reading the value of the epsilon expression 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 same there but it's the square but it's the cube 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 three more dots but high and one 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.670
 do these three dots mean 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.969
 What are you going to have to keep doing? 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.179
 this sequence is squared but it is the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.780
 body but is more fourth and fifth most 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:47.219
 and the sixth plus and the seventh until they 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.670
 1001 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.949
 if you add this in hand one by one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.460
 will end the test you will not have 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.459
 finished the sum of ok then there is a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 I jump from the cat to these people and I said 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.339
 over there 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.390
 about it in the power of lessons 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:12.720
 information that is very important. 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:16.400
 that the sum of four is consecutive 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.850
 with put so will be equal to zero 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.800
 so let's go and there's nothing up there clothes 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.390
 on the right side and taken to a 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:31.770
 truth but square and square but 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 raised to cube plus raised to fourth 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.510
 this is going to be zero 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.960
 I do not believe in how to check 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.500
 high one equals how much equals e 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.690
 and squared equals how much less one 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.270
 and the cube is equal to how much neno c ea 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:57.930
 fourth is equal to how much staff is the same 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:01.320
 to one and less and 01 - 10 then to 4 number 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.770
 every four consecutive numbers goes 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.340
 give zero what we're going to do it 's good we have 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.220
 two ways to think ok he wants 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.760
 do you think the sum of 1,001 numbers 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.189
 Are you going to think about this and me? 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.030
 call change with 1.001 numbers you can 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:27.000
 to separate 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.660
 only to do a thousand plus one thousand 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.140
 it is divisible by four that this goes 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.130
 be equal to 250 then 250 times goes 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.150
 give zero 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.670
 Look at this one that is cyclical, that is you. 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.020
 will add the top four of zero 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.980
 we are 4 to 0 others we are 4 to 0 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.000
 this will happen 250 times in a row and 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:02.030
 There will be a number left over who will go 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.239
 and one that is equal to 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.350
 sure what the other way is 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.010
 that 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.060
 we can use a simple 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.530
 division 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.170
 Let's do here 1001/4 every 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.049
 four are repeating so let's go 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:28.890
 four times 28 to 10 are missing 12 below 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.579
 104 times 5 2010 the power to download a has 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:39.049
 I put another 0 here I come down 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:43.320
 then gave how much 250 250 divisions 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:46.079
 complete that is, divide from 44 and left over 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.579
 I'll do the same thing and raise a 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:52.350
 and boy 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.570
 Okay, anything goes there in class. 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.549
 base power on ok 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.230
 the correct alternative then this question 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.540
 is the letter b 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.890
 A big hug until the next videoula 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.130
 against a very interesting question there 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.540
 involving the real number to the real part of the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.970
 complex number ok 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.970
 a big hug to stay with God was
