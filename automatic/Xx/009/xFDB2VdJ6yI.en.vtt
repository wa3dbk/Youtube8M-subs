00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
way I play and it seems like this is the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.640 
way I play and it seems like this is the
easiest<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> smoothest<00:00:11.460> way<00:00:12.230> this<00:00:13.230> first

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
easiest and the smoothest way this first

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.590 
easiest and the smoothest way this first
finger<00:00:13.920> covers<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.969> top<00:00:15.179> two<00:00:16.130> and<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.820> these

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
finger covers the top two and this these

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.980 
finger covers the top two and this these
third<00:00:19.560> finger<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:19.949> fourth<00:00:20.279> finger<00:00:20.990> covers

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
third finger and fourth finger covers

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.650 
third finger and fourth finger covers
the<00:00:22.740> second<00:00:23.220> string<00:00:23.490> from<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.820> top<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the second string from the top and the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.330 
the second string from the top and the
third<00:00:24.869> string<00:00:25.140> from<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.470> time<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
third string from the time so you have

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.020 
third string from the time so you have
this<00:00:26.580> right<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:30.740> now<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> move<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.759> is

this right here now the move to that is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.540 
this right here now the move to that is
just<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.420> drop<00:00:33.750> these<00:00:33.960> two<00:00:34.200> fingers<00:00:34.469> down<00:00:34.680> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
strings cover it with this finger and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.490 
strings cover it with this finger and
you<00:00:40.050> move<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:40.800> fingers<00:00:41.520> down<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:43.050> the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
can play everywhere down the neck if you

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.320 
can play everywhere down the neck if you
play<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:04.880> here<00:01:05.059> it's<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.240> G<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.820> play<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.180> here

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
play it here it's a G you play it here

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.590 
play it here it's a G you play it here
in<00:01:08.420> San<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.750> lay<00:01:09.650> your<00:01:09.890> it's<00:01:10.040> a<00:01:10.160> b<00:01:10.400> c<00:01:12.340> in<00:01:13.340> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
in San a lay your it's a b c in the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.870 
in San a lay your it's a b c in the
tenth<00:01:14.600> fret<00:01:14.870> so<00:01:15.050> deep<00:01:16.120> and<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:19.460> can<00:01:19.670> play<00:01:19.790> a

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
tenth fret so deep and so you can play a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.690 
tenth fret so deep and so you can play a
record<00:01:20.240> there<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.420> basically<00:01:22.630> g<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.900> b<00:01:23.990> c<00:01:24.680> d<00:01:25.520> e

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
record there is basically g a b c d e

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.330 
record there is basically g a b c d e
and<00:01:26.360> when<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.290> move<00:01:27.440> down<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:28.160> can

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
and when you do the move down you can

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.460 
and when you do the move down you can
play<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.550> record<00:01:28.940> there<00:01:29.120> is<00:01:29.150> at<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.080> position

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
play a record there is at that position

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.790 
play a record there is at that position
too<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.430> would<00:01:31.610> be<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.760> seaport<00:01:32.270> here<00:01:32.800> D

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
too so this would be a seaport here D

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.320 
too so this would be a seaport here D
chord<00:01:36.040> I'm<00:01:37.040> only<00:01:37.369> playing<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.880> top<00:01:38.030> four

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
strings when I do that move down that's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.930 
strings when I do that move down that's
one<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.140> most<00:01:45.320> used<00:01:45.680> chords<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:46.729> can<00:01:46.790> play

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
one of the most used chords you can play

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.740 
one of the most used chords you can play
all<00:01:47.300> your<00:01:47.390> cords<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.900> flat<00:01:48.610> D<00:01:49.610> flat<00:01:51.280> just<00:01:52.280> by

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.480 
all your cords a flat D flat just by
doing<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:54.290> little<00:01:54.680> move<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.220> seems

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
doing that one little move and it seems

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.910 
doing that one little move and it seems
like<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:56.030> very<00:01:56.360> natural<00:01:56.750> chord<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:58.130> play

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.520 

what<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> call<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.340> move
