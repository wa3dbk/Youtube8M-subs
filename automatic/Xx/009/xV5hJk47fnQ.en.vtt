00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello friends with you Anton battleship 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.179
 This is the second lesson on burning fashion and in this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 the lesson we learn to arrange the characters 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.650
 choose various beautiful poses 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.630
 half-life 2 part 1 and choose 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.100
 any heroes ugly so let's 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.150
 choose a woman black woman 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.189
 she is very beautiful so raise her holding 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.949
 left mouse button on the head 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.550
 it is desirable to raise your character for 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 head and damn it will be much easier then 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 twist 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.829
 and the characters here are the models here people 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 consist of several parts i.e. 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.510
 bones and who worked wednesday max me 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 understand that there are people who did not work 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 With 3d max, everyone will understand me 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.640
 bodies we can twist separately 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.070
 almost every that we mean 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.000
 left-click it as we 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.260
 please and then fix it as if 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.930
 right click so let her 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.830
 overtake throws a ridge 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.990
 so at least something like that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.189
 no no no it does not roll at all 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.549
 make bend no no no now 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.560
 wait very uncomfortable to drive now 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.460
 I pressed the left mouse button 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.850
 I hold the button I twist it with the mouse so here it is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.900
 looks to nowhere choose by on the chandelier in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.689
 toolbars 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.450
 so now choose the toolbar 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.189
 the eye poser and the eye poser is responsible for 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 where will our model be our model 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.110
 look that is click on the face and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.590
 and she looks at this point which 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.630
 listed green estel to green less 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.420
 cooler and we can bring anywhere 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.600
 click for example here and watch them 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.930
 where to look and about how without a pen well they are not 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.070
 it is seen 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.469
 we can do to watch everything 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.700
 but it looks awful and the data itself 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.399
 awful and we will do so for us probably 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.069
 do to keep us away wreaths away 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.050
 like everybody 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.879
 she looks into the distance so let's still 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.360
 analyze one of the functions favor nga 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:20.140
 the passing tools 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:24.100
 persons so we press the button c target russian 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.990
 with this is understandable and we can twist her face 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.350
 arbitrarily randomly push it 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.730
 randomly generated ie 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.680
 she can smile maybe 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.570
 upset might be noise can be 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.520
 horrible 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.530
 distortion distortion can this scrollbar 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.390
 we can twist it as you like 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.040
 the more she lives so little 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.350
 above we have already harvested 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.860
 templates clicking on which we choose 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.230
 and her appearance ie we are so we can 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.200
 choose her smile can and serious look 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.600
 faces and inject a just below a bunch of scroll 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.209
 bar of we can unscrew somehow 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.400
 customizes your own how would your 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.440
 own face let's do like this 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:13.209
 great so now poser fingers and if 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.850
 honestly i'm playing on licensed version 13 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.130
 garry's mod 13 I don't understand why here 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:24.130
 it does not work last played 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.720
 garry's mod code and doctrine know when 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.930
 harry himself he was only and then everything 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.200
 Worked now I absolutely do not understand 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.100
 maybe four years, I can two wills 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.600
 years ago, he played not remember and that's not 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.670
 I know I can not make it work, you can 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.060
 then I'll figure it out when everything is done and you 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.870
 will show 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.880
 and the funniest features are one pump on 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.890
 just click the left mouse button and we 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.110
 inflating the part of the body which to which 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.750
 we hover click right mouse button we 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.600
 does not reduce it is the funniest feature 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.269
 which is here we did this 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.280
 beautiful and probably finish this with 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.019
