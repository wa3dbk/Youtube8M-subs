mine right so you do like this they will
get<00:01:41.610> other<00:01:41.790> ear<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.530> ear<00:01:43.979> car<00:01:44.369> looking

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

get other ear so the ear car looking
like<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.259> like<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> big<00:01:46.680> leaf<00:01:47.250> okay<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
like a like a big leaf okay so which is

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.910 
like a like a big leaf okay so which is
one<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.460> curve<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:51.170> another<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.470> curve

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
one of one curve out another one curve

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.630 
one of one curve out another one curve
in<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.970> run<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
in so you run like that

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.870 
in so you run like that
okay<00:01:56.420> theta<00:01:56.750> eyes<00:01:57.110> would<00:01:57.410> be<00:01:57.530> pretty<00:01:57.800> easy<00:01:58.280> so

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
okay theta eyes would be pretty easy so

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.980 
okay theta eyes would be pretty easy so
we're<00:01:59.030> gonna<00:02:00.310> sew<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> circle<00:02:02.060> not<00:02:02.570> all<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.870> way

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
we're gonna sew a circle not all the way

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.950 
we're gonna sew a circle not all the way
halfway<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:04.340> connect<00:02:05.030> those<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.630> then

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
halfway to connect those to that then

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.710 
halfway to connect those to that then
this<00:02:06.280> part<00:02:07.280> will<00:02:07.340> represent<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:08.060> eye<00:02:08.210> pupil

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
this part will represent the eye pupil

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.530 
this part will represent the eye pupil
okay<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.920> how<00:02:10.070> do<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.340> city<00:02:10.550> another<00:02:10.940> size<00:02:11.210> so

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
okay so how do the city another size so
