00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.410
 it seems like a dream where I found myself 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.420
 awake I woke up I saw the coffin and I 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.860
 I realized that my mother had died not 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.290
 I know if you will meet God or with 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.230
 Lucifer will not meet her or with 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.330
 he with a virgin or with belcebú the only thing 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.550
 What I know is that I will not have your company here 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.010
 my shoulder like you did it like a day 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.289
 that I stayed with you and you told me 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.840
 life is not that you live it but that 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.940
 I live for you and he told me I lived it 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.649
 of yourself and the day she told me 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.370
 I contemplated that I fell tears 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.910
 bells rang and I felt happy 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.010
 and fucking mother now it's gone I left and 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.860
 people laugh at me about my impatience 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.410
 and my poetry but today I cry like 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.969
 I was crying my guitar on that day 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.100
 I felt that interpretation for 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.290
 time I just felt like my heart was beating 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
 faster by more feeling I get 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.610
 insulin was rising and my 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.140
 diabetes that I am suffering I am not 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.120
 that person who sings a song 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.720
 love i am a person who saw my mother 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.850
 death and his heart exploded 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.350
 and it destroyed all my soul and in the moment 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.000
 in which the way and the coffin I felt that the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.460
 my body got up and I had asthma 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.259
 because because nobody can understand is 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.960
 cry because you can even poets 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.880
 They cry and how I can translate it into the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.890
 rap and now I calm down when the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.560
 tear falls to the floor and at that moment I 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.850
 I realized that my life got to the point 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 where nothing is needed anymore 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.060
 it's okay 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.150
 much 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:58.340
 it is an accident 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:01.359
 listen and listen to an accident died your 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.359
 son and you went blind 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.739
 at this time 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.520
 321 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.370
 the day was sad too 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.620
 I did not know when I did not know how when 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.200
 but the feelings have passed by 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.390
 inside of me they reminded me 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.920
 the first time he told me dad I wanted to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.780
 escape from this world and it was too much 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.490
 painful 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.670
 bliss of happiness does not enjoy is not sad 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.790
 He begins to suffer physically or 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.310
 I can not see you on both sides 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.110
 God punished me twice asked me 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.230
 because the good fish happen to us 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.510
 these things sometimes 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.400
 I do not know but I wanted to touch you with my 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.180
 hands I would like even if I 'm blind 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.609
 sing like jose feliciano 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:08.230
 it will be that it will be that it will be of my 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.939
 son that will be my son you who are in 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.950
 the sky and now you're next to 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.810
 our grandfather I want you to know that here 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.180
 in the world there are people who despite 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.500
 has eyes can not see and although 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.730
 can walk can not move 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.060
 from up there you can believe it 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.469
 God is not sitting to his right to 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.840
 Although I can not see, I can not 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.840
 feel and I put the nickname new arrow 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:46.110
 the people 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.110
 I do not know because 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.599
 and sometimes we put our throats we are 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.819
 in the house eating and something we need not 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.470
 we are choked we eat salad eleven 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.319
 global teeth for friends so that we 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.329
 we miss, I do not know for real and it's worth 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.829
 it's worth there are things in life really 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.139
 like any and oats 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.630
 but grab the panettone pour chocolate 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.630
 and latex for you to have a good night 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.140
 ay my food today is a reason I am a 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.990
 man of the cave and today I am a 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.180
 primitive man after grip and that not 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.070
 the dried potato is discussed we do not grab 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.350
 a car and left carapulcra after 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.990
 grip and it's a ready test take a 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.970
 little yellow and that being agile what 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.800
 combine damage also a chicken 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.800
 a chicken and then I was surprised 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.870
 saliva de gallina de gallina este 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.450
 experiment I do not know everything I did in the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.220
 ecuador and I put there stuck watermelon 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.710
 I put papaya and many things because 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.890
 belly full heart happy but 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.720
 I also have to nourish the soul 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.690
 stomach screams and we do not find calm 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.480
 we grab something to fill the empty 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.760
 because if we do not get tickled and I 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.740
 truly a person I will love so much 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.350
 so he combined the porridge 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.660
 salt tasted good after my stomach less 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.750
 co2 but the sacrifice does not come at all if 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.510
 it's not love you can not understand me 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.240
 no one sick can not abstain 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.190
 well and I really can not be worse is 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.610
 that eating anything is trash 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.410
 a woman you do not have to be meticulous 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.380
 food is very exquisite and I do not trust 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.840
 its clichés I know and makes a 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.330
 Ceviche and a lot of effort says sigh that 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.790
 Lima fell in love inside began to 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.760
 throbbing I wanted to eat more you could not 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.010
 to truly sate I have it from 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.350
 knowledge because the best food is 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.410
 the worst thought of all is that 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.240
 now I am sincere I grab after a 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.220
 candy combines it with love and 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.740
 also with the body of a woman both 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.650
 so I really enjoyed it they have 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.990
 I tell him or maybe I do not like it but 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.330
 I liked it better on Saturday at the beginning I do not know 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.010
 if they understand me in the description that I 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.160
 tell them to blur my sweet how to make 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.040
 love making love and what is said I am 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.020
 vallejo cooking because I make the sad 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.390
 it's sad and sweet we combine it 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.340
 experienced many more things 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.320
 to see what it is they really tell me in each 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.540
 occasion perfect chili dishes 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.969
 hen nougat do not know me and gastón 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.849
 but he pulled chest Peruvian food 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.549
 every weekend a day grip and the 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:36.279
 people respect me I grab a little bit of 

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:39.699
 candy and combines it rightly after 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:41.139
 someone you respect me for a lady I put 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.869
 the pepa 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.509
 and I put the sweet taste on it so the 

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:48.489
 skinny claws and liked it so much I do not know if 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.139
 that's a charm but the woman of 

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:54.029
 mulata became white and in the end 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.029
 he gave me some money to eat me
