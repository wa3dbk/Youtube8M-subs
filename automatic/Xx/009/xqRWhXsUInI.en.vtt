00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
which is the problem I was having on the

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.830 
which is the problem I was having on the
front<00:02:21.840> here<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:23.209> I'm<00:02:24.209> going<00:02:24.329> to<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.660> peel

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
front here so I'm going to have to peel

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.449 
front here so I'm going to have to peel
this<00:02:25.019> plastic<00:02:25.470> tape<00:02:25.650> off<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.010> double-sided

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
this plastic tape off this double-sided

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.339 
this plastic tape off this double-sided
tape<00:02:26.700> stick<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.090> back<00:02:27.209> onto<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> laptop<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
tape stick it back onto the laptop and

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.319 
tape stick it back onto the laptop and
pull<00:02:29.220> up<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.370> rest<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> plastic<00:02:29.940> coating

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
pull up the rest of the plastic coating

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.240 
pull up the rest of the plastic coating
and<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:32.069> keyboard<00:02:32.430> should<00:02:32.579> lift<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.060> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
and the keyboard should lift up with it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.009 
and the keyboard should lift up with it
this<00:02:35.250> black<00:02:35.579> tape<00:02:35.879> is<00:02:36.060> really<00:02:36.480> sticky<00:02:36.989> and

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
this black tape is really sticky and

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.539 
this black tape is really sticky and
it's<00:02:37.200> thin<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:37.920> hard<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.190> work<00:02:38.340> with

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
it's thin so it's hard to work with

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's thin so it's hard to work with
stuck<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.299> back<00:02:39.420> onto<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> laptop<00:02:40.019> they're

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
stuck it back onto the laptop they're

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.979 
stuck it back onto the laptop they're
the<00:02:40.560> best<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.859> could<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> parts<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.730> uh

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the best I could the parts that uh

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.240 
the best I could the parts that uh
separated<00:02:42.989> anyways<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.590> rest<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.920> its<00:02:44.040> kind

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
separated anyways the rest of its kind

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.619 
separated anyways the rest of its kind
of<00:02:44.340> intact<00:02:44.849> there<00:02:45.090> now<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.540> just

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
of intact there now and it's just

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.449 
of intact there now and it's just
starting<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.019> pull<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.500> stuff<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:46.950> really

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
starting to pull up this stuff is really

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.920 
starting to pull up this stuff is really
sticky<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.120> you're<00:02:48.269> probably<00:02:48.569> going<00:02:48.870> to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
sticky so you're probably going to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.490 
sticky so you're probably going to
destroy<00:02:49.680> your<00:02:49.859> keyboard<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.549> process<00:02:51.500> so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
destroy your keyboard in the process so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.900 
destroy your keyboard in the process so
don't<00:02:52.950> take<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.400> unless<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:53.609> have<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
don't take it out unless you have a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.410 
don't take it out unless you have a
replacement<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:55.069> have<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.250> stress<00:02:56.549> do<00:02:56.819> not<00:02:57.120> take

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
replacement I have to stress do not take

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.699 
replacement I have to stress do not take
this<00:02:57.569> keyboard<00:02:57.840> out<00:02:58.139> unless<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.380> absolutely

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
this keyboard out unless you absolutely

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.979 
this keyboard out unless you absolutely
have<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:00.359> it's<00:03:00.480> completely

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
have to as you can see it's completely

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.460 
have to as you can see it's completely
mangled<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.819> put<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> new<00:03:06.239> one<00:03:06.419> in<00:03:06.470> this

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
mangled so to put the new one in this

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.780 
mangled so to put the new one in this
part<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:07.859> important<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.430> want<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.609> get<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
part is important you want to get the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.289 
part is important you want to get the
ribbon<00:03:08.970> cable<00:03:10.340> through<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.489> opening<00:03:11.940> before

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
ribbon cable through the opening before

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.520 
ribbon cable through the opening before
you<00:03:12.389> stick<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> keyboard<00:03:13.109> down<00:03:13.290> otherwise

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
you stick the keyboard down otherwise

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.460 
you stick the keyboard down otherwise
it's<00:03:13.799> probably<00:03:14.130> pretty<00:03:14.370> hard<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:15.349> pull<00:03:16.349> it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
it's probably pretty hard to pull it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.110 
it's probably pretty hard to pull it
through<00:03:16.650> from<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.859> bottom<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> I'm<00:03:20.940> just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
through from the bottom so I'm just

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.610 
through from the bottom so I'm just
lining<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.480> up<00:03:23.989> making<00:03:24.989> sure<00:03:25.139> it's<00:03:25.470> not

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
lining this up making sure it's not

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.240 
lining this up making sure it's not
sticking<00:03:26.040> before<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.609> get<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.349> cable<00:03:28.349> through

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.170 

sorry<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.370> do<00:03:34.460> this<00:03:34.580> with<00:03:34.760> one<00:03:34.790> hand<00:03:37.030> all<00:03:38.030> right

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
sorry to do this with one hand all right

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.390 
sorry to do this with one hand all right
so<00:03:38.360> that's<00:03:38.480> feeding<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.380> I'm<00:03:40.160> going<00:03:40.340> to

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
so that's feeding in and I'm going to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.230 
so that's feeding in and I'm going to
carefully<00:03:40.610> stick<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.180> keyboard<00:03:41.540> down

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
carefully stick the keyboard down

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.000 
carefully stick the keyboard down
backside<00:03:44.240> first<00:03:47.290> make<00:03:48.290> sure<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.530> cables

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
backside first make sure the cables

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.220 
backside first make sure the cables
still<00:03:49.190> in<00:03:49.370> there<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:53.180> we'll<00:03:53.750> seat<00:03:53.990> that

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
still in there and we'll seat that

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.340 
still in there and we'll seat that
properly

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.720 

there's<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.560> cable<00:04:00.890> at<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.070> bottom<00:04:01.340> here<00:04:01.550> so

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
there's the cable at the bottom here so

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.970 
there's the cable at the bottom here so
when<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.690> cut<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.020> bottom<00:04:03.140> off<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.680> want<00:04:03.920> to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
when you cut the bottom off you want to

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.800 
when you cut the bottom off you want to
be<00:04:04.040> really<00:04:04.489> careful<00:04:04.670> opening<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.300> closing<00:04:05.690> it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
be really careful opening and closing it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.949 
be really careful opening and closing it
because<00:04:06.730> on<00:04:07.730> each<00:04:07.910> side<00:04:08.270> there's<00:04:08.540> only<00:04:08.660> one

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
because on each side there's only one

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.590 
because on each side there's only one
screw<00:04:09.380> going<00:04:09.620> into<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.920> hinge<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.390> not<00:04:11.570> a

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
screw going into the hinge so it's not a

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.270 
screw going into the hinge so it's not a
very<00:04:12.019> strong<00:04:12.080> connection<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.920> don't<00:04:13.070> want<00:04:13.220> to

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
very strong connection you don't want to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.050 
very strong connection you don't want to
force<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.610> down

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
force it down

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.630 
force it down
you<00:04:14.150> know<00:04:14.239> I'm<00:04:14.360> breaking<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.810> plastics<00:04:15.290> here

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
you know I'm breaking the plastics here

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.340 
you know I'm breaking the plastics here
those<00:04:16.640> are<00:04:16.669> expensive<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.510> replace<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.140> hard

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
those are expensive to replace and hard

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.320 
those are expensive to replace and hard
to<00:04:18.440> find<00:04:20.980> so<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.250> put<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.520> cable<00:04:22.790> back<00:04:22.910> in<00:04:23.180> it's

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
to find so to put the cable back in it's

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.390 
to find so to put the cable back in it's
the<00:04:23.419> reverse<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.900> taking<00:04:24.200> it<00:04:24.290> out<00:04:24.380> make<00:04:25.370> sure

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
the reverse of taking it out make sure

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.750 
the reverse of taking it out make sure
this<00:04:25.790> little<00:04:26.200> plastic<00:04:27.200> piece<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.830> open<00:04:28.250> or<00:04:28.520> in
