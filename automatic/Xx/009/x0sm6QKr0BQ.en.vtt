00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello everyone and this is an arrow 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.550
 and today the theme of our video will be very 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.400
 simple and very interesting to many of us 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 today we will check in and map 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.470
 r9 280x in the game world of tanks that is on 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 what she is capable of in this game is siddick 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.779
 horde r9 280x we will use 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.930
 a bundle with a core i5 4590 processor 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 our processor will be overclocked to clean 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.130
 4600 megahertz this purity will allow us 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.689
 unleash the potential of a video card on 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 maximum opportunity 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 because the game world of tanks is enough 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.230
 demanding our copy of the radio r9 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 280x has a clean graphic 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.079
 cpu thousands 100 megahertz and memory 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.690
 and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.350
 at 6000 megahertz and so what are we waiting for 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.350
 it's time to start 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.480
 you erased me to produce on the client 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.480
 version 95 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.810
 and so for now he is sitting off we already 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.350
 we see that we have to press ranges from 50 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.350
 up to 68 fps it was not visible further 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 what does the picture already have on it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 and it cleared up and so on this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.180
 moment around 80 90 fps 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.329
 his long 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.939
 attack scene where there will be more graphics 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.939
 more calculations and we already see the difference 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.399
 we fell below 60 fps but 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.810
 meanwhile keeps around 60 how are you 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.220
 see a more dynamic scene already 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.259
 FPS drop has come from 80 90 fps to 6050 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.470
 Well, a little bit even put more than 60 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.399
 issue but still often goes to 50 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.399
 with pennies 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.190
 now we will figure out the optimal setting 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.900
 mud 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.790
 lose quality ie close 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.110
 very nice picture but will increase 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.110
 significantly performance 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.380
 FPS did not grow it is now in the region of 80 90 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.800
 no problem so we have these numbers 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.870
 like 90 and 100 fps and you can immediately say 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.910
 all the same, the average fps grew by 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.180
 optimal settings it provides and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.830
 the game in the region of 80 90 fps is stable 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.830
 places and over 100 fps 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.170
 if you look at the blade more difficult 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.330
 scenes fps we fall and on a regular map 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.260
 where there are not many trees in ps 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.260
 also high 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.790
 and so it is possible to sum up already small results 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.250
 at maximum settings video card 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.069
 radeon r9 280x provides 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.379
 performance around 60 fps without 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.459
 problems minimum fps is about 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.750
 40 maximum efficiency is about 90 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.459
 if you use video cards with 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.840
 optimal graphics settings that 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.230
 performance will be just 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.430
 a whopping 8090 fps and sometimes over 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.129
 110
