your hands so I'm going to show you the

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.940 
your hands so I'm going to show you the
more<00:02:51.480> complicated<00:02:51.870> method<00:02:52.500> isn't<00:02:52.709> that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
more complicated method isn't that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.520 
more complicated method isn't that
complicated<00:02:53.370> guys<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.970> try<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.239> one<00:02:54.600> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
complicated guys so try this one and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.550 
complicated guys so try this one and
we're<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.889> melt<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.750> over<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> pan<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
we're going to melt this over a pan a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.259 
we're going to melt this over a pan a
very<00:02:58.920> chef<00:02:59.280> shallow

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
very chef shallow

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.750 
very chef shallow
filled<00:03:00.870> pan<00:03:01.109> of<00:03:01.230> water<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.130> ball<00:03:02.430> when<00:03:02.639> it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
filled pan of water so the ball when it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
filled pan of water so the ball when it
sits<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.239> like<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.690> will<00:03:04.319> not<00:03:04.500> actually<00:03:04.680> be

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
sits in like that will not actually be

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.410 
sits in like that will not actually be
in<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.220> water<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.730> steam<00:03:06.060> will<00:03:06.299> be

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
in the water but the steam will be

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.180 
in the water but the steam will be
melting<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> chocolate<00:03:07.079> down<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:09.569> I've<00:03:09.690> got

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
melting the chocolate down so I've got

the<00:03:38.280> chocolate<00:03:38.459> melt<00:03:38.970> down<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:40.980> our<00:03:41.099> chocolate

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
the chocolate melt down so our chocolate

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.420 
the chocolate melt down so our chocolate
is<00:03:41.549> completely<00:03:41.579> melted<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:43.009> now<00:03:44.009> we<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.310> to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
is completely melted and now we have to

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.159 
is completely melted and now we have to
bring<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.729> temperature<00:03:44.910> back<00:03:45.120> down<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.930> sort

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
bring the temperature back down to sort

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.320 
bring the temperature back down to sort
of<00:03:46.229> realign<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
of realign the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.790 
of realign the
solids<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:47.930> there<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:48.410> we're<00:03:48.530> going<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.710> be

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
solids in there so we're going to be

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.040 
solids in there so we're going to be
adding<00:03:49.190> taking<00:03:49.700> off<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.030> heat<00:03:50.210> adding<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:50.930> our

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
adding taking off the heat adding in our

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.740 
adding taking off the heat adding in our
hundred<00:03:51.440> grams<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.890> letting<00:03:52.520> it<00:03:52.640> melt<00:03:52.910> as<00:03:53.210> we

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
hundred grams and letting it melt as we

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.690 
hundred grams and letting it melt as we
mix<00:03:53.990> it<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:54.530> bring<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.250> temperature<00:03:55.670> back

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
mix it in and bring the temperature back

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.810 
mix it in and bring the temperature back
down<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.720> get<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.870> little<00:03:57.050> glossy<00:03:57.670> finish<00:03:58.670> to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
down to get a little glossy finish to

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.130 
down to get a little glossy finish to
the<00:03:58.940> chocolate<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.480> we're<00:03:59.630> tempering<00:04:00.110> the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
the chocolate so we're tempering the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.940 
the chocolate so we're tempering the
chocolate<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.840> here<00:04:03.020> we<00:04:03.110> are<00:04:03.140> adding<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.770> saw

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
chocolate so here we are adding the saw

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.970 
chocolate so here we are adding the saw
foot<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.790> extra<00:04:05.180> curd<00:04:05.630> in<00:04:06.050> and<00:04:06.290> I'm<00:04:06.800> just

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
foot the extra curd in and I'm just

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.470 
foot the extra curd in and I'm just
going<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.280> continually<00:04:07.880> mix<00:04:08.240> that<00:04:08.480> through

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
going to continually mix that through

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.090 
going to continually mix that through
until<00:04:11.480> all<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.900> chocolate<00:04:12.080> is<00:04:12.470> melted<00:04:12.890> and

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
until all the chocolate is melted and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.470 
until all the chocolate is melted and
the<00:04:13.160> core<00:04:13.460> temperature<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.090> chocolates

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
the core temperature of the chocolates

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.380 
the core temperature of the chocolates
come<00:04:14.720> down<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:16.280> wear<00:04:16.519> it<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:16.940> point<00:04:17.239> where

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
come down to wear it to a point where

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:27.460 
come down to wear it to a point where
it's<00:04:17.540> been<00:04:17.690> nicely<00:04:17.930> tempered<00:04:26.290> now<00:04:27.290> you'll

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
it's been nicely tempered now you'll

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.340 
it's been nicely tempered now you'll
notice<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.860> I'm<00:04:28.040> also<00:04:28.310> using<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.910> metal

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
notice that I'm also using a metal

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.500 
notice that I'm also using a metal
pallet<00:04:30.350> knife<00:04:30.530> it's<00:04:31.190> not<00:04:31.430> essential<00:04:32.060> but<00:04:32.390> it

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
pallet knife it's not essential but it

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.450 
pallet knife it's not essential but it
does<00:04:32.660> help<00:04:32.900> reduce<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.680> temperature<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.370> the

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
does help reduce the temperature of the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.190 
does help reduce the temperature of the
chocolate<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:35.000> can<00:04:35.150> start<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.600> see<00:04:35.780> now<00:04:35.990> a

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
chocolate and you can start to see now a

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.680 
chocolate and you can start to see now a
nice<00:04:36.680> shine<00:04:37.160> coming<00:04:37.610> back<00:04:37.820> into<00:04:38.450> the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
nice shine coming back into the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.590 
nice shine coming back into the
chocolate<00:04:40.030> so<00:04:41.030> here's<00:04:41.270> where<00:04:41.390> it<00:04:41.510> becomes

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
chocolate so here's where it becomes

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.710 
chocolate so here's where it becomes
really<00:04:42.200> just<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.650> method<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.640> trial<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:44.570> error

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
really just a method of trial and error

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.170 
really just a method of trial and error
I'm<00:04:45.350> going<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.680> for<00:04:46.520> me<00:04:46.670> I'm<00:04:46.790> going<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.060> be

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
I'm going to for me I'm going to be

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.580 
I'm going to for me I'm going to be
using<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.630> chocolate<00:04:47.900> I'm<00:04:48.170> going<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.410> take

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
using the chocolate I'm going to take

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.790 
using the chocolate I'm going to take
one<00:04:49.300> Tim<00:04:50.300> Tam<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.840> I'm<00:04:51.050> going<00:04:51.230> to<00:04:51.320> dip<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.530> in

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
one Tim Tam and I'm going to dip it in

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.670 
one Tim Tam and I'm going to dip it in
to<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.669> chocolate<00:04:53.150> just<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:54.110> that<00:04:54.380> one<00:04:54.650> side

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
to the chocolate just so that one side

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.300 
to the chocolate just so that one side
gets<00:04:55.370> covered<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:57.650> then<00:04:57.800> I'm<00:04:57.919> just<00:04:57.950> going<00:04:58.250> to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
gets covered and then I'm just going to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.720 
gets covered and then I'm just going to
let<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.550> chocolate<00:04:59.240> run<00:04:59.930> off<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.730> biscuit

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
let that chocolate run off the biscuit

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.590 
let that chocolate run off the biscuit
until<00:05:02.090> most<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.230> it<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.500> off<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:04.640> then<00:05:05.330> take

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
until most of it is off and then take

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.740 
until most of it is off and then take
that<00:05:05.810> brisket<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.620> lay<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.950> down<00:05:07.750> chocolate

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
that brisket and lay it down chocolate

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.250 
that brisket and lay it down chocolate
side<00:05:09.140> up<00:05:09.410> on<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:10.130> baking<00:05:10.850> tray<00:05:10.880> just<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:11.990> allow

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
side up on the baking tray just to allow

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.800 
side up on the baking tray just to allow
that<00:05:12.620> chocolate<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.190> set<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.610> work<00:05:14.360> through<00:05:14.720> all

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
that chocolate to set I work through all

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.150 
that chocolate to set I work through all
those<00:05:14.990> that'll<00:05:15.260> give<00:05:15.470> me<00:05:15.620> one<00:05:15.830> side

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
those that'll give me one side

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:32.480 
those that'll give me one side
completely<00:05:16.760> coated

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.950 

so<00:05:33.490> I've<00:05:33.580> been<00:05:33.699> experimenting<00:05:34.419> with<00:05:34.449> coating

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
so I've been experimenting with coating

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.290 
so I've been experimenting with coating
these<00:05:35.139> so<00:05:35.409> that<00:05:35.530> you<00:05:35.650> don't<00:05:35.860> have<00:05:36.069> to<00:05:36.300> I've

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
these so that you don't have to I've

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.140 
these so that you don't have to I've
tried<00:05:37.599> doing<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.830> sides<00:05:39.129> first<00:05:39.430> and<00:05:39.639> then<00:05:39.909> the

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
tried doing the sides first and then the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.110 
tried doing the sides first and then the
the<00:05:40.780> bottom<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:41.259> then<00:05:41.379> the<00:05:42.069> bottom<00:05:42.699> person

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
the bottom and then the bottom person

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.659 
the bottom and then the bottom person
then<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.389> sides<00:05:43.629> and<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.409> reckon<00:05:44.949> sides<00:05:45.310> first

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
then the sides and I reckon sides first

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.480 
then the sides and I reckon sides first
so<00:05:45.879> what<00:05:46.030> we're<00:05:46.120> going<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.270> do<00:05:46.389> is<00:05:46.509> take<00:05:46.750> our

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
so what we're going to do is take our

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.589 
so what we're going to do is take our
Tim<00:05:48.490> Tam<00:05:48.729> now<00:05:49.949> and<00:05:50.949> we're<00:05:51.190> just<00:05:51.310> going<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.639> dip

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
Tim Tam now and we're just going to dip

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.890 
Tim Tam now and we're just going to dip
the<00:05:52.840> sides<00:05:53.220> in<00:05:54.220> we're<00:05:54.669> going<00:05:54.789> to<00:05:54.849> go<00:05:55.000> round<00:05:57.900> so

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
the sides in we're going to go round so

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.180 
the sides in we're going to go round so
we<00:05:58.990> do<00:05:59.110> all<00:05:59.169> four<00:05:59.530> sides<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:03.180> then<00:06:05.009> we<00:06:06.009> take

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
we do all four sides and then we take
