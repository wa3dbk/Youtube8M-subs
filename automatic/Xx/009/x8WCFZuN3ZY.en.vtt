simple<00:02:11.180> color<00:02:11.540> correction<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.140> think<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.680> is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
simple color correction I think this is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.790 
simple color correction I think this is
the<00:02:13.010> easiest<00:02:13.490> way<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.820> do<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.500> can<00:02:15.650> also

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
the easiest way to do it you can also

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.730

your video is shot and the lighting you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.860 
your video is shot and the lighting you
use<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.370> might<00:02:31.580> take<00:02:31.790> some<00:02:31.820> tweaking<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:32.840> I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
use it might take some tweaking but I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.480 
use it might take some tweaking but I

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
think you'll find the ease of doing it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.080 
think you'll find the ease of doing it
and<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.060> results<00:02:35.540> are<00:02:35.600> very<00:02:36.080> acceptable<00:02:36.709> I

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
and the results are very acceptable I

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.980 
and the results are very acceptable I
hope<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.270> helps<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.720> thanks<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.590> watching
