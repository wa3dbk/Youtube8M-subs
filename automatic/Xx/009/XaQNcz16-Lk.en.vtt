00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.290 

for<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.920> Rihanna<00:02:20.220> video<00:02:20.610> there's<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.970> lot<00:02:21.150> of

visual elements are very different from
each<00:02:23.250> other<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:24.330> know<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.870> need

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
each other and so we know that we need

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.130 
each other and so we know that we need
open<00:02:25.320> space<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.190> water<00:02:26.480> pavement<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.870> thought

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
open space and water pavement we thought

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.600 
open space and water pavement we thought
the<00:02:28.290> munition<00:02:28.680> life<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:29.040> perfect<00:02:29.220> because

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the munition life was perfect because

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.790 
the munition life was perfect because
they<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.330> those<00:02:30.720> locations<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
they have all those locations and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.630 
they have all those locations and
