can't<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> maybe<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.370> another<00:00:41.820> mixture

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
can't do and maybe it's another mixture

not<00:00:59.130> used<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> Bosch<00:00:59.670> mixer<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.180> going

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
not used to a Bosch mixer you're going

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.910 
not used to a Bosch mixer you're going
to<00:01:00.360> see<00:01:00.540> you've<00:01:00.690> got<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> double<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.559> action

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to see you've got a double little action

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
to see you've got a double little action
here<00:01:01.950> with<00:01:02.399> two<00:01:02.610> beaters<00:01:02.880> and<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.719> fit<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
here with two beaters and they fit the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.719 
here with two beaters and they fit the
contour<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> bowl<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.040> effectively<00:01:05.550> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
contour of the bowl so effectively that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.109 
contour of the bowl so effectively that
rarely<00:01:06.090> anything<00:01:06.330> gets<00:01:06.660> gets<00:01:07.110> by<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
rarely anything gets gets by so some of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
rarely anything gets gets by so some of
the<00:01:09.360> negative<00:01:10.110> things<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.410> been<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.680> there

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the negative things have been out there

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.529 
the negative things have been out there
as<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.399> people<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.729> bending<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> beaters

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
as the people are bending up the beaters

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.389 
as the people are bending up the beaters
they're<00:01:12.810> bending<00:01:13.110> them<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> reason<00:01:14.250> why

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
they're bending them and the reason why

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.980 
they're bending them and the reason why
is<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.330> nothing<00:01:15.810> can

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
is because as you can see nothing can

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
is because as you can see nothing can
get<00:01:16.110> away<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> normal<00:01:17.310> overhead

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
get away if you have a normal overhead

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
get away if you have a normal overhead
double<00:01:18.390> orbital<00:01:18.630> machine<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> get<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> piece

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
really really really hard so you just

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.840 
really really really hard so you just
set<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.650> now<00:01:43.830> have<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> bowl<00:01:44.640> set
