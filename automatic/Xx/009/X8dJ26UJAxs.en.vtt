00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.390
 seeing that the skin turns pink that 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.010
 it's time to treat them because then 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.860
 they are scars that are very difficult to 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.170

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.480
 vitamin capsules both have 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.489
 Different properties help moisturize 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.379
 and they also help to improve the tone of 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.819
