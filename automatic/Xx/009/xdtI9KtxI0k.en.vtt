tone like this that um you know there's
definitely<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.990> possibility<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:32.790> going

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
definitely the possibility of it going

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.050 
definitely the possibility of it going
even<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.380> than<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.619> should<00:01:34.799> have

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
even more actually than it should have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
even more actually than it should have
you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.240> tell<00:01:36.420> by<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.600> roots<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:37.950> my

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
you can tell by my roots which was my
natural<00:01:38.549> color<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.479> tell<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.020> not

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
natural color you can tell that it's not

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.810 
natural color you can tell that it's not
that<00:01:40.409> bad<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.490> nice

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that bad and it's actually a really nice

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
that bad and it's actually a really nice
color<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:42.390> really<00:01:42.630> happy<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.340> but

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
color and I'm really happy with that but

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
color and I'm really happy with that but
I<00:01:44.369> am<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.750> fix<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.290> just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
I am going to have to fix this just

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.160 
I am going to have to fix this just
because<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> little<00:01:47.189> bit<00:01:47.340> too<00:01:47.549> much<00:01:47.869> ashy

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because it's a little bit too much ashy

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
because it's a little bit too much ashy
tone<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.130> liking<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.180> see

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

hopefully I'm in the daylight good
enough<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.720> gray<00:01:55.140> um

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
enough here but it's just really gray um

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.819 
enough here but it's just really gray um
overall<00:01:56.219> though<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.759> color<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:58.079> me<00:01:58.350> was

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
overall though the color to me was

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.030 
overall though the color to me was
really<00:01:59.280> good<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.939> didn't<00:02:00.659> smell<00:02:00.810> bad<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.649> left

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
really good it didn't smell bad it left

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
when I was processing but I left my

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.320 
when I was processing but I left my
undertone<00:02:12.250> my<00:02:12.430> natural<00:02:12.819> color<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.120> I've

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
undertone my natural color and I've

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.509 
undertone my natural color and I've
always<00:02:13.569> had<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.110> my<00:02:14.290> natural<00:02:14.650> color<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.069> I

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
always had this my natural color and I

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.130 
always had this my natural color and I
just<00:02:15.550> wanted<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.239> keep<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.660> for<00:02:16.989> like

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
just wanted to really keep that for like

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.860 
just wanted to really keep that for like
a<00:02:17.170> little<00:02:17.500> bit<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.709> depth<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.879> yeah<00:02:19.510> like

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
a little bit of depth but yeah like

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.869 
a little bit of depth but yeah like
overall<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.500> would<00:02:20.739> say<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.129> color<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.610> good

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
overall I would say the color is good

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.150 
overall I would say the color is good
it's<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.390> too<00:02:22.569> grey<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.260> I'm<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.010> give

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
it's just too grey so I'm going to give

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.740 
it's just too grey so I'm going to give
it<00:02:24.250> about<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.459> week<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.970> see<00:02:25.299> what<00:02:25.450> happens

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
it about a week and see what happens

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.259 
it about a week and see what happens
with<00:02:25.900> washing<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.590> then<00:02:27.340> if<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.879> doesn't

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
with washing it and then if it doesn't

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.729 
with washing it and then if it doesn't
seem<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.599> go<00:02:28.750> away<00:02:28.840> I'm<00:02:29.290> just<00:02:29.500> going<00:02:29.680> to

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
seem to go away I'm just going to

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.559 
seem to go away I'm just going to
probably<00:02:29.980> wash<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:30.760> either<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.209> same

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
probably wash it with either the same

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.140 
probably wash it with either the same
color<00:02:32.560> or<00:02:32.980> else<00:02:35.400> or<00:02:36.400> else<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.760> was<00:02:36.879> thinking

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
color or else or else I was thinking

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150 
color or else or else I was thinking
maybe<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.420> get<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.780> same<00:02:37.989> color<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:38.620> go

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
maybe to get like the same color but go

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.330 
maybe to get like the same color but go
with<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> more<00:02:39.700> warm<00:02:40.090> tone<00:02:40.450> like<00:02:40.810> golden<00:02:41.590> dark

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
with a more warm tone like golden dark

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.000 
with a more warm tone like golden dark
blonde<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.530> hopefully<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.709> will<00:02:44.829> just

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
blonde and hopefully that will just

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.240 
blonde and hopefully that will just
correct<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> shiness<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:47.220> yeah<00:02:48.220> I

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
correct the a shiness out of it yeah I

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.220 
correct the a shiness out of it yeah I
really<00:02:48.880> wanted<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.239> post<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:49.630> for<00:02:49.989> you
