00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
start and card number 24 took the time

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.500 
start and card number 24 took the time
and<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> cut<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.490> deck<00:01:08.700> no<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> doesn't

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and all to cut that deck no it doesn't

if you're ready to cut it that's the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
if you're ready to cut it that's the
only<00:01:11.430> delay<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:11.820> there's<00:01:12.060> any<00:01:12.330> delay<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.350> how

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
only delay if there's any delay it's how

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
only delay if there's any delay it's how
long<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.159> person<00:01:14.729> takes<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.360> execute<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.990> cut

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
long a person takes to execute the cut

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.039 
long a person takes to execute the cut
budgets<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:17.070> give<00:01:17.280> them<00:01:17.369> 10<00:01:17.640> seconds<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.780> they

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
budgets we give them 10 seconds if they

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
budgets we give them 10 seconds if they
don't<00:01:19.290> execute<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.009> 10<00:01:20.280> seconds<00:01:20.759> then

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
don't execute it in 10 seconds then

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.640 
don't execute it in 10 seconds then
they'll<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.509> sat<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> game<00:01:22.439> and

procedures to get back here because we

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
procedures to get back here because we
just<00:01:26.670> want<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> make<00:01:27.000> sure<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
just want to make sure that it's not a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.800 
just want to make sure that it's not a
robotic<00:01:29.009> program<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.150> notice<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.659> not

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
robotic program you notice that or not

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.319 
robotic program you notice that or not
the<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.070> cut<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.430> actually<00:01:32.850> something<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the the cut is actually something that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.999 
the the cut is actually something that
that<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.049> player<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.590> dealer<00:01:34.979> button

see meeting here to cut yeah you're not
going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.869> representation

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
going to see that the representation

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.429 
going to see that the representation
that<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.280> saw<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.689> dealer<00:01:45.930> the
