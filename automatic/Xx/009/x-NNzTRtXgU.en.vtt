00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:24.070
 now more than interesting new items 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.070
 back away well start from what 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.970
 super sufix fishing line 21 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.470
 wake yourself up as dramatically small and tensile 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 transparent we press as soon as Dmitrov 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.850
 it seems to me that it can be used 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.610
 spinning fishing as a leader like 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.280
 a budget option 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.950
 carbon and soon 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.260
 impossible and knits a fishing line they are second 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.170
 here's a hormone 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.180
 inexpensive and good option with 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.620
 a few a years on diameters 40 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.350
 very wide spectrum there 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.030
 look at the table 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.909
 we have a catalog somewhere here we can 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.189
 look at tugovato not throw from 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.320
 fine yes very very long someone 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:17.890
 there is as always the whole line of it all 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:21.690
 will be dramatically not too expensive now 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 own now actually a bomb 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.120
 in the fall at a meeting with the manufacturer I 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.620
 got a test sample of this 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.370
 cord and caught 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.120
 them 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.240
 the general allowance is not spring and now in the summer 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.510
 what we have we have very thin 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510
 lace 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.119
 but send up under the name must braid 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 cord with bursting here indicated 6 liters 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.430
 it is somewhat lower however the cord 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.810
 exceptionally thin 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.810
 exceptionally thin is the cord for 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.020
 orthodox u grass this is micro jig 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.490
 even possible for cars 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.620
 actually quite perfectly fit 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:16.160
 smooth silky soft 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.360
 in general, waiting for more than interesting and I do not 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.519
 I can announce the price 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.890
 Now I can not say the final order 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.319
 less it will be very attractive in 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.269
 General Japanese 3 inaccurate cords 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.180
 have to really make room 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.340
 Subtle known to us all know 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.780
 Once this string is also not the same of the three 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.740
 yes it is flat 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.740
 but 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.790
 these are all 3 thread curtains 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.560
 probably the two most interesting 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.700
 diameters this in 004 so called if 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:58.820
 you are the diameter of a purely conditional and 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:02.319
 006 that is actually 6 and 7 clip for 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.120
 ultralight gorgeous than very 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.879
 1 hank 100 meters it seems that this 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.299
 small wiring need more rink 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.019
 downturn why for ultralight when casting 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.380
 20 25 meters for the more unwinding 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.300
 what is produced two you so 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.410
 such 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.980
 gray and 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.980
 but darling 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.470
 Well, in general, that's a convenient lure 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.260
 great option 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.939
 pour water under the micro jig also notice 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.939
 now more adult what is there 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.920
 8 filament laced up 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.040
 as I will say now 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.569
 for 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.569
 I already managed to catch this cord 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.510
 test sample hit me in the middle 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:07.710
 of the summer Iâ€™m already half in 15 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.760
 thin cord positioned as 01 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.560
 Immediately we are 65 kilograms somewhere around 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.140
 three and a half 4 kilograms keeps on 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.440
 donkey is here moshna 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.800
 again soft slippery smooth 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.510
 no noise rings are not considered to 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.170
 time I have edish on time 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.170
 coils 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.859
 everything is good according to the scheme 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:34.960
 and again an attractive price on the background 

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:38.330
 other 8 thread curtains 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.659
 1 skein 135 meters one hundred fifty yards 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.729
 our nur will be pink and green 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:44.409
 promised us white but the author is pink and 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.330
 green 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.490
 weaving is very dense however the cord is not 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.490
 round cord 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.540
 as let's say a very nice cord should 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.330
 be more than 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.510
 with this ability against the rest yes 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.180
 I also tried. mouth here is tactile 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.070
 sensations did not like thin 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.960
 smooth 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.060
 will have to try and sing over the feeder 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.590
 drawstring and flying characteristics 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.600
 flight number is cool 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.610
 fly chic and i use it on 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:24.440
 bombardier catching asp on thin diana 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.510
 kaleles cool I army yes I would like 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.640
 so he was round but if he was still 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.060
 and a perfectly round empty thousand hryvnia 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:36.200
 and so supposed to sleep 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.390
 not even twice as clear on the occasion find out in 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.970
 in the eleventh year when this is all understood and 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.300
 on a halt thanks to the sample is not a fish yet 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.300
 then
