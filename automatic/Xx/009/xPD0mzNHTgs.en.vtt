00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
get the chocolate if you can because

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689

then you won't have to use chocolate
syrup<00:01:48.869> mine<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.560> super<00:01:49.860> old<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.460> nasty<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
syrup mine was super old and nasty and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.690 
syrup mine was super old and nasty and
that<00:01:51.509> bottle<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:51.930> actually<00:01:52.350> empty<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.430> I'm

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that bottle was actually empty so I'm

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.490 
that bottle was actually empty so I'm
just<00:01:53.850> breaking<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.360> banana<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.049> placing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
just breaking up my banana and placing

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
just breaking up my banana and placing
it<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> blender<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:57.210> adding<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it in the blender and then adding a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.139 
it in the blender and then adding a
generous<00:01:58.409> scoop<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.799> peanut<00:01:58.979> butter<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.610> can

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
generous scoop of peanut butter you can

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.389 
generous scoop of peanut butter you can
add<00:02:00.329> more<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.659> less<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.130> peanut

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
add more or less I like a lot of peanut

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.100 
add more or less I like a lot of peanut
butter<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.820> mind<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.930> actually

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
butter in mind so I think I actually

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.760 
butter in mind so I think I actually
added<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.649> little<00:02:04.799> bit<00:02:04.950> more

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
added a little bit more

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.919 
added a little bit more
because<00:02:06.159> peanut<00:02:06.520> butter<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.909> just<00:02:06.939> delicious

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.860 

and<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:12.069> I'm<00:02:12.190> adding<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.790> few<00:02:12.940> scoops<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
and then I'm adding a few scoops of the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.690 
and then I'm adding a few scoops of the
Greek<00:02:14.050> yogurt<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.280> don't<00:02:15.430> really<00:02:15.550> have

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
Greek yogurt and you don't really have

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.339 
Greek yogurt and you don't really have
to<00:02:15.819> be<00:02:15.910> precise<00:02:16.360> with<00:02:16.569> your<00:02:16.599> measurements<00:02:16.840> I
