00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.340 
that's located up there so you know you
just<00:05:31.000> got<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.210> do<00:05:31.360> that<00:05:31.540> do<00:05:31.750> those<00:05:31.960> things<00:05:32.200> in

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
just got to do that do those things in

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.840 
just got to do that do those things in
that<00:05:32.440> particular<00:05:32.710> order<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.370> think<00:05:33.610> if<00:05:33.730> you<00:05:33.820> go

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
that particular order I think if you go

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.490 
that particular order I think if you go
take<00:05:34.210> out<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.450> sniper<00:05:34.720> first<00:05:35.080> you<00:05:35.230> won't<00:05:35.380> be

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
take out the sniper first you won't be

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500 
take out the sniper first you won't be
able<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.770> come<00:05:35.950> back<00:05:36.220> down<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:36.820> just<00:05:37.330> make<00:05:37.480> sure

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
able to come back down so just make sure

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.880
