00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.530
 Jo hello people welcome to 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.610
 a new video here on my channel 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.380
 and perhaps for the switch 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.900
 It's almost like today 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.090
 to be expected at the playstation 4 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.510
 yes that's worth it now as you do 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.269
 Nice says or appeared in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.440
 north america we europeans must unfortunately 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.010
 until the 29th 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.460
 So in about half a month to 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.770
 We have to wait there 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.690
 but that's not so bad either 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.009
 as tragic as I think 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.240
 and that's why I'm telling you now 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.790
 Namely, and indeed were already 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.080
 some hardware problems and framerate 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.820
 found problems 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.009
 yes, there were people for example the ps4 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.070
 earlier got something in action 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.420
 with taco bell and so and so is because when he 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 wonder what has loaded to play 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.680
 has at the same time with his ps 4 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.680
 yes is packaged there was already one 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.180
 reports of psv just ticked off 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.810
 shares and broke down or 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.340
 were already broken or just yes 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.720
 even minor problems such as premiums 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.960
 burglaries or normal crashes yes the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.869
 one also thinks of ps3 xbox 360 knows 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.140
 Of course, there were already a few 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.520
 messages to sony should not say itself 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.320
 is she a handful of people who really 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.790
 a broken until we got the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.130
 Of course, you first set 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.470
 accordingly, of course, it's clear how 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.790
 in almost all media devices or 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 There are of course electronic devices 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.070
 a guarantee and believe this later 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.720
 So ps4 twelve months a year long the 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.160
 of which there is no problem even if you 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.630
 then of course a few more days 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.140
 wait until you get the new one 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.950
 but nevertheless should not say as I said 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.290
 it's just a handful of people so it 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.060
 Of course not so many are there 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.670
 It would be pretty tragic too 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.860
 Of course, such a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.720
 billions of companies like sony even 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.459
 can not allow that is natural 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.440
 also tested and that's clear that 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.800
 that is not worth a debacle or something like that 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.989
 total catastrophe is of course clear 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.010
 but of course there were some 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.280
 I would personally report 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.330
 it really is about the factor 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.310
 I write my production error 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.780
 millions have already been produced 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.690
 Of course, not so much now 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.099
 Millions sold to release but it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.140
 are produced a few minutes and even 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.360
 well I mean that is clear that there 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.090
 one or the other console below is the one 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.730
 just does not work that is 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.140
 because in almost all other things the in 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.110
 the masses are produced exactly the same 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.040
 there are just as mistakes and general 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.319
 Sony also says that she expected 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.440
 have that it is still in measure and 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.430
 yet actually quite normal for 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.519
 konsolen state i think or me 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.049
 I assume that's not a criticism 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.299
 or do bad or do fanboy 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.980
 that at xbox just tell me that there 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.180
 there are a few issues people are having 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.630
 this very clearly that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.370
 Of course 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.829
 and that will be patched as well 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.140
 a ring i might as well 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.670
 not so badly tragic that we did it first 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.540
 because there is already 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.859
 update or patch 1.5 are there 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.230
 things of course not all samples 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.989
 is the first time a nonsense come 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.100
 Of course now over time 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.060
 I think that sony is also relative 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.790
 is quickly bang out together and I 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.290
 guess that the patch is as yet to 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.320
 then we get the console 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.299
 at least the end of the month 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.280
 if we download the patch altogether 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.380
 have good version of the psp and it 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.700
 then also reasonably at least without 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.660
 Errors would have to do what is not yet possible 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.030
 I've got a few already 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.940
 other videos are made of course 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.850
 as said this the caption of the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.160
 psp because you can for example with a 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.460
 You can not get elgato directly via hdmi 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.479
 capture there is still this hdcp 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.710
 the hdcp encryption on it so good 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.940
 as mentioned in the other video that 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.250
 still patchen versions and that would be 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.870
 probably get away that whole 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.580
 it can work normally 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.759
 now but I think you need it 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.789
 actually in another device what 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.440
 that then a component and yes that 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.930
 you have to do something in between, but 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.819
 sony will patchen I hope 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.199
 go at least once right times of it 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:12.699
 out and yes I think that then 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.720
 everything will work out the problems are 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.599
 but actually you have to 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.639
 say it is actually now firstly 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.960
 completely normal and secondly 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.759
 probably just because they 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.440
 at least two months ago 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.419
 started the console too 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.740
 to produce 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.419
 that means in time will be natural 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.900
 even more stuff and improved 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.720
 updated and yes, most of all, because yes 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.199
 the time shortly before he is usually the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.370
 probably with most happened 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.870
 and of course they have to 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.289
 and could not do it then 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.460
 Keep up to date every day 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:49.509
 that's why the patch is not 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.280
 think this unfinished come out completely 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.720
 Of course, you can find 1000 percent 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.330
 not even come out that's it 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.620
 shit does not buy it is clear 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.800
 that there must be a patch right away 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.199
 because as I said when you two months 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.219
 two months ago has begun to 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.330
 produce then is not on the 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.580
 latest stand and then you have to 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.009
 stop just with the update afterwards 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.840
 improve 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.960
 yes, well that's basically everything in principle 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.699
 she said it's a good start 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.240
 they have actually been predominantly 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:22.199
 So positive feedback gets something 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.880
 which concerns the errors and the ps4 too 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.419
 So I think that's all in the 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.610
 frame 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.440
 it is not a drama and above all you have to 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.849
 Consider here in Europe have it 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.900
 then just better if the ps4 gets along 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.050
 that will be a tick 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.610
 pavers are yes has the same now 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.080
 most problems because they are the first 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.880
 are the earliest rating 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.970
 gets 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.430
 but I think it's still sony sony 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.560
 get in the grip in the handle and 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.120
 It is not a debacle in this respect 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.750
 Actually, it's almost as though 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.160
 call succeeded city 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.110
 about what I'm talking about right now 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.220
 maybe you already have one 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.110
 or other things heard from 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.000
 other larger youtube channels 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:06.570
 Machine ma chen and yes well I hope 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.150
 you liked the video anyway 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.320
 we can please rate and please 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.790
 leave comments because I would be very 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.040
 looking forward 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:18.360
 and since then i hope very much that im 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.360
 next video which is good
