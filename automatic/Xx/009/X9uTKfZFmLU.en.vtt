00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.379
 hello everyone this first video and here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.029
 I'm going to show you how to make a design 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.660
 nail inspired by some flags 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.780
 of the world for this we need brillito 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.799
 red enamel also blue enamel a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.130
 white enamel 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.279
 scott for neil art red a pick or something 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.880
 point and more people who are like the scott 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.009
 but of paper 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.919
 to begin with I'm going to make the base of 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.810
 white color in all girls except 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.340
 the nail of the ring finger because from 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.340
 then I'm going to paint you another color 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 and as I think the color looks good 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.930
 similar and perfect I'll give you a 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.930
 second here 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.739
 and the nail that was missing I'm going to paint it 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.290
 blue and now I'm going to leave very well 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.050
 dry all my nails and I'm going to leave with 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.579
 the designs for the finger nail chubby 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.890
 I'm going to make the design of the flag of 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.680
 us then for this I'm going to put more 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.869
 syntek in the bottom half and also in 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.970
 half out and I'm going to leave 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.250
 as he does very little free and then 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.259
 I'm going to paint this little hole 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.060
 of blue percent I think it was super 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.970
 super bad of your time a lot but 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.440
 well then with the areas resolved 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.540
 all 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.160
 and once it's dry and I get out of the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.630
 more that there has to be something else or 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.670
 less so just change I forgot 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.000
 speak it now I'm taking little 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.010
 bits of the red scotch to crave and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.710
 I'm going to hit them as well as in stripes 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.900
 parallel to make the white lines 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.520
 and red I did not hit him so so 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.320
 perfectly but if you do it 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.020
 with more care surely they will stay 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.490
 better and certainly if they do not know where 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.170
 get this shield this thinks it's 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 very expensive for anyone to buy it 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 store has cost me 300 pesos so 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.890
 quite economical and easy to get 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.050
 and certainly do it when they have the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.550
 enamel very well dry because I do not know if 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.430
 you can see but there was a small 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.560
 piquete what happened to me why what 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.600
 I did with dry enamels and now with 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.370
 a needle and white enamel I will make 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.780
 little dots that simulate the stars 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.260
 use the play because it was too much 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.990
 gross 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.330
 and something like that would stay and to end with 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.930
 a scissors I will cut the s the excess 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.510
 from scott and that's it 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.189
 the next nail of the index finger and the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.140
 the chilean flag but sophie favorite 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.239
 because I'm from Chile I 'm going to put more 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.310
 kinder on the top and the part 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.930
 from below I'm going to paint it red and like 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.209
 can you see me I passed a button but they were 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.060
 once it is well dry with much 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.920
 I'm going to remove the plus 15 and in that 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.329
 corner I'm going to paint it blue I 'll 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.739
 I did it because I felt more 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.970
 sure but if you do not feel 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.580
 sure use more 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.860
 now with white enamel and a cuita I'm going 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.470
 to make a point right in the center of 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.600
 the blue part simulating the star and now 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.880
 would be to make the French flag 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.820
 I'm going to cut a piece of +15 in half 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.700
 and I'm going to hit him right in the center 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.680
 vigo and the top part I'm going to 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.040
 throw in red there as you can see 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.840
 and the cuticle part I'm going to 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.840
 paint blue and pto 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.940
 I spent a lot here but it does not matter 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.860
 let it dry very well and tele more 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.569
 critical and they will have something like that I know 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.550
 what happened there was a lot but then with 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.680
 the finite and removing the edges will be 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.050
 Pretty much the nail that I'm 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.690
 doing now is the United Kingdom and 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.269
 for this you have to make a white cross 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.370
 I did not have a cat's brush 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.200
 by the engine and that's why I'm not staying 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.940
 so beautiful but if you have a 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.350
 pincelito as well as delgadito is going to 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.720
 get pretty much better 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.910
 In addition to the red you have to make a 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.130
 task in general as an asterisk 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.050
 but I can not do it because 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.330
 that's very small and I would only stay 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.160
 space for the blue but if you 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.160
 they have the biggest is up 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.129
 let it dry super super super good 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.579
 the nail and when they had dry put 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.340
 the asterisk d escoto red as per vera 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.659
 and I put the x and I also put the cars 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.659
 by the white part 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.850
 and then with a scissor cut the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.200
 Leftovers could also animate them but 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.200
 I cut it with scissors 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.400
 and more or less to hesitate this area the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.720
 last nail is the flag of japan is 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.150
 super easy you just have to make a 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.160
 little red dot and ready and now it is 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.290
 all very dry I always but always 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.300
 put on shine because that's how things last 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.130
 more and they look more beautiful then they 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.950
 I put the shine this super good and dry 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.060
 as in 10 seconds the literal is super 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.130
 super good and I just stop and you 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.900
 the cuts and rough hatchers and more or 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.940
 less so was the result to me in 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.340
 truth and that in everything I did not delay so much 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.690
 saying that it was super super nice is 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.160
 quite original and you too 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.590
 they could do them with other patterns 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.790
 Flag patterns I hope you have them 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.800
 liked a lot 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.800
 a giant kiss bye
