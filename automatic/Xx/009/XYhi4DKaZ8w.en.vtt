completely aware of your surroundings in
a<00:02:12.200> video<00:02:12.410> game

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
a video game

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.650 
a video game
I<00:02:12.709> get<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.040> our<00:02:13.459> awareness<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.030> very<00:02:14.090> limited

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
I get that our awareness is very limited

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.089 
I get that our awareness is very limited
so<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.959> makes<00:02:15.110> sense<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.620> characters<00:02:15.980> we

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
so it makes sense that the characters we

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.890 
so it makes sense that the characters we
play<00:02:16.310> would<00:02:16.520> have<00:02:16.670> an<00:02:16.940> alternate<00:02:17.540> vision

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
play would have an alternate vision

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.750 
play would have an alternate vision
thing<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.230> kind<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.410> bridge<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.680> gap<00:02:19.010> it's<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
thing to kind of bridge that gap it's a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.220 
thing to kind of bridge that gap it's a
concession<00:02:20.120> that's<00:02:20.540> understandable<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
concession that's understandable the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.890 
concession that's understandable the
first<00:02:21.500> time<00:02:21.740> but<00:02:22.310> after<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.580> while<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.480> miss
