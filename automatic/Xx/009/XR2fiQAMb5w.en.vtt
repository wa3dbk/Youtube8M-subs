to do the hocus pocus and the triple
elastico<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:10.530> let's<00:00:10.889> not<00:00:11.040> waste<00:00:11.219> any<00:00:11.550> time<00:00:11.849> at

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
elastico so let's not waste any time at

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.539 
elastico so let's not waste any time at
all<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.389> start<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.049> hocus<00:00:13.320> pocus<00:00:13.549> you

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
all and start with the hocus pocus you

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.430 
all and start with the hocus pocus you
at<00:00:14.730> least<00:00:15.000> need<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> five<00:00:15.690> star<00:00:15.929> killer<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.350> do

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
at least need a five star killer to do

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.220 
at least need a five star killer to do
the<00:00:16.619> skill<00:00:16.859> move<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.880> hocus<00:00:18.180> pocus<00:00:18.270> probably

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the skill move the hocus pocus probably

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.140 
the skill move the hocus pocus probably
isn't<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.220> most<00:00:20.430> effective<00:00:20.910> skills

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
isn't one of the most effective skills

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.200 
isn't one of the most effective skills
from<00:00:21.449> FIFA<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.890> looks<00:00:22.920> great<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
from FIFA but I think it looks great the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.939 
from FIFA but I think it looks great the
skill<00:00:24.539> moves<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.869> discussed<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> previous

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
skill moves I discussed in the previous

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.759 
skill moves I discussed in the previous
episodes<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.730> well<00:00:27.390> let's<00:00:27.960> say<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> basic

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
episodes are well let's say the basic

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.830 
episodes are well let's say the basic
skill<00:00:29.070> moves<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:30.090> we're<00:00:30.300> heading<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
skill moves and now we're heading on to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.139 
skill moves and now we're heading on to
the<00:00:30.929> more<00:00:31.140> advanced<00:00:31.740> moves<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.250> you're<00:00:32.880> new<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the more advanced moves if you're new to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.209 
the more advanced moves if you're new to
skilling<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.989> should<00:00:34.200> definitely<00:00:34.860> check<00:00:35.070> out

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
skilling you should definitely check out

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.459 
skilling you should definitely check out
the<00:00:35.399> previous<00:00:35.880> episodes<00:00:36.300> first<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.899> start

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the previous episodes first and start

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.500 
the previous episodes first and start
with<00:00:37.649> those<00:00:37.860> because<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.030> might<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
with those because this might be a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.630 
with those because this might be a
little<00:00:39.930> bit<00:00:40.050> too<00:00:40.200> difficult<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.460> do

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
little bit too difficult so you can do

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340 
little bit too difficult so you can do
the<00:00:41.790> hocus<00:00:42.090> pocus<00:00:42.149> by<00:00:42.570> moving<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> right

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the hocus pocus by moving the right

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.709 
the hocus pocus by moving the right
stick<00:00:43.620> down<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> 45<00:00:45.360> degrees

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
stick down and then in a 45 degrees

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
stick down and then in a 45 degrees
angle<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> left<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> move<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
angle to the left then you move the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.180 
angle to the left then you move the
right<00:00:47.789> stick<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> 180<00:00:49.230> degrees<00:00:49.649> turn<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
right stick in a 180 degrees turn to the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
right stick in a 180 degrees turn to the
right<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.910> sure<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> skill<00:00:52.050> move<00:00:52.260> in

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
right make sure you do the skill move in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.889 
right make sure you do the skill move in
one<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:53.820> let<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.629> right

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
one go so don't let go of the right

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
one go so don't let go of the right
stick<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> middle<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> scale<00:00:56.370> move<00:00:56.610> by

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
stick in the middle of the scale move by

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
stick in the middle of the scale move by
doing<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.600> skill<00:00:57.840> move<00:00:58.050> you'll<00:00:58.230> always<00:00:58.469> end

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
doing this skill move you'll always end

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
doing this skill move you'll always end
up<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.640> there's<00:01:00.359> no<00:01:00.719> hocus<00:01:01.109> pocus

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
up to the right there's no hocus pocus

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
up to the right there's no hocus pocus
where<00:01:01.710> you'll<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> left<00:01:02.910> so

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
where you'll end up going to the left so

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
where you'll end up going to the left so
make<00:01:03.390> sure<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.840> keep<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.350> mind<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.159> I'll

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
make sure to keep that in mind so I'll

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
make sure to keep that in mind so I'll
show<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.760> few<00:01:06.090> examples<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> can

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
show you a few examples of when you can

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
show you a few examples of when you can
use<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> hocus<00:01:07.920> pocus

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
use the hocus pocus

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.789 
use the hocus pocus
as<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.150> said<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.900> think<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.500> very

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
as I said I don't think it's a very

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
as I said I don't think it's a very
effective<00:01:10.979> skill<00:01:11.549> move<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.210> sure<00:01:12.479> looks

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
effective skill move but it sure looks

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
effective skill move but it sure looks
great<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.740> least<00:01:14.040> that's<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.369> opinion<00:01:14.689> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
great at least that's my opinion you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
great at least that's my opinion you
should<00:01:15.720> use<00:01:16.229> Noakes<00:01:16.530> focus<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
should use Noakes focus when the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
should use Noakes focus when the
defender<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.820> running<00:01:18.180> toward<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.630> from<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
defender is running toward you from the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.830 
defender is running toward you from the
right<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> 45<00:01:20.009> degrees<00:01:20.369> angle<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:21.570> has

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
right from a 45 degrees angle there has

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.749 
right from a 45 degrees angle there has
to<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> bit<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> space<00:01:22.890> between<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to be a bit of space between you and the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
to be a bit of space between you and the
defender<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.659> animation<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.320> kinda

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
defender because the animation is kinda

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.490 
defender because the animation is kinda
heavy<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.330> mostly<00:01:27.330> use<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.570> scale<00:01:27.930> move<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> cut

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
heavy I mostly use the scale move to cut

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100 
heavy I mostly use the scale move to cut
inside<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.040> front<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> defender<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.390> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
inside in front of the defender if you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
inside in front of the defender if you
wait<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.680> bit<00:01:31.860> longer<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.520> also

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
wait a little bit longer you can also

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.819 
wait a little bit longer you can also
use<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.390> get<00:01:33.600> behind<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.229> defender<00:01:34.680> but

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
use it to get behind the defender but

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.469 
use it to get behind the defender but
then<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.490> likely<00:01:35.549> you'll<00:01:36.060> lose<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
then it's more likely you'll lose the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.350 
then it's more likely you'll lose the
ball<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.560> skill<00:01:37.920> move<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> also<00:01:38.850> great<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
ball the skill move is also great to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.060 
ball the skill move is also great to
combine<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> fake<00:01:40.259> rabona<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
combine with the fake rabona which I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
combine with the fake rabona which I
discussed<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> previous<00:01:41.850> episode<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> feel

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
discussed in a previous episode so feel

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.340 
discussed in a previous episode so feel
free<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.159> create<00:01:44.340> combos<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.119> yourself<00:01:45.509> I'll

show you some combos I personally use a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.889 
show you some combos I personally use a
lot<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.740> end<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.159> series<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.570> let's

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
lot at the end of this series so let's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.660 
lot at the end of this series so let's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
get on to the second scale move of this

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270 
get on to the second scale move of this
episode<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.420> triple<00:01:54.840> elastico<00:01:55.409> you'll<00:01:56.159> at

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
episode the triple elastico you'll at

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
episode the triple elastico you'll at
least<00:01:56.310> need<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> five<00:01:57.119> star<00:01:57.360> scaler<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
least need a five star scaler to do a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.380 
least need a five star scaler to do a
skill<00:01:58.229> move<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.399> opinion<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> triple

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
skill move in my opinion the triple

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.120 
skill move in my opinion the triple
elastico<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> most<00:02:01.770> difficult

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
elastico is one of the most difficult

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.429 
elastico is one of the most difficult
skill<00:02:02.670> moves<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.090> time<00:02:03.390> correctly<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
skill moves to time correctly the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.530 
skill moves to time correctly the
animation<00:02:04.979> takes<00:02:05.250> kinda<00:02:05.820> long<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.030> there's<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
animation takes kinda long so there's a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
animation takes kinda long so there's a
lot<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.990> time<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.439> your<00:02:07.530> opponent<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.009> steal

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
lot of time for your opponent to steal

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
lot of time for your opponent to steal
the<00:02:08.520> ball<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.629> said<00:02:09.869> we're<00:02:10.110> discussing

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the ball but as I said we're discussing

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.140 
the ball but as I said we're discussing
one<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> more<00:02:11.160> advanced<00:02:11.610> skill<00:02:11.910> moves

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
one of the more advanced skill moves

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.800 
one of the more advanced skill moves
right<00:02:12.300> now

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
right now

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.320 
right now
you<00:02:13.380> can<00:02:13.560> do<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.830> triple<00:02:14.069> obstacle<00:02:14.670> by<00:02:14.880> moving

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you can do the triple obstacle by moving

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690 
you can do the triple obstacle by moving
the<00:02:15.450> right<00:02:15.630> stick<00:02:15.930> down<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.190> 45

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the right stick down and then in a 45

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.550 
the right stick down and then in a 45
degrees<00:02:18.060> angle<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.599> right<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
degrees angle to the right then you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.520 
degrees angle to the right then you
instantly<00:02:20.340> move<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.120> 180<00:02:21.930> degrees<00:02:22.290> turn

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
instantly move it in a 180 degrees turn

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770 
instantly move it in a 180 degrees turn
to<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.830> left<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.940> paid<00:02:24.209> attention<00:02:24.569> you

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to the left so if you paid attention you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
to the left so if you paid attention you
would<00:02:25.080> probably<00:02:25.709> notice<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.190> it's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
would probably notice that it's

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.949 
would probably notice that it's
basically<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.030> same<00:02:27.300> as<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.540> hocus<00:02:27.900> pocus

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
basically the same as the hocus pocus

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.020 
basically the same as the hocus pocus
the<00:02:28.860> only<00:02:29.099> difference<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.849> do<00:02:30.000> it

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the only difference is that you do it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.210 
the only difference is that you do it
the<00:02:30.269> other<00:02:30.420> way<00:02:30.630> around<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.349> that's<00:02:31.950> why<00:02:32.190> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the other way around so that's why I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280 
the other way around so that's why I
decided<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.060> those<00:02:33.300> two<00:02:33.569> skill<00:02:33.870> moves<00:02:34.080> in

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
decided to do those two skill moves in

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.620 
decided to do those two skill moves in
one<00:02:34.590> episode<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.250> recommend<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.420> practice

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
one episode I recommend you to practice

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.660 
one episode I recommend you to practice
these<00:02:37.080> two<00:02:37.290> skill<00:02:37.560> moves<00:02:37.800> at<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.130> same<00:02:38.400> time

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
these two skill moves at the same time

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.300 
these two skill moves at the same time
because<00:02:39.030> they<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.330> very<00:02:39.690> similar<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.319> I'll

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
because they are very similar so I'll

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.009 
because they are very similar so I'll
show<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.760> few<00:02:42.000> examples<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.690> triple

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
show you a few examples of the triple

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.650 
show you a few examples of the triple
elastico<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.650> an<00:02:43.769> actual<00:02:44.280> game<00:02:44.489> as<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.450> said

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
elastico in an actual game as I said

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.449 
elastico in an actual game as I said
earlier<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.319> isn't<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> most

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
earlier it isn't one of the most

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.550 
earlier it isn't one of the most
effective<00:02:47.910> skill<00:02:48.150> moves<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:49.019> fact<00:02:49.290> it's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
effective skill moves and in fact it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.140 
effective skill moves and in fact it's
one<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> most<00:02:50.160> difficult<00:02:50.370> skill<00:02:50.850> moves<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
one of the most difficult skill moves to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.509 
one of the most difficult skill moves to
time<00:02:51.360> correctly<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.530> looks<00:02:52.769> amazing<00:02:53.190> when

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
time correctly but it looks amazing when

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.039 
time correctly but it looks amazing when
you<00:02:53.640> get<00:02:53.819> past<00:02:54.030> your<00:02:54.209> opponent<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:54.870> this

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
you get past your opponent with this

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.470 
you get past your opponent with this
skill<00:02:55.260> move<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.549> best<00:02:56.700> moment<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> use<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
skill move so the best moment to use the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.449 
skill move so the best moment to use the
skill<00:02:57.720> move<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.080> probably<00:02:58.709> when<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> defender

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
skill move is probably when a defender

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.979 
skill move is probably when a defender
is<00:02:59.580> walking<00:03:00.000> towards<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.480> from<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> left

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
is walking towards you from the left

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.740 
is walking towards you from the left
from<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.349> 45<00:03:01.950> degrees<00:03:02.310> angle<00:03:02.540> you'll<00:03:03.540> need<00:03:03.720> a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
from a 45 degrees angle you'll need a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.750 
from a 45 degrees angle you'll need a
lot<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.319> space<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.769> do<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> scale<00:03:05.280> move<00:03:05.519> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
lot of space to do the scale move and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.339 
lot of space to do the scale move and
you'll<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.450> predict<00:03:06.780> your<00:03:06.900> opponent's

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
you'll have to predict your opponent's

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.070 
you'll have to predict your opponent's
run<00:03:07.560> which<00:03:07.830> isn't<00:03:08.160> easy<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:09.720> want<00:03:09.959> to
