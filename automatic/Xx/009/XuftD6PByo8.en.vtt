00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
your foot as hell and you go into the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.520 
your foot as hell and you go into the
field<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.520> your<00:04:34.670> techniques<00:04:35.030> poor<00:04:35.270> then<00:04:36.020> you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
field and your techniques poor then you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.200 
field and your techniques poor then you
know<00:04:36.650> you're<00:04:36.740> not<00:04:36.860> going<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.100> do<00:04:37.880> well<00:04:38.030> you're

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
know you're not going to do well you're

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.400 
know you're not going to do well you're
going<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.360> come<00:04:38.480> over<00:04:38.510> second<00:04:38.900> best<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
going to come over second best and the

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.870 
going to come over second best and the
same<00:04:39.560> thing<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.860> way<00:04:39.980> around<00:04:40.220> if<00:04:40.610> you're<00:04:40.790> going

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
same thing I way around if you're going

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.610 
same thing I way around if you're going
to<00:04:40.940> fielding<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.300> techniques<00:04:41.570> great<00:04:41.810> but

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
to fielding the techniques great but

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.710 
to fielding the techniques great but
you're<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.830> bit<00:04:43.240> unconditioned<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.420> know<00:04:44.630> you

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
you're a bit unconditioned you know you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.390 
you're a bit unconditioned you know you
go<00:04:44.780> slow<00:04:44.960> when<00:04:45.050> you<00:04:45.140> get<00:04:45.260> injured<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.160> think

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
go slow when you get injured so I think

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.520 
go slow when you get injured so I think
it's<00:04:46.640> all<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:47.030> solid<00:04:47.360> balance<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.870> I'm<00:04:47.990> yeah<00:04:48.500> i

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
it's all a solid balance and I'm yeah i

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.250 
it's all a solid balance and I'm yeah i
think<00:04:48.710> it's<00:04:48.920> all<00:04:49.010> pretty<00:04:49.190> important

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.620 

yep<00:04:53.190> yep<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.790> think<00:04:54.090> that's<00:04:54.270> pushed<00:04:54.480> through

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
yep yep I think that's pushed through

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.860 
yep yep I think that's pushed through
the<00:04:54.750> indeed<00:04:54.960> i<00:04:55.050> use<00:04:55.200> all<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.650> NZ<00:04:55.920> at<00:04:55.980> rpa<00:04:56.250> um

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
the indeed i use all the NZ at rpa um

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.030 
the indeed i use all the NZ at rpa um
they're<00:04:57.870> always<00:04:57.960> coming<00:04:58.170> here<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.590> think<00:04:58.830> once

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
they're always coming here I think once

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.920 
they're always coming here I think once
a<00:04:59.130> year<00:04:59.310> or<00:04:59.490> different<00:05:00.210> different<00:05:00.630> start<00:05:00.870> of

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
a year or different different start of

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.330 
a year or different different start of
every<00:05:01.110> campaign<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.680> they<00:05:01.770> give<00:05:02.130> us<00:05:02.220> the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
every campaign and they give us the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.070 
every campaign and they give us the
briefings<00:05:02.730> on<00:05:02.880> what<00:05:03.420> happens<00:05:03.690> if<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.960> get

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
briefings on what happens if you get

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.960 
briefings on what happens if you get
injured<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.620> how<00:05:04.800> support<00:05:05.550> our<00:05:05.610> families<00:05:05.940> and

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
injured and how support our families and

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.940 
injured and how support our families and
whatnot<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:06.360> it's<00:05:06.630> pretty<00:05:07.140> cool

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.990 

run<00:05:14.540> run<00:05:15.540> run<00:05:15.890> good<00:05:16.890> that<00:05:17.280> makes<00:05:17.400> a<00:05:17.580> hot<00:05:17.760> it

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
run run run good that makes a hot it

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.220 
run run run good that makes a hot it
makes<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.360> whole<00:05:18.450> lot<00:05:18.510> easier<00:05:18.870> when<00:05:19.110> you're

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
makes it a whole lot easier when you're

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.840 
makes it a whole lot easier when you're
when<00:05:19.500> you're<00:05:19.590> there<00:05:19.800> for<00:05:20.040> their<00:05:20.340> age<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:20.730> know

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
when you're there for their age you know

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.920 
when you're there for their age you know
me<00:05:21.000> because<00:05:21.150> that<00:05:21.270> way<00:05:21.480> you<00:05:21.510> can<00:05:21.750> kind<00:05:21.900> of

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
me because that way you can kind of

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.600 
me because that way you can kind of
progress<00:05:22.110> higher<00:05:22.530> higher<00:05:22.770> but<00:05:23.100> I<00:05:23.130> came<00:05:23.280> into
