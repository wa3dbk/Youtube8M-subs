00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.540
 hello youtube friends today 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.290
 I come to teach with a new video 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:25.310
 tutorial how to get the gta san andreas 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.099
 for full pc since maybe many 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.320
 they have searched for us in google or google like 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.260
 I want to say and have met 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.850
 pure viruses that damage your computer 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:39.140
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.000
 is to download the file that I will leave 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.900
 the download link in the description 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.690
 of the video comes on this page 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.260
 to download it you have to subscribe 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.930
 good forgiveness you have to register in 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.079
 this page is very simple they do not have 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.089
 no cost 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.300
 we will give you where it says download 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.879
 free and the counting is going to start 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.159
 can perform the download once 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.250
 finish the 20 seconds automatically 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.320
 it will begin to download 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.890
 if it's going to take a little bit because it's a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 530 megabyte file if I do not 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.870
 I'm wrong or I think the truth is I do not know 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.120
 now we are going to see it 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:28.200
 is a 532 megabyte file that goes to 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.420
 take a little bit if I'm going to put it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 pause the video or rather I'm going to cancel 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.610
 the download better I think it's the best 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.230
 because I already have it on my desk 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.910
 well once downloaded they will leave 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.340
 a file like this gta san andreas the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:50.140
 download link is not mine is from a 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:54.130
 friend the king of 1988 is called suscribes 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.830

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.070
 an icon like this one that we're going to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.730

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.730

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.539
 once we get that out we're going to give it 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.539

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.940

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.910
 once he sends us here we are going to do 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.819
 a little parenthesis we're going to get 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.129
 to local disk ce program files and 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.519
 let's create a folder where they want 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.200
 gta san andreas that I will remove 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.700
 I'm going to put in my folder the name of 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.700

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.490
 7a program 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.900
 once we select it we are going to 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.540
 give in extracting it will take a little 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.570
 unzipping so I'm going to put it 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.840
