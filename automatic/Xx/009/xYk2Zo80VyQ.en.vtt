00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.650
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.350
 this new installment of planet century 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.180
 bardino quest today we'll talk about a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.439
 much discussed topic between us 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.680
 breeders and word books 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.100
 American of Italianate means 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.280
 means intersection of blood relatives there is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.480
 union between allowed this well 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.570
 let's say this procedure let's say of 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.039
 game breeding the hinges 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.000
 presents pros and cons 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.870
 well, however, they are in practice thanks to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.260
 always reading books they brought 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.199
 come on that thanks if it wasn't there 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.590
 the ii meeting today would not be there for 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.740
 example or would be manifested 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.619
 after a long time for example we can 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.580
 give a very trivial example hypo melanie 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.630
 c type for example 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.770
 when they were discovered they were born by chance 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.040
 that is, they were born imagine a normal for 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 a normal they joined and gave 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.910
 let's say this melanic type for example 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.190
 if they were born, a boy and a boy were born 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.540
 female and a male sibling and therefore 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.250
 to carry on this morrow bridging 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.530
 they gathered and then we say some news 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.200
 but with the line and therefore we say 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.479
 libridine used mainly to carry 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.060
 forward morphs pertaining to pattern we say 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.080
 most at home or for 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.000
 example we can say the mix that was born 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.650
 always to be regulated no because all the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.290
 nominated moves of the woman by name la 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.220
 most and therefore for example the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.910
 mac market was born of his sister 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.370
 or only an ex zero e was born 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.160
 so he was paired with the non brothers 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.050
 put roma were let's say with gene 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.140
 snow and therefore to have this normality 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.900
 and instead we have the feedback we say 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.680
 negatives that are many more than those 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.530
 positive especially because 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.609
 with the axis we say with a selection 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.069
 in in breathing a lot we say up to 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:47.420
 same generation meets 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.370
 problems beyond the sixth generation 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.340
 because you can face problems 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.579
 of dysfunction for the redheads there is therefore 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.969
 a poor quality regarding 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.480
 the health of the geko and then you will have it 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.769
 jackie maybe with beautiful colors 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.189
 I don't doubt this, but with one 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.819
 quality 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:12.540
 we say very poor health then 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.870
 because behind we say it behind for 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.799
 example no behind with frost there will be one 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.189
 there is a vast selection of blood relatives 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.019
 or many consanguineous couplings 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.430
 etc 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:31.650
 think for example a white and yellow 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.239
 a combo among a rolling pin bellalba 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.239
 or a mai tai and the oral one 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.530
 that is, to get at least what we say 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.579
 that selection if we start from wired a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.409
 white and yellow and wished there is one 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.530
 selection that at least four three 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.840
 generations to get right though 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.239
 let's start from qua tagliero without it ed 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:00.989
 aurata therefore in practice therefore these 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.169
 combos that you say come let's say le 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.770
 they ask for a lot of breeding selection though 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:11.630
 we start dinner 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:14.480
 from jackies who have no age instead if 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.910
 for example there is a rolling pin and radar 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.880
 now since then only one line will suffice 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.989
 generation or at most two and then the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.830
 everything is easier 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.810
 however projects will have had anyway 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.560
 shoulders of the selections of con 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.600
 most light today 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.810
 very much moved we say these 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.780
 numbers we see all these combos there 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.070
 they are very many with salvini 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.020
 so in practice we said that 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.960
 they can in practice create above all 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.990
 in females some problems for 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.510
 example when they are crossed between 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.430
 related to the age of less than one year 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.780
 which may have for example gods 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.850
 egg laying problems 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.680
 so they can see the attention 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:04.010
 of the eggs and then we operated 61 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.540
 we say not operate and in practice also 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.440
 for example let 's say about the combo bed e 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.490
 dysfunctions or even if they will not reach 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.770
 the normal weight that the geckos reach 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.140
 example a 60 gram could 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.350
 reach 50 grams this is 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.480
 speaking of bring let's say up to the water 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.920
 to the sixth generation or even up 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:35.100
 to the fourth in practice 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.790
 therefore or for example we have said 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.670
 may be the law they have 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.890
 small sizes remain small and 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.680
 so this will carry on a star know 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:50.220
 very small compared to normal or 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.960
 better I want found and therefore 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.390
 you have to be very careful especially 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.300
 for you are jazz 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.950
 for example the first draws the most 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.310
 part of the cases already the first depositions 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.620
 they make them infertile now it also sets 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.770
 to the breathing above and then it happens 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.110
 milan so you have to stay a lot 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.560
 be careful always select 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.620
 healthy animals of a size always 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.330
 optimal and obvious let's say wait 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.090
 paolo uno wants to make them drink wait 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.820
 we always say the first year of age or 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.160
 at least a year and a half so that there 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.480
 let us say union between two animals 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.480
 hundred percent 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:36.270
 healthy and and so these are let's say i 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.730
 evidence problems against this 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.430
 selection obviously I don't want 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:46.140
 to criticize this we say that if but 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:49.860
 I just want to say let's here 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:54.180
 problems that there may be with a 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.850
 wrong briefing indeed well it is you 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.180
 done well by good results has been made 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:03.380
 bad of course from 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.490
 very unpleasant results thanks for 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.710
 attention 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.370
 see you for the next good video 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.340
 vision 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.080
 remember that you can to have the 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.270
 more information always on these 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.680
 animals you can go to my site 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:25.930
 planit jacko martino and of course if 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.930
 you want to follow the spirits
