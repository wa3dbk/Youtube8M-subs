00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
sir see who i'm probably said wrong as

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.309 
sir see who i'm probably said wrong as
well<00:03:58.239> but<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.510> was<00:03:58.599> two<00:03:58.720> hundred<00:03:58.750> thirteen

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
well but it was two hundred thirteen

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.379 
well but it was two hundred thirteen
thousand<00:03:59.709> coins<00:03:59.829> grab<00:04:00.340> me<00:04:00.579> three<00:04:01.030> goals<00:04:01.239> in

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
thousand coins grab me three goals in

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.900 
thousand coins grab me three goals in
seven<00:04:01.630> games<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.230> i'm<00:04:02.290> not<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.680> he's<00:04:02.910> he's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
seven games and i'm not that he's he's

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.339 
seven games and i'm not that he's he's
probably<00:04:04.120> not<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.419> greatest<00:04:04.450> striker<00:04:05.109> just

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
probably not the greatest striker just

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.780 
probably not the greatest striker just
because<00:04:05.560> he<00:04:05.650> shot<00:04:05.950> was<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.130> little<00:04:06.400> bit<00:04:06.519> off<00:04:06.639> you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
because he shot was a little bit off you

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.580 
because he shot was a little bit off you
know<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:06.940> was<00:04:07.030> expecting<00:04:07.359> better<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.870> 84<00:04:08.290> shot

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
know I was expecting better of 84 shot

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.050 
know I was expecting better of 84 shot
it<00:04:08.889> was<00:04:09.040> really<00:04:09.280> good<00:04:09.400> pace<00:04:09.609> really<00:04:09.940> good

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
it was really good pace really good
