00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
see the whole of it the hole would be as

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.430 
see the whole of it the hole would be as
big<00:05:26.190> as<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.340> golf<00:05:26.550> ball<00:05:29.510> she's<00:05:30.510> like<00:05:30.690> like

there's a barnacle right there things

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.170 
there's a barnacle right there things
still<00:05:34.590> alive<00:05:34.680> at<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.040> rotate<00:05:35.430> one<00:05:35.640> right<00:05:35.820> here<00:05:35.970> -

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
still alive at a rotate one right here -

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.300 
still alive at a rotate one right here -
oh<00:05:36.450> wait<00:05:37.200> bigger<00:05:37.440> than<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.560> golf<00:05:37.710> ball<00:05:37.860> like<00:05:38.250> a
