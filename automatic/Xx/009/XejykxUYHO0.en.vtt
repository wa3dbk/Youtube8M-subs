 from 2012 also the duration of the film is 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.600
 Personally, I find it very obvious 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.639
 good and we will be four out of five stars 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.680

 the movies are now relatively old walking 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.039
 so I have an unconditional here now 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.430
 not maybe you can further 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:05:00.530
 Below we have comedies here 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.849
 first time loved the mask reported ok 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:10.820
 We also have German films where it is 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:13.440
 warmer too quickly what older before 1996 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.199
 We have international documentation 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.940

 Look, we really have a great deal here 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.599
 especially nice thing and that my 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.320
 list 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.990
 which is currently more and that means 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.270
 For example, if we go to the movie 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.300
 so far we can now here and 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.540
 decide either direct playback 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.890
 Add my list or a friend 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.780
 recommend 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.020
 and when we say my list 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.900
 we have to add that as well 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.850
 you see below my list and 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.590
 we do not just save 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.040
 get out masters that's a good one 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:04.180
 But things are a thing of the past as well 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.290
 yes that exist elsewhere beneficial 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.260
 if you look at the example 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.800
 series house of cards also have now 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.790
 the possibility of scale 1 follow 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.030
 here we can play another 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.240
 follow length further follow also beautiful 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:23.600
 make a direct survey what in the 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.180
 followed and how long that too 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.390
 takes if, for example once a 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:34.040
 season 14 follow the sequence we watch 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:36.980
 let's see how long it takes, and there 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.700
 it actually starts quickly and 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.850
 if we are a little bit 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.680
 we see here that would be too fast 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:46.460
 can jump okay to strong heart 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.830
 Just here in a scene and that 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.020
 good at netflix is ​​that there are times for 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.060
 Amazon in the video at the moment not us 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.740
 can audio subtitling comment 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.560
 adjust and so are the milk 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.230
 warm english german english 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.110
 comment and subtitle subtitles in 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.810
 English and German which I personally 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.550
 very good that we find the series then 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.270
 also similar in the original torc2 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.370
 can watch 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.750
 That's good for me , for example 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.750
 after konz monitor except 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:26.080
 that we are running the series english 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:27.729
 that is a very good thing in the big one 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.660
 and all you can say that netflix 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:34.900
 very clear and essential 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:38.440
 becomes more mature than other portals of mine 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.120
 have eight euros a month opinion, 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.729
 Now here's real possibility around the 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:47.409
 Watch movies and series to look at what 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:51.669
 I do not think too much as I said 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:54.870
 there are beside the 89 euro and also the 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:58.030
 third option I need for 12 euros 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:00.550
 Subscribe to netflix then you make ultra 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.130
 hd movies but you can also 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.380
 read through everything on the tricks homepage 

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.500
 I have the normal as I said 

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.120
 make basic version yes there I would 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.000
 wish you a lot of fun with netflix 

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.000
 and succeed in a good one
