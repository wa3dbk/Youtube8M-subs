00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.200
 the very beginning of the sixties 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.890
 Americans were forced to do very 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.749
 unpleasant for you 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.749
 they did not have a good mass 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.579
 adopted in 1957 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.529
 assault rifle m 14 is obsolete 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.400
 in less than five years 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.170
 heavy cumbersome she is in no way 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.480
 answered modern 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.730
 besides the cartridges Kalashnikov 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.779
 caliber 7 62 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.659
 whether there were in the Czech Republic 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.620
 more effective than cartridges of the same caliber 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.990
 american screws 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.970
 the us army was not going to its 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.060
 their territories 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.620
 area of ​​responsibility the whole world got up at that 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.390
 time is especially relevant 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.340
 so easy and effective weapon 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.440
 it was just necessary 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.600
 american infantry 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.680
 firm rings and designer stone 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.740
 US Department of Defense coped with 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.360
 the task of creating such weapons 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.300
 the best way 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.130
 in december 60 of the first thousand around the edge 15 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.920
 was delivered in armenia already leads 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.470
 on the model of military trials 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 over the next two years the rifle 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.160
 seriously worked 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.760
 renamed at 16 00 sent to the dynamo 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.680
 after this word combat use 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.010
 it was then that in 1964 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.840
 the story of a new generation began 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.570
 individual small arms 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.350
 weapons designed under 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.979
 small after pogroms of reduced caliber 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.979
 5 56 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.640
 new complex consisting of that 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 rifle m 16 other cartridge 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.350
 turned out at first glance quite successful 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.240
 ammo can take a lot of rifle 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.650
 easy to wear but the most important thing is easy 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 shoots 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 and hit the target 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.550
 however, the light weight of the rifle is high 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.980
 accuracy with single and 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.800
 automatic army so they 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.860
 compensated for all the shortcomings of this 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.450
 weapons 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.500
 the main one of which is now reliability in 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.690
 operation 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.470
 the case when the american soldiers 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 they changed their rifles we got refused and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.259
 not at all rare 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.439
 and it happened not only language 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.269
 neighborhoods 16 but paradoxically 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.269
 even declared dignity 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.569
 American field 203 and a half grams 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.919
 acm field 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.349
 almost 8 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.239
 initial bullet speed and sixteen 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.810
 surpasses ours by almost 300 meters in 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.480
 second flu done 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.379
 actions 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.430
 field and 16 for no honor nor field km on 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.430
 distance to one hundred meters 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 m 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.309
 but if on the way field 16 turned out 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.620
 even the smallest obstacles 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.620
 she changed her flight path in 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.089
 arbitrary direction 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.349
 so what do they have to get American 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.659
 grunt was incredibly difficult a 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.399
 here is the Kalashnikov field even now 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:15.919
 Kuskovskaya branch kept the direction 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.399
 of your flight 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.679
 strictly speaking edge and m 16 is not 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:21.699
 twins 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.249
 and you can only compare them services 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.679
 and still in size and weight rifle 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:27.809
 pedestrians 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.259
 and most importantly they are throughout 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.239
 decades have been adversaries in the most 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.609
 different wars 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.299
 in foreign policy M16 exceeds this 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.939
 primarily thanks to more 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.989
 high initial bullet speed 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.749
 M16 bullet save flight path 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.149
 the best people of Kalashnikov 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.179
 at small and medium distances 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.389
 range correction is practically unnecessary 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.840
 besides in comparison with Kalashnikov 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.669
 then sixteen almost no recoil 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.929
 weak recoil along with higher 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.439
 speed bullet gives better accuracy 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.239
 single fire shooting 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.799
 so learn to shoot straight from m 16 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.419
 easier because than Zakayev 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.879
 higher location 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.900
 sighting Lenin table m 16 allows 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:14.689
 strain shilka less and aiming 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.009
 but the matter if the said brought 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.699
 shooting lesha 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.799
 shutter handle edge easier and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:21.569
 more reliable 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.149
 and here is the location of the flag 

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:25.270
 fuses switches kind 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.149
 fire hail the thumb of the right hand 

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.870
 more comfortable to both 16 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.860
 another virtue 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.990
 american assault rifle 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.780
 is the slide lag 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.139
 stop gates 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.160
 rear position after shelling 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.729
 the last cartridge in the store 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.189
 however, the exploitation of weapons is not only 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:45.309
 shooting 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.629
 weapons must be kept clean 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.919
 for this disassemble and clean 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.199
 and here m sixteen does not go to any 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.419
 comparison with Akayev 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.610
 how easy it is to disassemble and clean 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.940
 Kalashnikov assault rifle 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.809
 so hard to do it myself 16 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:02.749
 some assault rifle details 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.979
 we are only small that the mortgage becomes 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.459
 matter of time especially in the field 

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:08.370
 conditions 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.720
 especially laborious cleaning thin 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.840
 tubules for powder gas 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.949
 served in the gate to work 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.080
 but you need to do jewelry work after 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.539
 each shooting otherwise the M16 will just come out of 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:21.839
 building 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.889
 overall assessment is cleverly crafted 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:24.980
 so accurate 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.440
 that getting into it is literally 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.820
 several thousand fatal to the whole 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.039
 constructions 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.389
 and God forbid m16 to drop dirty lies 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.479
 any weapon can perfectly shows 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.759
 yourself on landfills and shooting range 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.870
 but the real test suits him only 

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:42.999
 real fighting 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.269
 my machine gun is often the only friend 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:46.249
 soldier 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.679
 on how reliable and trouble free 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:51.870
 personal weapons depend on life and death of fighters 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.189
 american jazz 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.519
 began to change their m 16 on the trophy akaev 

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:58.839
 still in vietnam 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.909
 applies so far 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.339
 so in the Balkans 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.550
 this is not a lack of patriotism 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.509
 on rational soldier egoism outstanding 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:08.689
 survive simultaneously
