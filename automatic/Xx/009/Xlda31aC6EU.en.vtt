proceeded<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.329> kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.020> there

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
proceeded to just kind of go from there

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
proceeded to just kind of go from there
most<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.219> pokemon<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.090> very<00:00:36.270> defensive

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
most for pokemon are not very defensive

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.110 
most for pokemon are not very defensive
so<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.410> i<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.280> dragon<00:00:38.730> dance<00:00:38.910> up

be enough to handle the waterfall and it

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.740 
be enough to handle the waterfall and it
is<00:04:00.900> indeed<00:04:01.440> not<00:04:01.680> enough<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.390> was<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> little

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
is indeed not enough so it was a little

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.090 
is indeed not enough so it was a little
bit<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.080> sketchy<00:04:04.320> moon<00:04:04.560> because<00:04:04.890> had<00:04:05.070> she

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
bit of a sketchy moon because had she

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.039 
bit of a sketchy moon because had she
lived<00:04:05.310> she'd<00:04:05.970> be<00:04:06.090> able<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.330> take<00:04:06.510> meal<00:04:06.720> with<00:04:07.019> a

thunderbolt<00:04:07.410> most<00:04:07.739> likely<00:04:08.160> even<00:04:09.060> though<00:04:09.269> it's

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
thunderbolt most likely even though it's

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.060 
thunderbolt most likely even though it's
only<00:04:09.630> super<00:04:10.049> effective<00:04:10.290> not<00:04:10.590> four<00:04:10.860> times

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
only super effective not four times

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.340 
only super effective not four times
super<00:04:11.400> effective<00:04:11.640> still<00:04:12.209> probably<00:04:12.870> kill<00:04:13.200> me

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
super effective still probably kill me

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.700 
super effective still probably kill me
but<00:04:13.530> i<00:04:14.040> managed<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.430> take<00:04:14.640> her<00:04:14.790> out<00:04:14.910> and

in comes to Alakazam I didn't catch that
I<00:04:19.670> don't<00:04:19.880> think<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.120> had<00:04:20.240> magic<00:04:20.420> art<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.960> I

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
I don't think I had magic art and I

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.250 
I don't think I had magic art and I
think<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.190> just<00:04:22.370> got<00:04:22.670> destroyed<00:04:23.660> by<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:23.990> rocks

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
think it just got destroyed by the rocks

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.110 
think it just got destroyed by the rocks
and<00:04:24.560> waterfalls<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:25.370> even<00:04:25.610> if<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:25.700> had<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.970> focus

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
and waterfalls so even if I had to focus

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.570 
and waterfalls so even if I had to focus
on<00:04:26.450> I<00:04:26.720> don't<00:04:27.260> think<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.440> had<00:04:27.530> magic<00:04:27.680> guard<00:04:28.010> and

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
on I don't think I had magic guard and

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.460 
on I don't think I had magic guard and
I'm<00:04:29.180> gonna<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.510> take<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.810> out<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.020> it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
I'm gonna just take that out and it

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.790 
I'm gonna just take that out and it
