could<00:02:26.030> take<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.359> out<00:02:26.390> but<00:02:27.290> uh<00:02:27.519> yeah<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:28.970> let's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
could take you out but uh yeah so let's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.640 
could take you out but uh yeah so let's
go<00:02:29.269> over<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> moves<00:02:29.689> and<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.260> alternate

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
go over the moves and the alternate

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.789 
go over the moves and the alternate
moves<00:02:30.859> you<00:02:31.159> can<00:02:31.280> use<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.640> all<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:32.799> first

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
moves you can use and all that first

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.440 
moves you can use and all that first
move<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.099> have<00:02:34.250> upon<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.640> plate<00:02:34.849> is<00:02:35.060> fire

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
move we have upon the plate is fire

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.390 
move we have upon the plate is fire
punch<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.109> the<00:02:36.170> reason<00:02:36.500> we'd<00:02:36.620> run<00:02:36.799> fire<00:02:37.069> punch

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
punch and the reason we'd run fire punch

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.660 
punch and the reason we'd run fire punch
over<00:02:37.640> flare<00:02:38.090> blitz<00:02:38.329> on<00:02:38.629> this<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.079> because<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.220> a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
over flare blitz on this is because of a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.869 
over flare blitz on this is because of a
rocks<00:02:41.329> damage<00:02:41.840> B<00:02:42.470> lack<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.400> leftovers

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
rocks damage B lack of leftovers

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.210 
rocks damage B lack of leftovers
recovery<00:02:44.389> and<00:02:44.629> C<00:02:45.230> we're<00:02:45.500> not<00:02:45.650> running<00:02:45.859> roost

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
recovery and C we're not running roost

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.309 
recovery and C we're not running roost
on<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.609> we<00:02:46.849> are<00:02:46.879> instead<00:02:47.720> running<00:02:48.200> a

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
on this we are instead running a

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.979 
on this we are instead running a
coverage<00:02:48.859> move<00:02:49.069> in<00:02:49.250> earthquake<00:02:49.819> so<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.870> have

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
coverage move in earthquake so you have

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.369 
coverage move in earthquake so you have
fire<00:02:51.230> punch<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.799> definitely<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.870> hits<00:02:54.139> hard

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
fire punch is definitely it hits hard

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.319 
fire punch is definitely it hits hard
after<00:02:54.650> tough<00:02:55.159> claws<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.639> hits<00:02:55.790> hard<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.180> kind

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
after tough claws it hits hard it's kind

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.390 
after tough claws it hits hard it's kind
of<00:02:56.359> like<00:02:56.480> an<00:02:56.540> iron<00:02:56.750> fist<00:02:57.079> boost<00:02:57.470> if<00:02:57.739> you've

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
of like an iron fist boost if you've

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.940 
of like an iron fist boost if you've
ever<00:02:58.609> used<00:02:58.939> an<00:02:59.569> Infernape<00:03:00.200> with<00:03:00.409> fire<00:03:00.620> punch

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
ever used an Infernape with fire punch

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.690 
ever used an Infernape with fire punch
or<00:03:01.189> something

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
or something

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.970 
or something
so<00:03:02.209> it's<00:03:02.840> definitely<00:03:03.230> nothing<00:03:03.349> to<00:03:03.530> sleep<00:03:03.769> on<00:03:03.950> I

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
so it's definitely nothing to sleep on I

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.250 
so it's definitely nothing to sleep on I
think<00:03:04.159> the<00:03:04.519> base<00:03:04.730> power<00:03:05.030> reaches<00:03:05.930> something

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
think the base power reaches something

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.949 
think the base power reaches something
like<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.280> don't<00:03:07.849> know<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.209> reaches<00:03:08.569> something

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
like I don't know it reaches something

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.059 
like I don't know it reaches something
like<00:03:09.849> 120<00:03:10.849> 130<00:03:11.420> something<00:03:12.079> like<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.409> so<00:03:12.919> it's

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
like 120 130 something like that so it's

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.770 
like 120 130 something like that so it's
not<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.250> weak<00:03:13.459> move<00:03:13.699> and<00:03:13.940> after<00:03:14.030> dragon<00:03:14.569> dance

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
not a weak move and after dragon dance

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.960 
not a weak move and after dragon dance
it'll<00:03:15.169> hurts<00:03:15.410> anything<00:03:16.129> that's<00:03:16.430> weak<00:03:16.609> -<00:03:16.760> it'd

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
it'll hurts anything that's weak - it'd

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.990 
it'll hurts anything that's weak - it'd
probably<00:03:17.329> kill<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.980> can<00:03:19.250> even<00:03:19.370> do<00:03:19.549> very

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
probably kill it and I can even do very

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.580 
probably kill it and I can even do very
good<00:03:20.030> damage<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.569> Skarmory<00:03:20.989> but<00:03:21.319> if<00:03:21.500> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
good damage to Skarmory but if you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.619 
good damage to Skarmory but if you
really<00:03:21.799> want<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.069> run<00:03:22.160> flare<00:03:22.459> blitz<00:03:22.699> you<00:03:23.359> might

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
really want to run flare blitz you might

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.030 
really want to run flare blitz you might
want<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.840> consider<00:03:24.079> running<00:03:24.379> roost<00:03:24.769> over

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
want to consider running roost over

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.009 
want to consider running roost over
earthquake<00:03:25.699> but<00:03:25.909> then<00:03:26.120> your<00:03:26.299> wall<00:03:26.659> to<00:03:26.870> buy

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
earthquake but then your wall to buy

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.189 
earthquake but then your wall to buy
Heatran<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:28.370> that's<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.699> thing<00:03:28.879> but<00:03:29.569> it's<00:03:29.870> up<00:03:30.049> to

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
Heatran so that's a thing but it's up to

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.439 
Heatran so that's a thing but it's up to
you<00:03:30.379> next<00:03:31.129> we<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.430> Dragon<00:03:31.879> Claw<00:03:32.060> which<00:03:32.329> is

the only thing that can really resist
that<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.750> think<00:03:54.199> is<00:03:54.409> Heatran<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.280> oh<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:56.560> so

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
that I think is Heatran and oh you so

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.949 
that I think is Heatran and oh you so
yeah<00:03:57.709> there's<00:03:57.949> that<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.400> then<00:03:58.849> finally<00:03:59.359> here

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
yeah there's that and then finally here

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.839 
yeah there's that and then finally here
this<00:04:00.349> is<00:04:00.500> where<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.739> gets<00:04:00.889> kind<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.099> tricky<00:04:01.370> if

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
this is where it gets kind of tricky if

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.580 
this is where it gets kind of tricky if
you<00:04:01.940> run<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.090> flare<00:04:02.419> blitz<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.900> might<00:04:03.319> want<00:04:03.560> to
