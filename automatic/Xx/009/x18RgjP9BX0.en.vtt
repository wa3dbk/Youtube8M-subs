00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello how about this is a very video 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.140
 simple where we will show 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 so an example of kinect for windows 7 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.010
 first I want to comment 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 the basic requirements that we have 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.590
 have installed in our 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.590
 computer 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.860
 and I will describe them here 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.560
 first we need version 2.7 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 piton 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.810
 with some modules that we are going to occupy 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.829
 in this example including the game and 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.719
 well, good 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.190
 here here this is a set of 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:54.010
 modules 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.440
 time the most street occupy later 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.900
 this also with a previous installation 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 Start the student 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.590
 2010 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.890
 and also of course also the sdk of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.890
 kinect 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.590
 this is what we are going to occupy and what 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.230
 I already have installed, I want to tell you 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.230
 that with installation a bit the thing 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:32.080
 but at the end of accounts there 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.080
 let's execute in our example 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 and well here through the cinema we are already 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.770
 capturing then what is the video 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.270
 and I'm going to stand in front of the camera to 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.270
 get the coordinates 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.120
 I think I swallowed here 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.830
 what I swallow 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.189
 we can run it again without any 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.189
 problem 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.900
 to try again 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.900
 our little table due to space problems 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.190
 we already have it 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.690
 obviously we need a space 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.720
 for greater 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.820
 a minimum distance of 1 meter with 80 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.660
 I have just one centimeter meter 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.660
 distance to kinect 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.070
 and well then this way we can 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.070
 get also the skeleton 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.310
 of our body 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.739
 what you liked this is 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.000
 simply a basic example 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.000
 Later I am going to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.360
 Some examples 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.460
 with more this 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.460
 development thanks
