00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.320
 at hanser this mobile giggs we are 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.390
 still many thanks to ifa 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.610
 asus and mercedes benz support 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.830
 Here again just on stand by and acer 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.449
 polens the acer iconia where night 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.619
 watch this here at the fair 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.720
 was presented 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.529
 it is an inexpensive 8-inch tablet to 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.339
 will cost around 150 euros 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.009
 it's not all that good 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.539
 equipped therefore above all what that 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.439
 design concerns is one feels 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.789
 a bit cheap 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.380
 but you can not even do it that way 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.840
 bad we have here as the name 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.680
 already says an 8-inch display that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.570
 has a hd-resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.180
 it also contains an intel atom z 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.830
 3735 g-ba core processor around the kids 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.300
 already from other devices and its 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:57.700
 four cores clock to 80 to 1.8 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.079
 gigahertz on it runs android 4.4 kitkat 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.110
 is also typically azer only minimal 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.460
 adjusted I like that even if it 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.469
 actually always good that surfaces 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.819
 never adjusted so much anyway in 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.439
 lately there are not that many 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.369
 updates you have to buy a lot 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.560
 do something 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.719
 because it should not be that hard 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.119
 strongly adapted surface 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.310
 but his but we also have a 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.229
 gigabyte of RAM in there and then 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.869
 we will go through various memory options 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.729
 a little bit about the acer iconia 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.130
 night around we have a power here 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.439
 button then a volume rocker to the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.329
 there's nothing here, nothing 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.689
 front we have up there, we have 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.240
 micro-usb port on a headset board 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:43.310
 the back then a camera and such 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.079
 a third point back feels 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.060
 Okay but definitely not high 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.920
 end tablet so we have better 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.630
 acer devices dress better 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.079
 felt it is a rather cheap 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.479
 tablet calls that should be the one series 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.950
 In addition to a number of cheap tablets 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.450
 we still have a camera, a rear 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.890
 micro sd card slot is allowed of course 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.200
 not missing and then back down 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.280
 her the speakers all in all 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.080
 makes the acer iconia of 8 1 all right 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.819
 an impression it is not that 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.740
 most surprising most innovative tablet 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.890
 Outside, an 8 inch tablet is the right one 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.910
 will be cheap and yes it should be 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.170
 but his ok 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.550
 We will definitely be more accurate 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.860
 if it is in germany 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.830
 available is that it is a fast car 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.230
 with the hesse heiko night so I am 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.220
 for tablet blog.de and mobile facts 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.220
 to see figures
