health when you pick up a an orb is a
useful<00:04:21.510> feature<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.730> think<00:04:23.730> in<00:04:23.940> trials<00:04:24.360> of

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
useful feature I think in trials of

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.300 
useful feature I think in trials of
Osiris<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.350> we're<00:04:25.470> going<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.680> see<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.040> crest

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
Osiris that we're going to see the crest

Osiris that we're going to see the crest
of<00:04:26.430> alpha<00:04:26.730> lupi

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
of alpha lupi

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.480 
of alpha lupi
get<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.639> little<00:04:28.030> bit<00:04:28.509> more<00:04:29.020> useful<00:04:29.830> because<00:04:30.310> it

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
get a little bit more useful because it

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.870 
get a little bit more useful because it
will<00:04:30.820> allow<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:32.009> revive<00:04:33.009> your<00:04:33.310> teammates

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
will allow you to revive your teammates

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.590 
will allow you to revive your teammates
much<00:04:34.270> faster<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.550> my<00:04:36.550> recommendation<00:04:36.759> if

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
much faster so my recommendation if

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.240 
much faster so my recommendation if
you're<00:04:37.720> planning<00:04:38.080> on<00:04:38.199> going<00:04:38.560> into<00:04:38.620> trials<00:04:39.160> of

you're planning on going into trials of

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.670 
you're planning on going into trials of
Osiris<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.360> crest<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:40.720> alpha<00:04:40.990> loop<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.350> if

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
Osiris is the crest of alpha loop I if

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.850 
Osiris is the crest of alpha loop I if
you're<00:04:42.520> still<00:04:42.789> working<00:04:42.970> on<00:04:43.360> crota<00:04:44.050> then<00:04:44.830> i

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
you're still working on crota then i

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.710 
you're still working on crota then i
would<00:04:45.100> go<00:04:45.250> with<00:04:45.280> insurmountable<00:04:45.850> skull<00:04:46.449> for

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
would go with insurmountable skull for

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.960 
would go with insurmountable skull for
next<00:04:47.350> for<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.620> Warlocks<00:04:48.400> we<00:04:48.550> got<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.759> heart

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
next for the Warlocks we got the heart

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.999 
next for the Warlocks we got the heart

go between the two it's really going to

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.450 
go between the two it's really going to
be<00:05:13.900> preference<00:05:14.380> which<00:05:14.800> one<00:05:15.130> do<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:15.430> like

better which subclass you like playing

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.310 
better which subclass you like playing
as<00:05:17.889> better<00:05:18.130> both<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.090> them<00:05:19.419> are<00:05:19.660> kind<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.080> mid

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
as better both of them are kind of mid

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.339 
as better both of them are kind of mid
tier<00:05:20.620> i<00:05:20.650> think<00:05:21.070> but<00:05:21.220> there<00:05:21.370> are<00:05:21.490> no<00:05:21.960> stand<00:05:22.960> out

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
tier i think but there are no stand out

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.430 
tier i think but there are no stand out
chest<00:05:24.220> armors<00:05:24.789> for<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.479> Warlock<00:05:25.930> right<00:05:26.199> now

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
chest armors for the Warlock right now

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.110 
chest armors for the Warlock right now
so<00:05:26.800> either<00:05:27.070> one<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.400> them<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.729> going<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.000> be

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
so either one of them is going to be

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.839 
so either one of them is going to be
good<00:05:28.300> alright<00:05:29.259> for<00:05:29.530> weapons<00:05:30.009> we<00:05:30.130> got<00:05:30.250> bad<00:05:30.430> juju
