00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.939
 hello I'm manna olive vet of the 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.440
 veterinary clinic olivares in granada 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.330
 and from www.triodos.es to continue talking 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.039
 today of the diseases that affected 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.070
 the skin of our dogs our 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.020
 cats we talked about mushrooms the other day 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.250
 dermatophytes and they are dogs and today 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.410
 we are going to talk about the same thing but 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.119
 referring to the case of cats and 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.010
 I reminded them we must remember that the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.080
 dermatophytosis were infections 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.730
 produced by certain types of fungi that 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.620
 they were going to affect the more layers 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 superficial from the skin to the hair even 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.020
 to the nails is an infection that 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.899
 It is produced by some fungi 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.510
 dermatophytes that are known and there are several 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.820
 species within these mushrooms in the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.890
 case of cats the most frequent goes to 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.629
 to be the micro is for a canis although the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.540
 man seems to the one who does not indicate that he is 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.969
 one of the dogs in 90% of cases 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.550
 of dermatophytes dermatophytes and 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.219
 cats is going to be this this fungus that the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 cause of the process then it is a 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.820
 process that is even more frequent in 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.500
 the cats that in dogs in the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.240
 Clinic looks more even in cats 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.540
 long- haired masters 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.920
 sang now more than those with short hair and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.110
 this is a disease that is very 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.759
 contagious among animals and it is also 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.490
 an afano sisocia that can be transmitted 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.320
 to people and that transmission to both 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.090
 other animals as to people is going to 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.280
 be through direct contact or with 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.740
 the remnants of scaling and hairs 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.810
 contaminated with infectious forms 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.700
 and from then on then well then 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.159
 I already say so much other another cat get infected 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.259
 as a person in the specific case of 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.759
 the cats is very important to know that 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.710
 also have what is known 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.560
 with some carriers without apparent that 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.750
 they are animals that are going to be able to infect 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.429
 others to other animals other people and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.039
 however they do not present any 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.080
 symptomatology of this disease 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.259
 then it is to remember it by when it arrives 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.539
 a new little cat to the clinic is 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.200
 important that good as the veterinarian 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.789
 Also check if there is any 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.530
 a suspicion that it could be a 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.909
 carrier and apparent good then for 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.470
 prevent infection from appearing in 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.330
 other animals in the house or even in 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.160
 those in the owners is a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.799
 disease that is going to present on 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.180
 all in animals that are young in 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.170
 those who do not have the system yet 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.319
 immune well 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.540
 developed and good put kittens 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.010
 that arrive from first to home that comes 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.470
 in three shelters that come from some 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.239
 money that from first to the best not 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.340
 present any symptoms and to the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.510
 few days and even after having 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.310
 past a veterinary review it 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.930
 they begin to show those injuries and it's 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.480
 because these animals already had those 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.069
 those fungi on the skin and in with a 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.600
 lowering of defenses due to the stress of 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.560
 the changes then may result in 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.330
 lesions are already presented 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.940
 this disease that represented the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.830
 cats in more adult cats already have 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.450
 an immune system developed but that 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.400
 for some systemic disease that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.830
 are suffering can also suffer 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.800
 an immunosuppression and that they can suffer 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.420
 this disease as we know that our 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.370
 cat can have fungi 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.410
 well, they can be presented the same as 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.989
 we talk but it 's the small way 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.380
 caldas that usually appear in the area 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.209
 from the head in the snout to the ears 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.190
 on the bridge of the nose but it also 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.620
 can generalize and accept the rest of the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.239
 trunk to the nails in cats even 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.790
 other forms can be presented as is 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.769
 a form that is called dermatitis 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.780
 miliaries in which they appear as 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.280
 tiny little men in the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.690
 skin are sometimes difficult even 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.519
 appreciate in areas that are 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.890
 affected can also be presented 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.660
 like a fine peeling that is also 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.160
 difficult to appreciate are less ways 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.140
 frequent of the presentation of this 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.549
 giving this disease just as it happened 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.739
 in the case of dogs it is also 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.230
 can manifest in a way what is 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.569
 called banker yum that was an injury already 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.940
 more important an injury 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.240
 also circular but much more 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.210
 inflamed that what are the injury 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.190
 because folliculitis appeared in 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.110
 the boils assumes a boil if by 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.060
 a deeper skin lesion 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.510
 due to the presence of these fungi 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.860
 once we have this suspicion then 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.200
 We take our kitten to the vet 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.430
 and will perform a general examination in which 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.230
 will appreciate the state in which 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.840
 find the cat in good condition 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.580
 body of your vaccination status see if there is 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.410
 parasites both external and internal 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.760
 if it is an adult cat even with tests 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.350
 more complementary as they can be 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.050
 blood tests to rule out any 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.850
 systemic disease and we already resorted to 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.340
 study of the skin and in that study of 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.080
 the skin that we use from the tricogram 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.170
 to see if there are important ways and see 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.920
 the shape of the hairs we also make 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.580
 scraped to rule out diseases 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.320
 parasitic we do we put the lamp 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.180
 with debut light in which it appears 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.130
 apple green fluorescence in 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.620
 some cases of these dermatophytosis 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.670
 you can also resort to yielding busy 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.460
 must resort to making crops 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.660
 specific for dermatophytes and with everything 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.100
 this is good because we are going to be able to 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.440
 diagnose the presence of this 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.500
 disease, even good, it will come 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.300
 to diagnose what kind of two videos the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.220
 which is producing the process 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.870
 once we have diagnosed it already 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.310
 our animal pacma dermatophytosis 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.590
 we must resort to installing a 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.560
 treatment that is going to be both topical 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.090
 as systemic so that sometimes there 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.590
 have to resort to peeling the animal to 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.780
 well, so I can use these 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.400
 treatments more more easily a 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.990
 topical treatment with shampoos that already 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.180
 even prepared for treatment 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.830
 of these where these mushrooms and is a 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.060
 systemic treatment as good for the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.889
 medications that our veterinarian 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.750
 consider more appropriate since there is a 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.240
 matter series of them in the 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.669
 market and depending on both the size 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.449
 as the weight of the animal when it takes 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.979
 diary goes to the vet's tastes 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.780
 You can use one or the other 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.430
 medicines I already say that always under your 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.110
 supervision 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.490
 It is important not only to treat 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.550
 our animals but also prevent 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.030
 the contagion to others so good then 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.500
 If the cat has this disease we should 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.539
 of trying to prevent it from going up 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.370
 example the sofas to the beds 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.289
 we must cover it with some sheets 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.000
 to winds that can be removed and washed 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.560
 regularly so that they are not left 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.419
 there are infectious elements that give rise 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.490
 to the appearance of new infections of 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.360
 our cat and of course I do not go 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.789
 to have contagion 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.169
 to the people good because this is what 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.120
 I wanted to tell you about the 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.400
 dermatosis and in the case of what the 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.629
 data we will continue talking about other 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.189
 diseases that affect the skin of 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.389
 our animals and others never anymore 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.680
 you know that if you have any doubt 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.539
 about this or any other subject 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.280
 related to health and care of 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.780
 our animals you can get in 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.219
 contact us through the 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.099
 telephone query that appears in 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.469
 our website www point your vet 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.000
 point info and there we will be happy to 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.889
 solve all those doubts 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.689
 Well, I hope this little video 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.770
 has been useful and see you in the 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.770
 next up soon
