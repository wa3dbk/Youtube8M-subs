but we do end up winning the first side
before<00:06:47.020> this<00:06:47.470> I<00:06:47.710> believe<00:06:48.009> this<00:06:48.130> is<00:06:48.190> the<00:06:48.370> second

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850

before this I believe this is the second
side<00:06:49.060> we<00:06:49.270> do<00:06:49.419> end<00:06:49.570> up<00:06:50.130> winning<00:06:51.130> this<00:06:51.340> whole<00:06:51.550> map
