00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.240 
point like when I was doing the battle I
didn't<00:04:03.120> know<00:04:03.330> what<00:04:03.630> type<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.260> Arceus<00:04:04.800> was<00:04:05.040> so

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
didn't know what type that Arceus was so

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.120 
didn't know what type that Arceus was so
I<00:04:05.280> would<00:04:05.550> just<00:04:05.580> wanted<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.210> throw<00:04:06.390> on<00:04:06.690> an

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
I would just wanted to throw on an

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.690 
I would just wanted to throw on an
assurance<00:04:08.130> just<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.060> see<00:04:09.390> what<00:04:09.810> type<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.470> was

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
assurance just to see what type it was

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.240 
assurance just to see what type it was
so<00:04:11.700> yeah<00:04:12.090> anyway<00:04:12.480> go<00:04:12.720> for<00:04:12.930> assurance<00:04:13.440> faster

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
so yeah anyway go for assurance faster

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.690 
so yeah anyway go for assurance faster
than<00:04:14.460> to<00:04:14.610> tauros<00:04:15.540> obviously<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:17.370> does

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
than to tauros obviously and it does

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.039 
than to tauros obviously and it does
neutral<00:04:18.120> damage<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.600> know<00:04:18.660> because<00:04:18.900> his

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
neutral damage you know because his

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.539 
neutral damage you know because his
poison-type<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.770> thought<00:04:19.980> it<00:04:20.070> was<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.370> looked

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
poison-type I thought it was it looked

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.020 
poison-type I thought it was it looked
like<00:04:20.730> psychic<00:04:21.270> but<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.290> guess<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.100> wasn't<00:04:23.280> good

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
like psychic but I guess it wasn't good

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.940 
like psychic but I guess it wasn't good
anywhere<00:04:24.360> earthquake<00:04:24.750> goes<00:04:24.930> off<00:04:25.170> and<00:04:25.500> knocks
