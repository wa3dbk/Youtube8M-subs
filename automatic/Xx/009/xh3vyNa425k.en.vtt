00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
ways of doing this here you can leave a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
ways of doing this here you can leave a
white<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.210> lighter<00:00:54.690> gap<00:00:55.140> some<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.560> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
white a lighter gap some of the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400 
white a lighter gap some of the
background<00:00:56.160> showing<00:00:56.460> through<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:58.140> could

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
background showing through or you could

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.890 
background showing through or you could
put<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.700> of<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> dark<00:01:00.210> line<00:01:00.510> there

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
put a little bit of a dark line there

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.170 
put a little bit of a dark line there
just<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.470> say<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.130> saucer<00:01:02.550> shape<00:01:02.820> will

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
just to say where the saucer shape will

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.479 
just to say where the saucer shape will
be<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.259> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.619> you've<00:01:04.829> got<00:01:05.040> two<00:01:05.250> options

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
be so you can you've got two options

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.420 
be so you can you've got two options
there<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.509> just<00:01:07.409> put<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
there I just put a bit more into that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
there I just put a bit more into that
one<00:01:09.710> make<00:01:10.710> sure<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.100> coverage<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> enough<00:01:13.310> if

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
one make sure the coverage is enough if

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.120 
one make sure the coverage is enough if
you<00:01:14.790> use<00:01:15.000> too<00:01:15.270> much<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> magic<00:01:16.140> mix<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you use too much of the magic mix you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630 
you use too much of the magic mix you
will<00:01:17.399> get<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:18.469> transparent<00:01:19.469> look<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.219> then

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
will get more transparent look and then

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.959 
will get more transparent look and then
the<00:01:21.090> petals<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> background<00:01:22.740> section<00:01:23.100> in

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
the petals to the background section in

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:30.289 
the petals to the background section in
just<00:01:24.420> little<00:01:24.749> short<00:01:25.229> choppy<00:01:25.740> strokes<00:01:29.299> blend

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just little short choppy strokes blend

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.960 
just little short choppy strokes blend
on<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.689> palate

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.820 

remember<00:01:39.870> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.050> going<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.710> the

remember this is going to be the
brightest<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.610> now<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.120> bottom<00:01:42.690> candles<00:01:43.170> are

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
brightest one now the bottom candles are

brightest one now the bottom candles are
usually<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.730> a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.960> bit<00:01:46.080> angular<00:01:46.710> shape<00:01:47.450> we

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
usually in a little bit angular shape we

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.420 
usually in a little bit angular shape we
want<00:01:48.480> to<00:01:48.810> use<00:01:49.010> netfile<00:01:50.010> crimson<00:01:50.700> across<00:01:51.660> these

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
want to use netfile crimson across these

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.970 
want to use netfile crimson across these
petals<00:01:55.130> netball<00:01:56.130> crimson<00:01:56.730> is<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:58.470> median

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
petals netball crimson is the median

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.070 
petals netball crimson is the median
colored<00:01:59.430> mix<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.000> we're<00:02:00.210> starting<00:02:00.660> off<00:02:00.780> with

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
colored mix so we're starting off with

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.059 
colored mix so we're starting off with
the<00:02:01.320> medium<00:02:01.800> color<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:03.300> put<00:02:03.630> these

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.250 

sometimes<00:02:10.879> we<00:02:11.060> can<00:02:11.209> change<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.749> angles<00:02:12.079> of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
sometimes we can change the angles of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.619 
sometimes we can change the angles of
these<00:02:12.439> these<00:02:12.829> later<00:02:13.219> so<00:02:13.909> just<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.359> some

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
these these later so just get some

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.220 
these these later so just get some
little<00:02:14.780> V<00:02:15.079> shapes<00:02:15.469> into<00:02:15.799> their<00:02:19.989> use<00:02:20.989> the
