genes that code for creativity also code
for<00:00:23.580> bipolar<00:00:23.850> disorder<00:00:24.060> hence<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.350> concept

for bipolar disorder hence the concept

researchers<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.960> Sweden<00:00:34.079> found<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.739> writers

disorders and creativity I mean just

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
disorders and creativity I mean just
look<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.829> headlines<00:00:47.010> researchers

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.069 
don't know sorry to burst your bubble
but<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.610> study<00:00:53.879> isn't<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.390> conclusive<00:00:54.930> as

but that study isn't as conclusive as
