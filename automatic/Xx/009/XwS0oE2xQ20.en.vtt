new<00:00:09.630> monitor<00:00:10.080> from<00:00:10.260> Asus<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> Asus

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
new monitor from Asus this is the Asus

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.259 
new monitor from Asus this is the Asus
VG<00:00:12.450> 278<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.130> starters<00:00:14.340> let's<00:00:14.790> talk<00:00:15.030> about

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
VG 278 so for starters let's talk about

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.269 
VG 278 so for starters let's talk about
some<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> technology<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.650> Asus<00:00:17.070> has

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
some of the technology that Asus has

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.689 
some of the technology that Asus has
integrated<00:00:17.699> into<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> LCD<00:00:19.109> panel<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.710> for

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
integrated into this LCD panel and for

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880 
integrated into this LCD panel and for
starters<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.539> LED<00:00:22.170> backlight<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
starters here we have LED backlight and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.599 
starters here we have LED backlight and
LED<00:00:23.880> backlights<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.539> generally<00:00:25.470> smaller<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
LED backlights are generally smaller and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.089 
LED backlights are generally smaller and
use<00:00:26.760> less<00:00:27.029> power<00:00:27.300> than<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> traditional<00:00:28.349> CCFL

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
use less power than the traditional CCFL

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.759 
use less power than the traditional CCFL
backlighting<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:29.880> used<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> lot<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.769> LCD

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
backlighting that's used in a lot of LCD

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.500 
backlighting that's used in a lot of LCD
panels<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.489> an<00:00:32.610> LED<00:00:32.790> backlight<00:00:33.360> you'll

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
panels so with an LED backlight you'll

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.420 
panels so with an LED backlight you'll
get<00:00:33.719> an<00:00:33.989> overall<00:00:34.350> thinner<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.219> lighter

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
get an overall thinner and lighter

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
get an overall thinner and lighter
monitor<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.090> well<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.930> generally<00:00:37.469> speaking

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
monitor as well as generally speaking

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.220 
monitor as well as generally speaking
better<00:00:38.040> contrast<00:00:38.730> ratio<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> often<00:00:40.140> they

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
better contrast ratio and often they

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
better contrast ratio and often they
will<00:00:40.350> use<00:00:40.500> less<00:00:40.710> power<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.250> well<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> also

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
will use less power as well this is also

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.990 
will use less power as well this is also
a<00:00:42.450> 3d<00:00:43.020> monitor<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.680> there's<00:00:43.860> several<00:00:44.610> features

this<00:01:04.739> has<00:01:04.949> two<00:01:05.309> times<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.820> 3d<00:01:06.180> brightness

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this has two times the 3d brightness

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
this has two times the 3d brightness
featuring<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.650> Nvidia<00:01:08.400> light<00:01:08.700> boost

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
featuring the Nvidia light boost

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.179 
featuring the Nvidia light boost
technology<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.020> basically<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.799> means<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
technology and basically that means that

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.050 
technology and basically that means that
if<00:01:11.280> you're<00:01:11.400> using<00:01:11.430> 3d<00:01:12.119> glasses<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.840> view<00:01:13.229> 3d

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
if you're using 3d glasses to view 3d

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.880 
if you're using 3d glasses to view 3d
material<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.360> monitor<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.740> will

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
material on this monitor then you will

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
material on this monitor then you will
actually<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.369> double<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.670> brightness<00:01:18.090> so

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
actually have double the brightness so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
actually have double the brightness so
you<00:01:18.509> won't<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> dimming<00:01:19.500> effect<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you won't get the dimming effect that a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.300 
you won't get the dimming effect that a
lot<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.520> times<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:22.070> wearing<00:01:23.070> 3d

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
lot of times you can get with wearing 3d

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
lot of times you can get with wearing 3d
glasses<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:24.090> also<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> two<00:01:25.049> millisecond

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
glasses I also get a two millisecond

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380 
glasses I also get a two millisecond
