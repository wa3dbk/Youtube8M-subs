11<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:45.030> think<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.989> know<00:03:46.109> we<00:03:46.739> put<00:03:47.069> we

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
11 and I think that you know we put we

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.759 
11 and I think that you know we put we
kind<00:03:47.849> of<00:03:47.939> change<00:03:48.689> a<00:03:48.840> little<00:03:49.109> how<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:49.260> play<00:03:49.560> we

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
kind of change a little how we play we

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.409 
kind of change a little how we play we
tried<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.099> get<00:03:50.189> more<00:03:50.400> pressure<00:03:50.730> up<00:03:50.939> front<00:03:50.969> we

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
tried to get more pressure up front we

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.059 
tried to get more pressure up front we
try<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.629> get<00:03:51.810> our<00:03:51.870> backs<00:03:52.169> forward<00:03:52.620> more<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:52.980> we

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
try to get our backs forward more and we

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.979 
try to get our backs forward more and we
were<00:03:53.129> successful<00:03:53.519> doing<00:03:53.879> that<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.780> all

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
were successful doing that but it all

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.929 
were successful doing that but it all
has<00:03:55.169> to<00:03:55.199> do<00:03:55.469> with<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.680> urgency<00:03:56.099> and<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.669> you

things guys you know putting forth that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.720 
things guys you know putting forth that
effort<00:04:04.909> Christoph<00:04:05.909> as<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.480> top<00:04:07.579> was<00:04:08.579> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
effort Christoph as the top was the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.360 
effort Christoph as the top was the
father<00:04:09.290> well<00:04:10.290> like<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.709> said<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:11.129> know<00:04:11.219> we

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
father well like I said you know we

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.069 
father well like I said you know we
thought<00:04:11.669> that<00:04:11.939> what<00:04:12.389> we<00:04:12.480> didn't<00:04:12.719> want<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.959> do

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
thought that what we didn't want to do

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.050 
thought that what we didn't want to do
was<00:04:13.260> give<00:04:13.439> them<00:04:13.650> time<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.340> back<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.849> move

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
was give them time in the back to move

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.819 
was give them time in the back to move
the<00:04:15.209> ball<00:04:15.239> all<00:04:15.840> around<00:04:15.900> we<00:04:16.320> want<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.590> pressure

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
the ball all around we want to pressure

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.589 
the ball all around we want to pressure
them<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.280> we<00:04:17.430> pressured<00:04:17.909> them<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.180> two<00:04:18.359> with

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
them so we pressured them with two with

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.909 
them so we pressured them with two with
three<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> middle<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:19.349> four<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> back

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
three in the middle and four in the back

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.009 
three in the middle and four in the back
and<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.579> idea<00:04:20.880> was<00:04:20.909> to<00:04:21.060> get<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.239> full-backs

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
and the idea was to get the full-backs

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.810 
and the idea was to get the full-backs
forward<00:04:22.500> almost<00:04:22.830> making<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:24.320> 252<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.820> didn't

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
forward almost making it a 252 I didn't

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.149 
forward almost making it a 252 I didn't
trade<00:04:26.940> off<00:04:27.409> first<00:04:28.409> off<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:29.220> score<00:04:31.159> that's

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
trade off first off you score that's

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:47.550 
trade off first off you score that's
good
