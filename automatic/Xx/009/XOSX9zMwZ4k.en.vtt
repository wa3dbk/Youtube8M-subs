00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 right porsche virtues materials accurately 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.589
 the revenue in question and that after the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.860
 looked at between how is her 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.120
 Body make up on anabolic steroids 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.040
 what do i call each one to those 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.109
 but in character and called for 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.789
 Watch TV before then I wore 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.020
 heard that we have the stream international 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.029
 have opened now 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 that's good for one thing because of two things 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.539
 that we now have German colleagues 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 but you can enjoy Austria 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.670
 greet each other and hear we understand each other 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.500
 Now we'll come back later 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.149
 They are now happy because their main 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 Subscribers are at home in Germany 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.149
 but now we are international 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.370
 the way I wanted to briefly say 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.710
 can now have a ship language 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.710
 clearly discuss everything so it is so 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.289
 Here's the question, too 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 Bodybuilder I say now 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 I myself have no 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.309
 problem with people who consume that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 Every person has a body 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.160
 disposal his body and can do 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.960
 with what he chooses but you look 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.430
 also weird if you see 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 that one in the locker room or something 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.240
 Angelini wants to put him in the spotlight 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.010
 seen my whole life 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.510
 I also think that has a lot to do with that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 law of attraction to do that if you 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.439
 to say such things out to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.909
 maybe they 'll shoot that too 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.540
 but I am still happy about it myself 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.130
 never seen 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.810
 it just matters to me that the people 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.490
 for the 7 between competitive sport 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.229
 and just hobby sport and what me 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 bothers are all these hobby athletes 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.369
 they are theirs, so to speak 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.140
 health yes at this moment endangered 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.970
 play an example and set that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.100
 everything for short-term successes or when 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.780
 these short term ones are made by 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.270
 we are talking about for the summer 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.640
 we want now and now in January in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.320
 space and a sixpack folder and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.119
 if possible with little effort a lot 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.350
 reach or is called women then there 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.610
 I do not even have an advantage against it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.930
 As everyone can say, even if I can 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.060
 just a pity 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.259
 and if you have someone now if now 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.820
 says i 'll go to the stage i want 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.280
 we will have masters 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.680
 maybe these pictures were seen 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.420
 the pigs blinded 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.470
 He is the best in the world to become 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.460
 to get the stage then it's something 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.780
 others but close like 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.850
 We conclude that with sport 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.229
 the whole bodybuilding and we go 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.560
 on the channels 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.450
 you have two youtube channels and for the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.770
 German and Austrian 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.310
 colleagues now at home in front of the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.170
 screen 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.260
 You can ask your questions now 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.330
 dot ch slash live comes to us 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.190
 in the broadcast and ask your questions 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.560
 me and patrick and my first 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.840
 question to public is there are quite a few 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.390
 different channels where it is about nutrition 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.900
 and sport fitness lifestyle bodybuilding 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.080
 is why you have your own 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.610
 That 's a good question 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.300
 I never really wanted to go to that 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.040
 public 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.370
 until half a year ago I had 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.780
 not even her facebook account 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.489
 but due to the Swiss 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.430
 make championship because of mine 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.489
 title as well on my title worldwide 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.180
 third place he is interested 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.160
 That's okay with one person 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.830
 or the shit I think I think it's ok 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.019
 because of this, because I now have the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:13.190
 people yes by being able to say people 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.600
 It is also a motto it is still possible 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.130
 if you bring the necessary discipline 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.680
 if you have the necessary if you have the necessary 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.630
 know how bring nutrition and also 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.630
 always in training then it is with
