and the fact that they are four point to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.880 
and the fact that they are four point to
constant<00:00:39.180> voltage<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> very<00:00:40.590> powerful

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
constant voltage that is a very powerful

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.250 
constant voltage that is a very powerful
little<00:00:41.520> battery<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
little battery right here one of the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.569 
little battery right here one of the
biggest<00:00:43.590> complaints<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
biggest complaints I got about the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.790 
biggest complaints I got about the
regular<00:00:45.059> MIG<00:00:45.300> stick<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:46.020> how<00:00:46.230> long<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> was

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
regular MIG stick was how long it was

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
regular MIG stick was how long it was
and<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.309> wanted<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> show<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> guys<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and I just wanted to show you guys the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.189 
and I just wanted to show you guys the
difference<00:00:49.050> between<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:50.750> manual<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
difference between the manual one and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
difference between the manual one and
the<00:00:52.289> automatic<00:00:52.649> battery<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> reason

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the automatic battery and the reason

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
the automatic battery and the reason
they<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.590> much<00:00:55.860> smaller

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
they can make this one so much smaller

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
they can make this one so much smaller
is<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> doesn't<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.260> button

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
is because it doesn't have the button

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
is because it doesn't have the button
but<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.100> feel<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.399> since<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> great

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
but I feel like since this is a great

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
but I feel like since this is a great
Sig<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.690> beginners<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> having<00:01:01.890> an

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
Sig for beginners that having an

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
Sig for beginners that having an
automatic<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.579> even<00:01:02.910> better<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
automatic is even better because you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000 
automatic is even better because you
never<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> push<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> button<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
never have to push a button on a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.250 
never have to push a button on a
cigarette<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.930> give<00:01:07.170> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
cigarette to get it to you know give you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.929 
cigarette to get it to you know give you
the<00:01:07.380> drag<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> feel<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.790> would

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the drag and so I feel like this would

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
the drag and so I feel like this would
even<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.240> more<00:01:09.750> close<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.320> cigarette<00:01:10.740> for

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
even be more close to a cigarette for

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.490 
even be more close to a cigarette for
those<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.850> starting<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.240> vape<00:01:12.510> also<00:01:13.260> there

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
those just starting to vape also there

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
those just starting to vape also there
is<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.799> airflow<00:01:14.159> button<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> back<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
is an airflow button on the back but I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.149 
is an airflow button on the back but I
have<00:01:15.600> tried<00:01:15.930> plugging<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.860> doesn't

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
have tried plugging that and it doesn't

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.310 
have tried plugging that and it doesn't
really<00:01:17.460> make<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> difference<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.900> drag<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
really make a difference on the drag so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.640 
really make a difference on the drag so
if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.500> accidentally

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.990 

still<00:01:26.650> baits<00:01:26.830> just<00:01:26.979> fine<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.580> as<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.820> can<00:01:27.940> see

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
still baits just fine and as you can see

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.240 
still baits just fine and as you can see
those<00:01:28.659> are<00:01:28.840> huge<00:01:29.260> clouds<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.130> feel

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
those are huge clouds and I just feel

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.130 
those are huge clouds and I just feel
like<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:30.790> is<00:01:30.820> also<00:01:31.299> a<00:01:31.330> lighter<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:32.080> you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
like this one is also a lighter and you

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.350 
like this one is also a lighter and you
know<00:01:32.799> no<00:01:33.070> button<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.460> think<00:01:33.490> this<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.030> even

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
know no button I think this is even

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.230 
know no button I think this is even
closer<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.409> cigarette<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:39.790> know<00:01:39.880> some<00:01:40.210> of

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
closer to a cigarette so I know some of

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.550 
closer to a cigarette so I know some of
you<00:01:40.450> out<00:01:40.630> there<00:01:40.659> were<00:01:40.930> like<00:01:41.080> oh<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.259> want<00:01:41.530> to

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
you out there were like oh I want to

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.109 
you out there were like oh I want to
make<00:01:41.710> sake<00:01:41.950> but<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.190> wasn't<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.610> right<00:01:42.909> yet

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
make sake but it wasn't just right yet

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.020 
make sake but it wasn't just right yet
so<00:01:43.300> maybe<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:44.050> was<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.770> upgrade<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.790> you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
so maybe this was the upgrade that you

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.850 
so maybe this was the upgrade that you
have<00:01:46.210> been<00:01:46.360> looking<00:01:46.479> for<00:01:46.930> I'll<00:01:47.170> go<00:01:47.590> ahead<00:01:47.680> and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
have been looking for I'll go ahead and

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.710 
have been looking for I'll go ahead and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
put a link below to make cigs website if

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.060 
put a link below to make cigs website if
you're<00:01:49.869> interested<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:50.320> picking<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.800> this

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
you're interested in picking it this

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.760
