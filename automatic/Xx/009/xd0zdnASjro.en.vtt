Chicago<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.740> both<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.250> cause<00:01:11.630> problems<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
Chicago for both from cause problems I

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.430 
Chicago for both from cause problems I
think<00:01:14.369> Phoenix<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.750> shoot<00:01:16.140> better

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
think Phoenix because they shoot better

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.980 
think Phoenix because they shoot better
from<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.800> outside<00:01:17.190> but<00:01:17.520> Portland<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.720> better

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
from the outside but Portland has better

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.710 
from the outside but Portland has better
one-on-one<00:01:19.259> players<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.369> Clyde<00:01:20.720> quarter

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
one-on-one players with Clyde quarter

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.109 
one-on-one players with Clyde quarter
and<00:01:22.020> Doug<00:01:22.530> worth<00:01:22.710> inside<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.790> they

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and Doug worth inside so I think they

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
and Doug worth inside so I think they
both<00:01:24.330> creates<00:01:24.780> different<00:01:25.080> problems<00:01:25.800> but

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
both creates different problems but

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
both creates different problems but
that's<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.640> great<00:01:26.880> series<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.140> will

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that's a great series I think that will

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
that's a great series I think that will
go<00:01:28.290> seven<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.040> light<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.729> Phoenix<00:01:29.940> will

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
go seven to light I think Phoenix will

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.020 
go seven to light I think Phoenix will
win<00:01:30.390> at<00:01:30.720> home<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.190> anybody's<00:01:32.759> ball<00:01:32.970> game

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
in game 7 that's just a tremendous

Portland<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.759> been<00:01:38.940> so<00:01:39.240> close<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.930> often<00:01:40.350> for

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
Portland it's been so close so often for

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.950 
Portland it's been so close so often for
them<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:41.100> could<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.820> gotten<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
them they could have gotten one of the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.900

they really had a chance last night to
win<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.950> didn't<00:01:50.220> execute<00:01:51.060> down<00:01:51.720> at

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
win and they just didn't execute down at

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.520 
win and they just didn't execute down at
the<00:01:52.050> end<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.380> win<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> game<00:01:53.899> we<00:01:54.899> have
