 folder that says duties between sisters 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.509

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.820
 software ps terminal ps service ips 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.529
 store the order of installation of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.919
 next in the first place we will install 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.660
 the ps service double click on it 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.170

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.210
 English 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.680

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.680
 configuration and installation assistant 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.710
 we give next we choose the route 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.230
 default where the psc will be installed 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 next service 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.040
 we leave the server ports by 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 default we give next and finally 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.460
 install 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.950
 we end 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.970
 then we install ps terminal the same 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.090
 how is the language 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.490
 as following next create icon in 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.490
 the next desktop install 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.710
 and finally we installed the weightlifter 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.000
 on the desk 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.660
 what does today known about the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.660
 endless 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.890
 let's double click on it and on this in 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.650
 this in this screenshot we will configure 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.460
 the following there are two ways to do it 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.630
 we can put the ip address the server 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 the server would be your pc 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.369
 we look for any of these ip that 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.010
 have the local area card added 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.710
 of the pc or we put an address by 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.360
 default which is the loop back 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.060
 we leave the port that we set 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.620
 previously that is 8000 the user 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.390
 is admin the password from 1 to 6 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.930
 we give in this option to remember 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.930
 password 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.140
 we are already inside the interface of 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.360
 insists on the video now let's 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.270
 add those of dancing in conflict there 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.410
 an option that says vice management 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.850
 there are two options or add them manual or 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.050
 Run a search engine automatically 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.820
 between the network 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.890
 here by the force I get these two 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.430
 equipment that we have here internally in 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.430
 the company 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.180
 we put the first 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.180
 we dedicate 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.659
 in this option of devizes status 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.819
 We verify if the equipment is off or 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.620
 We do not have access if the team is 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.620
 blue color we have access 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.470
