bet that there's going to be people but
we'll<00:02:30.980> have<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.310> exact<00:02:31.760> same<00:02:32.120> pattern<00:02:32.450> that

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
we'll have that exact same pattern that

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.670 
we'll have that exact same pattern that
you<00:02:33.140> can<00:02:33.380> put<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:34.099> normal<00:02:34.400> 3ds<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.930> it

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you can put on a normal 3ds but it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.509 
you can put on a normal 3ds but it
doesn't<00:02:37.130> really<00:02:37.250> matter<00:02:37.489> because<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:39.230> end

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
doesn't really matter because in the end

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.860 
doesn't really matter because in the end
people<00:02:40.519> will<00:02:40.730> sit<00:02:40.940> there<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.180> say<00:02:41.359> well<00:02:41.630> it's
