00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 we put the text that we want 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.560

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.570

 toolbar we look for the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.200
 folder address 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.329

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.140
 gabi israel in our taskbar 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.140

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.860
 recording I'm going to open it so they can see 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.240

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.740
 and the additional icons and ready like this is 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.369

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.409
 with a text either about name name 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.870
 or some text that you want to put 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.620
 the text can be long 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.920
 this is without altering the system without 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.660
 altering windows without altering anything is not 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.370
 with no program like you saw 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.250
