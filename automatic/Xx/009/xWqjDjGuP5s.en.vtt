game<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:47.599> the<00:01:47.659> most<00:01:47.749> part<00:01:48.079> was<00:01:48.229> really<00:01:48.799> really

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
game for the most part was really really

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.679 
game for the most part was really really
good<00:01:49.279> and<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:49.520> had<00:01:49.700> little<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.149> complain<00:01:50.359> about

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
good and I had little to complain about

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.019 
good and I had little to complain about
when<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:51.770> came<00:01:51.919> to<00:01:52.069> playing<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.849> made

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:53.029 
when it came to playing it and that made

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.359 
when it came to playing it and that made
it<00:01:53.149> easy<00:01:53.419> to<00:01:53.869> make<00:01:54.049> anything<00:01:54.560> about<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.159> just

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
it easy to make anything about it just

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.129 
it easy to make anything about it just
because<00:01:55.669> I<00:01:55.880> knew<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.119> could<00:01:56.329> go<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.719> and

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
because I knew I could go in and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.749 
because I knew I could go in and
whatever<00:01:57.439> I<00:01:57.590> had<00:01:57.709> to<00:01:57.829> get<00:01:57.950> done<00:01:58.159> I<00:01:58.399> could<00:01:58.579> get

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
whatever I had to get done I could get

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.999 
whatever I had to get done I could get
done<00:01:58.969> that's<00:01:59.719> not<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.169> case<00:02:00.349> of<00:02:00.529> battlefield

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
done that's not the case of battlefield

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.729 
done that's not the case of battlefield
4<00:02:01.039> I<00:02:01.520> cannot<00:02:02.299> guarantee<00:02:02.689> that<00:02:02.929> I<00:02:03.169> can<00:02:03.349> go<00:02:03.559> in

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
4 I cannot guarantee that I can go in

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.289 
4 I cannot guarantee that I can go in
and<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.130> game's<00:02:04.340> gonna<00:02:04.520> play<00:02:04.849> the<00:02:05.059> way<00:02:05.149> it's

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
and the game's gonna play the way it's

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.149 
and the game's gonna play the way it's
supposed<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.779> that<00:02:06.380> allows<00:02:06.529> me<00:02:06.709> to<00:02:06.799> get<00:02:06.919> things

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
supposed to that allows me to get things

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.119 
supposed to that allows me to get things
done<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.549> that<00:02:08.300> more<00:02:08.899> than<00:02:08.929> anything<00:02:09.500> has

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
done and that more than anything has

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.399 
done and that more than anything has
made<00:02:10.399> me<00:02:10.579> just<00:02:10.759> hate<00:02:11.239> gaming<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:11.989> general

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
made me just hate gaming in general

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.290 
made me just hate gaming in general
because<00:02:12.980> there's<00:02:13.430> no<00:02:13.579> consistency

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
because there's no consistency

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.780 
because there's no consistency
to<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:14.780> wild<00:02:15.110> card<00:02:15.260> every<00:02:15.500> time<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.370> not

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
to it it's wild card every time so not

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.430 
to it it's wild card every time so not
being<00:02:17.030> able<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.240> make<00:02:17.390> content<00:02:17.840> has<00:02:18.110> really

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
being able to make content has really

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.930 
being able to make content has really
kind<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.650> killed<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.950> fun<00:02:19.190> for<00:02:19.430> me<00:02:19.520> because<00:02:19.790> I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
kind of killed the fun for me because I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.220 
kind of killed the fun for me because I
know<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.180> want<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.510> keep<00:02:20.630> up<00:02:20.780> at<00:02:20.960> least<00:02:21.110> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
know I want to keep up at least a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.260 
know I want to keep up at least a
regular<00:02:21.710> stream<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.070> content<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.030> know<00:02:23.210> I

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
again I can't get it done for all the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.290 
again I can't get it done for all the
reasons<00:02:25.040> already<00:02:25.340> mentioned<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:25.880> what<00:02:26.240> I'm

reasons already mentioned so what I'm

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.420 
reasons already mentioned so what I'm
trying<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.630> do<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.140> make<00:02:27.320> gaming<00:02:27.770> fun<00:02:28.250> for

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
trying to do is to make gaming fun for

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.060 
trying to do is to make gaming fun for
me<00:02:28.520> again<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.030> lately<00:02:30.020> what's<00:02:30.590> been<00:02:30.770> doing

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
me again and lately what's been doing

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.890 
me again and lately what's been doing
that<00:02:31.190> for<00:02:31.400> me<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:31.730> live<00:02:32.150> streaming<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.720> all

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
that for me is live streaming of all

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.630 
that for me is live streaming of all
things<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.710> weird<00:02:33.950> because<00:02:34.130> I've

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
things and this is weird because I've

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.580 
things and this is weird because I've
tried<00:02:35.030> live<00:02:35.330> streaming<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.780> past<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.350> I

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
tried live streaming in the past and I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.230 
tried live streaming in the past and I
didn't<00:02:36.860> care<00:02:37.040> for<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.490> I'm<00:02:37.850> not<00:02:37.970> entirely

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
didn't care for it and I'm not entirely

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.970 
didn't care for it and I'm not entirely
sure<00:02:38.360> why<00:02:38.810> maybe<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.170> was<00:02:39.260> because<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.530> felt<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
sure why maybe it was because I felt the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.980 
sure why maybe it was because I felt the
need<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.370> constantly<00:02:40.940> try<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.300> keep<00:02:41.750> people

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
need to constantly try to keep people

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.570 
need to constantly try to keep people
entertained<00:02:42.170> while<00:02:42.620> I'm<00:02:42.740> trying<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.010> play<00:02:43.220> but

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
entertained while I'm trying to play but

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.490 
entertained while I'm trying to play but
that<00:02:43.610> really<00:02:44.120> distracts<00:02:45.020> me<00:02:45.110> when<00:02:45.260> I'm<00:02:45.350> in<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
that really distracts me when I'm in the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.930 
that really distracts me when I'm in the
middle<00:02:45.710> of<00:02:45.800> playing<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.190> game<00:02:46.430> like<00:02:46.700> trying<00:02:46.910> to

talk to people ever the most part I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.470

to in the chat but that's that's not

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.880 
to in the chat but that's that's not
what<00:02:53.510> live-streaming<00:02:54.170> should<00:02:54.380> be<00:02:54.470> about<00:02:54.710> and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
what live-streaming should be about and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.410 
what live-streaming should be about and
that's<00:02:54.950> one<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.280> things<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.550> realize<00:02:55.910> a

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that's one of the things I realize a

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.780 
that's one of the things I realize a
couple<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:56.990> sessions<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.530> while<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.280> nice<00:02:58.490> to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
couple of sessions in while it's nice to

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.400 
couple of sessions in while it's nice to
sit<00:02:59.150> there<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.600> interact<00:03:00.020> with<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.230> guys

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410

non-stop<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.490> chat<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:02.000> look<00:03:02.390> at

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
non-stop in the chat I look at

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.540 
non-stop in the chat I look at
live-streaming<00:03:03.020> as<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.740> different<00:03:04.370> way<00:03:04.490> to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
live-streaming as a different way to

pretty good at for a long time but the

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.979 
pretty good at for a long time but the
other<00:03:28.520> hand<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.060> was<00:03:29.209> entertainment<00:03:29.720> just

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
entertaining and I feel that with

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.540 
entertaining and I feel that with
live-streaming<00:03:36.320> I've<00:03:36.560> gotten<00:03:36.980> back<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.430> that

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
live-streaming I've gotten back to that

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.620 
live-streaming I've gotten back to that
I've<00:03:37.700> gotten<00:03:37.910> back<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.209> our<00:03:38.300> roots<00:03:38.480> I've

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
I've gotten back to our roots I've

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.390 
I've gotten back to our roots I've
gotten<00:03:38.870> back<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.290> making<00:03:39.470> everything<00:03:39.890> fun

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
gotten back to making everything fun

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.340 
gotten back to making everything fun
again<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:41.180> biggest<00:03:41.540> reason<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.110> is

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
again the biggest reason for that is

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.220 
again the biggest reason for that is
nothing<00:03:42.650> scripted<00:03:43.370> there<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:43.850> no<00:03:44.510> plans<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.110> go

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
nothing scripted there is no plans to go

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.840 
nothing scripted there is no plans to go
in<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.410> do<00:03:45.560> something<00:03:46.010> specific<00:03:46.640> for<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
in to do something specific for the

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.570 
in to do something specific for the
night<00:03:47.000> or<00:03:47.180> okay<00:03:48.110> we<00:03:48.260> have<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.410> general<00:03:49.040> idea<00:03:49.130> for

into that trap all the time so in short
to<00:06:46.849> kind<00:06:47.060> of<00:06:47.150> flip<00:06:47.539> this<00:06:47.720> around<00:06:47.780> and<00:06:48.229> put<00:06:48.500> it

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
to kind of flip this around and put it

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.159
