00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.420
 as you all know gearbox has promised 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.010
 to keep borderlands 2 updated as 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.860
 more than the chapter that preceded it 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.840
 through a series of dlc the plans of the 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.869
 software houses are crystal clear a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.490
 extra character and 3 big expansion 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.200
 contents all developed after the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.419
 completion of the title and ready to 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.730
 make the new one even more massive 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.009
 gage character the micro manser is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.970
 arrived a few days in advance 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.220
 for free to all those who had 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.109
 pre-ordered the game and already for some 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.210
 day that you talked about her in the forums 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.160
 and in the sites of the sector 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.660
 today we have therefore decided to avoid the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.370
 usually descriptive article and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.960
 propose the special on the huntress 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.179
 of the crypt just arrived in the form 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.859
 explanatory guide to help you 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.309
 unleash all his enormous fury 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.309
 destructive 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.620
 let's start from the basics 10 like the others 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.870
 Playable characters can develop the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.700
 his abilities on three different branches called 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.760
 little big tra bond best friend forever 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.590
 and order chaos his active ability 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 allows you to summon a powerful robot 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.760
 floating called the tramp in degree 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.580
 both to distract the enemies and to do them to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.350
 even the new recruit has small bits 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 some flexibility that allows 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.340
 cover various roles but it is mainly 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.990
 indicated to rain death 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.480
 destruction are from what dwells 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.850
 pandora two of his three branches are 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.740
 in fact dedicated to devastation e 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.330
 they are so synergistic as to make it a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.910
 tornado of bullets even more 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.400
 devastating of a well-armed welfare state 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.500
 let's see the branch one by one 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.120
 order and chaos and without profit 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.400
 the most powerful one available to 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.770
 gauge everything revolves around a single one 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.240
 ability called anarchy that allows 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 to the girl to earn mushrooms 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 anarchy when reloading his weapon 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.140
 finishing a loader in battle 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.940
 each point gives her 1.75 percent of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.230
 more damage and less precision 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.720
 of the used weapons of the same 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.160
 percentage of the damage to the baff can 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.880
 seem useless given the decline of 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.550
 accuracy 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 but don't be fooled gage use 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.550
 several tricks to hit 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.560
 however his enemies 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.530
 the first is the organic is simply 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.270
 shoot from short distance 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.770
 no matter who in Rome used a 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.400
 point blank will practically hit the mark 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.110
 always miter shotguns and smg are 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.910
 particularly suitable for doing damage 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.630
 devastating when the indicator exceeds 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.610
 quota 100 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.290
 especially if equipped with some 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.150
 elementary effect 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.950
 another possibility is to use weapons 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.989
 exclusive or with bullets you hit 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.270
 a parabola in those cases is possible 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.800
 maintain a high distance and be based 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.860
 only on the visual effect of the bullet 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.900
 to hit the enemies in the game there are 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.580
 even trinkets with bullet research but 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.070
 they are very rare so don't hope for 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.959
 see them easily join those who grow more 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.870
 quickly thanks to the taplast skills 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.160
 iconoclast and fresh also cyberfunk but it is 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.480
 always recommended to have neither 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.220
 the equipment at least one weapon 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.900
 dedicated to fast stacking with a 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.239
 small charger and high speed 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.459
 charging and even better if the weapon 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.720
 jacobs since the brand allows 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.980
 download bullets almost 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.600
 instantly 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.750
 if you want to abuse this technique 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.150
 always remember a fundamental rule 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.440
 forget about the top up button 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.940
 recharge ahead of time means 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.100
 instantly lose all points 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.989
 allergies earned so you will have to 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.730
 always finish the magazines and wait 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.220
 that the brigade automatically replaces 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.989
 recharge before time purchases 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.730
 meaning only once the skill is obtained 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.620
 of slag that activates a regeneration 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.000
 Continuous life points is an increase 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.130
 of the precision from paul change of 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.170
 advance loader instead of points 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.810
 Earned EFA Energy Disabled With 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.489
 another reload spend a point in 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.170
 discorde is not an obligation but can be 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.150
 useful in particularly situations 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.500
 dangerous where life points are more 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.090
 important damages 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.739
 but always keep in mind that a power 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.989
 anti synergistic with strategy 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.459
 fundamental of the branch that leads to hold 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.079
 always the quantity of 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.250
 anarchy 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.440
 attention also to the abuse of points in 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.720
 death from above the skill is slightly 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.280
 wet and causes an explosion capable 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.870
 to consume anarchy even during 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.209
 simple displacements from a depression 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.640
 to the other or due flights and impacts 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.380
 provoked by the enemy in certain situations 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.390
 could make it difficult to accumulate 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.859
 anarchy and is therefore better not 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.859
 spend more than a couple of points on it 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.510
 the central branch focuses on the damage 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.460
 elementals and techniques able to do 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.950
 disasters to give but almost requires 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.330
 mandatory weapons never one or equipped 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.580
 of extra effects to result 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.260
 actually devastating the techniques in 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.150
 which focus slightly more on 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.919
 right that once you get the truth 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.200
 right can set fire to enemies or 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.240
 throw a powerful lesbian spheres every 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.860
 point expense the trouble process will lead to 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.140
 all effects being more frequent and 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.550
 harmful therefore always keep four 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.740
 elemental years of properties 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.440
 different in the backpack and use them a 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.330
 depending on the enemy also met 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.250
 this specialization makes it possible to do 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.870
 enormous damage but in our opinion it appears 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.570
 more suitable in combination with 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.010
 the ability to use both bonuses 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.720
 elementary that anarchy stacks 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.700
 reads a force of nature 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.220
 before which nothing anyone can 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.020
 survive for more than a few seconds 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.940
 almost every power of this ram is well 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.950
 designed so choose them well 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.830
 based on your preferences or 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.570
 our addiction to stretch 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.010
 better, however, to avoid honey if not 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.250
 betting in a defensive way 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.110
 and then we hear the branch best friend 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.730
 forever is partially meant for 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.250
 help the less experienced players 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.770
 why his skills are quickly told 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.630
 they guarantee more defensive trough bonuses 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.270
 and gage life points and the ability to 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.130
 hit enemies even without the shot 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.930
 it would hurt you to underestimate this 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.760
 specialization because it is the most 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.130
 purely from tank available to the 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.690
 necromancer almost all the skills which 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.000
 guarantee an improvement of some 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.250
 type health or shields and make 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.960
 gage really hard to get rid of not 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.640
 only once you have invested enough 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.890
 points in the trap branch reaches 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.480
 sensational power levels that it 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.370
 make it able to stay in the field 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.710
 almost perpetually and to get all the 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.870
 bonus of your shield with ability 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.820
 chat robot the trap can do even 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.010
 barrels in certain areas where you win 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.720
 respondo and gain experience for the 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.350
 his mistress in total solitude for 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.690
 hours 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.460
 pity that this curious ramos is also 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.500
 the most paid of the three because of it 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.180
 of its link with the entry can 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.100
 happen more robottone stops at 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.230
 attacking inanimate objects for no reason 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.090
 apparent or assault without mercy 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.160
 objects and people that could come 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.170
 save by causing problems in the 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.880
 completely of some if these 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.230
 decide to throw me on the best friend 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.880
 forever keep an eye on yours 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:37.180
 puppy or float we have them 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:39.460
 warned in our opinion we were not there 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.780
 best for order gage and chaos for 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.580
 do damage to the bound system 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.860
 to anarchy and the most powerful of the 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.830
 game since you can bypass the 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.820
 dear of precisions multiple ways 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.920
 advisable to get up to the skill 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.780
 final and spend some time point 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.180
 in club all to expand the technicians 3 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.670
 and earn additional bonuses due to 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.840
 elementary effects paradoxically between 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.000
 the most synergistic skills 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.490
 in this villa c klose known in the art 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.110
 best friends forever once expenses 5 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.610
 points in that power most of the 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.410
 missed shots due to anarchy 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.080
 bounce enemies will return 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.850
 causing further injury 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.740
 on balance that German is always 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.280
 fun to use independently 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.280
 from the bild
