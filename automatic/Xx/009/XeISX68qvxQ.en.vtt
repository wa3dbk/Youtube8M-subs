00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 and hello everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.259
 my first tutorial on my channel then 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.880
 supported tauriel will focus on the mini 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.590
 hiding a figure that were very 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.389
 asked I will confess to you then who 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.889
 consist of catching up diabolo in the air 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.800
 by doing rounds around is a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 variant that you see now so 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 which consists of bouncing the diabolo 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.769
 on the ground for this figure will 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.769
 master the dark side and mini catch 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.130
 first of all so I'm going to invite 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.100
 a little recap of the dark side so game 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.040
 dark side is to cross 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.110
 scissors to cross the chopsticks so we 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.790
 will pass the red right stick 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.140
 over the diabolo if you are 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.830
 right-handed and of course the left 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.030
 if you are cochet so that's it 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.680
 that's very simple we can do in 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.080
 tightrope a small variant 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.000
 there is one does not put that I do not master 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.550
 no we have so we'll see that when 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.699
 next tutorials and then we'll 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:03.949
 learn to catherine diabolo so for 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.630
 catch it diagnose it's pretty simple 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.780
 when we understood 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.640
 so just go to dark side on 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.070
 will swing the say our two right towards 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.260
 the left then let go the right stick 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.520
 here the red and take the string 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.640
 catch the diabolo while idling 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.200
 so we lick the baguette we catch the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.700
 string it is given a movement 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.210
 circular it must be able to reform 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.009
 the diabolo in the air once you 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.439
 have figured out how to catch the diabolo 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.899
 or two three days of training 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.439
 you master it is almost 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.079
 perfectly 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.500
 so here we go we'll have him in profile 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.500
 right now 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.020
 so in profile so that always pushes 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.550
 the same at the same movement 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.860
 so they spend the ring is in dark 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.290
 side up a circular motion and one 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.630
 catch up with the diabolo then at the beginning the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.080
 hours will mostly focus on the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.970
 catching the diabolo but after 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.190
 the training that goes by itself all of 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.860
 following the variant then for the variant 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.110
 which is a little bit harder we're going 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.430
 take a lap turn over the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 diabolo let him bounce and the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.360
 then catch up 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.090
 so we'll see it in slow motion all of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.850
 after 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.090
 so we go into dark side like those 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.650
 this and we'll turn a turn at 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.260
 above the diabolo without touch diabolo 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.430
 and then we caught up with von trap 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.989
 the abbayette are facts the knots and 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.120
 it's in the box 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.550
 so here I thank you for having 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.050
 watched this tutorial Thursday at the next 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.440
 for new skin tutorials 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.440
 go ciao
