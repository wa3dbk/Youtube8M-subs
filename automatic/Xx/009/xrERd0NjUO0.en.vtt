00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.130
 hello youtube friends this here I come 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.470
 with this tutorial of the song of 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.930
 Georgia and I forgot you recently had 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.340
 and uploaded a video of a liter of that 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.310
 song but the way me to this headdress of 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.680
 some notes that did not go to the original 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.810
 but already checking the already it is the 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.870
 can already correctly draw that it would be 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.300
 how are I going to show you right now 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 I the notes that I had taken out there in 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.860
 the other video would be these 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.870
 to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:55.000
 thing that we are going to change them for these 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.000
 nothing else for this would sound like this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.530
 Not really how I touched it before me 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.080
 and that in a little bit different but it remains 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.720
 but really the right thing 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.200
 good to start this let's play 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.090
 dance at the same time then I did what 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.090
 same time in this way 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.030
 a single family with those of 2005 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:39.270
 it runs easily 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:41.240
 I only repeat tower 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.960
 worship 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 in real time 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.590
 easy runs 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.590
 single 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.200
 truth is what the right hand to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:04.410
 principle with the left hand we are going to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.530
 playing re with his octave will touch us time 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.229
 and this goes against time later 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.490
 we are going to touch two tell you and in time 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.490
 that is, it would be like that 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.409
 and immediately if we see without octave and then 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.409
 they were the same as network 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.349
 Y 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.410
 then they would give at the same time 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.410
 it would sound like this 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.790
 ah 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:01.380
 we go to the tower 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.380
 and here 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.030
 now 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.569
 four times after the four times 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.050
 comes another part where the tonality 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.050
 less 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.380
 but here we are going to do this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.060
 let's play this part 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.440
 and then in the right hand we're going to play 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.190
 these notes just me go I release 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.190
 in this way 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:04:01.990
 through and then if he fails his fault I 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:06.180
 I repeat if you endorse them are only for one 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.180
 more time if the network 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.470
 it would be this way 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.000
 i 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.340
 and in the right hand what we're going to 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.070
 do 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.540
 when we start is to do it from the network and 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.290
 touch it with the same figure we do 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.290
 here in river be 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.580
 what when we are going to change here 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.580
 let's touch this cure against 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.599
 you see 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.599
 this coach now is 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:04.129
 true 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:07.629
 they go to this dry land and the notes are like this 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.629
 then it would sound zhijun 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.380
 i 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.780
 do not 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.639
 do not 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.050
 here previously it has been 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.039
 recorded this a 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.639
 the chords of a particular sound this 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:41.020
 that resembles that of the original song 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.880
 what are these games 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.500
 no no no 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.410
 truth that I use for the 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.630
 accompaniment that I have recorded here 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.390
 then if there are any questions 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.780
 of how this setback goes on in the 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.330
 video and there check the notes and so that 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.960
 it is already finish 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.030
 also to check how it goes then 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.210
 last would be if the song together 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.569
 with the kilo of the notes I recorded 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.569
 it would be like that 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.120
 no no 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.110
 it's simple like that though 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.570
 suddenly it's not like that anymore 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.320
 very on time so they cross more than 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.320
 nothing here the low 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.120
 and little by little they will grab him then 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.940
 I hope you liked it and I hope 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.389
 then upload some more things and if 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.180
 there you have doubts therefore with pleasure for 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:14.480
 upload some tutorials to help them 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.480
 good, goodbye
