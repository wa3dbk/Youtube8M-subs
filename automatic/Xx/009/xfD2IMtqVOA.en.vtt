of<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.550> biggest<00:04:54.699> fights<00:04:55.000> every<00:04:55.270> single<00:04:55.539> every

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
single year without without question I

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.890 
single year without without question I
think<00:04:58.210> there's<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.389> lot<00:04:58.449> of<00:04:58.509> names<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.870> you

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
think there's a lot of names that you

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.480 
think there's a lot of names that you
can<00:04:59.020> start<00:04:59.169> with<00:04:59.259> a<00:04:59.320> JC<00:04:59.500> Tran<00:04:59.919> a<00:04:59.949> so<00:05:00.220> many<00:05:00.370> that

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
can start with a JC Tran a so many that

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.550 
can start with a JC Tran a so many that
comes<00:05:00.639> to<00:05:00.820> mind<00:05:01.000> but<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.720> also<00:05:01.930> think<00:05:02.320> that<00:05:02.440> the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
comes to mind but I also think that the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950 
comes to mind but I also think that the
biggest<00:05:03.009> omission<00:05:03.639> is<00:05:03.849> kathy<00:05:04.449> liebert<00:05:04.599> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
biggest omission is kathy liebert the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.100 
biggest omission is kathy liebert the
number<00:05:05.410> one<00:05:05.590> female<00:05:05.979> player<00:05:06.340> in<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.550> world

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
spot because of course they are so

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.700 
spot because of course they are so
relevant<00:05:55.570> when<00:05:56.050> they<00:05:56.169> win<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.440> main<00:05:56.590> event

relevant when they win the main event

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.010 
relevant when they win the main event
but<00:05:57.460> a<00:05:57.490> lot<00:05:57.699> of<00:05:57.759> them<00:05:57.940> sort<00:05:58.210> of<00:05:58.270> trail<00:05:58.599> off<00:05:58.780> into

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
but a lot of them sort of trail off into

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.719 
but a lot of them sort of trail off into
obscurity<00:05:59.440> after<00:05:59.770> that<00:05:59.919> so<00:06:00.130> it<00:06:00.430> really

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
obscurity after that so it really

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.820 
obscurity after that so it really
creates<00:06:01.180> a<00:06:01.419> catch-22<00:06:02.050> for<00:06:02.199> these<00:06:02.440> guys<00:06:02.620> so<00:06:02.770> I

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
creates a catch-22 for these guys so I

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.930 
creates a catch-22 for these guys so I
kind<00:06:03.039> of<00:06:03.070> feel<00:06:03.250> for<00:06:03.310> him<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:03.580> wouldn't<00:06:03.610> want<00:06:03.909> to

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
kind of feel for him I wouldn't want to

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.580 
kind of feel for him I wouldn't want to
put<00:06:04.060> this<00:06:04.150> list<00:06:04.330> together<00:06:04.479> all<00:06:05.259> right<00:06:05.380> well<00:06:05.500> on
