00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.620 
a very important factor to it we could
be<00:01:42.509> um<00:01:42.780> seeing<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.939> does<00:01:45.119> make<00:01:45.329> sense

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
be um seeing this now it does make sense

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.080 
be um seeing this now it does make sense
and<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.079> would<00:01:46.320> bring<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.159> lot<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> interesting

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and it would bring a lot of interesting

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
and it would bring a lot of interesting
stuff<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:49.020> halo<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.280> may<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.490> seeing

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
stuff to halo and what we may be seeing

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.399 
stuff to halo and what we may be seeing
in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> next<00:01:51.210> Halo<00:01:51.540> game<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.170> want<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
in the next Halo game I really want to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.499 
in the next Halo game I really want to
see<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.860> does<00:01:53.189> plan<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.030> way<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
see if this does plan out the way that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.980 
see if this does plan out the way that
it<00:01:54.689> should<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
it should or the way that that like this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.469 
it should or the way that that like this
video<00:01:58.350> pretty<00:01:58.740> much<00:01:58.950> explains<00:01:59.460> now<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.270> would

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
video pretty much explains now it would

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.880 
video pretty much explains now it would
bring<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> lot<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.869> controversy<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:01.799> if

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
bring a lot of controversy and then if

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.469 
bring a lot of controversy and then if
do<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> want<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.490> I'll<00:02:02.700> figure<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.149> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
do you want to see I'll figure it out it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.609 
do you want to see I'll figure it out it
probably<00:02:03.630> caused<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> lot<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> problems

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
probably caused a lot of problems

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
probably caused a lot of problems
because<00:02:04.860> Hosie<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.820> pretty<00:02:06.000> much<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> traitor

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
because Hosie is pretty much a traitor

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
because Hosie is pretty much a traitor
and<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.200> would<00:02:07.290> bring<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.530> lot<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> interest

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and that would bring a lot of interest

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.690 
and that would bring a lot of interest
to<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.090> um<00:02:09.539> different<00:02:10.080> topic<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.340> we<00:02:11.520> just
