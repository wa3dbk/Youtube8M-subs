00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.710
 good afternoon with you channel site large 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.539
 shin com i wladislaw marmot 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.520
 and today our guest is Chinese 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.500
 giant is the world 's largest smartphone 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.570
 huawei mail 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 smartphone display as much as 6.1 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.970
 inches made by ps plus technology and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.180
 he is very good bright contrast 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.090
 natural color rendering but alas it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.829
 the resolution is not impressive just 720 on 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.020
 1280 pixels 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.850
 that combined with a huge size 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.739
 display results in a low 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
 to today's standards pixel density 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.670
 so most of the time the pixels 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 can be distinguished with the naked eye 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 especially on the gray background of the interface 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480
 most programs also may not 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 Clearly displayed thin white fonts 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.989
 on black background 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.059
 despite this the screen shows itself 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.809
 good way in real mode 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.149
 operation 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.309
 This is especially noticeable on the street screen 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.860
 Remains quite readable even in bright 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.330
 sunny day the screen viewing angles are not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.100
 they are most likely to complain 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.479
 possible approaching 180 degrees 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 conclusion display topic I want to note 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.909
 that he is good with us is excellent with such 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 display size would be more appropriate 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.320

 expandable memory on 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.520

 about flush with galaxy laptop 2 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.000
 which is not surprising because under the hood here 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.500
 quad- core frequency 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.049

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.200
 in the end I can say that the smartphone to me 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.580
 I liked it and I think that after the start 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.340
 sales he will like 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.020
 to numerous buyers besides i 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.940
 was glad to experiment with more 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.550
 larger display size than my current 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.650
 laptop 2 and I can say that this size 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.360
 I was not scared at all like that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.930
 increasing the crane is only beneficial 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.010
 convenience of working with any type of information 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.410
 of course I would like to have a little 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.910
 reduce the physical size of the smartphone and 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.810
 It seems to me that technically it is quite 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.300
 possibly 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.550
 manufacturing quality of huawei devices 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.530
 is at a competitive level 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.660
 no different from the more famous 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.560
 manufacturers perhaps even surpasses 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.330
 them in some cases smartphones huavei 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.790
 offer the consumer a good play 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.220
 faucet huge battery modern 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.550
 actual iron is just superb 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.440
 sound 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.320
 excellent materials and high-quality assembly 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.720
 and all this for quite an acceptable cost 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.360
 what is holding me back from buying it 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.510
 This device has only two reasons 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.260
 The first is a screen at this size is needed 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.380
 full hd 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.340
 these are my own second second to me 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.169
 huawei chip 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.970
 namely video accelerator which 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.680
 shows poor performance in 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.740
 games shows artifacts 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.150
 texture mappings 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.640
 I hope these problems will be fixed 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.640
 soon for now i'll wait for may 2 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.290
 with you was vladislav marmots and channel 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.290
