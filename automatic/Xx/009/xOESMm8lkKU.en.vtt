that's<00:06:20.490> because<00:06:20.640> you've<00:06:20.820> got<00:06:20.910> to<00:06:21.000> fathom<00:06:21.300> it

out exactly just figuring it out and
then<00:06:24.240> I<00:06:24.300> mean<00:06:24.540> that<00:06:24.690> he<00:06:24.780> came<00:06:24.960> away<00:06:25.050> with<00:06:25.230> no
