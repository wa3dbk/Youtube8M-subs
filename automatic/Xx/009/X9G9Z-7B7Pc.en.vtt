most<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.240> your<00:00:21.359> standard<00:00:21.630> setups<00:00:22.020> are

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
most of your standard setups are

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.040 
most of your standard setups are
designed<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:22.619> 3s<00:00:23.070> well<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> reason<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.539> by

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
designed around 3s well the reason is by

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019 
designed around 3s well the reason is by
going<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> lower<00:00:25.740> kV<00:00:26.189> motor<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.760> higher

going with a lower kV motor and higher

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.970 
going with a lower kV motor and higher
voltage<00:00:27.570> you're<00:00:27.990> able<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> much<00:00:28.769> more

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
voltage you're able to get a much more

this<00:00:33.149> type<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.390> setup<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.260> getting<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
this type of setup and are getting up to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
this type of setup and are getting up to

10 minutes or more flight time depending

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.450 
10 minutes or more flight time depending
on<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.260> type<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.559> head<00:00:37.739> speeds<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.129> set<00:00:38.340> up

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
on what type of head speeds you set up

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
on what type of head speeds you set up
for<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:39.300> only<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.230> 6s<00:00:40.710> setup<00:00:40.980> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
for not only that with the 6s setup you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.220 
for not only that with the 6s setup you
will<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.550> tons<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.239> power<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
will have tons of power so the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
will have tons of power so the
performance<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.070> upgrade<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.700> well<00:00:44.910> as

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
performance is an upgrade and as well as

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.760 
performance is an upgrade and as well as
lower<00:00:45.450> current<00:00:45.870> draw<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.230> translates<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
lower current draw which translates to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.250 
lower current draw which translates to
the<00:00:46.860> longer<00:00:47.129> flight<00:00:47.340> times<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:48.329> these<00:00:48.899> packs

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the longer flight times now these packs

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
the longer flight times now these packs
are<00:00:49.530> designed<00:00:49.559> specifically<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> fit

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
are designed specifically to fit

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
are designed specifically to fit
helicopters<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> 450<00:00:52.170> class<00:00:52.289> such<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:52.710> an

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
