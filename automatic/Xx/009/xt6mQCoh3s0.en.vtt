00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:14.210
This is a push-back pallet racking system
where as the name suggest, the pallets are

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.259
pushed back by the next pallet

00:00:16.259 --> 00:03:07.140
being put onto the racking - as we will now
demonstrate.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.900
The way that it works is, the first pallet
gets positioned at the front, the second pallet

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.870
pushes the first pallet

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.361
back and then the third pallet pushes the
first and second pallets back and so on and

00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:25.700
so forth. This system is four

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.230
lanes wide and four pallets deep and each
pallet is pushed back on an individual trolley

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.680
which extends for each

00:03:37.680 --> 00:04:30.940
additional pallet.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:05:28.540
So there we are left with three pallets. So
each time you take on eout or put one in they

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.870
are always at the front for

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.660
easy access.
