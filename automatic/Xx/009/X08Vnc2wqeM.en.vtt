seen<00:00:25.609> stage<00:00:26.210> 3<00:00:26.480> I<00:00:26.509> remember<00:00:27.050> we<00:00:27.289> really

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589

started doing like character themes so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.560 
started doing like character themes so
during<00:00:30.619> pre-production<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:32.210> have<00:00:32.360> like<00:00:32.540> a

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
during pre-production you have like a

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.660 
during pre-production you have like a
small<00:00:32.930> team<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.110> animators<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:34.040> lead<00:00:34.460> up<00:00:34.579> a

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
character so that means interacting with

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.400 
character so that means interacting with
rigging<00:00:37.609> and<00:00:37.910> with<00:00:38.180> design<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.960> director

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
the rig working with design at this

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.850 
the rig working with design at this
point<00:04:45.570> trying<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.110> like<00:04:46.880> final<00:04:47.880> look<00:04:48.860> recent

with<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:54.830> this<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:55.920> funny<00:04:56.130> cuz<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.490> was<00:04:56.970> like

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
with this this is funny cuz I was like

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.600 
with this this is funny cuz I was like
this<00:04:58.080> is<00:04:58.140> all<00:04:58.380> so<00:04:58.560> p1<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.100> that<00:04:59.250> means<00:04:59.430> it's

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
this is all so p1 so that means it's

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.910 
this is all so p1 so that means it's
very<00:05:00.000> early<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.810> production<00:05:01.140> like<00:05:01.620> in<00:05:01.770> the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
very early in the production like in the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.040 
very early in the production like in the
pre-production<00:05:02.340> process<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.750> character

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
pre-production process so the character

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.510 
pre-production process so the character
is<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.290> little<00:05:04.440> bit<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.620> model<00:05:04.980> right<00:05:05.070> here<00:05:05.130> and

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
is a little bit of model right here and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.820 
is a little bit of model right here and
we<00:05:06.240> didn't<00:05:06.480> have<00:05:06.570> an<00:05:06.750> actor<00:05:07.170> assigned<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.650> him

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
here the character leads had decided

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.240 
here the character leads had decided
that<00:05:40.080> he's<00:05:40.470> supposed<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.710> be<00:05:40.800> like<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:40.950> nerdy

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
sort of nerdiness they were going to

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.780 
sort of nerdiness they were going to
have<00:05:45.660> him<00:05:45.900> always<00:05:46.380> like<00:05:46.530> look<00:05:46.830> up<00:05:47.070> through<00:05:47.700> the

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
have him always like look up through the

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.520 
have him always like look up through the
glasses<00:05:48.030> as<00:05:48.360> if<00:05:48.510> they're<00:05:48.810> kind<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.080> up<00:05:49.230> here

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
glasses as if they're kind of up here

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.400 
glasses as if they're kind of up here
and<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.490> he's<00:05:50.790> like<00:05:51.060> he<00:05:51.900> looks<00:05:52.110> at<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.380> world

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
and so he's like he looks at the world

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.220 
and so he's like he looks at the world
like<00:05:52.740> this<00:05:52.770> you<00:05:53.040> know<00:05:53.790> and<00:05:54.000> I<00:05:54.900> thought<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.169> was

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
like this you know and I thought it was

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.260 
like this you know and I thought it was
just<00:05:55.410> such<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.650> clever<00:05:56.250> idea<00:05:56.430> that<00:05:56.910> really

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
just such a clever idea that really

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.180 
just such a clever idea that really
added<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.630> his<00:05:57.720> character<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.260> have<00:05:58.440> him<00:05:58.740> to

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
added to his character to have him to

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.490 
added to his character to have him to
hold<00:05:59.430> his<00:05:59.520> head<00:05:59.760> a<00:05:59.820> certain<00:06:00.180> way<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:00.500> that's

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
hold his head a certain way so that's

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.540 
hold his head a certain way so that's
the<00:06:01.590> kind<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:01.800> thing<00:06:01.950> that<00:06:01.980> they<00:06:02.250> carefully

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
the kind of thing that they carefully

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.940 
the kind of thing that they carefully
just<00:06:03.000> to<00:06:03.120> do<00:06:03.270> is<00:06:03.419> trying<00:06:03.720> to<00:06:03.780> figure<00:06:03.930> out<00:06:04.050> how

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
just to do is trying to figure out how

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.040 
just to do is trying to figure out how
does<00:06:05.100> this<00:06:05.190> character<00:06:05.669> hold<00:06:06.180> themselves<00:06:06.419> and

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
does this character hold themselves and

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.950 
does this character hold themselves and
how<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.800> use<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:08.490> design<00:06:08.820> in<00:06:09.120> your<00:06:09.390> advantage

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
how to use the design in your advantage

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.840 
how to use the design in your advantage
right<00:06:10.169> like<00:06:10.770> blue<00:06:11.130> for<00:06:11.280> example<00:06:11.610> like<00:06:11.669> you're

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
right like blue for example like you're

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.210 
right like blue for example like you're
saying<00:06:12.120> when<00:06:12.540> you<00:06:12.690> go<00:06:12.810> in<00:06:12.930> profile<00:06:13.320> he's<00:06:13.980> big

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
saying when you go in profile he's big

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.620 
saying when you go in profile he's big
let's<00:06:14.580> say<00:06:14.760> like<00:06:15.060> there's<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.360> very<00:06:15.540> clear

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
let's say like there's a very clear

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.800 
let's say like there's a very clear
slant<00:06:16.380> here<00:06:17.220> so<00:06:17.760> that<00:06:18.060> makes<00:06:18.360> you<00:06:18.570> what<00:06:18.780> a

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
slant here so that makes you what a

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.310 
slant here so that makes you what a
point<00:06:19.940> always<00:06:20.940> you<00:06:21.270> know<00:06:21.390> the<00:06:21.810> head<00:06:22.140> in<00:06:22.290> that

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
point always you know the head in that

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.110 
point always you know the head in that
direction<00:06:22.500> that<00:06:23.010> makes<00:06:23.460> you<00:06:23.550> want<00:06:23.730> to<00:06:23.790> look<00:06:23.970> in

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
direction that makes you want to look in

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.610 
direction that makes you want to look in
that<00:06:24.240> direction<00:06:24.360> like<00:06:24.780> graphical<00:06:25.260> it<00:06:25.350> makes<00:06:25.530> a

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
that direction like graphical it makes a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.100 
that direction like graphical it makes a
lot<00:06:25.710> of<00:06:25.770> sense<00:06:25.860> and<00:06:26.450> to<00:06:27.450> have<00:06:27.630> that<00:06:27.660> ever

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
lot of sense and to have that ever

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.990 
lot of sense and to have that ever
almost<00:06:28.500> you<00:06:28.890> know<00:06:29.010> it's<00:06:29.250> pointing<00:06:29.640> everywhere

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
almost you know it's pointing everywhere

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.420 
almost you know it's pointing everywhere
so<00:06:30.180> it's<00:06:30.330> it's<00:06:30.840> a<00:06:30.930> very<00:06:30.960> cool<00:06:31.290> trade<00:06:31.860> for<00:06:32.160> blue

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
so it's it's a very cool trade for blue

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.370 
so it's it's a very cool trade for blue
for<00:06:32.790> Nigel<00:06:33.120> ethical<00:06:33.510> about<00:06:33.990> it<00:06:34.140> little<00:06:34.290> bit

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
for Nigel ethical about it little bit

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.380 
for Nigel ethical about it little bit
later<00:06:34.590> but<00:06:34.830> one<00:06:35.190> of<00:06:35.310> the<00:06:35.430> key<00:06:35.760> things<00:06:36.060> was<00:06:36.270> the

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
later but one of the key things was the

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.540 
later but one of the key things was the
crest<00:06:36.660> so<00:06:37.020> we<00:06:37.380> did<00:06:37.560> a<00:06:37.590> lot<00:06:37.890> of<00:06:37.950> testing<00:06:38.430> with

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
crest so we did a lot of testing with

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.850 
crest so we did a lot of testing with
the<00:06:38.580> press
