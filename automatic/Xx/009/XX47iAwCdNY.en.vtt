00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:15.309
 little novelty the gotham chad 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.170
 the particularity is that it is the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 big brother of the drop shot minots who 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.250
 had already been released three years ago 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.960
 particularity a leaf in mylar that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.400
 can see inside the a so who 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.830
 gives holographic reflections and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.910
 really impressive light 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.920
 transparent micro stewardship 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.809
 glitter on the back a very condemns 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.880
 very slender that will allow to have 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.320
 associated with the tone of theirs that is 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.050
 still really toned a 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.420
 quite flexible but powerful vibration 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.579
 at a time when we can see the eyes 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.840
 are encrusted in the mass that makes 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.850
 we really have to finish 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.649
 very very realistic that allows to do 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850
 faced with quite complicated situations of 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.640
 fishing entry into clear water 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.280
 I like to do with the address more 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.469
 to pike on this body of water so 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.940
 it is I run it usually close to 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.870
 the border or so on the top of a case 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.399
 meaning since we can be in the place 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.490
 of a body of water with 1,400 a little offbeat 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.159
 I let him go down friends deep 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.829
 after I gently mill for the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.270
 bring back to me that's really 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.219
 prospecting fishing for arms at 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.569
 above weeding understands well that if 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.819
 I never let him down all the time 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.529
 in the herbarium I have nine chances out of ten 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.299
 to harvest grass and therefore less 

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:23.469
 chance to have keys so there I am 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.719
 happy to go above especially 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.799
 cloud is very clear and normally if 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.420
 the fish want, they come up 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.490
 but intercept it presents you two 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.990
 other colors the chartreuse there that is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.759
 really done to fish for either 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 aggressive fish either in the years a 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.950
 little cloudiness and high or color 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.840
 peculiar enough that I use to the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.049
 times in very clear waters but also 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.849
 especially for fish educate on 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.139
 fisheries where there is sand and so that 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.909
 works on ashes as well as 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.229
 on the bars at sea it's really a 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.389
 color that I advise for those who 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.759
 would like to try the awesome part at 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.649
 clear on the bars at sea on the 4th 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.719
 inches and a half and the 3 inches when they 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.700
 are really in the little sprints 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.439
 after the second option we have 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.649
 if we fish on fish that are 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.630
 nice enough we'll go fishing 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.250
 more by doing antilles for 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.250
 their out of larbi a little hot there
