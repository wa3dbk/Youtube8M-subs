00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.360
 now let's talk about the main 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.429
 actions that we 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.139
 can produce using a mouse with 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.900
 using the mouse we can choose and 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.179
 I will move 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.759
 objects ie files folder or window 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.220
 programs single left click 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.529
 the mouse on the object is usually used to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.900
 object selection double click left 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.360
 click on the program icon or on 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 file leads to the launch of the program or 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.859
 to open the file also double click 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.690
 can be used to perform 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.449
 some other actions for example for 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.670
 window open full screen but about this 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.320
 we'll talk a little later for sure 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.120
 on the desktop have any 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.570
 object for example files or icons 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.550
 of programs 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 Well, at least the trash icon at you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 should definitely work out on it 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.790
 let's bring 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.970
 mouse pointer over the trash icon and 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.610
 click the left mouse button you see how 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.710
 icon is highlighted this indicates 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.019
 that we chose this icon and he 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.360
 now we are active if we 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.299
 now we hover over this 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.180
 icon on click the left mouse button and not 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.770
 let's let her go now we're continuing 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.810
 hold down the left mouse button 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.080
 move the pointer in any direction 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.550
 you see how the pointer stretches into 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 in general, and the icon should be let us go 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.650
 left mouse button and trash icon 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.230
 will fall on that place on your desktop on in 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.390
 which was the mouse pointer like that 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.570
 in a simple way you can change the place 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 location of objects on the desktop 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.670
 now let's set the trash icon 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.430
 somewhere for example on his former 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.710
 place and make the trash icons 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.170
 double click i.e. double click 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.909
 left click without pause on this 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.710
 icons opened shopping cart exactly 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.470
 in this way it does 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.600
 double click on the program icon or on 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.909
 file and we will run the program and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.760
 files if we double click on 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.770
 the program icon will start the program 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.960
 if on some arbitrary file then 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.420
 First, the program will start 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.879
 able to work with this file type and 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.920
 then in this program will open itself 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.690
 file where does the computer know which 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.440
 program to open files need 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.629
 run 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.370
 here it is not entirely in the computer but in 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.590
 operating system, we remember already 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.349
 talked about operating systems so 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.200
 here windows is such a warden of yours 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.200
 computer 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.300
 she knows everything and what is where that lies for 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.280
 what is intended and what is it in general 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.440
 when to run this information 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.670
 I give the operating system the programs themselves 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 when installing them 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.810
 when your computer is not collected on it 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.760
 there were no programs at all first 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.959
 the program that you installed on your 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.940
 the computer was an operating system 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.430
 windows since windows 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.110
 responsible for the operation of the entire computer then 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.720
 she has certain rules that 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.739
 Comply with all programs that want 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.019
 work on the computer 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.819
 one of these rules to report 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.380
 operating system which folder on 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.480
 computer program when installing 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.080
 copied my files and with what types 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.599
 of files 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.670
 This program can work therefore 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.630
 when you run any 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.220
 music file 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.470
 operating system without difficulty 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.599
 determines which program is capable with 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.910
 This file works and runs exactly 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.370
 this program is about how windows 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.930
 determines the type of file ie music is 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.829
 video or text we'll talk a little later 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.329
 and now we continue the mouse theme and so I 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.489
 sure double click you already 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.500
 It turns out great but I remember 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.190
 saying that double click and two single 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.889
 flick 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.139
 they cause different actions try 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.450
 the basket icon will make two single 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.100
 click that is wait for a short pause 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.620
 literally one or two seconds between 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.900
 clicks 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.060
 you see what happened you opened 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.980
 fields in which you can change 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.799
 the name of the object so be 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.049
 careful when double clicking 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.579
 if you mix do not double 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.040
 click two single clicks 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.109
 then you will call the name of the object to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.620
 double click editing only 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.980
 open the program accordingly 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.079
 run file 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.989
 so we talked in general 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.910
 now the left mouse button but the mouse 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.829
 there is also a right button which also 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.170
 equally helpful let's bring 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.329
 mouse pointer over the trash icon again and 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.700
 click right mouse button 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.250
 a menu appears this menu is called 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.220
 contextual thing is that the content 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.090
 This menu depends on the object on 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.400
 which you 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.919
 This menu called it depends on 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.610
 context so for example if you on 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.830
 is there any other desktop 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.479
 object file or program icon then 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.360
 try to put a pointer on it 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.069
 mouse click and right click you 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.840
 see the context menu that will be 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.490
 contain completely different items than that 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.800
 which you see now for example on 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.330
 The screens usually have a context menu 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.669
 the teams that most often 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.800
 used with this object 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.169
 so for example the context menu of the object 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.789
 the basket contains the commands that us 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.580
 will open 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.150
 clear or rename rename 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.650
 this object 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.020
 on almost all elements 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.279
 operating system can be called 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.259
 context menu and accordingly 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.500
 get quick access to properties either 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.539
 the settings of this object we already 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.490
 little acquainted with the desktop 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.610
 so try to do the following 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.460
 let's see the mouse pointer in 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.879
 free part of the desktop and click 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.849
 here 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.590
 the right mouse button and here we have a 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.659
 desktop context menu 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.120
 in this menu of focused team 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.539
 which are specific to the worker 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.240
 of the table 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.759
 we'll talk about this in more detail a little 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.550
 a little later now our task was in 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.710
 Generally learn the mouse that is, we are with you 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.550
 studied the right and left mouse buttons and 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.099
 understand what their difference is, well, on this I 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.529
 I suggest to finish this video lesson well 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.060
 and in general, the first day of our training 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.219
 computer literacy 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.409
 well now go to home 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.240
 task and what do you think without practice we 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.750
 nowhere not move therefore everything is like 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.060
 follows 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.289
 from rehearsing from train and 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.289
 will see you tomorrow
