would recommend for everybody to start

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.669 
would recommend for everybody to start
with<00:01:00.370> because<00:01:00.820> this<00:01:01.090> has<00:01:01.329> analog<00:01:02.079> inputs<00:01:02.469> on

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
with because this has analog inputs on

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.290 
with because this has analog inputs on
the<00:01:02.829> side<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.039> you<00:01:03.340> can<00:01:03.460> run<00:01:03.670> your<00:01:03.940> wideband

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
the side that you can run your wideband

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.390 
the side that you can run your wideband
into<00:01:04.690> for<00:01:05.170> example<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:05.740> we<00:01:05.980> always<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.280> to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
into for example so we always like to

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.520 
into for example so we always like to
tune<00:01:06.580> using<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.510> wideband<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.200> kind<00:01:08.440> of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
tune using a wideband and that kind of

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.590 
tune using a wideband and that kind of
is<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.740> nice<00:01:08.980> transition<00:01:09.160> to<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.150> other<00:01:10.330> thing

that<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.070> have<00:01:48.100> one<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.400> these<00:01:48.490> for<00:01:48.730> tuning

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
that you have one of these for tuning

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.580 
that you have one of these for tuning
with<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.450> then<00:01:49.990> you're<00:01:50.110> also<00:01:50.230> going<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.470> need

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
with and then you're also going to need

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.590 
with and then you're also going to need
some<00:01:50.650> accessories<00:01:51.310> such<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:52.300> exhaust

some accessories such as the exhaust
clamp<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:53.230> recommend<00:01:53.710> something<00:01:53.920> like<00:01:54.040> this

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
clamp we recommend something like this

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.430 
clamp we recommend something like this
because<00:01:54.940> it's<00:01:55.270> quick<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.540> easy<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.200> do<00:01:56.410> a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
because it's quick and easy to do a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.230 
because it's quick and easy to do a
sample<00:01:56.800> for<00:01:57.490> your<00:01:57.610> wide<00:01:57.760> open<00:01:58.000> throttle

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
sample for your wide open throttle

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.200 
sample for your wide open throttle
tuning<00:01:58.840> -<00:01:59.800> let's<00:02:00.370> say<00:02:00.460> your<00:02:00.580> buddy<00:02:00.760> comes<00:02:00.970> over

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
tuning - let's say your buddy comes over

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.340 
tuning - let's say your buddy comes over
and<00:02:01.270> says<00:02:01.360> hey<00:02:01.480> let's<00:02:01.600> check<00:02:01.630> how<00:02:01.930> my<00:02:02.080> cars

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
and says hey let's check how my cars

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.900 
and says hey let's check how my cars
running<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:03.100> don't<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:03.490> jack<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.730> the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
running you don't have to jack up the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.120 
running you don't have to jack up the
car<00:02:04.000> down<00:02:04.420> underneath<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.930> weld<00:02:05.560> in<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.830> bung

car down underneath it weld in a bung

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.520 
car down underneath it weld in a bung
and<00:02:06.490> then<00:02:07.030> do<00:02:07.210> everything<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.050> do<00:02:08.349> teach

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
and then do everything now we do teach

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.930 
and then do everything now we do teach
you<00:02:08.679> how<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.830> use<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.129> properly<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.789> can

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
you how to use it properly so you can

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.030 
you how to use it properly so you can
account<00:02:10.149> for<00:02:10.270> things<00:02:10.599> like<00:02:11.379> your<00:02:11.709> catalytic

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
account for things like your catalytic

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.979 
account for things like your catalytic
converters<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.940> whatnot<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.480> measuring<00:02:13.840> at

converters and whatnot and measuring at

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.750 
converters and whatnot and measuring at
the<00:02:14.140> tailpipe<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.860> wide<00:02:15.069> open<00:02:15.099> throttle<00:02:15.459> can

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
the tailpipe so wide open throttle can

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.729 
the tailpipe so wide open throttle can
be<00:02:16.000> measured<00:02:16.689> at<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.900> tailpipe<00:02:17.349> with<00:02:17.560> this

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
be measured at the tailpipe with this

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.289 
be measured at the tailpipe with this
type<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.950> clamp<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.549> quick<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.819> easy<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.269> use

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
type of clamp it's quick and easy to use

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.850 
type of clamp it's quick and easy to use
and<00:02:19.750> we<00:02:19.810> highly<00:02:20.079> recommend<00:02:20.109> it

if<00:02:41.410> you're<00:02:41.800> tuning<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:43.600> way<00:02:43.900> you're<00:02:44.260> going

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
if you're tuning that way you're going

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.260 
if you're tuning that way you're going
to<00:02:44.410> need<00:02:44.530> some<00:02:44.710> extra<00:02:45.100> length<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.970> your<00:02:46.060> cable

we have on our dyno here it's always

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.350 
we have on our dyno here it's always
good<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.130> have<00:02:54.340> an<00:02:54.520> extension<00:02:54.850> because<00:02:55.240> you

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
good to have an extension because you

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.580 
good to have an extension because you
never<00:02:55.480> know<00:02:55.690> which<00:02:55.870> side<00:02:56.140> you're<00:02:56.170> going<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.530> do

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
never know which side you're going to do

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.350 
never know which side you're going to do
the<00:02:56.650> sample<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.400> you're<00:02:57.850> not<00:02:57.880> going<00:02:58.270> to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
the sample on and you're not going to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.880 
the sample on and you're not going to
want<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.570> move<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:58.960> around<00:02:59.290> once<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.560> get<00:02:59.770> it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
want to move this around once you get it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.010 
want to move this around once you get it
