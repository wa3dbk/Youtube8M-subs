of lift up like this see once you got

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.420 
of lift up like this see once you got
the<00:00:41.219> top<00:00:41.370> clubs<00:00:41.550> out<00:00:41.960> just<00:00:42.960> pick<00:00:43.079> IV<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:44.040> gentle

the top clubs out just pick IV be gentle
with<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.170> if<00:00:46.170> you're<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.620> know

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
with it because if you're not you know

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.240 
with it because if you're not you know
life<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.250> probably<00:00:47.399> break<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.820> um<00:00:49.250> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
life you will probably break it um and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
life you will probably break it um and
then<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.579> key<00:00:50.940> keyboard<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.570> comes<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.870> like

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
then a key keyboard just comes up like

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.389 
then a key keyboard just comes up like
that<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> thieve<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.690> um<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> do

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
that now a thieve this um we need to do

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.529 
that now a thieve this um we need to do
is<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.640> need<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:59.000> slightly<00:01:00.000> damp<00:01:00.359> cloth

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
is you need to get a slightly damp cloth

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
is you need to get a slightly damp cloth
now<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.469> wet<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.829> because

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
now really really wet one because

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
now really really wet one because
they're<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.850> don't<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> miss<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
they're not you don't want to miss the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.759 
they're not you don't want to miss the
surface<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> can't<00:01:04.619> really

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
surface up not that you can't really

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
surface up not that you can't really
miss<00:01:04.890> many<00:01:05.100> circuits<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> it's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
miss many circuits up in here but it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.630 
miss many circuits up in here but it's
just<00:01:07.470> pretty<00:01:07.680> much<00:01:07.740> plastic<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.400> pretty

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
just pretty much plastic so it's pretty

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.950 
just pretty much plastic so it's pretty
safe<00:01:08.790> too<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> use<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.880> cloth<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
safe too so I use a cloth on there and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.929 
safe too so I use a cloth on there and
damp<00:01:13.170> off<00:01:13.320> anyway<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.189> kind<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> wipe

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
damp off anyway and just kind of wipe

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.260 
damp off anyway and just kind of wipe
around<00:01:16.220> just<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> coke<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
around just with the coke is all the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
around just with the coke is all the
