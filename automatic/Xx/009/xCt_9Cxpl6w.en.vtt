00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.490
 hello to all this is pesos bob I 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.250
 am in the company of him 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.259
 how is lulu telling him you do that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.849
 means in the language of everything or to 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.279
 him 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.349
 good so in fact so here I am going to you 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 take is represented by a tutorial 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.170
 devoted to how to equip very quickly 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.730
 in minecraft 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.519
 so you have to know that I've caught 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.620
 this idea on video that I watched 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.269
 a video of seeing an octopus plant 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.229
 then I put on a little super guy 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.989
 friendly who expresses himself very well who acquit 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:47.820
 which is very clear in his videos he has 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.500
 looks very young but frankly he has 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.720
 a lot more talent than some who 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.769
 are much older and so I 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.549
 would like to advertise for him 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.860
 is called 9.9 movie and I will put the link 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.689
 anyway on my video because 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.070
 these dikes try to him it's not about 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.460
 me even though the flu and on someone 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.559
 else 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.260
 whatever happens it's him that I 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.600
 fell first so here's how 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 equip fast is against him by then 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 stayed in bed 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 because he can see little ones 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.619
 bugs compared to what I did so 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.850
 as you can see I'm in 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.219
 creative fashion but whatever happens 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.530
 walk in survival mode so I'm not 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.119
 not equipped I have nothing and everything so 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.119
 we will OEMs 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.659
 and that's it took like a time and ad 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.170
 I am equipped what is in place 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.170
 I even have tears 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.990
 that's it and as you can see I 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.009
 am totally equipped that it was 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.690
 extremely fast 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.640
 so I will show you everything 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.090
 just the little tutorial how 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.100
 do this is super simple him you 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.320
 can follow me there will be more bugs 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.299
 come on let's go let's go with the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.770
 company of him 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.470
 that's the thing that will finally give 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.110
 it is extremely compact 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.850
 I looked on finally I do not have 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.490
 found videos the facts by myself 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.830
 I thought a little bit it's me who 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.380
 finally found it's me no yes it's 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.600
 me who really did that alone 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.410
 meaning to look at tutorials since it 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.489
 was not there really was not 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.010
 simply logic question 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.180
 so we will start his request not 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.569
 a lot of things it's going to be very 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.580
 quick 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.120
 you simply put things 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.720
 like that you do it the way I do 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.280
 I'll do the blocks where I put them 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.650
 wanted to ask 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.240
 you use so use there is one 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.510
 of cube any of which I put 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.940
 snow that's pretty easter 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.980
 pressure here you take torches from 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.860
 restaurant you put here is all 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.910
 we'll just take the red stone 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.020
 that we are going to place this way is 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.610
 here at the bottom do not forget that's next 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.260
 we will place after without the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.190
 destroy because they have to be placed 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.560
 loops 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.790
 so we will place so we need 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.360
 distributors we need four here we 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.100
 will place another here 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.670
 to place the writers one must do 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.190
 this after breaking it's all stupid in 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.800
 done on the contrary in the good sense as well 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.610
 possible in a good way a goal 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.880
 him 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.990
 it's going to bother me we're going to go like this 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.730
 that's fine as these do not have 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.260
 very well here 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.260
 then we will put the right fear 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.460
 we will put the small dropper then the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.350
 drop hours must be put this way 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.420
 the 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.660
 that's how it's the drop hours 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.470
 do not confuse too much fear here you are 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:04.620
 put that way your mouth to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.220
 down then we follow 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.390
 I do not do any nonsense that here we go 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:18.109
 put here the throats of reed to 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.109
 little one is rehearing then we go m 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.070
 a little trick here 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.170
 so it can break 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.090
 you said it's extremely compact 1 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.230
 it's super simple case it's very 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.650
 fast it does not require a lot of 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.870
 resources 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.810
 it does not serve much either 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.270
 time 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:40.889
 we're going to say it's for fun for 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:45.230
 fun so y'a good this said so he goes 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.230
 then have to go up a notch 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.380
 here you are 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.879
 at worst 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.400
 there like that that's how it is like 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:03.099
 that like that actually you do like I 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.449
 just made a tube 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.430
 the double to 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.659
 you have to know of course I do not have 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:18.069
 specified I'm sorry it's 1 2 3 2 of 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:20.830
 wide 2 of depth and then 1 2 3 4 5 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.840
 5 languor excuse me it's true I 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:29.830
 did not specify I should have I am 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:31.840
 sorry that's ok so we did this 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.909
 then you take repeaters you 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.930
 just need two repeaters 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:44.260
 here are two transponders it is necessary that 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.169
 I put a right behind 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.469
 this 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.469
 no 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.130
 here 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.729
 you take a repeater already the first 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.370
 follows as those ci see there from this 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.050
 evening of course then ben this is it 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.330
 finished we ended there I told you this is 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:11.039
 super fast we are there red stone and you 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.840
 put them the lure of the wages to him it is 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:17.099
 puts exactly where you need not with his 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.969
 old that a good comes to him here at the foot 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.159
 he does not care 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.049
 lulu hughes is here good it's true he 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.429
 made sweet 

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:30.429
 yes shit I did sit down okay 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.429
 cork 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.819
 he comes here from the check veil 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.210
 so so that's so 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.930
 normally it should be functional 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.350
 listen we'll test the little wolves 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:49.170
 so 3 tested 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:52.050
 already we put ourselves with the tree so tears 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:56.250
 we put it up there 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:59.909
 oops I'm sorry we 're doing it again 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.930
 it's not there then we'll put it 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:06.360
 so in the home inventory I'm going 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.569
 put the stuff there is no there is 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.550
 no novels of 200 you can do 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.039
 anything as long as you 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.590
 you put everything you need 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.060
 to equip it is good good here 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:23.909
 normally it's its numbers 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:26.690
 I put myself like this here I am 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.690
 totally equipped 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.759
 yes it's really fast 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:33.860
 so I would put nothing links that 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.210
 gave me the idea of ​​this stuff is not useful 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.149
 to a lot but who is really
