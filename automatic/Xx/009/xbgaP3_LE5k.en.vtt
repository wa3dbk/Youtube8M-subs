pretty because it's kind of a little

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.179

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
of room inside for a small wristlet so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
of room inside for a small wristlet so

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that's actually my first wristlet

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.230 
that's actually my first wristlet
because<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:00.240> general<00:02:00.869> I'm<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:02.280> big<00:02:02.880> fan<00:02:02.909> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
because in general I'm a very big fan of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.930 
because in general I'm a very big fan of
large<00:02:03.840> purses<00:02:04.469> so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.610 

and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:08.320> they<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:09.300> found<00:02:10.300> this<00:02:10.960> I<00:02:11.290> think<00:02:11.500> it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
and then they I found this I think it's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.370 
and then they I found this I think it's
a<00:02:11.710> ponytail<00:02:12.310> holder<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.990> thought<00:02:14.230> the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
a ponytail holder but I thought the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.910 
a ponytail holder but I thought the
pattern<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.040> color<00:02:15.280> was<00:02:15.580> cute<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:17.500> don't

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
pattern and color was cute so I don't

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.350 
pattern and color was cute so I don't
think<00:02:18.070> I'm<00:02:18.160> going<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.340> tie<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.820> my<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.210> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
think I'm going to tie this in my in a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.910 
think I'm going to tie this in my in a
ponytail<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.440> would<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.710> kind

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
ponytail so I think that would be kind

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.090 
ponytail so I think that would be kind
of<00:02:21.010> lame<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.450> i<00:02:22.450> would<00:02:23.140> probably<00:02:23.440> tie<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.740> on

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
of lame but i would probably tie this on

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.840 
of lame but i would probably tie this on
to<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.390> handle<00:02:25.600> one<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.050> my<00:02:26.140> purses<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.820> be

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
to the handle one of my purses to be

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.550 
to the handle one of my purses to be
cute<00:02:28.330> probably<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> little

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
cute probably just you know as a little
