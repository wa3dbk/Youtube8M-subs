00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
so it's a very special time authorities

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
so it's a very special time authorities
say<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.729> handling<00:01:33.240> everything

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
say that they are handling everything

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960 
say that they are handling everything
but<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:35.310> hard<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> find

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
but it's it's really very hard to find

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.249 
but it's it's really very hard to find
that<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> railway<00:01:36.810> stations

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that when you go to the railway stations

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.780 
that when you go to the railway stations
and<00:01:37.439> seeing<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> catch<00:01:38.189> stations<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and seeing the catch stations and the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.670 
and seeing the catch stations and the
people<00:01:39.060> waiting<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.540> train<00:01:39.780> we're<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.200> now

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
people waiting the train we're on now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
people waiting the train we're on now
actually<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> turn<00:01:41.909> people<00:01:41.970> away<00:01:42.329> they

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
actually I have to turn people away they

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
actually I have to turn people away they
bought<00:01:42.869> tickets<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.439> journey<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> had

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
bought tickets for this journey and had

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.580 
bought tickets for this journey and had
to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.520> sent<00:01:45.390> away<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> work<00:01:45.869> another<00:01:46.320> platform

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to be sent away to work another platform

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.560 
to be sent away to work another platform
to<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:46.950> another<00:01:47.189> train<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.790> shows<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to get another train so it shows that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.289 
to get another train so it shows that
maybe<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.619> chaos<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.189> still<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.790> although

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
maybe the chaos is still here although

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.040 
maybe the chaos is still here although
they<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.600> trying<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.409> come<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.619> with

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
they are trying to come up with

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.080 
they are trying to come up with
I<00:01:53.080> knew<00:01:53.620> sisters<00:01:53.950> one<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.280> ideas<00:01:54.580> is<00:01:54.850> to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
I knew sisters one of the ideas is to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.810 
I knew sisters one of the ideas is to
come<00:01:55.300> up<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.630> an<00:01:55.840> air<00:01:56.500> air<00:01:57.100> line<00:01:57.370> style

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
come up with an air air line style

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.550 
come up with an air air line style
tickets<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.420> person's<00:01:58.990> name<00:01:59.170> will<00:01:59.320> be<00:01:59.410> on<00:01:59.470> the

tickets so person's name will be on the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.950 
tickets so person's name will be on the
ticket<00:01:59.860> and<00:01:59.980> also<00:02:00.550> their<00:02:00.730> identification<00:02:01.120> so

ticket and also their identification so
that<00:02:02.380> would<00:02:02.530> stop<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.190> black<00:02:03.400> marking<00:02:03.910> in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
that would stop the black marking in

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.750 
that would stop the black marking in
tickets<00:02:04.360> that's<00:02:04.480> developed<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.290> China<00:02:05.760> which

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
tickets that's developed in China which

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.520 
tickets that's developed in China which
will<00:02:06.940> see<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.480> tickets<00:02:07.780> sell<00:02:07.990> being<00:02:08.260> sold

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
will see that tickets sell being sold

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.750 
will see that tickets sell being sold
for<00:02:08.650> something<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.070> four<00:02:09.340> or<00:02:09.550> five<00:02:09.580> times

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
for something like four or five times

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.000 
for something like four or five times
their<00:02:10.510> face<00:02:10.720> value<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.650> causing<00:02:11.860> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
their face value and this is causing a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.330 
their face value and this is causing a
problem

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
problem

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.830 
problem
it's<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.640> bearing<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.000> mind<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.510> lot<00:02:13.570> of

network will be improved in years to
come<00:02:29.860> at<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.190> moment<00:02:30.490> it's<00:02:30.580> only<00:02:30.720> 77,000
