00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
I'm going to show you how to build a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.050 
I'm going to show you how to build a
decent<00:00:13.769> mob<00:00:14.250> grinder<00:00:14.719> that<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:17.060> fairly

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
decent mob grinder that is a fairly

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.420 
decent mob grinder that is a fairly
resource<00:00:19.130> fairly<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.400> resource<00:00:20.910> demanding

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.320 

step<00:00:26.430> 1<00:00:27.470> make<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> 4<00:00:28.859> by<00:00:29.039> 4<00:00:29.070> base<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
step 1 make a 4 by 4 base like this and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.010 
step 1 make a 4 by 4 base like this and
place<00:00:31.320> 4<00:00:31.710> stone<00:00:32.130> slabs<00:00:32.579> above<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.899> be

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
place 4 stone slabs above it it can be

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.770 
place 4 stone slabs above it it can be
any<00:00:34.260> type<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:35.000> thing<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.050> yeah

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
any type of thing just yeah

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.119 
any type of thing just yeah
step<00:00:39.780> 2<00:00:40.230> follow<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:42.200> it<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.920> not

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
step 2 follow as I do it is not

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.619 
step 2 follow as I do it is not
necessary<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> fill<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> corners<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:47.629> if

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
necessary to fill in the corners if a if

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.310 
necessary to fill in the corners if a if
you're<00:00:48.840> trying<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> save<00:00:49.469> some<00:00:49.680> resources<00:00:50.160> but

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
you're trying to save some resources but

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.020 
you're trying to save some resources but
build<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:53.390> 21<00:00:54.390> blocks<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> 3/4<00:00:56.640> all

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
build up 21 blocks for this is 3/4 all

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.540 
build up 21 blocks for this is 3/4 all
the<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> 21<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.170> every<00:00:59.039> single<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.870> step<00:01:00.870> 3

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
the way to 21 on every single one step 3

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.370 
the way to 21 on every single one step 3
get<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> top<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.979> build<00:01:05.659> 7<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
get to the top here and build 7 from the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.490 
get to the top here and build 7 from the
edge<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> total<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.290> 8<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:12.500> way

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
edge so there will be a total of 8 a way

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.030 
edge so there will be a total of 8 a way
to<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.369> by<00:01:15.299> sneaking<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.830> won't

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
to do this is by sneaking so you won't

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
to do this is by sneaking so you won't
following<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> won't<00:01:18.210> fall<00:01:18.390> off<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
following off so you won't fall off the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:28.039 
following off so you won't fall off the
edge<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.400> build<00:01:22.189> step<00:01:23.189> 4<00:01:23.900> do<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:27.049> build

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
edge and build step 4 do as I do build

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
edge and build step 4 do as I do build
walls<00:01:28.560> along<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:30.000> edges<00:01:30.600> whoops<00:01:30.960> along<00:01:32.030> the

the signs they're just for measuring
purposes

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
purposes

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.520 
purposes
do<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.930> all<00:02:14.080> four<00:02:14.110> sides<00:02:15.990> step<00:02:16.990> 6

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
do this on all four sides step 6

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.260 
do this on all four sides step 6
the<00:02:18.040> step<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.460> will<00:02:18.580> have<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> build<00:02:19.090> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
the step you will have to build the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.570 
the step you will have to build the
walls<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:20.050> will<00:02:20.200> take<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.410> while<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:20.920> be

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
walls and this will take a while so be

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.370 
walls and this will take a while so be
prepared<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:23.290> walls<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.100> will<00:02:25.000> be<00:02:25.380> not

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
prepared the walls of this will be not

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.500 
prepared the walls of this will be not
as<00:02:26.560> high<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.100> walls<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.820> case<00:02:31.090> it'll

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
as high the walls and in this case it'll

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.480 
as high the walls and in this case it'll
be<00:02:31.720> eight<00:02:32.560> blocks<00:02:32.950> high<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:36.130> will<00:02:36.250> have

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
be eight blocks high and you will have

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.630 
be eight blocks high and you will have
to<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:39.310> surround<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.120> whole<00:02:40.270> place<00:02:40.510> with

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
to just surround the whole place with

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
to just surround the whole place with
whatever<00:02:42.640> building<00:02:42.940> material<00:02:43.510> you're<00:02:43.870> using

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
whatever building material you're using

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.180 
whatever building material you're using
the<00:02:45.430> three<00:02:45.970> favorite<00:02:46.620> building<00:02:47.620> materials<00:02:48.040> I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the three favorite building materials I

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.000 
the three favorite building materials I
use<00:02:48.430> are<00:02:49.680> wood<00:02:50.880> snow<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.180> stone<00:02:53.020> actually

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
use are wood snow and stone actually

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.720 
use are wood snow and stone actually
four<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.840> fourth<00:02:56.080> one<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.320> netherrack<00:02:56.890> so

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
four and the fourth one is netherrack so

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.330 
four and the fourth one is netherrack so
just<00:02:58.060> build<00:02:58.480> up<00:03:01.620> step<00:03:02.620> 7

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
just build up step 7

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.430 
just build up step 7
we've<00:03:04.000> gone<00:03:04.240> pretty<00:03:04.480> far<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.140> we're<00:03:05.320> almost

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
we've gone pretty far and we're almost

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.080 
we've gone pretty far and we're almost
done<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.040> hang<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:07.150> one<00:03:07.330> sec<00:03:07.570> yeah<00:03:09.090> now

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
done so hang out just one sec yeah now

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.420 
done so hang out just one sec yeah now
we're<00:03:10.300> gonna<00:03:10.450> build<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.810> second<00:03:11.430> spawning

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
we're gonna build the second spawning

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.390 
we're gonna build the second spawning
platform<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.420> will<00:03:13.660> be<00:03:13.810> three<00:03:14.110> blocks<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.650> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
platform it will be three blocks of the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.900 
platform it will be three blocks of the
first<00:03:15.670> one<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.420> Enderman<00:03:16.870> can<00:03:17.050> spawn<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:18.160> yep

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
first one so Enderman can spawn so yep

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.610 
first one so Enderman can spawn so yep
and<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.170> same<00:03:20.380> thing

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
and it's the same thing

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.030 
and it's the same thing
build<00:03:20.920> four<00:03:21.580> 8x8<00:03:22.800> spawning<00:03:23.800> platforms<00:03:24.400> and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
build four 8x8 spawning platforms and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.440 
build four 8x8 spawning platforms and
yeah<00:03:30.270> this<00:03:31.270> is<00:03:31.450> an<00:03:31.570> optional<00:03:32.170> step<00:03:33.180> let's<00:03:34.180> say

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
yeah this is an optional step let's say

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.850 
yeah this is an optional step let's say
step<00:03:34.900> 7<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:36.209> okay<00:03:38.190> okay<00:03:39.190> it's<00:03:39.489> for<00:03:40.000> trap<00:03:40.270> doors

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
step 7 I okay okay it's for trap doors

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.040 
step 7 I okay okay it's for trap doors
you<00:03:41.860> don't<00:03:41.890> need<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.430> have<00:03:42.489> trap<00:03:42.820> doors<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:43.420> if

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
you don't need to have trap doors but if

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.100 
you don't need to have trap doors but if
you<00:03:44.680> put<00:03:45.160> trap<00:03:45.430> doors<00:03:45.700> on<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.570> edges<00:03:46.930> and

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
you put trap doors on the edges and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.460 
you put trap doors on the edges and
close<00:03:47.590> them<00:03:47.980> they<00:03:48.820> act<00:03:49.180> I'll<00:03:49.510> open<00:03:49.989> them<00:03:50.110> they

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
close them they act I'll open them they

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.180 
close them they act I'll open them they
actually<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:52.660> makes<00:03:52.900> another<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.920> makes

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
actually it makes another that makes

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.860 
actually it makes another that makes
more<00:03:54.400> spawning<00:03:54.700> area<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:56.620> empty<00:03:57.100> space

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
more spawning area so this empty space

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.410 
more spawning area so this empty space
becomes<00:03:58.870> spawning<00:03:59.260> area<00:03:59.530> but<00:04:00.220> this<00:04:00.519> takes<00:04:01.239> a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
becomes spawning area but this takes a

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.350 
becomes spawning area but this takes a
lot<00:04:01.570> of<00:04:01.630> wood<00:04:01.959> especially<00:04:02.590> on<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.489> Super's

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
lot of wood especially on the Super's

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.780 
lot of wood especially on the Super's
honor<00:04:04.630> that<00:04:05.350> will<00:04:05.769> be<00:04:05.920> in<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> description

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
honor that will be in the description

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.820 
honor that will be in the description
the<00:04:07.450> link<00:04:07.480> will<00:04:07.810> be<00:04:07.930> in<00:04:07.959> description<00:04:08.050> below

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
the link will be in description below

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.960 
the link will be in description below
and<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:10.420> it's<00:04:10.720> not<00:04:10.870> necessary<00:04:11.530> but<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:11.970> does

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
and so it's not necessary but it does

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.199 
and so it's not necessary but it does
increase<00:04:13.269> spawning<00:04:13.690> rates<00:04:15.900> step<00:04:16.900> 8

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
increase spawning rates step 8

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.110 
increase spawning rates step 8
place<00:04:19.989> water<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:21.430> should<00:04:21.459> be<00:04:21.699> simple<00:04:22.060> enough

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
place water it should be simple enough

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.540 
place water it should be simple enough
just<00:04:22.800> don't<00:04:23.800> fall<00:04:24.100> and<00:04:24.340> die<00:04:24.910> here<00:04:25.630> as<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:27.280> have

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
just don't fall and die here as I have

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.540 
just don't fall and die here as I have
done<00:04:27.819> many<00:04:28.150> times<00:04:28.770> place<00:04:29.770> two<00:04:29.949> buckets<00:04:30.370> of

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
done many times place two buckets of

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.200 
done many times place two buckets of
water<00:04:33.060> whoops<00:04:34.060> almost<00:04:34.419> died<00:04:35.069> so<00:04:36.069> since<00:04:36.910> we<00:04:37.060> did

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
water whoops almost died so since we did

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.029 
water whoops almost died so since we did
eight<00:04:37.479> blocks<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.289> water<00:04:38.470> stops<00:04:38.860> right

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
eight blocks so the water stops right

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.589 
eight blocks so the water stops right
there<00:04:39.069> so<00:04:39.370> when<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.639> mob<00:04:39.819> gets<00:04:40.120> there<00:04:40.360> it'll

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
there so when the mob gets there it'll

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.770 
there so when the mob gets there it'll
fall<00:04:40.930> down<00:04:41.169> and<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:42.580> won't<00:04:42.789> jump<00:04:43.120> out<00:04:43.300> because

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
fall down and it won't jump out because

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.170 
fall down and it won't jump out because
it's<00:04:43.960> two<00:04:44.110> blocks<00:04:44.259> high<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:45.280> do<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.759> on<00:04:45.819> all

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
it's two blocks high so do that on all

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:56.180 
it's two blocks high so do that on all
four<00:04:48.599> streams<00:04:53.340> after<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.759> place<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.509> water

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
four streams after you place the water

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.999 
four streams after you place the water
but<00:04:57.190> step<00:04:57.820> nine<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.330> last<00:04:58.539> step<00:04:58.840> which<00:04:59.380> is<00:04:59.410> to

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
but step nine the last step which is to

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.700 
but step nine the last step which is to
fill<00:05:00.190> in<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.340> ceiling<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.440> this<00:05:02.440> should<00:05:02.620> be

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
fill in the ceiling and this should be

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.110 
fill in the ceiling and this should be
simple<00:05:03.070> enough<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.400> explain<00:05:03.699> boil<00:05:03.940> take

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
simple enough to explain boil take

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.310 
simple enough to explain boil take
awhile<00:05:04.270> just<00:05:05.190> fill<00:05:06.190> in<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.430> whole<00:05:06.729> ceiling

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
awhile just fill in the whole ceiling

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.420 
awhile just fill in the whole ceiling
fill<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.500> in<00:05:08.880> good<00:05:09.880> luck<00:05:13.470> congratulations<00:05:14.470> you

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
fill it in good luck congratulations you

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.980 
fill it in good luck congratulations you
have<00:05:15.460> just<00:05:15.880> built<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.659> simple<00:05:17.789> non<00:05:18.990> resource

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
have just built a simple non resource

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.159 
have just built a simple non resource
demanding<00:05:20.560> well<00:05:20.949> log<00:05:21.819> of<00:05:22.060> resources<00:05:22.659> but<00:05:22.810> not

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
demanding well log of resources but not

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.350
