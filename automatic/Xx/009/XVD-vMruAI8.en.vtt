whoa that's not the stabilizing anything

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.929 
whoa that's not the stabilizing anything
right<00:04:13.900> there<00:04:14.519> overexposure<00:04:15.519> doesn't<00:04:15.819> really

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
right there overexposure doesn't really

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.189 
right there overexposure doesn't really
seem<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.150> be<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.269> problem<00:04:16.419> there<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.659> bit<00:04:16.840> there

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
seem to be a problem there a bit there

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.689 
seem to be a problem there a bit there
the<00:04:17.470> image<00:04:17.680> gang<00:04:17.829> and<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.010> non-existent

makes<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.500> video<00:04:20.620> jump<00:04:21.220> oh<00:04:21.430> well<00:04:21.669> we're

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
makes the video jump oh well we're

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.939 
makes the video jump oh well we're
necklace<00:04:22.930> when<00:04:23.199> you're<00:04:23.320> running<00:04:23.470> around<00:04:23.620> I

trailing low-light footage is average
it's<00:04:29.020> grainy<00:04:29.259> sort<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.710> blur<00:04:29.860> even<00:04:30.159> the<00:04:30.220> light

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
it's grainy sort of blur even the light

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.070 
it's grainy sort of blur even the light
doesn't<00:04:30.490> really<00:04:30.789> help<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.090> much<00:04:31.389> okay<00:04:31.900> what

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
doesn't really help that much okay what

if you've got just the right light they

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.040 
if you've got just the right light they
look<00:04:36.909> pretty<00:04:37.030> good<00:04:37.150> most<00:04:37.599> of<00:04:37.659> our<00:04:37.690> pictures

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
look pretty good most of our pictures

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.899 
look pretty good most of our pictures
looked<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.260> tad<00:04:38.409> over<00:04:38.740> exposed<00:04:39.130> or<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.639> little

bit<00:04:40.000> soft<00:04:40.270> low-light<00:04:40.900> photos<00:04:41.050> aren't<00:04:41.349> bad<00:04:41.529> but

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
bit soft low-light photos aren't bad but

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.230 
bit soft low-light photos aren't bad but
but<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.370> really<00:04:42.520> better<00:04:42.669> keep<00:04:42.909> that<00:04:42.940> steady

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
but you really better keep that steady

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.860 
but you really better keep that steady

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.530 
deal hundred and ten bucks on nuway just
cheaper<00:04:48.070> than<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.220> flip<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.880> um<00:04:49.120> what's

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
cheaper than the flip it is um what's

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.610 
cheaper than the flip it is um what's
the<00:04:49.660> verdict<00:04:49.900> different<00:04:50.140> price<00:04:50.320> here's<00:04:50.590> the

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
the verdict different price here's the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.780 
the verdict different price here's the
thing<00:04:50.740> we're<00:04:50.890> going<00:04:51.010> to<00:04:51.070> give<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.280> buy<00:04:51.460> and

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
thing we're going to give it a buy and

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.690 
thing we're going to give it a buy and
here's<00:04:52.570> why<00:04:52.780> we<00:04:53.590> think<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.890> flip<00:04:54.100> is<00:04:54.250> better

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
here's why we think the flip is better

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.190 
here's why we think the flip is better
but<00:04:55.180> it's<00:04:55.450> also<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.870> be<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.990> lot<00:04:56.170> more

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
but it's also can be a lot more

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.140 
but it's also can be a lot more
expensive<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.670> good<00:04:57.880> cheap

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
expensive and this is a good cheap

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.300 
expensive and this is a good cheap
