00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
sort of uneventful term because the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.620 
sort of uneventful term because the
Confederate<00:00:14.490> troops<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> East<00:00:15.299> which

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
Confederate troops in the East which

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.930 
Confederate troops in the East which
seem<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.289> been<00:00:16.460> invaded<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.699> southern

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
seem to have been invaded in southern

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
seem to have been invaded in southern
Pennsylvania<00:00:18.180> retreated<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.500> can't<00:00:19.770> even

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
Pennsylvania retreated and I can't even

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.679 
Pennsylvania retreated and I can't even
see<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.250> anymore<00:00:20.520> they've<00:00:20.880> gone<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
see them anymore they've gone into the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019 
see them anymore they've gone into the
fog<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:21.990> war<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.550> these<00:00:23.670> troops

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
fog of war so they have these troops

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
fog of war so they have these troops
here<00:00:24.240> covering<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> Shenandoah<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.279> no

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
here covering the Shenandoah but no

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
here covering the Shenandoah but no
longer<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.180> troops<00:00:27.420> threatening

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
longer do they have troops threatening

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.960 
longer do they have troops threatening
pencil<00:00:28.310> Pittsburgh<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.519> anything<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
pencil Pittsburgh or anything like that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.040 
pencil Pittsburgh or anything like that
so<00:00:30.890> I<00:00:32.090> expect<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.420> sort<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> quiet

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
so I expect this to be sort of a quiet

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.450 
so I expect this to be sort of a quiet
term<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.649> we'll<00:00:34.980> find<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:35.750> my<00:00:37.190> troops<00:00:38.190> here

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
term but we'll find out my troops here

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.270 
term but we'll find out my troops here
in<00:00:38.610> Pittsburgh<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.600> raised<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.350> few<00:00:41.010> turns

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
in Pittsburgh that I raised a few turns

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
in Pittsburgh that I raised a few turns
ago<00:00:41.460> many<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.480> arrived<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.230> I've

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
ago many of them have arrived and I've

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.180 
ago many of them have arrived and I've
ordered<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> few<00:00:44.309> more<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> their<00:00:45.270> way<00:00:45.420> so

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
ordered a few more to be on their way so
I'm<00:00:47.190> comfortable<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.090> stack<00:00:48.420> now

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
I'm comfortable with this stack now

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
I'm comfortable with this stack now
defending<00:00:49.320> Pittsburgh<00:00:49.860> especially<00:00:50.460> because

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
defending Pittsburgh especially because

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.920 
defending Pittsburgh especially because
there<00:00:51.090> isn't<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> Confederate

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
there isn't going to be a Confederate

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
there isn't going to be a Confederate
unit<00:00:52.440> threatening<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.250> I'm<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.520> move

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
unit threatening it so I'm going to move

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.529 
unit threatening it so I'm going to move
McDowell<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.739> his<00:00:55.739> four<00:00:56.100> brigades<00:00:56.280> down<00:00:57.270> here

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

McDowell and his four brigades down here
to<00:00:57.660> Grafton<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.710> I'll<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.980> walk<00:00:59.190> him<00:00:59.370> there

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to Grafton can I'll just walk him there

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.229 
to Grafton can I'll just walk him there
so<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> don't<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.829> railroad<00:01:01.829> points<00:01:02.280> but

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so I don't use a railroad points but

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299 
so I don't use a railroad points but
then<00:01:03.449> once<00:01:04.110> he<00:01:04.260> gets<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.680> I'll<00:01:04.860> feel<00:01:05.070> pretty

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
then once he gets there I'll feel pretty

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.800 
then once he gets there I'll feel pretty
comfortable<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:05.970> defenses<00:01:06.510> off<00:01:06.659> we

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
could stack here in Harpers Ferry of a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.469 
could stack here in Harpers Ferry of a
good<00:01:09.270> stack<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.049> Manassas<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
balloon is still slowly walking its way

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.090 
balloon is still slowly walking its way
to<00:01:41.520> Washington<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> hasn't<00:01:42.689> gotten

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
to Washington and it hasn't gotten

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.510 
to Washington and it hasn't gotten
destroyed<00:01:44.100> yet<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.640> that's<00:01:44.820> nice

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
destroyed yet so that's nice

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.190 
destroyed yet so that's nice
still<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.790> large<00:01:48.060> defensive<00:01:48.600> force<00:01:48.840> in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
still have this large defensive force in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
still have this large defensive force in
Fort<00:01:49.619> Monroe<00:01:49.740> which<00:01:50.220> hasn't<00:01:50.430> come<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.939> any

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
Fort Monroe which hasn't come on to any

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.850 
Fort Monroe which hasn't come on to any
attack<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:51.990> unfortunate<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.680> me

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
attack which is unfortunate for me

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.310 
attack which is unfortunate for me
because<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.149> strong<00:01:54.420> force<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
because it's a strong force and it's in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.069 
because it's a strong force and it's in
a<00:01:55.380> good<00:01:55.590> defensive<00:01:56.100> fort<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.060> wish<00:01:57.869> they'd

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
a good defensive fort so I I wish they'd

going<00:06:36.539> to<00:06:36.599> go<00:06:36.719> here<00:06:37.020> and

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
going to go here and

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.300 
going to go here and
raise<00:06:37.830> a<00:06:38.280> new<00:06:38.970> Army<00:06:39.270> HQ<00:06:39.509> unit<00:06:40.350> and<00:06:40.830> we'll

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
probably give them to Fremont and then

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.600 
probably give them to Fremont and then
hide<00:06:46.139> Fremont<00:06:46.590> away<00:06:46.800> so<00:06:47.160> he's<00:06:47.280> not<00:06:47.400> actually

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610
