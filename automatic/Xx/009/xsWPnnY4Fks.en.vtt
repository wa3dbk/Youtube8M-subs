00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
just show you a better view here as you

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.870 
just show you a better view here as you
can<00:01:48.530> see<00:01:48.649> it's<00:01:48.890> not<00:01:49.039> even<00:01:49.310> lined<00:01:49.550> up<00:01:49.729> right

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
can see it's not even lined up right

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.900 
can see it's not even lined up right
there<00:01:50.149> I<00:01:50.360> mean<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:51.349> still<00:01:51.440> not<00:01:51.619> gonna<00:01:51.910> mess

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
there I mean it's still not gonna mess

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.820 
there I mean it's still not gonna mess
up<00:01:53.060> your<00:01:53.090> shot<00:01:53.450> or<00:01:53.660> anything<00:01:53.929> i'm<00:01:54.110> just<00:01:54.140> not

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
up your shot or anything i'm just not

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.949 
up your shot or anything i'm just not
perfectly<00:01:55.310> lined<00:01:55.550> up<00:01:55.759> all<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:55.970> time<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.390> all

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
perfectly lined up all the time and all

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.330 
perfectly lined up all the time and all
the<00:01:57.050> reason<00:01:57.319> for<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.470> is<00:01:57.679> because<00:01:57.709> this<00:01:58.099> case

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
the reason for that is because this case

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.300 
the reason for that is because this case
that<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.509> ipad<00:01:59.599> doesn't<00:02:00.289> always<00:02:00.709> fit

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
that the ipad doesn't always fit

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.339 
that the ipad doesn't always fit
perfectly<00:02:01.759> inside<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.360> case<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:03.050> kind<00:02:03.289> of

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
perfectly inside the case it kind of

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:04.510 
perfectly inside the case it kind of
moves<00:02:03.470> around<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.039> a<00:02:04.129> little<00:02:04.160> bit

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
moves around just a little bit

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.889 
moves around just a little bit
definitely<00:02:04.819> not<00:02:05.149> a<00:02:05.179> big<00:02:05.390> deal<00:02:05.599> that<00:02:05.840> would

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
definitely not a big deal that would

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.809 
definitely not a big deal that would
make<00:02:06.080> me<00:02:06.200> not<00:02:06.319> want<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.560> buy<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.770> case<00:02:07.039> but

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.119 
make me not want to buy the case but

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.610 
this and you put it underneath the ipad
and<00:02:30.910> by<00:02:31.910> doing<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.660> ipad<00:02:32.960> is<00:02:32.990> secure<00:02:33.500> in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
and by doing that the ipad is secure in

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.530 
and by doing that the ipad is secure in
there<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.100> not<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.490> fall<00:02:34.670> out<00:02:34.730> or

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.940 
there and it's not going to fall out or
anything<00:02:36.780> will<00:02:36.959> move<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.439> little<00:02:37.560> bit<00:02:37.739> because

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
anything will move a little bit because

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.770 
anything will move a little bit because

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
like the way they did this one they did

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.089 
like the way they did this one they did
it<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.659> they<00:02:54.750> both<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.470> same<00:02:55.500> exact

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
it so that they both have the same exact

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.830 
it so that they both have the same exact
kind<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.489> cut<00:02:56.700> out<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.420> kind<00:02:57.629> of<00:02:57.689> like<00:02:57.810> it

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
circle so that's definitely a really

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.080

or if it's just a different kind of
material<00:06:18.129> and<00:06:18.339> then<00:06:19.000> on<00:06:19.240> the<00:06:19.449> outside<00:06:19.509> you<00:06:19.930> can

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
material and then on the outside you can

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.629 
material and then on the outside you can
see<00:06:20.229> that<00:06:20.319> there's<00:06:20.500> nice<00:06:20.830> stitching<00:06:21.219> around

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
see that there's nice stitching around

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.119 
see that there's nice stitching around
here<00:06:22.029> on<00:06:22.509> the<00:06:22.870> outside<00:06:23.229> i<00:06:23.259> love<00:06:23.560> the<00:06:23.710> stitching

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
here on the outside i love the stitching

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:25.980 
here on the outside i love the stitching
but<00:06:24.159> when<00:06:24.399> i<00:06:24.430> go<00:06:24.610> inside<00:06:25.060> I'm<00:06:25.569> not<00:06:25.719> sure<00:06:25.870> I<00:06:25.899> like

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
but when i go inside I'm not sure I like

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.929 
but when i go inside I'm not sure I like
this<00:06:26.199> taking<00:06:26.439> so<00:06:26.560> much<00:06:26.740> on<00:06:26.919> the<00:06:26.979> inside<00:06:27.310> on<00:06:27.490> the

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
this taking so much on the inside on the

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.879 
this taking so much on the inside on the
outside<00:06:28.300> though<00:06:28.479> it<00:06:28.689> looks<00:06:28.930> awesome<00:06:29.199> on<00:06:29.589> this

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
outside though it looks awesome on this

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.469 
outside though it looks awesome on this
case<00:06:30.129> especially<00:06:30.370> on<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:30.789> outside<00:06:31.089> of<00:06:31.210> like<00:06:31.330> I

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
case especially on the outside of like I

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:32.939 
case especially on the outside of like I
think<00:06:31.870> this<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.110> city<00:06:32.379> makes<00:06:32.680> the<00:06:32.770> case

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
think this is the city makes the case

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.139 
think this is the city makes the case
look<00:06:33.129> better<00:06:33.339> on<00:06:33.430> the<00:06:33.580> outside<00:06:33.879> but<00:06:33.969> when<00:06:34.089> i

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:34.149 
look better on the outside but when i

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:36.209 
look better on the outside but when i
get<00:06:34.300> into<00:06:34.419> the<00:06:34.509> inside<00:06:34.899> i'm<00:06:35.139> not<00:06:35.529> sure<00:06:35.620> if<00:06:36.069> I

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
get into the inside i'm not sure if I

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.159 
get into the inside i'm not sure if I
like<00:06:36.399> the<00:06:36.520> stitching<00:06:36.909> so<00:06:37.060> much<00:06:37.240> I'm<00:06:37.509> not<00:06:37.990> not

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
sure how they could fix that but just

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.959
