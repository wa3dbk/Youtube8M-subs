00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.680
 equal to all boys well back on 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.290
 fashion videos 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.180
 Today I want to do something a little 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.790
 different from the usual I want to invite you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.110
 everyone out for dinner 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.779
 I thought of making a nice barbecue of 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.210
 meat and fish what do you say 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:37.530
 we'll just need a couple of things there 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:41.070
 charcoal raw meat and ribbon 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.230
 barbecue is the gel this fashions that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.050
 adds this barbecue which is a stuff 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.829
 fantastic 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.350
 sorry for a moment here we are if not 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.100
 recognize the house and the instant villa 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.339
 which I reviewed some time ago 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.739
 I put even the updated video seen 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.350
 that fashion has been updated with other 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.400
 so in the meantime houses put the link in 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.090
 description of the current video core e 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.580
 then I will update while it starts 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.550
 put down our bike bar look 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.610
 at the same size as 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.380
 of negligence in 1.4 works 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.430
 only charcoal and there are 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.290
 only two and will go on forever 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.550
 only two charcoals you can practically 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 cook endlessly of food and it will remain 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.750
 turned on forever until it did 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.420
 break the barbecue the beauty of these 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.440
 that you can cook eight pieces of meat 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.730
 any all of them together you see the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.170
 first time I used it I thought 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.150
 fuck there's a pietro clipper that i 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.730
 they were exploding instead it was the meat that 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.530
 he was cooking look at the meat too 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.130
 that changes color and then jumps off 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.080
 ricotta this fashion is also very useful 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.760
 to create a kitchen to make 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.710
 also nice scene in the videos 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.720
 look at any kind of meat on 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.810
 nice of this is that he does it too 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.700
 all of them always mixed 8 hours 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:22.610
 as soon as they skip these I do them to you 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:27.740
 see from salda via ok workshop coat 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:31.730
 now look at two chickens two cows while 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.350
 there is a pig and two fish seen there 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.230
 cooking all of them together of course 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.090
 the time that one way jumps from the other is 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.190
 different because he put them one later 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.430
 the other one, however, look, they're jumping 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.010
 away all of them cooked with it 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.980
 same time practically even a good one 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.020
 way to consume less coal in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.650
 how much with only two charcoal we can 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:59.690
 cook the food endlessly now first 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.420
 from an evaluation and then I talk to you about one 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.650
 what this fashion is very useful for various 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.459
 reasons obviously saving of coal 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.730
 cooks quickly 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:15.310
 every type of meat and above all it is also 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.410
 beautiful to make david scenes of minecraft 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.280
 so to this fashion I seriously give a 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.239
 nice 10 full this time and I'm proud of 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.959
 cut because it is very useful does not occupy 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.320
 space takes up just one cube and therefore there 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.320
 can stay
