00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Today we are in an art gallery at 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.279
 Open Sky in Sao Paulo 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.210
 You'll meet the batman alley that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.210
 stay here in the village madalena 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.980
 the neighborhood alley received this year in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.079
 80's that was a time he was 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.430
 one of the unknown alleys or even 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.260
 abandoned center 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.050
 so some students decided to come 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.100
 up here and started yelling at the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.590
 alley walls 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 the first painting here was the bat 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.690
 Batman is why the alley today has 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.690
 this name 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.780
 The cool thing about Batman's alley is that every time 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.060
 that you come here will get the impression 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.250
 to see something new because the paintings are 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.140
 retouched always and in addition many 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.580
 of them are modified for example the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.260
 people were walking around here 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.340
 He found the boy was touching up. 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.340
 his house dye 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.880
 Look who came with all the time sitting 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.610
 is an organized space that is thought to 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.350
 for example a wall that did not exist 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.230
 another world do not be late if you want 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.810
 then a new constitution is a wall 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.850

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.719

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.940
