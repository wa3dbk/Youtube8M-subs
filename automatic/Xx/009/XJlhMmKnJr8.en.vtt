00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.750
 Russia is returning to the civil market 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.250
 aviation as full 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.170
 independent manufacturer 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.259
 shrunk 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.259
 insurance industry of kazakhstan astana 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.210
 five 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.910
 superjet 100 first for the last 16 years 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.000
 russian airliners 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.970
 increased flight range and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.100
 record in world civil aviation 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.710
 resources 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.289
 70 thousand 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.019
 increase this figure more than 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.970
 Twice the Russian specialists succeeded 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 due to special design 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 making 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.480
 superjet 100 became known even before 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.850
 how started 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.360
 to attract the attention of western 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.809
 buyers at the beginning of the word super 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.300
 but the number of Spartak 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.730
 passenger seats but they're like 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.060
 order volume guide 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.580
 the aircraft we are counting on to the end 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.530
 year this volume of orders will increase 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.860
 up to about 150 aircraft we have 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.810
 in front 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.040
 given the exhibition max 2009 at which we 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.440
 also 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.900
 winners of two contracts as 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.710
 for our and foreign 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680
 customers so for customers inside 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.260
 country 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.790
 Airliner is needed before Russia at all 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.430
 must change political soon 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.480
 long-liver 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.710
 that 134 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.650
 but finally that 154 therefore another will come 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.600
 Russian medium-haul 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.659
 aircraft 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.390
 we are all 21 who say little 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.880
 if it is profitable to be in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.060
 thicker documentation 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.829
 that the thought service should raise anyone 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.530
 aircraft 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.100
 create a spot have in their 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.270
 certify 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.860
 I think this is the future that 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.010
 Russian aviation is interesting it will 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.080
 foreign partners so how to make 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.780
 serious competition a320 boeing 737 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.380
 uah 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.219
 m and 21 designed for airways 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.280
 50 half thousand 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.090
 kilometers 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.940
 the plane will be able to fly in all climates 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.820
 zones and even the most difficult 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.180
 weather conditions 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.300
 on Saturday went to court on fundamentally 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.000
 new technology 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.320
 first of all it was kruglov was black 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.900
 composite cow gives opportunities 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.330
 ed said bernanke is the most advanced 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.770
 technology so-called price 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.509
 plastic 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.130
 new hydrocarbon wing with 35 scale 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.049
 meters to make a Russian plane 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.149
 coins 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.659
 will the boyer get dynamic 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.329
 specifications 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.499
 registration at high speeds 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.239
 Yesterday, visitors do yourself more 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.989
 comfortable 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.279
 liner engines became more economical and 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.279
 almost resolved 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.279
 get to third place in the world for release 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.619
 civil aircraft 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.619
 ban on 13 percent of the market 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:36.790
 the only thing 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.599
 and operating reactors however 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.329
 decision 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.329
 however hope 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.169
 she ruled and Russian 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.489
 this plane which 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.779
 which embodies a lot of the last 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.239
 research 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.079
 Pace is the best valuable world 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.739
 these are good conditions we have long been 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.699
 Washington center 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.699
 about how we will prepare 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.999
 perfect not easy 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.199
 first on the layout then on 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.339
 here is a powerful airflow 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.339
 about a thousand people 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:25.989
 harmony 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.709
 more harmony with the environment 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.099
 surely 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.729
 he should be more efficient 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.119
 less 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:36.149
 release harmful substances into the atmosphere 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.669
 make less noise that you disturb these people 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.339
 network less so he must survive all 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.740
 achievement 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.879
 in science 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.980
 it seems to me that it can be with 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.180
 by plane which is in its configuration 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.459
 something even resembles a bird 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.999
 the plane must change shape during the flight 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:57.089
 depending on the mode of guardianship 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:59.849
 m products that set conditions 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.049
 flight is the dream of everyone 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.889
 nature itself suggests for 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.189
 this year colleagues
