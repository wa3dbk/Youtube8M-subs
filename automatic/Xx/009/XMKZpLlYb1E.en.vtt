hi i'm jenna chris mason d well today we

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.920 
hi i'm jenna chris mason d well today we
have<00:00:18.290> a<00:00:18.320> Porsche<00:00:18.860> 911<00:00:19.390> cylinder<00:00:20.390> head<00:00:20.540> on<00:00:20.750> the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
have a Porsche 911 cylinder head on the

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.740 
have a Porsche 911 cylinder head on the
CNC<00:00:21.410> milling<00:00:21.830> room<00:00:22.100> no<00:00:23.000> reason<00:00:23.330> I'm<00:00:23.420> doing<00:00:23.660> it

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
CNC milling room no reason I'm doing it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.450 
CNC milling room no reason I'm doing it
here<00:00:23.960> is<00:00:24.110> because<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.440> have<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.740> little<00:00:24.920> bit<00:00:25.220> more

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
here is because I have a little bit more

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.080 
here is because I have a little bit more
height<00:00:25.810> than<00:00:26.810> I<00:00:26.930> do<00:00:26.990> on<00:00:27.230> my<00:00:27.260> Bridgeport<00:00:28.090> we

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
height than I do on my Bridgeport we

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.490 
height than I do on my Bridgeport we
made<00:00:29.480> up<00:00:29.630> a<00:00:29.720> new<00:00:29.750> tool<00:00:30.520> to<00:00:31.520> ream<00:00:32.300> out<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.260> top

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
made up a new tool to ream out the top

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500 
made up a new tool to ream out the top
of<00:00:33.710> these<00:00:33.829> or<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.399> top<00:00:34.609> or<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:34.909> intake<00:00:35.300> port

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
of these or the top or the intake port

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.139 
of these or the top or the intake port
is<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.530> we<00:00:36.769> can<00:00:36.920> get<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.489> little<00:00:37.670> bit<00:00:37.760> more<00:00:37.940> air

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
is so we can get a little bit more air

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.319 
is so we can get a little bit more air
fuel<00:00:38.449> mixture<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:38.929> this<00:00:39.050> thing<00:00:39.940> guys<00:00:40.940> say<00:00:41.179> this

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
fuel mixture in this thing guys say this

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.569 
fuel mixture in this thing guys say this
when<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:41.749> bolt<00:00:42.589> this<00:00:42.739> thing<00:00:42.800> down<00:00:43.190> which<00:00:43.429> I've

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
when you bolt this thing down which I've

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.970 
when you bolt this thing down which I've
made<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.789> fixture<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.359> do<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:45.620> want<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.859> make

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
made a fixture to do you want to make

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.169 
made a fixture to do you want to make
sure<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.339> you<00:00:46.460> have<00:00:46.670> your<00:00:48.100> port<00:00:49.100> aligned<00:00:49.760> to

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
sure that you have your port aligned to

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.200 
sure that you have your port aligned to
the<00:00:50.510> center<00:00:50.839> of<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.170> machine<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.850> do<00:00:52.999> that

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the center of the machine and to do that

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.809 
the center of the machine and to do that
we<00:00:53.420> have<00:00:53.629> this<00:00:53.899> tool<00:00:54.229> here<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.710> we<00:00:54.769> set<00:00:55.069> up<00:00:55.100> in

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
we have this tool here that we set up in

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.629 
we have this tool here that we set up in
here<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.600> line<00:00:57.139> the<00:00:57.289> thing<00:00:57.499> up<00:00:57.679> you'll<00:00:58.399> find

00:00:58.629 --> 00:00:58.639 
here and line the thing up you'll find

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.099 
here and line the thing up you'll find
that<00:00:58.909> on<00:00:59.059> most<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.449> these<00:00:59.569> cylinder<00:00:59.929> heads

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
that on most of these cylinder heads

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.180 
that on most of these cylinder heads
they'll<00:01:00.289> have<00:01:00.409> a<00:01:00.440> little<00:01:00.710> bit<00:01:00.799> of<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.920> chamfer

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
they'll have a little bit of a chamfer

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.009 
they'll have a little bit of a chamfer
in<00:01:01.460> here<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.569> reason<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:02.870> have<00:01:02.989> that

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
in here and the reason you have that

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.840 
in here and the reason you have that
chamfer<00:01:03.620> is<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:04.510> align<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.440> head<00:01:06.850> toward

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
chamfer is to align the head toward

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.060 
chamfer is to align the head toward
these<00:01:07.970> bolts<00:01:08.420> go<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.380> that's<00:01:09.620> kind<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.920> lined

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
these bolts go so that's kind of lined

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.760 
these bolts go so that's kind of lined
up<00:01:10.280> correctly<00:01:10.310> with<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.000> manifold<00:01:11.770> sometimes

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
up correctly with the manifold sometimes

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.320 
up correctly with the manifold sometimes
they'll<00:01:12.980> be<00:01:13.100> offset<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.580> little<00:01:13.850> bit<00:01:14.030> one<00:01:14.210> way

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
they'll be offset a little bit one way

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.630 
they'll be offset a little bit one way
or<00:01:14.480> the<00:01:14.600> other<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:16.130> really<00:01:16.400> doesn't

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
or the other and that really doesn't

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.940 
or the other and that really doesn't
matter<00:01:16.880> as<00:01:17.120> long<00:01:17.150> as<00:01:17.480> you<00:01:17.600> align<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.770> this

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
matter as long as you align to this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.340 
matter as long as you align to this
chamfer<00:01:19.460> right<00:01:19.640> here<00:01:20.020> anyway<00:01:21.020> we're<00:01:21.200> gonna

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
chamfer right here anyway we're gonna

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.410 
chamfer right here anyway we're gonna
show<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.560> how<00:01:21.620> this<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:21.890> done<00:01:25.270> we're<00:01:26.270> gonna

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
show you how this is done we're gonna

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.310 
show you how this is done we're gonna
turn<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:26.720> on

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.970 

put<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.370> little<00:01:30.520> bit<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.700> oil<00:01:30.910> on<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.120> cutter<00:01:31.390> on

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
put a little bit of oil on the cutter on

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.080 
put a little bit of oil on the cutter on
the<00:01:32.980> head<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:34.320> already<00:01:35.320> have<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:36.490> determine<00:01:36.970> how

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
the head I already have to determine how

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.770 
the head I already have to determine how
deep<00:01:37.360> I'm<00:01:37.540> gonna<00:01:37.750> go<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:40.240> get<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.540> size

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
deep I'm gonna go and to get the size

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.670 
deep I'm gonna go and to get the size
that<00:01:40.960> I'm<00:01:41.080> looking<00:01:41.440> for<00:01:43.500> occasionally<00:01:44.500> what

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
that I'm looking for occasionally what

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.080 
that I'm looking for occasionally what
you'll<00:01:44.800> hear<00:01:45.010> is<00:01:45.070> you'll<00:01:45.370> hear<00:01:45.520> cutting<00:01:45.910> more

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
you'll hear is you'll hear cutting more

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.030 
you'll hear is you'll hear cutting more
on<00:01:46.240> one<00:01:46.450> side<00:01:46.480> than<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.990> other<00:01:47.110> that's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
on one side than the other that's

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.690 
on one side than the other that's
because<00:01:48.550> these<00:01:49.330> heads<00:01:49.660> are<00:01:49.810> not<00:01:49.840> cast<00:01:50.470> true<00:01:51.340> to

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
because these heads are not cast true to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.390 
because these heads are not cast true to
the<00:01:51.880> whole<00:01:52.380> Russia<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.590> say<00:01:53.950> they're<00:01:54.250> not

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
the whole Russia I say they're not

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:38.509 
the whole Russia I say they're not
machined<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.390> hole

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:49.500 

okay<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.670> that's<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:48.150> didn't<00:02:49.150> see<00:02:49.299> they

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
okay and that's it and didn't see they

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.229 
okay and that's it and didn't see they
have<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> nice<00:02:49.930> opening<00:02:50.379> here<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.879> that<00:02:52.060> one's

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
have a nice opening here and that one's

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.640 
have a nice opening here and that one's
fairly<00:02:52.450> concentric<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:54.579> cast<00:02:54.849> hole<00:02:55.650> so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
fairly concentric to the cast hole so

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.410 
fairly concentric to the cast hole so
anyway<00:02:57.069> this<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.640> how<00:02:57.670> we<00:02:57.849> do<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.120> here<00:02:58.360> at

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
anyway this is how we do it here at

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.020 
anyway this is how we do it here at
Costa<00:02:58.810> Mesa<00:02:58.930> indeed<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.709> said<00:03:00.519> we<00:03:00.610> made<00:03:00.819> up<00:03:00.909> a

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
Costa Mesa indeed I said we made up a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.990 
Costa Mesa indeed I said we made up a
special<00:03:01.450> tool<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.840> do<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.640> works<00:03:03.819> out

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
special tool to do this and it works out

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.869 
special tool to do this and it works out
pretty<00:03:04.299> well<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.620> open<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:05.980> up<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.549> quite

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879
