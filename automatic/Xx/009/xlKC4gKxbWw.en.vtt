00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
study and found that a key ingredient in

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.690 
study and found that a key ingredient in
beer<00:05:36.570> may<00:05:36.960> help<00:05:37.380> stave<00:05:37.740> off<00:05:37.980> the<00:05:38.190> common<00:05:38.490> cold

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
basically they found that one of the

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.409 
basically they found that one of the
chemicals<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.250> hops<00:05:41.460> helps<00:05:42.000> fight<00:05:42.270> off

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
chemicals and hops helps fight off

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.150 
chemicals and hops helps fight off
viruses<00:05:42.450> and<00:05:43.350> even<00:05:43.620> has<00:05:43.919> some

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
viruses and even has some

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.730 
viruses and even has some
anti-inflammatory<00:05:45.060> properties<00:05:45.590> now<00:05:46.590> they

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
anti-inflammatory properties now they

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.620 
anti-inflammatory properties now they
say<00:05:46.919> that<00:05:46.950> they<00:05:47.250> only<00:05:47.280> have<00:05:47.700> trace<00:05:48.150> amounts<00:05:48.570> of

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
say that they only have trace amounts of

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.240 
say that they only have trace amounts of
this<00:05:48.780> chemical<00:05:49.200> in<00:05:49.410> beer<00:05:49.680> so<00:05:49.980> you<00:05:50.040> have<00:05:50.160> to
