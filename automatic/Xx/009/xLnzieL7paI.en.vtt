00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.840
 very well 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.330
 there is a bridge that is between paradise 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.930
 and the land and it's called the bridge of 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.300
 rainbow when an animal that has 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.870
 been especially loved by someone 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.020
 here on earth then it goes to the bridge 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.630
 of the rainbow there are valleys and hills 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.850
 for all our special friends 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.110
 so they can run and play 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.379
 together 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.760
 there is a lot of food, water and sun and our 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.989
 Friends are comfortable and sheltered 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.929
 all the animals that have been 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.120
 sick or who were elderly recover 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.059
 your health and vigor those who were 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.690
 injured or mutilated recover what was lost 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.420
 and they are strong again just like the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.300
 we remember in our dreams of days and 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.360
 past times the animals are 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.260
 happy and happy except for one 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.740
 small thing 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.500
 each one of them miss someone very 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.820
 special someone who had to leave 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.460
 back all run and play together but 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.660
 come a day when one of them 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.060
 stop suddenly and look at the distance 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.190
 his bright eyes are intent its 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.190
 impatient body shudders and vibrates 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.860
 suddenly he runs away from the group 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.870
 flying over the green grass moving 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.660
 your legs getting faster and faster 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.730
 you have been listed and when you and your 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.120
 special friend they finally meet 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.300
 the two embrace in a wonderful 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.940
 reunion to never separate from 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.520
 again a shower of kisses falls on you 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.520
 face your hands caress again the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.729
 beloved head and you can look again at 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.780
 the trusting eyes of your pet 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.890
 so much time away from your life but 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.980
 never absent from your heart then the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.760
 two cross the rainbow bridge 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.760
 together 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.829
 do not
