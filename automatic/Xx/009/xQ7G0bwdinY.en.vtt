you<00:00:00.510> know<00:00:00.630> take<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> look<00:00:01.110> at<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.680> is

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
you know take a look at this this is

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.740 
you know take a look at this this is
what<00:00:02.280> they<00:00:02.370> call<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.669> Ring<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.060> Fire<00:00:03.120> for

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
what they call the Ring of Fire for

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.210 
what they call the Ring of Fire for
earthquakes<00:00:04.290> so<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.560> have<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> series<00:00:05.190> of

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
earthquakes so you have a series of

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.940 
earthquakes so you have a series of
quakes<00:00:05.490> it<00:00:06.150> started<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.720> Chile<00:00:07.080> then<00:00:07.740> went

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
quakes it started in Chile then went

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.620 
quakes it started in Chile then went
over<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.160> New<00:00:08.309> Zealand<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:08.880> then<00:00:09.090> hit<00:00:09.240> Japan

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
over to New Zealand and then hit Japan

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.990 
over to New Zealand and then hit Japan
we'll<00:00:10.410> keep<00:00:10.620> following<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.340> ring<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
we'll keep following this ring it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.850 
we'll keep following this ring it
actually<00:00:12.330> leads<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> u.s.<00:00:12.990> west<00:00:13.230> coast<00:00:13.380> so

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
actually leads to the u.s. west coast so

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.980 
actually leads to the u.s. west coast so
could<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.400> next<00:00:14.759> here's<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.540> fella<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:15.929> she

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
could that be next here's a fella so she

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.689 
could that be next here's a fella so she
could<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.529> me<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:16.980> Jim<00:00:17.220> Birkeland

this<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.180> rather<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.930> critical<00:00:34.530> time<00:00:35.660> indeed

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
this is rather a a critical time indeed

this is rather a a critical time indeed
Jim<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.200> said<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.680> notice<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.760> unusual

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
Jim you said you notice the unusual

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.470 
Jim you said you notice the unusual
events<00:00:40.020> prior<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:40.950> big<00:00:41.250> events<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.910> one

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
events prior to these big events and one

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
events prior to these big events and one
is<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.899> these<00:00:43.020> dead<00:00:43.290> fish<00:00:43.530> popping<00:00:44.010> up

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
is all these dead fish popping up

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
is all these dead fish popping up
particularly<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> California<00:00:45.600> coast

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
particularly with the California coast

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.430 
particularly with the California coast
that<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> pattern<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.210> see

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
that that is a pattern that you see

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.380 
that that is a pattern that you see
prior<00:00:49.610> two<00:00:50.750> quakes<00:00:51.750> could<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> explain<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
prior two quakes could you explain that

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.700 
prior two quakes could you explain that
that's<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> type<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> thing<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.140> does

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that's the type of thing that does

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.680 
that's the type of thing that does
happen<00:00:55.949> fairly<00:00:56.370> routinely<00:00:57.980> animals<00:00:58.980> often

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
happen fairly routinely animals often

anticipate<00:01:00.690> upcoming<00:01:01.320> quakes<00:01:01.699> mainly<00:01:02.699> due<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
anticipate upcoming quakes mainly due to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.350 
anticipate upcoming quakes mainly due to
the<00:01:03.660> changes<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.769> magnetic<00:01:05.489> field<00:01:06.000> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the changes of the magnetic field that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.740 
the changes of the magnetic field that
precede<00:01:06.900> quakes<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:08.369> often<00:01:08.549> found<00:01:08.939> right

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
precede quakes and is often found right

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
precede quakes and is often found right

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
California quake at 89 you're seeing

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170 
California quake at 89 you're seeing
being<00:01:49.409> repeated<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.130> particularly<00:01:50.820> off<00:01:50.970> the

California coast but but others say well

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.819 
California coast but but others say well
these<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.750> anomalies<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.259> happen<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:55.710> the

these are anomalies that happen all the

it<00:01:59.159> into<00:01:59.399> something<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.909> might<00:02:00.570> not<00:02:00.689> happen

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it into something that might not happen

it into something that might not happen
what<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.290> say<00:02:02.240> well<00:02:03.240> before<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> World

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
what do you say well before the World

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.929 
what do you say well before the World
Series<00:02:04.079> quake<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.829> knew<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.490> were<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.790> to

the<00:03:46.890> next<00:03:46.920> time<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.610> looks<00:03:47.730> like<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:47.970> would<00:03:48.060> be

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the next time it looks like it would be

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.590 
the next time it looks like it would be
due<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.720> fill<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.959> gap<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:50.150> Mexico<00:03:51.150> or<00:03:51.390> more

likely in California and he made that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.850 
likely in California and he made that
talk<00:03:54.299> in<00:03:54.630> about<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.170> tenth<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:57.709> April<00:03:58.709> in

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
1906 and sure enough the quake happened

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.780 
1906 and sure enough the quake happened
and<00:04:03.090> I've<00:04:03.720> got<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.110> many<00:04:04.200> stories<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:05.160> of

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
and I've got so many stories now of

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.110 
and I've got so many stories now of
animals<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.840> people<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:08.030> weirding<00:04:09.030> out

animals and people that weirding out

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.150 
animals and people that weirding out
there<00:04:09.360> were<00:04:09.540> decimated<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.200> quake<00:04:10.380> okay<00:04:10.920> Jim

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
there were decimated the quake okay Jim

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.530 
there were decimated the quake okay Jim
we're<00:04:11.400> going<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.579> watch<00:04:11.730> close<00:04:12.030> right<00:04:12.390> now

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
we're going to watch close right now

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.890 
we're going to watch close right now
good<00:04:13.170> finish<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.709> though<00:04:14.480> well<00:04:15.480> I'll<00:04:15.570> just<00:04:15.600> say
