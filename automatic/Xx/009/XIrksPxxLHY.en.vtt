and<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.700> only<00:01:41.810> 28,000<00:01:42.810> miles<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.890> 2010s<00:01:44.700> are

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and it's only 28,000 miles the 2010s are

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.410 
and it's only 28,000 miles the 2010s are
out<00:01:44.970> right<00:01:45.180> now

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
out right now

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.499 
out right now
so<00:01:46.049> typically<00:01:46.500> cars<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.369> 15,000<00:01:48.240> miles<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
so typically cars have 15,000 miles a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
so typically cars have 15,000 miles a
year<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> car<00:01:48.930> should<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.340> 45,000<00:01:50.340> miles

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
year this car should have 45,000 miles

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.030 
year this car should have 45,000 miles
on<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> already<00:01:51.210> only<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:52.049> 28<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.680> very<00:01:52.860> low

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
on it already only has 28 it's very low

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.620 
on it already only has 28 it's very low
miles<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.850> let's<00:01:53.970> look<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.479> big

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
miles so let's look at some of the big

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.260 
miles so let's look at some of the big
things<00:01:54.899> six<00:01:55.590> piston<00:01:56.040> calipers<00:01:56.579> not<00:01:56.969> even

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
things six piston calipers not even

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.149 
things six piston calipers not even
forced<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.719> six<00:01:57.960> piston<00:01:58.290> calipers<00:01:58.320> three

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
forced those six piston calipers three

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.749 
forced those six piston calipers three
on<00:01:59.280> each<00:01:59.460> side

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
on each side

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.850 
on each side
huge<00:02:00.420> two-piece<00:02:01.049> rotors<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.770> actually

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
huge two-piece rotors you can actually

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.440 
huge two-piece rotors you can actually
see<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.340> bolts<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.759> hold<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> center

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
see the bolts that hold the center

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.600 
see the bolts that hold the center
section<00:02:03.869> together

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
section together

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.450 
section together
and<00:02:04.730> then<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.210> hub<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.540> separate<00:02:05.900> also

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
and then the hub is separate also

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.730 
and then the hub is separate also
cross-drilled<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:08.090> car<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.630> easily<00:02:09.530> capable

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
cross-drilled this car is easily capable

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.370 
cross-drilled this car is easily capable
in<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.250> 190<00:02:10.580> range<00:02:11.180> miles<00:02:11.750> per<00:02:11.990> hour<00:02:12.080> and

in the 190 range miles per hour and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.870 
in the 190 range miles per hour and
believe<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:12.800> electronically<00:02:13.400> governed<00:02:13.550> but

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
believe it's electronically governed but

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.940 
believe it's electronically governed but
it<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.030> capable<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.420> 192<00:02:14.960> can<00:02:15.200> bypass<00:02:15.350> that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
it is capable of 192 can bypass that

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.710 
it is capable of 192 can bypass that
system<00:02:16.460> which<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.910> hear<00:02:17.060> lots<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.390> people<00:02:17.660> could

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
system which I hear lots of people could

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.000 
system which I hear lots of people could
do<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.140> don't<00:02:18.290> know<00:02:18.470> anything<00:02:18.590> about<00:02:18.830> that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
do that I don't know anything about that

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.100 
do that I don't know anything about that
so<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.490> just<00:02:19.610> stay<00:02:19.910> out<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.180> great<00:02:20.840> ground

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110

engines are hand assembled forward to
6.3<00:03:01.310> liters<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.060> guy<00:03:02.210> who<00:03:02.240> builds

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
6.3 liters and then the guy who builds

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.380 
6.3 liters and then the guy who builds
it<00:03:02.900> right<00:03:03.110> here<00:03:03.350> Sergei<00:03:03.830> your<00:03:04.130> hand<00:03:04.730> signs<00:03:05.120> his

it right here Sergei your hand signs his

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.120 
it right here Sergei your hand signs his
name<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> engine<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.440> can<00:03:06.680> see<00:03:06.890> who
