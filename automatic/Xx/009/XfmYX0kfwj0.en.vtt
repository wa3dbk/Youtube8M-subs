00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
while the leveling system is completely

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.660 
while the leveling system is completely
set<00:00:34.270> at<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.750> factory<00:00:34.830> to<00:00:35.830> be<00:00:35.950> calibrated<00:00:36.550> to

set at the factory to be calibrated to
the<00:00:36.700> zero<00:00:37.030> point<00:00:37.300> there<00:00:37.809> could<00:00:37.989> be<00:00:38.020> a

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
the zero point there could be a

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.140 
the zero point there could be a
situation<00:00:38.380> we<00:00:38.890> will<00:00:39.010> have<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.309> reset<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.910> zero

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
situation we will have to reset the zero

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.510 
situation we will have to reset the zero
point<00:00:40.450> on<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.840> coach<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:42.040> do<00:00:42.160> this<00:00:42.309> we're

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
point on the coach to do this we're

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.070 
point on the coach to do this we're
going<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.670> have<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:42.940> put<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.300> control<00:00:43.720> panel

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
going to have to put the control panel

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.860 
going to have to put the control panel
into<00:00:44.440> programming<00:00:44.890> mode<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:46.420> our<00:00:46.540> engine

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
into programming mode with our engine

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.869 
into programming mode with our engine
running<00:00:47.170> parking<00:00:47.710> brake<00:00:47.890> engaged<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.699> our

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
transmission and park were neutral we'll

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.390 
transmission and park were neutral we'll
want<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.309> go<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.670> turn<00:00:52.210> on<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.480> system<00:00:53.400> once

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
want to go and turn on the system once

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.070 
want to go and turn on the system once
we<00:00:54.550> turn<00:00:54.760> on<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.000> system<00:00:55.210> we'll<00:00:55.809> hit<00:00:55.930> the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
we turn on the system we'll hit the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.799 
we turn on the system we'll hit the
front<00:00:56.320> Jack<00:00:56.680> button<00:00:57.070> five<00:00:57.519> times

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.410 

then<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> rear<00:01:01.710> Jack<00:01:01.980> button<00:01:02.340> five<00:01:02.760> times

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.910 

after<00:01:07.420> we<00:01:07.479> hit<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.720> two<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:08.049> these<00:01:08.170> five<00:01:08.560> times

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
after we hit the two of these five times

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.219 
after we hit the two of these five times
each<00:01:09.100> we'll<00:01:09.790> see<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.360> control<00:01:10.840> panel

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
each we'll see that the control panel

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.170 
each we'll see that the control panel
has<00:01:11.380> gone<00:01:11.560> into<00:01:11.799> programming<00:01:12.280> mode<00:01:12.400> all<00:01:13.119> the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
has gone into programming mode all the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.969 
has gone into programming mode all the

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
lights throughout the entire control

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.580 
lights throughout the entire control
panel<00:01:15.430> are<00:01:15.580> flashing<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:17.200> at<00:01:17.320> this<00:01:17.470> point

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
panel are flashing it's at this point

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.109 
panel are flashing it's at this point
where<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:18.070> can<00:01:18.250> take<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.790> we<00:01:18.880> put<00:01:19.030> our

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
where we can take and we put our

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.789 
where we can take and we put our
carpenters<00:01:19.659> level<00:01:19.960> at<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.320> back<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.530> the

coach in the center actually of the

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.420 
coach in the center actually of the
coach<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:23.320> put<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.560> on<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.770> floor<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.310> we

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
coach we put it on the floor and we

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.490 
coach we put it on the floor and we
start<00:01:24.670> looking<00:01:24.790> for<00:01:25.149> level<00:01:25.479> we<00:01:26.020> can<00:01:26.200> use<00:01:26.350> our

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
start looking for level we can use our

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.290 
start looking for level we can use our
jak<00:01:26.740> control<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.399> front<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.000> rear<00:01:28.119> to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
jak control to the front to the rear to

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.410 
jak control to the front to the rear to
the<00:01:28.479> side<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.840> side<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.170> get<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:31.119> zero

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
the side to the side to get to the zero

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:54.270 
the side to the side to get to the zero
point<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.960> set<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.590> new<00:01:32.740> automatic<00:01:33.250> leveling

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.620 

once<00:01:55.280> we<00:01:55.430> are<00:01:55.520> finished<00:01:55.909> with<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:56.509> will

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
once we are finished with that we will

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.749 
once we are finished with that we will
take<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.140> we'll<00:01:57.409> hit<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.740> read<00:01:57.979> track<00:01:58.310> button

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
take and we'll hit the read track button

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.080 
take and we'll hit the read track button
three<00:01:59.420> times

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.780 

now<00:02:02.750> we<00:02:02.810> have<00:02:03.110> programmed<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.710> zero<00:02:03.950> point<00:02:04.220> we

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
now we have programmed the zero point we

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.340 
now we have programmed the zero point we
know<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:05.210> because<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.600> wait<00:02:05.840> button<00:02:06.200> is

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
know this because the wait button is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.500 
know this because the wait button is
flashing
