one here I've actually drilled into the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.350 
one here I've actually drilled into the
original

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360

right<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.350> simple<00:02:19.800> myth<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.100> I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
right there that's a simple myth that I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.000 
right there that's a simple myth that I
use<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.180> method<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.630> use<00:02:21.900> my<00:02:22.500> time<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.830> use

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
use and the method I use my time to use

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.910 
use and the method I use my time to use
these<00:02:23.730> small<00:02:24.450> screwdrivers<00:02:25.290> I've<00:02:25.680> got<00:02:25.890> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
these small screwdrivers I've got a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.870 
these small screwdrivers I've got a
whole<00:02:26.160> set<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.740> it'll<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.280> usually<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
whole set here and it'll be usually the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.220 
whole set here and it'll be usually the
flat<00:02:30.210> head<00:02:30.450> not<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.050> cross<00:02:32.780> flat<00:02:33.780> heads<00:02:33.990> are

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
flat head not the cross flat heads are

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.190 
flat head not the cross flat heads are
usually<00:02:35.040> very<00:02:35.220> sharp<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.880> they<00:02:36.630> use<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> small

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
usually very sharp and they use a small

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.590 
usually very sharp and they use a small
one<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.240> bore

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
one and what you can do is you can bore

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.880 
one and what you can do is you can bore
a<00:02:39.630> hole<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:40.790> into<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.910> there<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:43.500> tend<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
a hole right into it there and I tend to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.990 
a hole right into it there and I tend to
use<00:02:43.980> different<00:02:44.310> types<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.580> glues<00:02:44.820> with

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
use different types of glues with

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.110 
use different types of glues with
different<00:02:45.300> types<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.690> joints<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.620> different

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
different types of joints or different

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.580 
different types of joints or different
causes<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.209> one<00:02:48.390> here<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.660> your<00:02:48.690> standard

here I used for other things and this
particularly<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.780> used<00:03:03.959> for<00:03:04.350> like<00:03:04.590> flat

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
particularly it's used for like flat

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.470 
particularly it's used for like flat
edges<00:03:07.290> where<00:03:07.770> I've<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.640> kind<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.000> sanded

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
edges where I've like kind of sanded

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.930 
edges where I've like kind of sanded
down<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:10.590> make<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.770> rough<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.310> stick<00:03:11.760> better

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
down to make it rough so it stick better

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.280 
down to make it rough so it stick better
and<00:03:12.480> I've<00:03:12.959> used<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.350> for<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
and I've used this for like the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.140 
and I've used this for like the
three-quarter<00:03:16.290> inch<00:03:16.470> figures<00:03:17.340> where<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
three-quarter inch figures where the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.270 
three-quarter inch figures where the
joints<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.780> break<00:03:19.019> because<00:03:19.590> they're<00:03:20.130> so

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
joints like break because they're so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.680 
joints like break because they're so
small<00:03:20.549> sometimes<00:03:20.820> putting<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.239> pin<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.510> there

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
small sometimes putting a pin in there

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.660 
small sometimes putting a pin in there
it's<00:03:22.350> such<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> good<00:03:22.650> idea

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
it's such a good idea

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.270 
it's such a good idea
other<00:03:24.120> figures<00:03:24.299> I've<00:03:24.480> prepared<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.930> like

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
other figures I've prepared is like

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.660 
other figures I've prepared is like
Marvel<00:03:26.630> Legends<00:03:27.680> ultimate<00:03:28.680> Rhino<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.549> there

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
Marvel Legends ultimate Rhino and there

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.270 
Marvel Legends ultimate Rhino and there
was<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.820> need<00:03:30.030> ankle<00:03:30.810> joint<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.170> went<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.920> I

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
was a need ankle joint that went and I

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.120 
was a need ankle joint that went and I
replaced<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.730> using<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:36.739> 50<00:03:37.739> end<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:38.040> a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
replaced that using a 50 end of a

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
replaced that using a 50 end of a
toothpick<00:03:39.890> such<00:03:40.890> as<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.459> all<00:03:41.580> I'm<00:03:42.000> a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
toothpick such as this and all I'm a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 
toothpick such as this and all I'm a
even<00:03:42.330> sure<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.600> result<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.709> at<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
even sure the result that and at the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.280 
even sure the result that and at the
later<00:03:44.190> stage<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.269> used<00:03:45.510> like<00:03:45.840> towards

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
later stage so I used like towards

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.190 
later stage so I used like towards
middle<00:03:46.820> weapons<00:03:47.820> which<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.180> middle<00:03:48.330> more

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
middle weapons which the middle more

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.140 
middle weapons which the middle more
like<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.530> end<00:03:49.739> without<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.310> small<00:03:50.700> fin<00:03:50.910> part

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
like the end without the small fin part

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.949 
like the end without the small fin part
and<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:52.049> use<00:03:52.230> glue<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.920> set<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.150> it's

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
and I use glue to set it in and it's

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.270 
and I use glue to set it in and it's
this<00:03:55.170> blue<00:03:55.799> here<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.340> UV<00:03:56.610> blue<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:59.160> that's

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
this blue here the UV blue and that's

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.680 
this blue here the UV blue and that's
awesome<00:03:59.640> because<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:01.440> adds<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.890> little<00:04:02.070> bit<00:04:02.220> of

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
awesome because it adds a little bit of

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.420 
awesome because it adds a little bit of
friction<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.140> middle<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.860> so<00:04:05.100> it's<00:04:05.280> no

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
friction to the middle of it so it's no

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.670 
friction to the middle of it so it's no
longer<00:04:05.459> loose<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> joint<00:04:06.959> won't<00:04:07.200> spin

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
longer loose so the joint won't spin

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.850 
longer loose so the joint won't spin
around<00:04:07.830> Eames<00:04:08.790> leaf<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.989> replacement<00:04:10.620> and

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
around Eames leaf the replacement and

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.960 
around Eames leaf the replacement and
pennies<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.930> lose<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.530> what<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.340> is<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.880> would

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
pennies to lose and what it is it would

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.140 
pennies to lose and what it is it would
also<00:04:15.120> hold<00:04:15.510> in<00:04:15.690> place<00:04:15.930> as<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.579> as<00:04:17.579> forming<00:04:18.090> a

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
also hold in place as a as forming a

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.479 
also hold in place as a as forming a
little<00:04:18.329> barrier<00:04:18.750> between<00:04:19.410> like<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.070> joints

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
little barrier between like the joints

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.260 
little barrier between like the joints
to<00:04:21.209> form<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.570> barrier<00:04:21.900> around<00:04:22.020> there<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:24.120> it

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
to form a barrier around there and so it

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.150 
to form a barrier around there and so it
wouldn't<00:04:24.479> fall

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
wouldn't fall

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.790 
wouldn't fall
so<00:04:25.640> that's<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.480> little<00:04:26.630> quick<00:04:26.870> tip<00:04:27.080> there<00:04:27.410> for

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
so that's a little quick tip there for

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.400 
so that's a little quick tip there for
you<00:04:27.980> okay<00:04:28.660> with<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:29.750> one<00:04:29.960> I'm<00:04:30.080> just<00:04:30.230> going<00:04:30.380> to

you okay with this one I'm just going to
cut<00:04:30.590> down<00:04:30.770> piece<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.250> wire<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:33.580> tried<00:04:34.580> using<00:04:34.760> a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
cut down piece of wire and tried using a

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.710 
cut down piece of wire and tried using a
toothpick<00:04:36.530> but<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:36.980> too<00:04:37.340> too<00:04:37.940> fine<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.330> snap

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
toothpick but is too too fine and snap

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.840 
toothpick but is too too fine and snap

hey there okay so I've pre-cut the
length<00:05:02.630> of<00:05:02.810> wire<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:04.550> cable<00:05:04.970> type<00:05:05.150> used<00:05:05.510> is

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
length of wire this cable type used is

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.270 
length of wire this cable type used is
actually<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.820> medium<00:05:08.920> size<00:05:09.920> thickness<00:05:12.280> opposed

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
actually a medium size thickness opposed

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.420 
actually a medium size thickness opposed
the<00:05:13.580> section<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.330> is<00:05:14.510> actually<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:15.170> lot<00:05:16.130> more

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
the section of it is actually a lot more

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.550 
the section of it is actually a lot more
famous<00:05:17.090> like<00:05:17.300> half<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.990> size<00:05:18.200> of<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.410> one<00:05:18.530> I

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
famous like half the size of the one I

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.410 
famous like half the size of the one I
just<00:05:18.650> showed<00:05:18.890> earlier<00:05:19.460> just<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.240> make<00:05:20.390> sure

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
just showed earlier just to make sure

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.260 
just showed earlier just to make sure
one<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.110> actually<00:05:21.800> fits<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.640> can<00:05:22.760> see<00:05:22.940> here

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
one that actually fits you can see here

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.840 
one that actually fits you can see here
I've<00:05:23.990> pre-cut<00:05:24.290> it<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:24.680> little<00:05:25.010> bit<00:05:25.250> long<00:05:25.550> and

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
I've pre-cut it a little bit long and

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.460 
I've pre-cut it a little bit long and
there's<00:05:26.450> a<00:05:26.510> reason<00:05:26.840> for<00:05:26.870> that

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
there's a reason for that

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.190 
there's a reason for that
just<00:05:28.160> so<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.370> can<00:05:28.790> measure<00:05:29.300> how<00:05:29.480> long<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.050> is

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
just so you can measure how long it is

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.510 
just so you can measure how long it is
within<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.190> actual<00:05:31.460> forearm<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:33.520> you've

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
within the actual forearm that you've

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.510 
within the actual forearm that you've
bought<00:05:34.790> into<00:05:35.090> you've<00:05:35.330> drilled<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:37.340> drilled

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
bought into you've drilled and drilled

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.480 
bought into you've drilled and drilled
and<00:05:38.050> into<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.170> hand<00:05:39.380> as<00:05:39.560> well<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:40.280> as<00:05:40.340> you<00:05:40.430> can

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
and into the hand as well so as you can

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.000 
and into the hand as well so as you can
see<00:05:40.550> there's<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:41.180> little<00:05:41.660> bit<00:05:41.810> extra<00:05:42.020> length

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
see there's a little bit extra length

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.540 
see there's a little bit extra length
and<00:05:43.280> that<00:05:43.730> can<00:05:43.880> always<00:05:44.120> actually<00:05:44.360> be<00:05:44.690> cut<00:05:45.050> down

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
and that can always actually be cut down

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.420 
and that can always actually be cut down
so<00:05:46.550> with<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.600> it's<00:05:48.050> a<00:05:48.260> good<00:05:48.500> experience<00:05:48.800> some

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
so with that it's a good experience some

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.730 
so with that it's a good experience some
good<00:05:49.580> experience<00:05:50.000> I've<00:05:50.960> had<00:05:51.020> I've<00:05:51.410> had<00:05:51.560> to

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
good experience I've had I've had to

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.330 
good experience I've had I've had to
just<00:05:54.430> pre-cut<00:05:55.430> that<00:05:55.780> just<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:56.930> see<00:05:57.200> how<00:05:58.070> long

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
just pre-cut that just to see how long

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.460 
just pre-cut that just to see how long
I'll<00:05:58.520> need<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:59.180> length<00:05:59.390> and<00:05:59.870> at<00:06:00.290> this<00:06:00.410> stage

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
I'll need the length and at this stage

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.620 
I'll need the length and at this stage
you<00:06:00.800> can<00:06:01.220> then<00:06:01.580> tell<00:06:01.850> you<00:06:02.120> know<00:06:02.210> what<00:06:02.330> kind<00:06:02.570> of

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
you can then tell you know what kind of

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.420 
you can then tell you know what kind of
joint<00:06:02.840> you'd<00:06:03.050> want<00:06:03.290> you<00:06:03.770> know<00:06:03.920> do<00:06:04.070> you<00:06:04.130> want<00:06:04.340> to

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
joint you'd want you know do you want to

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.180 
joint you'd want you know do you want to
flexible<00:06:05.090> and<00:06:05.210> moving<00:06:05.540> so<00:06:05.690> you<00:06:05.780> can<00:06:05.960> do

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
flexible and moving so you can do

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.490 
flexible and moving so you can do
articulate<00:06:07.190> inside<00:06:07.940> some<00:06:08.150> articulation<00:06:08.930> it

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
articulate inside some articulation it

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.860 
articulate inside some articulation it
just<00:06:09.680> means<00:06:09.830> you<00:06:09.920> wouldn't<00:06:10.100> glue<00:06:10.430> it<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:10.940> but

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
just means you wouldn't glue it and but

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.400 
just means you wouldn't glue it and but
as<00:06:12.350> its<00:06:12.560> for<00:06:12.710> an<00:06:12.800> eight-year-old<00:06:12.950> my<00:06:13.880> son's

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
as its for an eight-year-old my son's

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.530 
as its for an eight-year-old my son's
gonna<00:06:15.410> need<00:06:15.710> it<00:06:15.890> probably<00:06:16.390> fastened<00:06:17.390> in

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
gonna need it probably fastened in

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.390 
gonna need it probably fastened in
otherwise<00:06:18.170> he<00:06:18.440> will<00:06:18.500> lose<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:18.800> hand<00:06:19.210> so<00:06:20.210> a

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
otherwise he will lose that hand so a

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.610 
otherwise he will lose that hand so a
training<00:06:22.400> that<00:06:22.670> I'm<00:06:23.240> gonna<00:06:23.390> now<00:06:23.600> and<00:06:23.960> pause

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
training that I'm gonna now and pause

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.360 
training that I'm gonna now and pause
this<00:06:24.830> and<00:06:25.270> pre-cut<00:06:26.270> it<00:06:26.420> so<00:06:26.630> see<00:06:27.620> you<00:06:27.680> in<00:06:27.860> a<00:06:27.980> bit

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
this and pre-cut it so see you in a bit

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.850 
this and pre-cut it so see you in a bit
hey<00:06:28.910> we're<00:06:29.390> back<00:06:29.510> right<00:06:29.930> and<00:06:30.320> there<00:06:30.590> we<00:06:30.710> have

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
hey we're back right and there we have

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.940 
hey we're back right and there we have
it<00:06:30.890> the<00:06:31.490> finished<00:06:31.700> joint<00:06:32.500> can<00:06:33.500> make<00:06:33.770> it<00:06:33.919> a

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
it the finished joint can make it a

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.680 
it the finished joint can make it a
little<00:06:34.070> bit<00:06:34.280> more<00:06:34.400> cleaner<00:06:34.729> if<00:06:35.330> they<00:06:35.450> wish<00:06:35.660> but

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
little bit more cleaner if they wish but

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.900 
little bit more cleaner if they wish but
I<00:06:36.290> decided<00:06:36.710> to<00:06:36.860> leave<00:06:37.010> a<00:06:37.070> little<00:06:37.340> bit

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
I decided to leave a little bit

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.260 
I decided to leave a little bit
there<00:06:38.090> and<00:06:38.830> only<00:06:39.830> that<00:06:39.980> I<00:06:40.190> only<00:06:40.640> glued<00:06:41.060> it

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
there and only that I only glued it

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.110 
there and only that I only glued it
where<00:06:41.450> the<00:06:41.570> hand<00:06:41.780> is<00:06:41.930> I<00:06:42.610> say<00:06:43.610> I<00:06:43.640> use<00:06:43.820> that<00:06:44.000> a<00:06:44.030> lot

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
where the hand is I say I use that a lot

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.260 
where the hand is I say I use that a lot
like<00:06:44.390> just<00:06:45.140> so<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.350> can<00:06:45.680> steal<00:06:46.010> its<00:06:46.790> place<00:06:47.030> I'm

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
like just so you can steal its place I'm

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.460 
like just so you can steal its place I'm
gonna<00:06:47.420> give<00:06:47.600> it<00:06:47.630> a<00:06:47.900> go

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
gonna give it a go

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.010 
gonna give it a go
see<00:06:48.710> if<00:06:48.770> my<00:06:48.830> son<00:06:49.160> can<00:06:50.060> get<00:06:50.180> on<00:06:50.360> with<00:06:50.630> actually

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
see if my son can get on with actually

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.710 
see if my son can get on with actually
not<00:06:51.200> losing<00:06:51.470> it<00:06:52.750> but<00:06:53.750> I<00:06:54.670> think<00:06:55.670> that<00:06:55.850> may<00:06:56.330> work

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
not losing it but I think that may work

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.350 
not losing it but I think that may work
I<00:06:57.220> can<00:06:58.220> see<00:06:58.370> just<00:06:58.430> coming<00:06:58.790> out<00:06:58.910> a<00:06:58.970> little<00:06:59.120> bit

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
I can see just coming out a little bit

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.970 
I can see just coming out a little bit
so<00:06:59.840> that<00:06:59.870> might<00:07:00.140> be<00:07:00.320> a<00:07:00.350> good<00:07:00.470> idea

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
so that might be a good idea

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.740 
so that might be a good idea
I<00:07:01.030> may<00:07:02.030> just<00:07:02.680> glue<00:07:03.680> that<00:07:03.800> in<00:07:03.980> there<00:07:04.160> but<00:07:04.970> that's

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
I may just glue that in there but that's

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.780 
I may just glue that in there but that's
how<00:07:06.730> to<00:07:07.730> repair<00:07:08.150> your<00:07:09.430> Marvel<00:07:10.430> legend
