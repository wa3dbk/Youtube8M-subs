 After a long winter you long for yourself 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.130
 in the living rooms and there are exactly 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.870
 the right one and not just a pleasure 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.580
 for the palate but also for the 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.650
 so eyes to offer these cute 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.450
 hands and brightly shining colors 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.500
 you can really great decorations 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.600
 freshen up a bit 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.250
 i am in the brain but and i love 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.870

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.239
 create and thus seasons 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.820
 piece far reflect and then 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.199
 to make small moments of happiness in everyday life 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 that's how it works out so well here 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.960
 these nostalgic eggs with these 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
 bright colors of lindt here it is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.249
 something special that I have you now 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.460
 subsequently still sprinkled and 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:53.159
 Although if you have the paint on here 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.929
 you can spit that check 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.690
 still great with a little darker 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:00.979
 color dot for that I need to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.359
 brush in a little water first 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.070
 you have to try a bit 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.170
 depending on how firm one presses 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.580
 the speckles a bit bigger or smaller 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.940
 because you get a feeling for it the best 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.110
 first try it out first and then 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.800
 She can do one for drying 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.940
 Styrofoam plate stuck 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.490
 out of these eggs you can count on one 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.490
 put together very beautiful Easter wreath 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.700
 there the eggs are on a branch completely 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700
 groomed 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.400
 meanwhile I tie the eggs I do something 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.400
 it must be again with rad 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 tied 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.230
 Then I stepped on the back 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:14.230
 and the final touch gets the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.819
 all through those shiny eggs those with 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:23.380
 the film has been pasted by the linzers 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.989
 I can with normal glue stick 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.160
 then quite simple styrofoam with the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.160
 paste a nice foil 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.090
 the eggs are the same with 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.090
 glued hot glue 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.510
 can you still a few springs in between 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.370
 stick and then the whole wreath with 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.370
 hung beautiful ribbons
