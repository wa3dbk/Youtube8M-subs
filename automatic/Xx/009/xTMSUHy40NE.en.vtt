thermometer into the glass and it should

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.660 
thermometer into the glass and it should
read<00:01:57.549> 32<00:01:58.299> degrees<00:01:58.659> if<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.649> does<00:01:59.799> not<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.609> can

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
read 32 degrees if it does not you can

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.029 
read 32 degrees if it does not you can
use<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.119> nut<00:02:01.569> on<00:02:01.749> the<00:02:01.899> bottom<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.469> adjust<00:02:02.859> it

use the nut on the bottom to adjust it

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.969 
use the nut on the bottom to adjust it
so<00:02:03.249> it<00:02:03.340> does<00:02:03.549> read<00:02:03.759> 32<00:02:04.179> degrees<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:05.590> check<00:02:05.859> that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
so it does read 32 degrees to check that
