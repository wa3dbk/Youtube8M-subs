00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 there are 8 kilometers from here to the sea 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 open three gray whales are 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.460
 trapped between ice walls there are 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 whales with problems and they do not call me no 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.620
 I have called you because there is nothing 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.090
 can you do this is dad 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.090

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.470
 we present you the film of ken kwapis 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.960
 a wonderful adventure in this 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.970
 narration very well told because he is 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 a specialist in television series 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.820
 with a great attraction for young people 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.160
 tells a true story what 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.890
 really happened is that three whales 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.040
 they were trapped in the polar circle 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.180
 Arctic will take the icebreaker up 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.520
 where he is desperately needed 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.040
 all focus on the monumental task 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.250
 to save the whales 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.120
 they had to come to help them not only 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.760
 the alaska police but also the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.100
 own administration of the president 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.650
 Reagan at that moment about to leave 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.560
 the presidency and I needed to grow 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.799
 in popularity 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.009
 even two union icebreakers 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.649
 Soviet all this union had as its 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.950
 protagonists to a limitation of 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.470
 greenpeace and also a journalist who 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.229
 I wanted to give news that reached the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.340
 world and the truth is that this news is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.750
 became a media event 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.509
 of the entire population of the world that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.490
 was pending for a few days of 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.090
 these three whales this has been 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.009
 become a well-narrated film 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.290
 interesting where also we also 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.930
 place the character of a child 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.620
 esteemed that also implies his people 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.830
 to the Inuit 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.500
 from his experience in the middle of 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.870
 alaska will also help to rescue 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 these whales very different interests 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.880
 but all at the service of a good 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.880
 causes the perspective of conservation 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.830
 of nature the grateful look at 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.600
 the creation presents us 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.750
 characters that after facing 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.690
 although they have different perspectives 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.940
 collaborate to bring forward those 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.040
 cetaceans that finally manage to survive 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.960
 a film that we advise you for 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.940
 family audience also for the most 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.940
 small and that will interest you 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.680
 everything both children and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.680
 working to open an exit 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.960
 where they were has not appeared here 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.860
 maybe he's hurt you can not go down there 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.860
 it's very dangerous 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.340
 to which you can arrive on time 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.870
 belongs to the Soviets in dreams 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.670
 I'll let the reds solve this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.670
 then these whales will die 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.000
 although they are large and powerful 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.659
 closely resemble us are 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.220
 vulnerable we are scared and sometimes 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.220
 we also need help
