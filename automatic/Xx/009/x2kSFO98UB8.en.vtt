00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.250
 but 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.320
 here these brands are not business you Anton 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.930
 golden apple studios today we 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.430
 try installing smart moving for 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.260
 minecraft 1 4 7 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.750
 principle, there will be absolutely any version 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.849
 if you follow the link to one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.360
 saytik and there you can choose your 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.090
 version of 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.670
 what you need is player appia 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.320
 wagon for its version of minecraft 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 also for my version and the set 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.390
 smart moving of namely this kit 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.970
 enters 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.629
 for client and for server installation for 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.079
 client that for server 1 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.219
 practically the same just in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.410
 smart moving 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.180
 can work with mantla blow well me 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.489
 accustomed to playing with my howard after all 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 he is somehow much better ie you 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.390
 open this one here and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.100
 flip the file you need that is 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.750
 either to the server or to the client if you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.789
 you want to play on the server then you all 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.300
 equal in my opinion you need to install it 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.890
 touch and for clients so but this 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.170
 Now we postpone, that is, here are our three 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.600
 the file namely three archives which us 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.509
 you need to start first install 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.990
 with minecraft damage immediately say that what 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.939
 you definitely need to minekravt 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 was absolutely clean without any could 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.070
 strikes without any mods extra 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.470
 established that is here after 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.750
 installation and forger while you can 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.630
 install absolutely any mods already 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:52.090
 without fear that you will fly so 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.719
 and now, just without thinking, we throw 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:02.200
 and re- archives another but of course 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:05.950
 this is all a matter of replacing and the firm is showing 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.519
 tap further we need player api 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.810
 we allocate it too and just spear us 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:16.300
 here hands after carbon paper 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.410
 after we copied yes we 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.560
 Now we delete the daddy not meta-inf 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.030
 generally mercilessly and remove perfectly well 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.790
 now we go out 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.870
 they run our firmware then what 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.870
 he works for us 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.450
 and make sure that he works exactly 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.030
 look down so it turn out left 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.830
 the corner we should have maykravt and 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.970
 our version is some additional 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.000
 data 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.180
 version of damage and and the fact that we have 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.370
 installed 4 mod and not about all four 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.800
 more precisely active also we can check 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.470
 What mods are installed by clicking 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.990
 on the mods button and here we must mouth 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.040
 see 4 standard mods which 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.310
 must necessarily have all namely 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.080
 so but the aura of fashion in general should not be here 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.120
 essentially the forge modloader mantra 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.100
 a square can even have three 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.370
 be on ordinary 4 I personally light up and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.370
 not so important okay after we 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.780
 checked out what maykravt forge us 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.940
 established in our graph remains us 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.760
 The last file is a smartphone for 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.030
 customer what to do with it is very simple we 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.740
 go to the mods folder which lies. 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.290
 minecraft just throw it here 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.550
 do not forget what the brain has installed 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.430
 only appears when we 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.650
 correctly set mikroft well here 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.980
 now everything is now coming back to 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.500
 minecraft now we see what we have 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.660
 increased by two mod immediately check 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.460
 the fact that we have established smart moving 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.400
 have mount render 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.050
 ok click done now lead in 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.470
 single player game and check what we have 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.940
 everything works i will come and created by me 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.940
 new map click yes 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.960
 Excellent smartphones installed on medium 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:27.520
 ie it features should work well, even 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.620
 I do not know how to check then yes everything works 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.319
 Here I climb I feel that this is all 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.740
 it goes smoothly and itâ€™s fine 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:38.259
 smartphone is established and it's great well 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.569
 and the next video I will do a full review 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.750
 this smart moment has it 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:46.389
 I will probably demonstrate the possibilities 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.860
 that's it. Anton was not there. 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.009
