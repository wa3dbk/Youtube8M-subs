00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
performance of the system but

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.420 
performance of the system but
specifically<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.860> comes<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> graphics

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
specifically when it comes to graphics

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.099 
specifically when it comes to graphics
supposedly<00:00:57.270> microsoft<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> be

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
supposedly microsoft is going to be

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
supposedly microsoft is going to be
taking<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> percentage<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.280> Kinect

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
taking a percentage of the Kinect

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.790 
taking a percentage of the Kinect
performance<00:01:00.449> power<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.960> putting<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> back

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
performance power and putting that back

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.410 
performance power and putting that back
into<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> rest<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> system<00:01:03.030> making<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
into the rest of the system making the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.880 
into the rest of the system making the
games<00:01:03.660> run<00:01:03.960> smoother<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:04.830> bit

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
games run smoother and a little bit

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.469 
games run smoother and a little bit
faster<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.670> sounds<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.150> well<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> good

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
faster now this sounds all well and good

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.120 
faster now this sounds all well and good
and<00:01:06.600> that's<00:01:06.780> great<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.140> Xbox<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.680> owners<00:01:07.979> but

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and that's great for Xbox one owners but

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.740 
and that's great for Xbox one owners but
why<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.520> taken<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> long<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.689> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
why has it taken it this long for this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600 
why has it taken it this long for this
to<00:01:09.810> happen<00:01:10.140> since<00:01:10.799> both<00:01:11.040> systems<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.520> been

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to happen since both systems have been

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.550 
to happen since both systems have been
out<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> ps4<00:01:12.180> has<00:01:12.390> been<00:01:12.720> winning<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> console

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
out the ps4 has been winning the console

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
out the ps4 has been winning the console
wars<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.310> mainly<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.939> its

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
wars and that's mainly because if its

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
wars and that's mainly because if its
overall<00:01:15.299> better<00:01:15.659> performance<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.650> xbox<00:01:17.040> one

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
overall better performance the xbox one

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
overall better performance the xbox one
maybe<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.880> all-in-one<00:01:18.479> entertainment

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
maybe the all-in-one entertainment

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
maybe the all-in-one entertainment
system<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.340> comes<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> just

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
system but when it comes down to just

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
system but when it comes down to just
gaming<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.689> ps4<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.290> taking<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> lead<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:22.979> we

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
gaming the ps4 is taking the lead now we

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.010 
gaming the ps4 is taking the lead now we
can<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> long<00:01:23.909> discussion<00:01:24.210> about<00:01:24.390> which

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
can get to a long discussion about which

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.630 
can get to a long discussion about which
system<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.500> better<00:01:25.680> than<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> other<00:01:25.950> based<00:01:26.430> on

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
system is better than the other based on

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.010 
system is better than the other based on
your<00:01:26.850> personal<00:01:27.299> assumptions<00:01:27.720> or<00:01:27.810> my<00:01:27.960> personal

your personal assumptions or my personal

your personal assumptions or my personal
assumptions<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.860> feelings<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
assumptions or feelings but when you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.800 
assumptions or feelings but when you
take<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> comparison<00:01:30.570> between

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
take a look at the comparison between

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.440 
take a look at the comparison between
some<00:01:31.229> ps4<00:01:31.740> gameplay<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.460> some<00:01:32.820> xbox<00:01:33.180> one

some ps4 gameplay and some xbox one

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060 
some ps4 gameplay and some xbox one
gameplay<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.320> difference<00:01:34.650> becomes<00:01:34.860> pretty

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
gameplay the difference becomes pretty

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.249 
gameplay the difference becomes pretty
clear<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> most<00:01:36.299> obvious<00:01:36.509> examples

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
clear one of the most obvious examples

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.390 
clear one of the most obvious examples
of<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.920> Tomb<00:01:38.100> Raider<00:01:38.130> definitive

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
or not it is nice to see that Microsoft

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.889 
or not it is nice to see that Microsoft
is<00:02:02.070> actually<00:02:02.670> making<00:02:02.850> an<00:02:03.030> attempt<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> get

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
back in the good graces with gamers

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.760 
back in the good graces with gamers
because<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> Xbox<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.719> has<00:02:06.960> been<00:02:07.350> touted<00:02:07.500> as

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
because the Xbox one has been touted as

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
because the Xbox one has been touted as
the<00:02:07.829> less<00:02:08.160> gay<00:02:08.429> more<00:02:08.640> friendly<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> two

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the less gay more friendly of the two

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.880 
the less gay more friendly of the two
