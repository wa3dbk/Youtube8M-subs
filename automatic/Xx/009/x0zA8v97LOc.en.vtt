00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.740
 hey people i like opera over and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.750
 Welcome to this video and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.009
 Today I'll tell you about ten facts 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.619
 spongebob probably not yet 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.320
 knew day one is the spongebob on the 14th 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.630
 July was born in 1986 that is only 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.000
 now 29 years old packs two is that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.080
 bikini bottom of the place where spongebob and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.180
 the others and to ground 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.609
 that this place is based on a real one 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.859
 I know when I'm on which but 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.489
 interesting there are definitely somewhere 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.040
 is different and so no idea 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.180
 maybe streets and the ract is 3 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.340
 what you know for sure now what you guys 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.070
 just did not notice that miss it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 fits the driving school teacher that the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.969
 the only main character is yes 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.860
 Fish is because the others are all 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.780
 no fish so there is a sponge 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.280
 and starfish and so on fact is 4 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.379
 the spongebob actually spongebob 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.750
 should be called but spongebob there 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.309
 was protected but that name had 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.780
 they call him spike and I believe 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.589
 spongebob is also really cooler than 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.479
 incentive 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 I do not know about two does not fit 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.549
 to spongebob I think what do you say to that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.040
 you find it better in the sport of 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.130
 sport.de comments on 26 august 2002 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.299
 was spongebobs first time on super rtl 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.810
 aired and of course I was the one 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.130
 The very first to see this is six 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.560
 I also found quite starkly the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.420
 spongebob aired in 170 countries 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.040
 is it really crass fell I did not know 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.939
 that sometimes really so blatant 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.090
 is common 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.479
 170 countries checkout is the fact 7 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.369
 Spongebob has a total of 374 employees 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.250
 of the month in the krabe crab became 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.380
 I also like to play 374 times 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.619
 become employee of the month 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.210
 how many years will that be for many 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.039
 fakt what is now not necessarily what 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.720
 but has to do with the series spongebob 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.340
 Actually even that barack obama 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.770
 fan is and also with his children 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.829
 Look, I think I'm cool 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.899
 just like the barack obama in his 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:09.500
 couch like he has spongebob 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.780
 his driving license and 258,000 56 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.330
 not passed 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.040
 crass I do not know where from this 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.410
 So I'm not showing 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.799
 everything looked through and counted 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.769
 no the last fact is that stephen 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.110
 hillenburg has sport weapons and he was 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.420
 marine biologist, too 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.950
 probably in the sea so that was now 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.180
 even with these ten facts the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.739
 probably not yet about that 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.730
 portal knew and if you which of them 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.959
 knew then you can me the gladly 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.519

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.170
