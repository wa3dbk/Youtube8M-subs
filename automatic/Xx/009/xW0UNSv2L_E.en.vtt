00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.099
 I decided that I wanted to make a 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.339
 played in Chinese style I saw a 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.970
 picture once I found it cool and came to look for 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:19.340
 Bamboo I found but bamboo I only got 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.099
 and then moving the sawing pulling 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.779
 jeep 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.000
 Unfortunately I did not do it well. 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.259
 Cool, it was not very easy. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.930
 I had to pull 44 very heavy and I'm 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.550
 suffering to close the bamboo works 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.750
 bamboo bow 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.750
 it was not easy to err 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 better for the standing cearÃ¡ but I'm 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.199
 tired as this would only be a piece 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.199
 from street 8 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.200
 I think you abducted by day 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.280
 to be really good, I need to be 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.400
 another piece of bamboo to leave everyone 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.869
 uniform procedures but I do not 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:02:17.310
 I'm going to do this, it's very tiring if 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:02:20.040
 floated it has to be right here that 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.890
 two people to saw using the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.250
 open saw she did not learn much in 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250
 bamboo 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.090
 My gosh, I want to fall into the water without 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.090
 played 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.280
 I never know how to cut it out. 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.280
 it's not easy 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.250
 I already saw that buoy 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.590
 I just do not know if I'll cut enough 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.650
 support my weight but I'm with a 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.650
 lazy bastard back pain 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.930
 I'll try with that, I'll use a 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.950
 polypropylene rope of two 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.290
 mm 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.290
 I chose to tie square for safety 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.390
 start from the same tunnel 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.240
 begins with whites 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.220
 the square mark is because if a 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.220
 cord munch on the peak all morning 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.700
 then the first brand in Portuguese 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.990
 doing a little preparation to try 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.530
 more stability because I do not 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.720
 I cut a lot of bamboo now if I'm short 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.590
 to navigate 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.590
 I'm going to cut more 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.820
 there the real fire without tools 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.290
 Adequate if feeding badly will take time 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:38.180
 days to make a play of this is not 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:40.220
 easy even more if you do not have rope will 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.480
 take much even that the film 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.840
 shipwreck that it takes a few days to 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:58.250
 build his boat fit nor 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:05:00.650
 Realistic I do not know if I can 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.390
 drag alone 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.390
 30 meters to water 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.940
 I do not know if it will float me itself 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.110
 ae 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.690
 I took two liters of water 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:30.130
 I'm almost building here all day. 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.130
 I will not build river 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.550
 now the challenge put in the water I do not 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.330
 build very close to the water for 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.330
 sunshine cause 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.150
 but it's better to do 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.560
 build a move was really cool 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:51.490
 tiring is a guy alone in a 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.110
 survival situation with machete knife 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.630
 natural rope will take days to 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.430
 make the badly fed face even more 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.930
 who do not have adequate resources to 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:04.250
 suitable tools 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.930
 It's very difficult, it's on the other hand. 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:10.520
 rewarding to take a walk after 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:13.790
 You end up in the mail, I think I will. 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.960
 make an improved second play 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:20.390
 When I have time I did not put faith 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.960
 I was upset that I had to carry 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.960
 alone 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.020
 It worked 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.910

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.870
 even twice a week 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.210
