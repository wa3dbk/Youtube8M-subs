okay this is just a quick race between
the<00:00:05.100> toyota<00:00:05.640> 86<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.420> mclaren<00:00:06.810> p1<00:00:06.990> i'm

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
driving both of them which is why it's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.049

to<00:00:20.340> our<00:00:20.640> 891<00:00:21.560> I<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:23.039> wanted<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.279> use<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to our 891 I just wanted to use this to

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.240 
to our 891 I just wanted to use this to
show<00:00:24.150> off<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.600> difference<00:00:25.199> between<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.710> cars

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
show off the difference between the cars

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.490 
show off the difference between the cars
and<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.269> our<00:00:27.510> cars<00:00:27.900> handled<00:00:28.380> differently

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and and our cars handled differently

depending<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.849> know<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
depending on you know it's not like that

power level dictates everything about
them<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> already<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.780> 86<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:35.430> very

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
them you can already see the 86 is very

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.200 
them you can already see the 86 is very
hard<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> take<00:00:36.360> around<00:00:36.600> corners<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:38.030> slips<00:00:39.030> out

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
hard to take around corners it slips out

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
hard to take around corners it slips out
very<00:00:39.510> easily<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.110> doesn't<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.620> much

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
very easily it doesn't have as much

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.000 
very easily it doesn't have as much
braking<00:00:41.390> ability<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.170> McLaren<00:00:43.860> which

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
braking ability as the McLaren which

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.650 
braking ability as the McLaren which
obviously<00:00:44.550> has<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:45.090> wider<00:00:45.329> wheel<00:00:45.629> base

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
obviously has a much wider wheel base

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
obviously has a much wider wheel base
better<00:00:46.410> aerodynamics<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.180> carries<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
better aerodynamics and that carries a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.880 
better aerodynamics and that carries a
little<00:00:48.750> wing<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> fly<00:00:49.350> itself<00:00:49.590> whenever

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
little wing that fly itself whenever

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.920 
little wing that fly itself whenever
it's<00:00:50.370> trying<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> slow<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> speed

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it's trying to slow down on the speed

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.040 
it's trying to slow down on the speed
meanwhile<00:00:52.890> everything<00:00:53.789> about<00:00:54.300> breaking<00:00:54.750> has

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
meanwhile everything about breaking has

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
meanwhile everything about breaking has
to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.289> done<00:00:55.469> done<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> brakes<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
third 86 and it has a tendency to look

third 86 and it has a tendency to look
up<00:01:00.059> very<00:01:00.329> easily<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.829> occasionally

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
up very easily you can see occasionally

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.390 
up very easily you can see occasionally
the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.080 
the
the<00:01:03.880> wheels<00:01:04.090> will<00:01:04.810> lock<00:01:05.080> up<00:01:05.140> just<00:01:05.770> for<00:01:06.090> almost

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
the wheels will lock up just for almost

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.600 
the wheels will lock up just for almost
no<00:01:07.270> reason<00:01:07.690> it's<00:01:07.900> it's<00:01:08.560> complicated<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:09.280> drive

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
no reason it's it's complicated to drive

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.030 
no reason it's it's complicated to drive
but<00:01:10.480> it's<00:01:10.600> still<00:01:10.750> beautiful<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.410> love<00:01:11.440> driving

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
but it's still beautiful I love driving

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.910 
but it's still beautiful I love driving
my<00:01:12.340> Toyota<00:01:12.730> 86<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.660> screwed<00:01:14.170> up<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.680> side

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
my Toyota 86 I screwed up in the side

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.340 
my Toyota 86 I screwed up in the side
and<00:01:15.190> making<00:01:15.610> this<00:01:15.730> video<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.090> little<00:01:16.330> bit<00:01:16.450> and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
and making this video a little bit and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.400 
and making this video a little bit and
then<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.590> left<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.280> top<00:01:18.820> speed<00:01:19.210> tune<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:20.290> I

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
then I left the top speed tune that I

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.680 
then I left the top speed tune that I
had<00:01:20.530> made<00:01:20.770> for<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.220> tone<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.520> 86<00:01:22.360> when<00:01:22.540> I<00:01:22.600> took

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
had made for the tone of 86 when I took

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.600 
had made for the tone of 86 when I took
around<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.170> Indiana<00:01:23.620> speed<00:01:24.400> bar

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
around the Indiana speed bar

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.200 
around the Indiana speed bar
Indianapolis<00:01:25.420> Speedway<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.940> was<00:01:27.940> trying<00:01:28.090> to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
Indianapolis Speedway I was trying to

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.510 
Indianapolis Speedway I was trying to
get<00:01:28.360> as<00:01:28.480> fastest<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.560> go<00:01:29.680> as<00:01:29.800> fast<00:01:29.980> as<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.340> could

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
get as fastest to go as fast as it could

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.940 
get as fastest to go as fast as it could
it<00:01:30.730> it<00:01:31.030> gets<00:01:31.120> up<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.420> around<00:01:31.630> 350<00:01:32.560> kilometers

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
it it gets up to around 350 kilometers

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.980 
it it gets up to around 350 kilometers
an<00:01:33.070> hour<00:01:33.190> but<00:01:33.820> I've<00:01:33.940> left<00:01:34.120> it<00:01:34.300> on<00:01:34.360> for<00:01:34.630> this

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
an hour but I've left it on for this

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.930 
an hour but I've left it on for this
race<00:01:35.170> around<00:01:35.380> Silverstone<00:01:36.010> which<00:01:36.610> isn't

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
race around Silverstone which isn't

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.180 
race around Silverstone which isn't
ideal<00:01:37.030> because<00:01:37.660> I<00:01:37.990> but<00:01:38.350> close<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.830> gear<00:01:39.040> ratio

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
ideal because I but close the gear ratio

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.859 
ideal because I but close the gear ratio
a<00:01:39.460> little<00:01:39.729> bit<00:01:39.820> in<00:01:39.970> my<00:01:40.119> be<00:01:40.270> able<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.600> accelerate

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
a little bit in my be able to accelerate

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.260 
a little bit in my be able to accelerate
out<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.920> apex<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.400> horns<00:01:42.729> will<00:01:42.880> be<00:01:43.060> better

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
out of the apex of horns will be better

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.900 
out of the apex of horns will be better
and<00:01:43.630> what<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.229> right<00:01:44.500> now<00:01:44.560> as<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:45.670> see

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
and what it is right now as you can see

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.810 
and what it is right now as you can see
it's<00:01:46.150> slightly<00:01:46.780> behind<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.500> flaring<00:01:47.820> which

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
it's slightly behind and flaring which

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.650 
it's slightly behind and flaring which
you<00:01:49.270> know<00:01:49.390> obviously<00:01:49.720> isn't<00:01:50.380> perfect<00:01:51.660> Clarent

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
you know obviously isn't perfect Clarent

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.600 
you know obviously isn't perfect Clarent
has<00:01:52.780> its<00:01:53.110> own<00:01:53.260> disadvantage<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:54.040> that<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:54.220> never

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
has its own disadvantage in that I never

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.670
