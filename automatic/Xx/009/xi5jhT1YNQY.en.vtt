00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.790 

first<00:00:33.870> I'm<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> kind<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.879> fast

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
first I'm going to do it kind of fast

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.540 
first I'm going to do it kind of fast
and<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:39.110> we'll<00:00:40.110> slow<00:00:40.380> it<00:00:40.500> down<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.130> you<00:00:41.219> kind

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and then we'll slow it down so you kind

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.670 
and then we'll slow it down so you kind
of<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.730> idea<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.170> doing

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of get the idea how you go about doing

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
of get the idea how you go about doing
the<00:00:43.890> magical<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:44.750> after<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:45.899> practice<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the magical not after some practice this

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.430 
the magical not after some practice this
is<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> should<00:00:46.800> look<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> again

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is what it should look like and again

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.900 
is what it should look like and again
like<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> said<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> perfect<00:00:53.460> way<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> end<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
like I said it's a perfect way to end a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.100 
like I said it's a perfect way to end a
routine<00:00:54.270> after<00:00:54.539> some<00:00:54.809> tricks<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> basically

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
routine after some tricks so basically

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.529 
routine after some tricks so basically
what<00:00:58.110> you're<00:00:58.140> doing<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:59.629> a<00:01:00.680> sequence<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
what you're doing is a sequence of

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.510 
what you're doing is a sequence of
twists<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.660> turns<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:04.289> strings<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
twists and turns with the strings to

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.560 
twists and turns with the strings to
make<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.899> one<00:01:07.289> big<00:01:08.270> jumble<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
make it look like a one big jumble of a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.649 
make it look like a one big jumble of a
mess<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> slow<00:01:12.420> mo

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
mess and now we're going to do a slow mo

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.740 
mess and now we're going to do a slow mo
for<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:14.760> might<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.119> easier<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
for you it might be easier to have a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.300 
for you it might be easier to have a
friend<00:01:16.110> hold<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> Diablo<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.189> you're

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
friend hold the Diablo when you're

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
friend hold the Diablo when you're
learning<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:19.260> can

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
learning how to do this if not you can

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.899 
learning how to do this if not you can
just<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> carpet<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.640> about

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
go under the DI block then you're going

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
go under the DI block then you're going
to<00:01:34.500> take<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> left<00:01:35.009> hand<00:01:35.189> stick<00:01:35.400> again<00:01:35.759> go

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
to take the left hand stick again go

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.999 
to take the left hand stick again go
behind<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.049> stick<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.770> under<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> Diablo

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
behind the stick and under the Diablo

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.969 
behind the stick and under the Diablo
opposite<00:01:41.009> direction<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:42.500> can<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.619> under<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
opposite direction I can get under the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.219 
opposite direction I can get under the
Diablo<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:45.689> you're<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.960> bring<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
Diablo and then you're going to bring it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.220 
Diablo and then you're going to bring it
up<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.009> over<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.490> stick<00:01:47.759> again

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.770 

stretch<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.340> out<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.460> little<00:01:54.670> bit<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:55.660> it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
stretch it out a little bit and it

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.860 
stretch it out a little bit and it
should<00:01:55.960> come<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.170> off<00:01:57.330> again<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.600> might<00:01:58.720> be

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
should come right off again it might be

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.600 
should come right off again it might be
easier<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.230> have<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.410> friend<00:01:59.680> hold<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.100> Diablo

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
easier to have a friend hold the Diablo

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.970 
easier to have a friend hold the Diablo
otherwise<00:02:01.540> it's<00:02:02.320> kind<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.650> pain<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:02.950> the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
otherwise it's kind of a pain in the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.400 
otherwise it's kind of a pain in the
butt<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.190> do<00:02:03.370> on<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.580> carpet<00:02:04.000> but<00:02:04.870> with<00:02:04.930> a

butt to do on the carpet but with a

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.890 
butt to do on the carpet but with a
little<00:02:05.530> bit<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.830> practice<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.670> should<00:02:07.540> be

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
little bit of practice you should be

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.200 
little bit of practice you should be
able<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.260> it<00:02:08.350> quite<00:02:08.740> quickly<00:02:08.980> and<00:02:09.430> it's<00:02:10.119> a
