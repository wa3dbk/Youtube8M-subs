 up in the beautiful choral tones and we 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.630
 start right away with the bremer of Mary 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:44.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 I generously distribute this color for you 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.070
 I use my eyelashes the bright one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.070
 to do for themselves 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.159
 for the accents namely a light brown 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.300
 I always wear these in the outer v 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.740
 and they stay good afterwards 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.740
 that a smooth transition arises 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.890
 from hailer I wear now a 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.209

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.659
 infobox 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.079
 then I take under the eyebrows 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.079
 again the bright tone 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.379

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.540

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.049

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.860
