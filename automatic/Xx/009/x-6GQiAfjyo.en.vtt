00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
you put the lemon upside down because

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.620 
you put the lemon upside down because
you've<00:03:17.609> got<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> holes<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.359> bottom

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
good leverage and we need a 3/4 of an

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.470 
good leverage and we need a 3/4 of an
ounce<00:03:42.590> now<00:03:43.590> let's<00:03:43.769> twist<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.579> lemon<00:03:44.940> over<00:03:45.150> and

through which I personally think would

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.979

add better flavor to it okay and I got

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.100 
almost three-quarters of an ounce
let's<00:04:04.710> go<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.360> I've<00:04:06.360> got<00:04:06.540> some<00:04:06.720> previously

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
let's go and I've got some previously

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.410 
let's go and I've got some previously
squeezed<00:04:07.560> lemon<00:04:08.370> juice<00:04:08.520> here<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.970> top<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.330> out

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
squeezed lemon juice here to top it out

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.720 
squeezed lemon juice here to top it out
with<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.420> there<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:12.750> go

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
with and there we go

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.070 
with and there we go
so<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:14.760> think<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.150> think<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.630> worked<00:04:15.780> pretty<00:04:15.900> well

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
so I think I think it worked pretty well

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.470 
so I think I think it worked pretty well
it's<00:04:16.260> nice<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.560> small<00:04:16.790> it's<00:04:17.790> not<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.239> sort<00:04:18.420> of

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
it's nice and small it's not the sort of

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.060 
it's nice and small it's not the sort of
thing<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.720> do<00:04:18.840> high-volume<00:04:19.380> squeezing<00:04:19.950> with

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
thing you do high-volume squeezing with

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.370 
thing you do high-volume squeezing with
it<00:04:20.250> be<00:04:20.310> cocktail<00:04:20.760> at<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.970> time<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:22.080> if<00:04:22.200> you're<00:04:22.350> a

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
it be cocktail at a time so if you're a

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.990 
it be cocktail at a time so if you're a
bar<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.340> want<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.520> take<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.790> squeeze

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
bar and you want to take and squeeze

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 
bar and you want to take and squeeze
three<00:04:24.300> or<00:04:24.420> four<00:04:24.600> lemons<00:04:24.870> at<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.050> time<00:04:25.230> might<00:04:25.980> not

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
three or four lemons at a time might not

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.800 
three or four lemons at a time might not
be<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.490> right<00:04:26.640> thing<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:26.970> one<00:04:27.150> cocktail<00:04:27.390> time

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
be the right thing but one cocktail time

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.810 
be the right thing but one cocktail time
I<00:04:27.930> think<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.230> might<00:04:28.410> work<00:04:28.440> pretty<00:04:28.800> well

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:43.900 

now<00:04:32.820> we're<00:04:32.940> gonna<00:04:33.030> shake<00:04:33.270> this<00:04:33.390> up<00:04:33.510> with<00:04:33.660> ice

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.150 

now<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:44.940> do<00:04:45.750> have<00:04:45.930> some<00:04:46.230> friends<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.770> mine<00:04:46.950> who

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
now I do have some friends of mine who

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.790 
now I do have some friends of mine who
have<00:04:47.450> complained<00:04:48.450> about<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:49.200> white<00:04:49.410> lady

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
have complained about the white lady

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.230 
have complained about the white lady
recipe<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.430> have<00:04:50.520> listed<00:04:50.670> on<00:04:50.910> drink<00:04:51.120> boy

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.620 
recipe that I have listed on drink boy

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
calm is not having egg white in it they

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.840 
calm is not having egg white in it they

say the proper white lady has a quintet

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.230 
say the proper white lady has a quintet
that's<00:04:57.150> why<00:04:57.330> it's<00:04:57.450> called<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.870> white<00:04:58.080> lady

that's why it's called a white lady

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.070 
that's why it's called a white lady
unfortunately<00:05:00.240> Harry<00:05:00.510> Mac<00:05:00.690> Lahani<00:05:00.930> who

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
unfortunately Harry Mac Lahani who

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.480 
unfortunately Harry Mac Lahani who
invented<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.500> drink<00:05:01.560> had<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.190> couple

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
invented the drink had a couple

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.770 
invented the drink had a couple
variations<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.180> rink<00:05:03.300> which<00:05:03.420> clearly

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
variations of the rink which clearly

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.180 
variations of the rink which clearly
didn't<00:05:04.020> have<00:05:04.170> egg<00:05:04.440> white<00:05:04.680> in<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.070> so

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
didn't have egg white in it and so

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.680 
didn't have egg white in it and so
that's<00:05:05.340> really<00:05:05.820> not<00:05:05.970> where<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.300> name<00:05:06.420> came

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
that's really not where the name came

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.340 
that's really not where the name came
from

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
from

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.720 
from
I<00:05:07.380> think<00:05:08.040> egg<00:05:08.190> white<00:05:08.370> would<00:05:08.520> make<00:05:08.610> an

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
I think egg white would make an

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.490 
I think egg white would make an
excellent<00:05:08.820> version<00:05:09.330> of<00:05:09.419> this<00:05:09.510> but<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.410> don't

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
excellent version of this but I don't

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.710 
excellent version of this but I don't
think<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:11.130> was<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.640> original<00:05:12.060> version<00:05:12.510> so

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
think that was the original version so

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.230 
think that was the original version so
Ted<00:05:13.680> if<00:05:13.890> you're<00:05:14.010> out<00:05:14.130> there<00:05:14.160> listening<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
Ted if you're out there listening the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.700 
Ted if you're out there listening the
white<00:05:15.419> lady<00:05:15.720> doesn't<00:05:16.290> have<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.530> have<00:05:16.620> egg

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
white lady doesn't have to have egg

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:29.840 
white lady doesn't have to have egg
white<00:05:16.890> but<00:05:17.070> you<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.250> add<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.460> if<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.640> want<00:05:28.850> you

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
white but you can add it if you want you

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.330 
white but you can add it if you want you
kind<00:05:30.090> of<00:05:30.240> think<00:05:30.450> of<00:05:30.510> this<00:05:30.630> as<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.840> gin<00:05:31.650> sidecar

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
kind of think of this as a gin sidecar

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.260 
kind of think of this as a gin sidecar
at<00:05:32.640> a<00:05:32.669> certain<00:05:32.970> level<00:05:37.790> another<00:05:38.790> name<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.180> you

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
at a certain level another name that you

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.850 
at a certain level another name that you
sometimes<00:05:39.750> see<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.350> version<00:05:40.590> of<00:05:40.770> the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
sometimes see this version of the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.650 
sometimes see this version of the
strengthless<00:05:41.160> before<00:05:41.520> is<00:05:41.580> also<00:05:41.850> in<00:05:41.940> Delilah

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
strengthless before is also in Delilah

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.390 
strengthless before is also in Delilah
so<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.169> have<00:05:43.290> two<00:05:43.530> drinks<00:05:43.860> now<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.070> same

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
so you have two drinks now the same

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.370 
so you have two drinks now the same
recipe<00:05:44.790> by<00:05:44.910> different<00:05:45.360> names<00:05:45.570> which<00:05:46.260> is

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
recipe by different names which is

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.140 
recipe by different names which is
another<00:05:46.530> interesting<00:05:46.890> problem<00:05:47.790> people<00:05:47.940> run

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
another interesting problem people run

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:57.140 
another interesting problem people run
into<00:05:54.650> so<00:05:55.650> since<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.370> drink<00:05:56.610> is<00:05:56.760> going<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.060> be

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
into so since the drink is going to be

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.580 
into so since the drink is going to be
cloudy<00:05:57.390> from<00:05:57.600> lemon<00:05:57.840> juice<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.290> shake<00:05:58.560> it

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
cloudy from lemon juice I shake it

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.050 
cloudy from lemon juice I shake it
rather<00:05:58.919> than<00:05:59.130> stir<00:05:59.400> it<00:06:01.370> it's<00:06:02.370> got<00:06:02.520> that<00:06:02.640> crisp

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
rather than stir it it's got that crisp

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.909 
rather than stir it it's got that crisp
lemon<00:06:03.540> flavor<00:06:03.900> that's<00:06:04.230> coming<00:06:04.470> off

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
lemon flavor that's coming off

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.590 
lemon flavor that's coming off
I<00:06:04.950> believe<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.700> oils<00:06:06.060> are<00:06:06.180> adding<00:06:06.390> quite<00:06:06.540> a

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
I believe the oils are adding quite a

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.700 
I believe the oils are adding quite a
bit<00:06:06.750> to<00:06:06.840> that<00:06:06.990> as<00:06:07.080> well<00:06:07.230> of<00:06:07.320> course<00:06:07.350> in<00:06:07.650> the

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
bit to that as well of course in the

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.070 
bit to that as well of course in the
lemon<00:06:07.950> juices<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.460> bringing<00:06:09.060> that<00:06:09.090> forward

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.870 

that<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.289> tart<00:06:15.530> Tang<00:06:15.830> with<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> sweetness

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
that the tart Tang with the sweetness

softening it out and the gin notes I
