00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.960
 hi friends video on firmware january 7 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.090
 and 2 I already showed how adapt Ivan I 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.039
 I use for flashing whether full 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.330
 I want to show you 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.380
 a small set of this soldered 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.090
 independently which allows both 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.699
 reflash electronic components so and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.150
 make their diagnostics including 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 this set is used to configure 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.510
 electronic unit firmware and so on 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.010
 the basis is taken k-line adapter to it food 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.800
 three wiring is power plus minus and 3 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.190
 postings and such a line by which 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.539
 firmware and diagnostics for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.449
 not to mess around constantly with 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.480
 wires with firmware and then with 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.739
 diagnostics because the firmware is needed 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.070
 your own set of wires for diagnosing your 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:10.189
 k-line adapter were soldered 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.299
 set adventure connectors for 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.299
 diagnostics or firmware on the fly 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.100
 it happens that during the diagnosis 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.250
 need to be directly at 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.670
 engine compartment 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.659
 together with a laptop for test 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.460
 actuators such as 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.770
 nozzles either when testing ignition 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.590
 and the length of the adapter itself is certainly not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.259
 there is therefore enough to solve 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 this problem can be used 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.060
 usb extension cable 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.119
 I now have a short extension cord 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 which is used for flashing 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.380
 block 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.140
 but if there is not enough length 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.710
 here you can attach and usb extension cable 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.950
 up to five meters for diagnosis 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.380
 car was purchased from the connector 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.880
 obd2 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.380
 which wires are already soldered 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.940
 corresponding connectors and now 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.830
 to make a diagnosis 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.280
 just connect the k-line wires 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.280
 adapter 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:33.690
 with diagnostics 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.690
 we connect to the line adapter to the laptop 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.470
 wait for the diagnosis, respectively 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.410
 we connect nent me nent 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.270
 we start the connector on the car 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.170
 program on a laptop and produce 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.110
 car diagnostics happen that 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.520
 electronic unit need to repaint 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.850
 many times when messing around with these 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.860
 detach each aim at a contact 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.080
 or this block delivers it all 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.470
 tremendous discomfort therefore was 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.470
 purchased 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:17.830
 connector January 7 2 and their analogues 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:22.110
 wires were also soldered to it 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.110
 corresponding connectors on the end 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:41.569
 and now in order to replace the wires 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.730
 to diagnose the unit or to flash 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:49.519
 all it takes is very short 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:54.609
 The time interval of the wire is connected from 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.609
 tons of ball we collect connect 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.470
 that's all very fast and convenient 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:11.640
 I also provided for one more let's say 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.820
 option for flashing 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.600
 electronic unit powered desktop at home 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:24.550
 I take from the battery 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:28.240
 accordingly in order to power 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.200
 block for flashing i use 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.760
 crocodile who also has 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.120
 end connectors 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.730
 but in order to produce firmware 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.810
 block car 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.810
 I take power from the cigarette lighter 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.340
 if need flashing 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.080
 electronic unit January 5 1 or their 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.270
 counterparts have also been acquired 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.090
 matching connector 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.990
 fifty 5 pin for firmware 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.990
 such blocks 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.690
 The connector consists of several parts according to 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:21.100
 As a matter of course it is much worse 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:24.530
 than factory but nonetheless for 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:30.740
 jointing or for making them either 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:33.770
 adapters it is quite suitable for 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.050
 of such quality therefore now 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.620
 wire connection for firmware block 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.550
 either for diagnostics going on very 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.550
 fast and convenient 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.430
 all until we meet again
