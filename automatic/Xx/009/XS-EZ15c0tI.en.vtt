00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello, I'm a doctor and he cooks for me all 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.200
 today we are going to make a recipe dedicated to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.360
 the smallest of the house is known 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.670
 as sarchÃ­ pasta and to make it we are going to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.940
 need the following ingredients 2 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.650
 sausages 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.330
 approximately 50 grams of spaghetti 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.920
 to cook we are going to need water 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.280
 a splash of oil 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.260
 a pinch of salt and to complement the 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.900
 sauce that you like most I will use 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.820
 fried tomato and if you want to know how it 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.430
 do it at home I'll leave you a 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.080
 link down the description first thing 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.880
 what we will do is cut the sausages 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.880
 in four equal pieces 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.790
 Y 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.170
 now every bit of sausage just 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.649
 is arranging l9 spaghetti 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.649
 ah 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.650
 and so on until nine o'clock and I have been 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.270
 done the same thing with all the pieces and 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.180
 now let's move on to put the water to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.250
 heat in a pot or case let's 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.900
 put the water we will put a game 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.360
 strong and we 'll wait until 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.770
 boil once it starts to boil 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.900
 we add the salt 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.780
 the oil 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 and the spaghetti we will 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.400
 introducing little by little 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.630
 and once they are inside we will leave 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.090
 Cook 8 to 10 minutes moving like this 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.490
 occasionally 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.320
 after eight minutes the packages 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.869
 they're ready so let's move on 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.429
 drain them with the help of a drainer or 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.429
 strainer we drain them 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.100
 once drained as to move to a 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.049
 dish we have already put to salt and pasta in 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.659
 a plate and now let's move on to put 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.119
 salt is above supplemented 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.179
 with fried tomato sauce a little 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.340
 cheese and oregano as you can see is a 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.229
 dish that the kids like have 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.569
