 hello my name is george lukas her 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.650
 the creator of the universe is star wars altogether 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.890
 recently two things happened 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.369
 connected to each other the first is that 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.619
 night mouse lovers bought my studio for 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.309
 a symbolic sum of 4 billion dollars 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.429
 the author did not suddenly have the idea to take with 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.650
 my shelves or lightsaber 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.860

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.259
 we have seen many examples of successful 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.390
 cooperation of two large companies 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.219
 for example al Qaeda terrorists and fbi all 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.540
 low government and alien reptiles with 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.410
 the planets on the side as well as the company coca cola and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.670

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.079
 bubbles and it has nothing to do with desire 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.149
 cut the dough standards though 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.809
 potential profit again project 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.800
 trillion dollars 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.650
 yes and it seems to me that what is written off with 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.070
 sales have reeled off your studio that offend 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.049

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.919

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.989
 lovers to shoot famous personalities 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.830
 they won't forgive us 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.650
 I don't think so 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.670
 I think you understand perfectly well that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460
 have to replace the entire composition 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.310
 it seems the edges of these characters 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.420
 and we perfectly understand this problem 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.740
 and and therefore Princess Leia will play 1 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.149

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.770
