00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:10.710
 We are very effective team 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.759
 welcome again with a message 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.410
 from the potsdam square 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.910
 I just got out of the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.010
 exclusive press screening of the new 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.240
 tom cruise film of the runs with the cruze 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.760
 it came to the theaters today though 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 this 49 is called mission 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.710
 control 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.910
 how are you doing with this wonderful 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.949
 Tomorrow is here but I am strong 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.700
 First of all, the whole thing 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.960
 Berlin film journalists and the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 Most of them will be much too 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
 dark film because at the entrance 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.629
 had been distributed glasses 3d the movie 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.309
 but not at all in 3d is the least 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.660
 thought and never has the whole 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.340
 movie is about the earth of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410
 extraterrestrial has been attacked 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 and humanity naturally opposes 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 these extraterrestrial fought and also 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.649
 but they won the earth 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.949
 so blatant about bombing that they actually 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.270
 The people have become uninhabitable 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 had to leave the earth 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.560
 we had to forget what it means 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.920
 to have a home 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 the moon is destroyed because of that is the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.270
 earth also on the arm of jakarta and his wife 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.979
 the last two are still on the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.570
 earth are jenny schall technicians and he 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.610
 takes care of that all over 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 Drones that protect the water pumps 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.420
 continue to operate the problem 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.770
 is some of these aliens team 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.990
 have been called five looters 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.110
 survived and they keep attacking 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.860
 they are threatening and trying this too 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.720
 destroy water pumps 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.939
 so far so good then though 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.070
 He makes a discovery of everything 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.170
 previous question and from it 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.600
 a strange one unwinds more and more 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 History in which nothing is like it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.560
 seems 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.009
 and everything seems to be different than it is 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.409
 it seems to be an unknown object 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.789
 On the way you keep your techniques 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.549
 that people are not many anymore 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.630
 she immediately returned to the tower 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.630
 shoot at survivors 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.679
 director Joseph Kosinski led before that 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.510
 already made tron ​​legacy his 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.080
 Influence is reflected throughout the film 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.019
 again 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.840
 you just see the whole figures 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.670
 the rounding of the whole thing works 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.980
 typical he looks we have to get away from here 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.430
 Immediately I can not protect myself 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.870
 Are you still an effective we are going 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.730
 are not an effective team 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.620
 I want people to survive 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.019
 the trailer he really shows a lot 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.400
 action scenes and in the film are then 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.739
 but not so many 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 In addition, the film is about the two 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.230
 hours 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.420
 The whole thing would be easy on 90 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.609
 minutes can show that is super long 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.069
 It was really close to the limit 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.650
 you are ok for me is over first 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.420
 would like to go dump me and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.160
 then we often work with them 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.410
 same cinematic means so always 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.680
 black iris and then he gets one 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:04.250
 fried black iris and then 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:06.489
 he makes black game I have her 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.489
 observed 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.640
 The've lied it is time the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.160
 Truth to experience her personally was 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.260
 the story too predictable I think that 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.020
 question how the film has totally 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.000
 uninteresting because it was clear if that was in 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.690
 Selection at the end of the film a thing 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.790
 I do not want to spoil you boring 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.170
 cliché typical no cool end 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.580
 be for a film of cool chain 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.720
 partly sympathizes with even more 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.489
 the drone as with tom cruise was no 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.680
 good sign for the actor is 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.510
 looks boring and is total 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.890
 predictable if you like that 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.570
 then we will be really fit again 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.850
 he thinks it's very clear what kind of people that 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.319
 are also easy entertainment and the 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.239
 like to be served cliché 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.190
 and of course for the sake of me 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.260
 but all right 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.910
 action fans for this absolutely nothing 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:08.970
 that's why oblivion gets from me 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:12.040
 personally two out of five dream catchers 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.410
 for the year round I would take her with me 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.000
 to shoot two and a half out of five threats 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.530
 what do you mean if you already saw them 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.530
 have that in the comments 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:28.470
 there must of fan what you happened to finish 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.470
 you this war 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.910
 this is the only way 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.550
 that was it with this review if it was 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.050
 you liked thumbs up and 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.000
 shares and writes go in the 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.980
 comments what everyone likes and how 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.080
 you think about it up here you come 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.150
 to the trailer of film and down here 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.830

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.780

 great time have a lot of fun and watch 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.800
