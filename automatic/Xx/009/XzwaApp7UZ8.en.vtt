00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 briefly outlined and two agents during 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 the cold war the one from the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 eurostar from the us american side 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.120
 the other from the soviet side 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.350
 both must be together 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.700
 work together 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.649
 although they do not want that for something 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.510
 to prevent big evil on the one 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.039
 page in the cast henry cavill know the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.020
 For example, from Lone Rangers and the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.280
 Of course , the two of them also apply 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.780
 somehow two ideologies on each other 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.489
 within the film if you look at the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.260
 Trailer is really cool 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.730
 the optics of the sixties I believe 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.470
 years the action packed is the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.000
 joke and humor and that together 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.740
