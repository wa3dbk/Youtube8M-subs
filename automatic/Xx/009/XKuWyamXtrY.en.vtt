 moisÃ©s capillaridade south zone of porto 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.400
 joyful 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.649
 He does not know what to do with the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.870
 stallion who got addicted to eating 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.269
 dung professor at university 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.460
 federal of pelotas doctor in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 would determine carlos eduardo nogueira que 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.170
 will talk about the horse's 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.840
 The fact that the horse ate feces 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.029
 people who call me cooper made is a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.830
 one of the signs one of the vices that is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 related to stress 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.779
 generally it is the horses that are very 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.480
 have improper handling 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.130
 the most varied and for a long time 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 so this does not happen from one day to the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.920
 other 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 they acquire addictions which is a form 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.440
 said horse to really de-stress 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.450
 it's a typical story of a situation 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 of neurosis or something similar was to do 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 a relationship with the hand 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 so some horses rui wood the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 horses walks in circles on the bed one 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 rocking horse like the bear some 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.930
 horses go horses get the habit 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 then if the horses masturbate 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.500
 several and various changes of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.380
 habits and the horse naturally as 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.280
 feces at the young age then by 30 and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.530
 14 days 60 days he eats feces for 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.020
 make the microbiota either to stabilize 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 your treatment to begin the digestion of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 food at this stage is normal 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.439
 after that the horse eats feces or 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.110
 committing land is always associated with 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.570
 some change now doctor regarding 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.390
 treatment that can be done 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.610
 What we can do is try to take 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.799
 all factors that are not natural to the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.680
 horse's life be tempted solo stress 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.509
 is the best way of freedom is this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.450
 horse does not leave the horses longer time 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.610
 free of activity but usually horse 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.530
 relate this to the type of food 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.600
 because a big mistake that has been made 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 confirm the animals if they give too much food 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.840
 and energetic food then the animal 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.780
 gets full of energy 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.430
 full of will to do non- active activity 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 has activity so we play that 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.079
 swallowing left the jury eating well inside 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.939
 from home he turns the case backwards the horse 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.040
 somehow like people 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.110
 then you have to organize food 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.580
 compatible with paulo type of exercise 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.850
 What kind of life does he have? 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.410
 if we let this horse out more often 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.120
 the day begins to exercise in a 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 generally a horse must have 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.830
 less activity, we minimize this 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.150
 problem if the horse has this already there is a 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.680
 good weather 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.380
 It's the right thing to do. 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.110
 and could work there 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.850
 with Tico it's just received you had some 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.410
 drugs in this line but would need 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.420
 consult a veterinarian to identify the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.260
 problems is to take the approach 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.030
 correct 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 another very important aspect that 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.230
 doctor walnut pointed me out 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.960
 this conversation of ours is that these vices 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.630
 difficult after 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.000
 installed are corrected and the animal 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.100
 even when he is free, he returns to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.110
 repeat for example that horse that 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.820
 acquired the dancer addiction that 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.680
 swings from side to side 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.900
 even though sometimes the picket 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.650
 people find him doing that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.530
 swing 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.440
 the horse that got used to gnawing the stall 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.780
 in the field he bites the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.120
 wood is a very complicated subject for 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.740
 This is very important to try. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.740
 prevent this from happening
