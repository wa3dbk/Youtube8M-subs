Telemark movement is the fundamental

notice<00:00:45.910> how<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.120> skier<00:00:46.480> moves<00:00:46.780> his<00:00:46.960> outside

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
notice how the skier moves his outside

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.700 
notice how the skier moves his outside
foot<00:00:47.739> forward<00:00:48.219> through<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.760> end<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.120> turn
