have a control stick down here that we
actually<00:01:24.750> fly<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:27.090> all

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
actually fly it with and it's all

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
actually fly it with and it's all
connected<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> series<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.619> cables<00:01:29.100> and

it's<00:01:32.310> relatively<00:01:32.790> easy<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.180> fly<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it's relatively easy to fly it's a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.370 
it's relatively easy to fly it's a
flying<00:01:35.040> wing<00:01:35.570> design<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.939> inputs<00:01:38.939> are

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
flying wing design and the inputs are

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
flying wing design and the inputs are
just<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.710> you'd<00:01:40.860> move<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> regular<00:01:41.610> joystick

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
just as if you'd move a regular joystick

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.889 
just as if you'd move a regular joystick
and<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> my<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.899> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and it's down here on my right and you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.649 
and it's down here on my right and you
can<00:01:46.049> notice<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.909> add<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:48.119> input<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.540> my

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
can notice as I add an input with my

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.889 
can notice as I add an input with my
right<00:01:48.899> hand<00:01:49.369> obviously<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> reacts<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
right hand obviously it reacts and of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
right hand obviously it reacts and of
course<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.619> air<00:01:52.770> flow<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.640> helps

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
course the air flow is really what helps

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.370 
course the air flow is really what helps
us<00:01:54.090> but

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
us but

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.080 
us but
really<00:01:57.040> don't<00:01:57.189> fly<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.490> around<00:01:57.549> too<00:01:57.909> much

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
really don't fly it around too much

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.029 
really don't fly it around too much
unless<00:01:58.450> we're<00:01:58.659> doing<00:01:58.869> our<00:01:58.990> checks<00:01:59.320> before<00:01:59.680> the

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
unless we're doing our checks before the

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.410

flight and a night flight obviously the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.160 
flight and a night flight obviously the
most<00:02:39.130> important<00:02:39.730> part<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.330> refueler<00:02:41.019> is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
most important part of the refueler is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.830 
most important part of the refueler is
right<00:02:41.380> before<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.860> make<00:02:42.040> contact<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.569> just

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
right before we make contact and in just

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.180 
right before we make contact and in just
a<00:02:43.930> little<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.170> you'll<00:02:44.470> see<00:02:44.560> when<00:02:44.860> they<00:02:44.950> come

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
a little bit you'll see when they come

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.160 
a little bit you'll see when they come
up<00:02:45.220> when<00:02:46.209> they're<00:02:46.390> about<00:02:46.480> two<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.930> three<00:02:46.959> feet

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
up when they're about two to three feet

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.080 
up when they're about two to three feet
from<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.099> end<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> nozzle<00:02:48.549> there<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
from the end of the nozzle there the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.830 
from the end of the nozzle there the
boom<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:50.470> our<00:02:51.099> most<00:02:51.250> critical<00:02:51.489> time<00:02:51.840> because

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
boom is our most critical time because

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.559 
boom is our most critical time because
that's<00:02:53.049> as<00:02:53.290> we're<00:02:53.650> doing<00:02:54.099> our<00:02:54.250> closure<00:02:54.579> just

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
that's as we're doing our closure just

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.990 
that's as we're doing our closure just
about<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.959> make<00:02:56.079> contact<00:02:56.430> any<00:02:57.430> movement<00:02:57.940> that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
about to make contact any movement that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.729 
about to make contact any movement that
the<00:02:58.209> pilot<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.110> receiver<00:02:59.500> aircraft

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
the pilot and the receiver aircraft

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.250 
the pilot and the receiver aircraft
performed<00:03:00.549> or<00:03:01.000> turbulence<00:03:01.630> we<00:03:01.780> encounter

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
performed or turbulence we encounter

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.559 
performed or turbulence we encounter
obviously<00:03:03.160> will<00:03:03.310> affect<00:03:03.609> my<00:03:03.819> performance<00:03:04.000> of

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
obviously will affect my performance of

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.390 
obviously will affect my performance of
trying<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.930> make<00:03:05.079> a<00:03:05.109> contact<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:05.890> that's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
trying to make a contact so that's

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.699 
trying to make a contact so that's
really<00:03:06.609> our<00:03:06.850> most<00:03:07.060> critical<00:03:07.269> portion<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:08.530> the

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
really our most critical portion of the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.530 
really our most critical portion of the
refueling<00:03:09.130> at<00:03:09.220> all<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.670> that's<00:03:10.269> when<00:03:10.420> we

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
refueling at all and that's when we

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.599 
refueling at all and that's when we
actually<00:03:10.720> become<00:03:11.290> one<00:03:11.530> big<00:03:11.739> aircraft<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.489> you

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
actually become one big aircraft if you

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.479 
actually become one big aircraft if you
will<00:03:12.790> once<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.540> make<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.750> connection<00:03:14.489> we

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
will once you make the connection we

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.050 
will once you make the connection we
have<00:03:15.700> made<00:03:15.880> visual<00:03:16.150> contact<00:03:16.389> with<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:18.340> Irish

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
have made visual contact with the Irish

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.879 
have made visual contact with the Irish

Indiana

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.290 

our<00:03:28.550> boom<00:03:28.819> operator<00:03:30.310> is

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
our boom operator is

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.830 
our boom operator is
flying<00:03:34.020> actually<00:03:34.860> flying<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.460> boom<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:36.690> the

flying actually flying the boom with the
flying<00:03:37.110> wing<00:03:37.410> then<00:03:38.250> I'll<00:03:38.400> fly<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.700> back<00:03:38.790> over

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
flying wing then I'll fly it back over

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.220 
flying wing then I'll fly it back over
the<00:03:39.330> center<00:03:39.600> line<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:42.150> then<00:03:42.300> slowly<00:03:42.660> co<00:03:43.170> chi
