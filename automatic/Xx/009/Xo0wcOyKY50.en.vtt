00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
I'm sure they had some shots that they

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.060 
I'm sure they had some shots that they
look<00:00:09.330> at<00:00:09.510> as<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.929> know<00:00:10.080> we<00:00:10.410> got<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.620> make<00:00:10.769> but

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
for the most part I thought our defense

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.890 
for the most part I thought our defense
fueled<00:00:13.740> us<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.219> through<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> 12

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
games on a schedule and in today's game

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660

bigger player in there our size negated
some<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> inside<00:00:37.710> shots<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
some of the inside shots that that that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.990 
some of the inside shots that that that
they<00:00:39.870> got<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> total<00:00:41.879> team
