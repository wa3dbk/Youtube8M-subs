nice oh that was close that's definitely
got<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.450> do<00:04:00.629> so<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.549> don't<00:04:02.549> know<00:04:02.670> actually<00:04:03.120> this

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
got to do so I don't know actually this

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.990 
got to do so I don't know actually this
thing<00:04:03.599> had<00:04:03.780> some<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.920> may<00:04:05.459> just<00:04:05.489> take<00:04:05.730> some

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
thing had some it may just take some

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.559 
thing had some it may just take some
getting<00:04:06.239> used<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:11.420> wonder<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.480> it's

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
getting used to it I wonder if it's

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:13.880 
getting used to it I wonder if it's
because<00:04:12.629> it<00:04:12.959> might<00:04:13.049> be<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.230> little<00:04:13.379> bit<00:04:13.590> set<00:04:13.769> up

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
because it might be a little bit set up

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.680 
because it might be a little bit set up
it'll<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.190> little<00:04:14.370> more<00:04:14.489> nimble<00:04:14.879> so<00:04:15.510> maybe

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
it'll be a little more nimble so maybe

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.939 
it'll be a little more nimble so maybe
it<00:04:15.840> doesn't<00:04:15.989> quit<00:04:17.930> no<00:04:18.930> I'm<00:04:19.350> trying<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.709> get<00:04:19.859> the
