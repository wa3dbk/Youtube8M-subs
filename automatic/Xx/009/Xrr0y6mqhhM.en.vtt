is<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> nice<00:01:50.159> start<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> bed

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is how you get a nice start to the bed

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.090 
is how you get a nice start to the bed
sometimes<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> soil<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.009> bit

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
sometimes when the soil is a little bit

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.830 
sometimes when the soil is a little bit
harder<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.759> better<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.180> come<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
harder it's better to come in in it this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.319 
harder it's better to come in in it this
way<00:01:55.049> first<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.710> pick<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.790> use<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> little

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
way first and pick it up use a little

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
way first and pick it up use a little
bit<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.509> leverage<00:01:57.659> come<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.119> let<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
bit of leverage come in here let a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.850 
bit of leverage come in here let a
little<00:02:00.360> bit<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> leverage<00:02:00.719> over<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
little bit of leverage over here a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920 
little bit of leverage over here a
little<00:02:02.310> bit<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> leverage<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:03.810> when<00:02:03.899> you

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
little bit of leverage so then when you

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.660 
little bit of leverage so then when you
come<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> bed<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> little<00:02:05.579> bit

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
come in to do the bed it's a little bit

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.670 
come in to do the bed it's a little bit
easier<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> read<00:02:06.240> even<00:02:06.360> cut<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.719> bat<00:02:06.899> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
easier to read even cut from the bat so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.720 
easier to read even cut from the bat so
these<00:02:07.770> pieces<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.250> pop<00:02:08.550> out

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.950 

take<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:14.940> rig<00:02:15.210> we'll<00:02:15.870> use<00:02:16.080> this

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
take a little rig we'll use this

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.390 
take a little rig we'll use this
here's<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.110> good<00:02:19.230> start<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.830> your<00:02:19.950> edge<00:02:20.100> right

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
here's the good start to your edge right

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.180 
here's the good start to your edge right
there<00:02:20.640> that's<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> rough<00:02:21.780> cut<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.070> I'm

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
there that's the rough cut and what I'm

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.550 
there that's the rough cut and what I'm
gonna<00:02:23.340> go<00:02:23.490> do<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.880> come<00:02:24.090> back<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.570> finesse

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
gonna go do is come back and finesse

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.340 
gonna go do is come back and finesse
this<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:27.330> coming<00:02:27.660> through<00:02:27.690> with<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.020> edging

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
this just coming through with the edging

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.520 
this just coming through with the edging
shovel<00:02:28.740> just<00:02:29.180> take<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.450> slivers<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.380> want

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
shovel just take little slivers you want

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
shovel just take little slivers you want
to<00:02:31.590> angle<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> shovel<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.610> right<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to angle the shovel to right now the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.650 
to angle the shovel to right now the
cuts<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.200> way<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.970> diagonal

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
cuts this way kind of on a on a diagonal

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900 
cuts this way kind of on a on a diagonal
I<00:02:37.050> want<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.830> straight<00:02:37.950> down<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:38.520> almost

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
I want to get it straight down or almost

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.060 
I want to get it straight down or almost
the<00:02:39.030> reverse<00:02:39.180> diagonal<00:02:40.050> just<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> nice

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
the reverse diagonal just to have a nice

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.900 
the reverse diagonal just to have a nice
clean<00:02:41.370> edge<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> top<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:47.550> take<00:02:47.730> little

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
clean edge in the top just take little

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.620 
clean edge in the top just take little
smidge<00:02:48.530> little<00:02:49.530> slices<00:02:49.830> off<00:02:50.210> and<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.300> see<00:02:51.480> how

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
smidge little slices off and you see how

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.200 
smidge little slices off and you see how
nice<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.170> clean<00:02:52.910> edges<00:02:53.910> become<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:56.210> and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
nice and clean edges become now and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.990 
nice and clean edges become now and
that's<00:02:57.570> essentially<00:02:58.200> how<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.550> planting

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
that's essentially how we do a planting

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 
that's essentially how we do a planting
bed<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.480> grass<00:03:00.690> was<00:03:00.900> mature<00:03:01.230> you'd<00:03:01.830> have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
bed if this grass was mature you'd have

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.100 
bed if this grass was mature you'd have
full<00:03:02.250> grass<00:03:02.490> all<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.880> way<00:03:03.000> through<00:03:03.300> here<00:03:03.600> this

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
full grass all the way through here this

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.250 
full grass all the way through here this
grass<00:03:04.440> will<00:03:04.470> grow<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.070> time<00:03:05.810> if<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.080> is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
grass will grow in time if there is

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.410 
grass will grow in time if there is
mature<00:03:07.590> grass<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.550> last<00:03:08.760> thing<00:03:08.970> we<00:03:09.090> do<00:03:09.270> after

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
mature grass the last thing we do after

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.960 
mature grass the last thing we do after
this<00:03:09.750> before<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.320> mulch<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.460> come<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:11.820> on

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
this before we mulch is we come with on

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.810 
this before we mulch is we come with on
a<00:03:12.180> line<00:03:12.540> trimmer<00:03:12.870> or<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.260> weed<00:03:13.530> whacker<00:03:13.740> turn<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
a line trimmer or a weed whacker turn it

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.440 
a line trimmer or a weed whacker turn it
I've<00:03:15.650> turned<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.770> vertical<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.270> lines

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
I've turned it vertical so the lines

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
I've turned it vertical so the lines
going<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:20.220> cut<00:03:20.490> this<00:03:20.670> grass

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
going like this just cut this grass

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.300 
going like this just cut this grass
right<00:03:21.210> here<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.470> not<00:03:22.710> only<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:23.010> clean

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
right here so you have not only a clean

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.270 
right here so you have not only a clean
dirt<00:03:23.580> edge<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> clean<00:03:24.660> grass<00:03:24.930> edge<00:03:25.280> that's

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
dirt edge but a clean grass edge that's

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.910 
dirt edge but a clean grass edge that's
