00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
why is this map called underground

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.950 
why is this map called underground
almost<00:00:16.560> none<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.340> know<00:00:17.369> well

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
did a good job something about this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
did a good job something about this
level<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:32.219> feels<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.850> underground<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.930> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

disagree<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.809> map<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.260> switch<00:00:49.530> from<00:00:49.710> close

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
disagree this map can switch from close

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
disagree this map can switch from close
to<00:00:50.010> long-range<00:00:50.579> combat<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:51.510> rounding<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
to long-range combat just by rounding a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.580

corner

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590

I<00:00:52.739> love<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.520> different<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> map<00:00:54.270> plays<00:00:54.570> just

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
I love how different the map plays just

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.900 
I love how different the map plays just
because<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.530> where<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because of where you are because of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060 
because of where you are because of
Underground's<00:00:57.660> design<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.230> really<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.890> make

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
Underground's design you really can make

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
Underground's design you really can make
an<00:00:59.190> argument<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.609> any<00:00:59.850> primary<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
an argument for any primary but the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.439 
an argument for any primary but the
assault<00:01:01.500> rifles<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.010> reign<00:01:02.250> King<00:01:02.609> any

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
assault rifles will reign King any

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.539 
assault rifles will reign King any
primary<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.290> work<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
primary can work I want to make that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.359 
primary can work I want to make that
clear<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.360> I'll<00:01:06.510> say<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.720> again<00:01:06.840> any<00:01:07.439> primary

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
clear so I'll say it again any primary

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.480 
clear so I'll say it again any primary
can<00:01:08.909> work<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:10.020> combat<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> map<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
can work the combat on this map is so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
can work the combat on this map is so
diverse<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.299> honestly<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.170> use<00:01:13.439> anything

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
diverse you honestly can use anything

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
diverse you honestly can use anything
from<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.130> shotgun<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> sniper<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.960> pick

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
from a shotgun to a sniper if you pick

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
from a shotgun to a sniper if you pick
your<00:01:16.409> battles<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:16.830> any<00:01:17.280> primary<00:01:18.060> will

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
your battles right any primary will

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810 
your battles right any primary will
suffice<00:01:18.509> here's<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> catch<00:01:19.890> though<00:01:20.250> that's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
suffice here's the catch though that's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
suffice here's the catch though that's
also<00:01:21.330> why<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.540> assault<00:01:21.990> rifles<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.530> best

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
also why the assault rifles are best

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
also why the assault rifles are best
these<00:01:23.369> primaries<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.330> handle<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> swish

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
these primaries can handle the swish

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
these primaries can handle the swish
from<00:01:25.320> close<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> long-range<00:01:26.159> combat<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
from close to long-range combat and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.359 
from close to long-range combat and
vice-versa<00:01:27.420> quite<00:01:27.990> easily<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.070> map<00:01:29.340> you

vice-versa quite easily on this map you

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.920
