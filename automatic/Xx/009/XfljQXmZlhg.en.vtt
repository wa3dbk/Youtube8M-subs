00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.219
 hello friends with you again I am you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.660
 fishermen and then ask me questions on 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.710
 about unhooked 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 fishing this bay us even 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.430
 well it came in handy he took off all the hooks and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.860
 one wobbler remained only at the bottom and so 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 what do we need for shops first thing 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.590
 This is a load we use we gross 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.180
 just ching first lead 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.189
 sinker 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.710
 weighing 200 grams and the second thing we take 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 any steel cable 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 here, too, found some not clear already 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.520
 rusty-rusty incomprehensible well how much he 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.080
 meter 2 probably the length of this cable 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.950
 to recommend taking it a little bit 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.820
 thinner 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:57.810
 the third need any wire wire 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.860
 the usual and final element is 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.019
 of course usually 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:06.090
 by chelochka twine well here you are the length 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.740
 determine yourself what you need this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.690
 the bay will work exclusively with 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.409
 boats, that is, from the shore I do not think that he 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.979
 will work 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.620
 always clumsy but from the boat 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.400
 works well and so is the action 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:24.780
 what we take steel cable 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 here we twist it with such rings further 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.369
 take the rope and mbi bangs we wind 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.630
 these rings 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.369
 so that they do not unwind 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.850
 that is, but this talk can be made 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.689
 of course and that will be more perfect 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.770
 but when the gift of the beam remains literally 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.990
 read minutes there it is necessary something 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.479
 quickly bungled it surely probably 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.729
 the best way 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.729
 take the rope you look how 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.729
 way it's all done 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 further lead load is taken 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:18.260
 embedded in the center and starts just 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.120
 roll tight 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.120
 reels very tightly than tight 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.870
 reel in principle will probably 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.790
 better here's a beater 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.510
 turned out that is fixed inside 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.510
 the load on top is just a rope our basis 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.720
 as well, the last loop slips th 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.600
 simple loop to make it stronger 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.600
 held on 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.000
 what purpose to fix in the center 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:08.970
 the rope is all in principle I think 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.209
 enough now I'm just tying 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.099
 firm and reliable 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.269
 Here we are 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:21.180
 design that is cola. with a load 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.780
 center show me the rope is attached then 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.430
 there is a rope attached here and here 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.800
 last last last last 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.510
 stroke to do it 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.610
 holder for sharp that is where we are 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.680
 we will feed the fishing line that is for 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.110
 This usually take any wire 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.300
 to such is at hand but desirable 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.800
 Of course she would be stroking to 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.110
 she was not rough not hurt 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.110
 fix this wire do a loop 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.430
 here's a loop made right loop 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.100
 on you can say pens and then we have this 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:08.940
 fold the loop to the line 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:12.300
 by holding tight we just bend 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.930
 such a loop turned out in principle 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.120
 unhook ready that is literally well where not 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.180
 I know how much time it will take you for 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.520
 two in three minutes this compartment and he to you 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.330
 Can not save one bait which 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.390
 there are more than one hundred hryvnia so now 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.070
 how we act at the toe swim up 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.780
 On the boat to the hook, take the cord in your hand 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.050
 second hand to cling and 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.680
 weights for cord hang here on this 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.550
 wire loop 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.740
 hanged cord 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.840
 it is fixed so that our cord is not 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:55.680
 popped up and let go just a weed he 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.530
 in free fall flies to the bait then 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.260
 have a dory tayton up bait and start 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.780
 pounding it, that is why I am here 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.550
 at first he spoke heavier than he did then 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.210
 perform two functions he or he has 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.610
 opportunity to either bring down the load or its 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.020
 hook on these wires, that is 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.710
 and how we beat 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.270
 just hooked and hooked these 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.030
 the wire itself is not behind the wobbler itself and 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.520
 tees that is, he was dragged along with 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.680
 reeds with reeds with roots of reeds then 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.510
 there is very well shot down that is 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.400
 repeat on the last fishing 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.900
 which we had happened the day before yesterday we 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.380
 so saved 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.410
 unhook 7 wabler ав1 wobbler unfortunately 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.070
 but failed to save but there is nothing 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:44.970
 you can't do it 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.900
 I don't know well for the money that 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:52.740
 it costs and it costs literally nothing 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.830
 best option all thank you all for 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.830
 Attention
