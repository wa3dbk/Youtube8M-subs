00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.000
 and then the topic will be in this 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.920
 chaos will be 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.029
 the hertz noises and that of the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.970
 places and the mitral valve again short 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.430
 to recapitulate the rest regularly 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.640
 you barren herztÃ¶ne namely the first 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.140
 to do the second heart 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.390
 why do they ultimately form something ? 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.540
 we actually hear the first sound 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 is not a muscle tense stone 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.829
 Just to do it ! 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 is often assumed to be in 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.730
 some textbooks in there but that how 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.320
 said tension stone of the muscles 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 as a result of the termination of atrio 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 ventricular fold when 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.170
 finally the flaps between the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.660
 forecourts and the wind rikels close 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 and the muscle tension that too 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.690
 it is necessary that you hear the second 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.920
 In the end , it's the way to do it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.570
 The vibration of the blood should be immediate 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.070
 after ejection hears from the ventricle 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.830
 So in the blood during the systems 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 is driven out and shortly thereafter the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.610
 Vibration in combination with the conclusion 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.830
 the ventricle works so the species 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 flap under pulmonary flap this 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.610
 Vibration of the blood is supposed to be the second 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.970
 heart will be very happy in exams 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.790
 also from the pp or in the klausuren and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.159
 An oral exam how to fold 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.549
 Sounds at certain deficits 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.840
 the heart valves can be heard we queried 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.159
 begin with the aortic stenosis 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.640
 but what is your characteristic way 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.130
 we have a short gray spindle 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.590
 shaped systolic so during the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.020
 sus thole we hear the sound is too 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.719
 finally understandable if the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.149
 aortic valve is stimulated and it must 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.729
 more pressure is spent around that 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.500
 blood then through the stylized flap 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.090
 to evaluate 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.979
 This then creates a historical 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.690
 noise because it is a 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.989
 here in the st is ole the boat 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.239
 The whole thing is best thrown out 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.629
 She knows her bar in the second intercostal 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.799
 room right paranal times to repeat 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.840
 a spindle-shaped new system for what 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.739
 Usually in both carrots ford 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.420
 is guided and partly you can 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.160
 a kind in the variable cleavage of the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.129
 second heart tons still higher come 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.620
 continue to locate insufficiency so if 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.209
 no longer close the flap adequately 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.920
 can 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.819
 Here it is now that we are immediate 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.040
 following the second heart death so 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.569
 shortly after this operation the blood 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.670
 pillar we have a decrescendo-like 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.720
 diastolic that is a sound of in 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.190
 its pitch decreases 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.349
 The whole thing is logical again 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.290
 explainable because ultimately we ourselves 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.840
 already in the diastole and 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.299
 during the diastole next to the fulfillment 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.269
 phase finally blood again 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.849
 was previously called back in runs 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.709
 the ventricle is the historical phase 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.260
 The blood will be used from normal 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.209
 Should the places be shut up 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.190
 she just does not quite come to herself 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.590
 does not close adequately so can during 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.930
 the diastolic filling phase again 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.840
 blood back through the aortic valve 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.489
 pour into the left when triegel and 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.750
 we will hear that as a decrescendo 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.940
 typically have diastolic 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.480
 we also carrot pulsations that 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.090
 paid as corrigan sign and one 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.549
 later the historical rumble over the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.099
 heart top also that one can perceive 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.370
 is called out of the flint noise 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.470
 denotes further characteristic 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.019
 for the types of insufficiency also the 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.470
 so-called water hama puls so the 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.690
 Pulse skeleton altus itself through a 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.120
 very large bleeding amplitude over 100 mm 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.700
 ag we excel so then have a 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.010
 very high systolic blood pressure 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:21.190
 but a very small diastolic 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:25.990
 worth 160 to 35, for example, we come 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.229
 to the mitral valve stenosis at the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.610
 mitral valve must stand so that we 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:36.400
 hear a late diastole kumm and that 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.460
 after mitral valve opening stone so 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.740
 we hear a neutral opening stone 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.540
 then comes a decrescendo orange and 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.330
 then finally a prehistoric one 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.430
 crescendo until the first one doctors 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.850
 speaks also of the thrilling first heart 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.889
 do 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.370
 So that's very typical of the metal 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.710
 stenosis late systolic diastolic 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.940
 sound after the metal opening and opening 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.950
 prehistoric crescendo that is so 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.950
 leading a parked first heart leads 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.680
 one speaks also of diastolic 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:20.200
 graham style noise related 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:23.979
 the nitrate stenose then concludes 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.360
 still dimitri inspicient here it is like that 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:30.820
 that we are just a band shaped again 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.190
 historique will also listen in part 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.050
 as machine-like noise 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.810
 We have no increase here 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.850
 a waste is relatively long 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.630
 the noise between the 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.780
 first and between the second heart do 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.450
 draws this wall-shaped 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.630
 systolic noise also makes up ever 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.680
 again sense during the historical 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.720
 phase during the 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.360
 tender phase the mitral valve 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.430
 does not close so efficiently and while 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.320
 the ventricle live controlled and in 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.440
 the history, the blood on the 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.400
 aortic valve ejects also flows proportion 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.889
 blood back into the left atrium ins 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.599
 left atrium through the just not 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.870
 adequately not so efficiently closed 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.300
 Mitral valve that's actually right 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.120
 comprehensible why it then just one 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.249
 historical noise is good with it 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:33.729
 we are for the places and mitral valve 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:33.729
 by and attention and bye
