this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.680> review<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
this is the video review of the

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.889 
this is the video review of the
Transformers<00:00:02.700> Prime<00:00:02.909> weaponized<00:00:03.689> our

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
Transformers Prime weaponized our

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.309 
Transformers Prime weaponized our
optimus<00:00:04.410> prime<00:00:04.740> figure<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.629> really<00:00:07.140> like

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
optimus prime figure and I really like

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.140 
optimus prime figure and I really like
this<00:00:07.500> figure<00:00:07.740> he's<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> pretty<00:00:08.700> nice<00:00:08.940> truck

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
this figure he's got a pretty nice truck

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.450 
this figure he's got a pretty nice truck
mode<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.929> back<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.650> does<00:00:10.860> look<00:00:11.160> pretty<00:00:11.309> ugly

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
mode the back it does look pretty ugly

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.640 
mode the back it does look pretty ugly
but<00:00:11.870> considering<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.259> more<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.530> a

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
but considering that this is more of a

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.410 
but considering that this is more of a
kid's<00:00:13.950> toy<00:00:14.190> than<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> collector's<00:00:14.849> item<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.269> am

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
kid's toy than the collector's item I am

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.670 
kid's toy than the collector's item I am
totally<00:00:15.750> fine<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.199> this

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
totally fine with this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.410 
totally fine with this
though<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.490> if<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.820> filled<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.240> these

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
though I do think if you filled in these

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.260 
though I do think if you filled in these
sections<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.529> something<00:00:20.160> maybe<00:00:20.340> blue

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
sections here with something maybe blue

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.179 
sections here with something maybe blue
silly<00:00:21.660> putty<00:00:21.990> or<00:00:22.170> something<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.769> some

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
silly putty or something or just some

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.040 
silly putty or something or just some
extra<00:00:23.519> plastic<00:00:23.760> I've<00:00:24.060> lying<00:00:24.269> around<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.779> think

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
extra plastic I've lying around I think

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.470 
extra plastic I've lying around I think
that<00:00:25.320> would<00:00:25.529> improve<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.849> may<00:00:27.300> end<00:00:27.420> up

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that would improve the lot I may end up

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
that would improve the lot I may end up
doing<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.810> video<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.529> find<00:00:28.680> something

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
doing a video if I can find something

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
doing a video if I can find something
that<00:00:29.310> fits<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.269> otherwise<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that fits in there but otherwise it's a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
that fits in there but otherwise it's a
really<00:00:31.769> nice<00:00:31.920> figure<00:00:32.219> doesn't<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.640> need

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
really nice figure doesn't really need

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.319 
really nice figure doesn't really need
that<00:00:32.969> many<00:00:33.180> fixes<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.670> yeah<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that many fixes and yeah just it's a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
that many fixes and yeah just it's a
really<00:00:36.360> nice<00:00:36.750> looking<00:00:36.989> truck<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> most

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
really nice looking truck for the most

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.060 
really nice looking truck for the most
part<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.520> rolls<00:00:39.170> really<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:43.070> know

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
part and it rolls really well and I know

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.100 
part and it rolls really well and I know
some<00:00:44.340> people<00:00:44.430> don't<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:45.719> kinds<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
some people don't like these kinds of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.080 
some people don't like these kinds of
wheels<00:00:46.289> they're<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> kind<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.250> plug<00:00:47.879> on

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
wheels they're the kind that plug on

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
wheels they're the kind that plug on
rather<00:00:48.360> than<00:00:48.480> pin<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.340> like

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
rather than pin on but I really like

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.459 
rather than pin on but I really like
these<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> understand<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.230> first

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
these now I understand that the first

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
these now I understand that the first
couple<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> figures<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:54.270> least<00:00:54.449> recent

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
couple of figures and at least recent

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
couple of figures and at least recent
memory<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.170> used<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.890> wheel

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
memory that used this kind of wheel

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.310 
memory that used this kind of wheel
construction<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.510> Transformers<00:00:58.170> Prime

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
construction that was Transformers Prime

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.979 
construction that was Transformers Prime
knockout<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> VidCon<00:00:59.340> they<00:01:00.210> didn't<00:01:00.600> roll<00:01:00.750> very

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
knockout in VidCon they didn't roll very

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.990 
knockout in VidCon they didn't roll very
well<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.890> those<00:01:02.129> figures<00:01:02.340> were<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
well but those figures were like the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.560 
well but those figures were like the
tests<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.510> initial<00:01:07.729> usage<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.030> has

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
tests or the initial usage of these has

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.030 
tests or the initial usage of these has
we're<00:01:09.840> hadn't<00:01:10.080> quite<00:01:10.200> mastered<00:01:10.409> how<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> use

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
we're hadn't quite mastered how to use

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
we're hadn't quite mastered how to use
them<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.369> these<00:01:12.000> wheels<00:01:12.270> roll<00:01:13.140> pretty<00:01:13.619> well

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
them but these wheels roll pretty well

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
them but these wheels roll pretty well
just<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.250> well<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.549> any<00:01:14.729> pinned<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
just as well as any pinned on kind of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.280 
just as well as any pinned on kind of
wheel<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:17.630> really<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> kind<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
wheel and I really like this kind of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.600 
wheel and I really like this kind of
veel<00:01:19.409> construction<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> makes

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
veel construction because one it makes

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.249 
veel construction because one it makes
figures<00:01:21.000> cheaper<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> produce<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:22.020> that's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
figures cheaper to produce I know that's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.399 
figures cheaper to produce I know that's
not<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> big<00:01:22.830> deal<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.070> me<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
not really a big deal for me but to

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.810 
not really a big deal for me but to
because<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.740> wheels<00:01:25.950> aren't<00:01:26.250> pinned<00:01:26.610> on

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
because the wheels aren't pinned on

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
because the wheels aren't pinned on
there's<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:27.689> quality<00:01:28.200> control<00:01:28.530> issue

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
there's not really quality control issue

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
there's not really quality control issue
with<00:01:28.950> them<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.850> happened<00:01:30.119> with

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
with them because what happened with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.499 
with them because what happened with
pind<00:01:30.570> wheels<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> pin<00:01:32.790> went<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.329> an

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
pind wheels is if the pin went in at an

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
pind wheels is if the pin went in at an
angle<00:01:33.750> which<00:01:34.470> happened<00:01:34.950> fairly<00:01:35.549> frequently

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
angle which happened fairly frequently

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
angle which happened fairly frequently
at<00:01:36.479> least<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.900> my<00:01:37.020> figures<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> wheel

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
at least for my figures then the wheel

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.569 
at least for my figures then the wheel
will<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.880> sort<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> off-balance<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
will be sort of off-balance and then the

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
will be sort of off-balance and then the
entire<00:01:41.579> thing<00:01:41.640> wouldn't<00:01:42.390> sit<00:01:42.720> flat<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
entire thing wouldn't sit flat or the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.020 
entire thing wouldn't sit flat or the
pin<00:01:44.520> being<00:01:44.790> too<00:01:45.000> tight<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:46.820> just<00:01:47.820> much

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
pin being too tight and I just much

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.429 
pin being too tight and I just much
prefer<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.540> having<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.960> deal<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.110> any<00:01:49.350> of

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
think about it as he is literally

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.180 
think about it as he is literally
wearing<00:05:34.090> a<00:05:34.240> backpack<00:05:34.479> because<00:05:35.200> he<00:05:35.800> needs<00:05:36.039> the

wearing a backpack because he needs the

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.159 
wearing a backpack because he needs the
extra<00:05:36.370> firepower<00:05:36.640> that<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.510> back<00:05:37.660> that<00:05:37.900> gives

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
extra firepower that the back that gives

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.779 
extra firepower that the back that gives
them<00:05:38.350> through<00:05:38.560> those<00:05:38.680> guns<00:05:39.010> then<00:05:39.490> it's<00:05:39.669> not

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
them through those guns then it's not

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.880 
them through those guns then it's not
that<00:05:40.060> bad<00:05:40.270> especially<00:05:40.510> considering<00:05:41.350> that<00:05:41.380> he

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890

it<00:05:49.390> so<00:05:49.479> he<00:05:49.570> doesn't<00:05:49.660> fall<00:05:50.020> over<00:05:50.050> very<00:05:50.530> easily

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
it so he doesn't fall over very easily

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.340 
it so he doesn't fall over very easily
so<00:05:51.100> I<00:05:51.130> do<00:05:51.310> think<00:05:51.729> the<00:05:52.450> backpack<00:05:52.840> is<00:05:52.960> not<00:05:53.110> as<00:05:53.169> big

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
so I do think the backpack is not as big

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.310 
so I do think the backpack is not as big
of<00:05:53.410> a<00:05:53.500> deal<00:05:53.650> as<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> lot<00:05:54.010> of<00:05:54.100> people<00:05:54.310> say<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:56.050> it

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
of a deal as a lot of people say but it

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.560 
of a deal as a lot of people say but it
would<00:05:56.590> have<00:05:56.680> been<00:05:56.770> nice<00:05:56.919> if<00:05:56.950> they<00:05:57.280> had<00:05:57.570> been

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
would have been nice if they had been

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.540 
would have been nice if they had been
able<00:05:58.660> to<00:05:58.810> integrate<00:05:59.139> this<00:05:59.530> part<00:06:00.310> of<00:06:00.460> the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
able to integrate this part of the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.159 
able to integrate this part of the
vehicle<00:06:01.300> mode<00:06:01.419> in<00:06:01.570> a<00:06:01.600> bit<00:06:01.840> better<00:06:02.020> especially

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
vehicle mode in a bit better especially

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.440 
vehicle mode in a bit better especially
since<00:06:02.680> you<00:06:02.800> can<00:06:02.950> blatantly<00:06:03.310> see<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.880> windows

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
since you can blatantly see the windows

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.090 
since you can blatantly see the windows
there<00:06:04.720> even<00:06:05.080> though<00:06:05.169> he<00:06:05.289> has<00:06:05.470> to<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.830> faux

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
there even though he has to the faux

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.080 
there even though he has to the faux
windows<00:06:06.490> out<00:06:06.789> there<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:08.400> well<00:06:09.400> I<00:06:09.430> do<00:06:09.550> like<00:06:09.850> the

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
windows out there and well I do like the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.330 
windows out there and well I do like the
weapon<00:06:10.840> gimmick<00:06:11.229> in<00:06:11.350> this<00:06:11.500> mode<00:06:11.710> I<00:06:11.919> don't

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
weapon gimmick in this mode I don't

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.510 
weapon gimmick in this mode I don't
quite<00:06:12.610> like<00:06:12.669> how<00:06:13.530> these<00:06:14.530> things<00:06:14.889> just<00:06:15.130> come<00:06:15.400> up

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
quite like how these things just come up

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.580 
quite like how these things just come up
I<00:06:15.639> wish<00:06:15.820> these<00:06:16.450> didn't<00:06:16.810> come<00:06:16.840> up<00:06:16.960> at<00:06:17.139> all<00:06:17.320> for

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
I wish these didn't come up at all for

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.070 
I wish these didn't come up at all for
the<00:06:17.650> weapon<00:06:17.919> gimmick<00:06:18.190> or<00:06:18.340> they<00:06:18.789> folded<00:06:19.750> up<00:06:19.930> or

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
the weapon gimmick or they folded up or

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.560 
the weapon gimmick or they folded up or
something<00:06:21.070> because<00:06:21.340> it's<00:06:21.970> a<00:06:22.120> nice<00:06:22.300> gimmick

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
something because it's a nice gimmick

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.279 
something because it's a nice gimmick
than<00:06:22.840> I<00:06:22.870> do

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
than I do

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.080 
than I do
like<00:06:23.560> it<00:06:23.850> but<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:27.370> just<00:06:27.400> wouldn't<00:06:27.639> be<00:06:27.729> nice<00:06:27.910> of

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
like it but it just wouldn't be nice of

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.430 
like it but it just wouldn't be nice of
those<00:06:28.210> hadn't<00:06:28.510> come<00:06:28.660> up<00:06:28.750> now<00:06:29.260> for

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
those hadn't come up now for

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.400 
those hadn't come up now for
articulation<00:06:30.450> so<00:06:31.450> he<00:06:31.780> actually<00:06:32.050> has<00:06:32.139> a<00:06:32.169> fair

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
articulation so he actually has a fair

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.500 
articulation so he actually has a fair

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
ratchets were way too strong and didn't

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.100 
ratchets were way too strong and didn't
give<00:07:07.810> a<00:07:08.020> good<00:07:08.320> rotation<00:07:08.620> this<00:07:09.600> is<00:07:10.600> a<00:07:10.660> good

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
give a good rotation this is a good

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.280 
give a good rotation this is a good
gradation<00:07:12.660> soon<00:07:13.660> there's<00:07:13.840> quite<00:07:14.020> a<00:07:14.050> bit<00:07:14.200> of

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290 
gradation soon there's quite a bit of

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.170 
gradation soon there's quite a bit of
possibility<00:07:14.830> and<00:07:15.460> like<00:07:15.580> I<00:07:15.700> was<00:07:15.820> saying<00:07:15.940> he<00:07:16.090> has

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
possibility and like I was saying he has

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.420 
possibility and like I was saying he has
good<00:07:16.420> balance<00:07:17.550> and<00:07:19.890> overall<00:07:20.890> I<00:07:21.070> think<00:07:21.190> it's

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
good balance and overall I think it's

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.340 
good balance and overall I think it's
just<00:07:21.520> a<00:07:21.640> really<00:07:21.670> fun<00:07:21.970> toy<00:07:22.390> if<00:07:22.600> you're<00:07:22.750> looking

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
into figures that look perfect then I

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.990 
into figures that look perfect then I
would<00:07:26.050> recommend<00:07:26.530> first<00:07:27.220> addition<00:07:27.640> optimus
