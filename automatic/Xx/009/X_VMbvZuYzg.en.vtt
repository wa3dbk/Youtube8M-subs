00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
going to tie a very small loose knot

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
going to tie a very small loose knot
tight<00:01:56.430> enough<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.150> will<00:01:57.180> stay<00:01:57.690> but

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
tight enough so that it will stay but
loose<00:01:58.560> enough<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> pain<00:02:00.060> in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
loose enough so that it's not a pain in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.290 
loose enough so that it's not a pain in
the<00:02:00.300> rear<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.110> undone<00:02:01.530> later<00:02:03.620> so<00:02:05.300> once

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
the rear to get undone later so once

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.800 
the rear to get undone later so once
you've<00:02:06.480> got<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:06.900> done

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
you've got that done

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.710 
you've got that done
you<00:02:08.810> can<00:02:08.960> adjust<00:02:09.130> however<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
you can adjust however you like and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.480 
you can adjust however you like and
there<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:12.590> have<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:14.690> way<00:02:15.280> might<00:02:16.280> be<00:02:16.459> a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
there we have it so this way might be a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.750 
there we have it so this way might be a
little<00:02:16.640> bit<00:02:16.910> easier<00:02:17.240> for<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:18.140> if<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:19.040> sort<00:02:19.670> of

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
little bit easier for you if you sort of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.780 
little bit easier for you if you sort of
wanted<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.840> waterfall<00:02:21.319> look<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:22.310> couldn't

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
wanted the waterfall look that couldn't

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.240 
wanted the waterfall look that couldn't
quite<00:02:22.970> get<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.450> adjusting<00:02:24.170> down<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:25.010> might

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
quite get the adjusting down this might

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.270 
quite get the adjusting down this might
be<00:02:25.430> an<00:02:25.670> easier<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:27.200> also<00:02:27.800> if<00:02:28.160> you

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
be an easier way and this also if you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.500 
be an easier way and this also if you
just<00:02:28.550> watched<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:31.250> European<00:02:31.820> style<00:02:32.150> scarf

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
just watched the European style scarf

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.740 
just watched the European style scarf
video<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.650> gives<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.250> appearance<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.970> that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
video this gives the appearance of that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.280 
video this gives the appearance of that
look<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.940> we've<00:02:38.090> got<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.390> fringe<00:02:38.660> showing<00:02:39.170> on

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
look so we've got the fringe showing on

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.440 
look so we've got the fringe showing on
both<00:02:39.470> sides<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.430> back<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.239> what<00:02:44.420> I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
both sides and the back and what I

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.680 
both sides and the back and what I
usually<00:02:44.690> do<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.860> back<00:02:49.040> there<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:50.360> anyway<00:02:50.660> I

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
usually do in the back there so anyway I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.110 
usually do in the back there so anyway I
again<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.830> hope<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.160> was<00:02:52.400> helpful<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.090> hope

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
again I hope this was helpful and I hope
