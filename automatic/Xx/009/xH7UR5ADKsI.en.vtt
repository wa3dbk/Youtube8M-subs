00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.799
 pascarella 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.030
 in 2013 it comes from bologna is called 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.540
 carlotta pascarella carlotta pascarella 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.790
 is the new miss over 2013 if he expected it 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.770
 absolutely no 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.440
 I'm so excited that I don't have it 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.559
 still understood maybe that fails 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.660
 I am very smiling or crying 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.550
 excited when she was what is the 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.710
 secret of this success and if the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.470
 jury was objective was 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.090
 objective because I have followed all 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.150
 the possible tests imaginable as 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.089
 also the other competitors of course 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.589
 but believe me 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.309
 I put so much effort into it 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:03.100
 even in the dance test that anyway 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.629
 it was very difficult but maybe not 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.990
 could slip to the ground there was that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.060
 still very young, 43 years old was born in 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.409
 naples and has been living in bologna for two years 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.590
 because by choice and because I have a part 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.890
 of my family that lives in bologna 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.710
 in fact I greet my mother my father who does not 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.510
 I'm here because I'm in Naples and I hope 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.120
 that will soon reach us in Bologna 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.060
 so we will gather all the PA from today in 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.250
 then what will he do but from today onwards I do 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.620
 a promise my parents made 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.220
 I will form a family because my neighbor 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.210
 goal is that of in the drawer e 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.330
 get married and have children 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.670
 certainly the most beautiful thing in the world miss 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.700
 over baby instead irene tellini and tuscany 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.659
 young 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.110
 and even if he has three and a half real children 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.929
 half still is not even introduced 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.439
 her husband who follows her then is worth 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:07.759
 for 15 he is not one for the day 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.640
 after the victory what has changed 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.030
 but nothing substantially because apart 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.790
 trying to remember moments of 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.810
 yesterday was not easy because it is 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.549
 all happened in a hurry and therefore not there 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.150
 it is capable of the end of what it is 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.739
 success 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.920
