00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 2 tables at the table or almost but 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.600
 following the scandal of the cow 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.429
 crazy some Alsatian producers have 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.809
 bet more than ten years ago 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.000
 set up a regional sector 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.110
 with a double purpose to ensure 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.240
 supermarket supply 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 all year round in local meat but 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.330
 especially master the entire chain of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 fork with fork 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.619
 our road starts with a dose jean 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.990
 louis siegrist raises beautiful sales 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.939
 for more than 30 years charollais salers 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 limousin they are born in breeders 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.870
 specialized in Alsace or in the center 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.600
 from France then arrives here with a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 mission grow bigger and grow in their 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 bundle their family book and a 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 ID card 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.770
 as earrings here when 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.140
 the animal that it happens they have to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.079
 so have these two earloop 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.239
 and this passport is going on for the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.850
 Am it's a bit like the map 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.100
 French identity also first 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.440
 things is in front of it's a number of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.359
 In fact, we find these 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.979
 last four digits after you 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.030
 have sex here in this case and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.189
 males the Charolais race and then 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.049
 something essential also the date 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.479
 of birth 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.509
 you also have the origin of the animal 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.259
 so birth exploitation is at 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.869
 say high guinea 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.640
 from birth, the animal is registered and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.220
 the controls are multiple at times 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.710
 internal to the cooperative but also by 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.659
 an independent external body when 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.600
 reaches an average of 750 kg 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.909
 towards the abattoir also managed by 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.619
 the cooperative regards the losses of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.579
 earrings if one has parked 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 during transport 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.930
 a genetic test should ensure 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.310
 the identity of there while waiting for the without 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.000
 papers will not pass the door 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.430
 input 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.240
 when the animal arrives at the slaughterhouse and he 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.740
 there is an inconsistency between the number finally 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.170
 finally the loops they have in their ears 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.079
 and the passport that you see here down 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.909
 the animal will not be slaughtered 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.270
 so it can not logically be 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.710
 with us there can be no 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.280
 problem at that level the slaughterhouse 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.229
 of holcim more than 400 mo 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.530
 20 are slaughtered each week either 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.930
 about 80% Alsatian production at 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.880
 the arrival the passport is flashed at 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.920
 passage the beast become carcass recovers 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.360
 other numbers and information like 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.980
 the date and place of slaughter 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.280
 find the same numbers 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.830
 the individual number of the cattle on 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.319
 the label of the carcass to and on the

 number on the passport slaughterhouse 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.420
 the beast was shot down the date of slaughter 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.720
 if it is a cattle 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.940

 w specifications in which 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.190
 this carcass can fit if also the

 mention ea high in Alsace 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.810
 the cutting place here at the same place 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.459
 the racial type of the category that we have 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.620

 at the time we did not talk too much 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.400
 local production of short supply chains 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.920
 and we are very proud of it and we 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.390

 our goal is essential first and foremost 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 to write the specifications at the

 independent structure which is one of 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.919
 scenes today also ensure the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.630
 checks because of course even if he 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.690
 there is trust that exists one the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.190
 checks are made justifies this 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.580
 consumer confidence in their

 qualitative to really bring a 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.100
 added value both the production 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.340
 but also again to guarantee this 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.630
 security side to consumers more 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.919
 500 cattle farmers are 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.169
 today engaged in this sector 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.550
 which also concerns the port and the 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.990
 regional production is still far 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.039
 to be sufficient to ensure 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.039
 the diet of all
