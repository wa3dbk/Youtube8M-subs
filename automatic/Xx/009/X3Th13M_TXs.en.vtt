just having a look bits of the hill that

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.960 
just having a look bits of the hill that
I<00:03:59.769> um<00:04:00.540> haven't<00:04:01.540> covered<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:03.549> see<00:04:03.760> if<00:04:03.819> there's

yeah that's right
I<00:04:25.900> hope<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:28.320> as<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:29.500> said<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:29.830> previous<00:04:29.950> videos

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
I hope so as I said in previous videos

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.490 
I hope so as I said in previous videos
it's<00:04:31.030> really<00:04:31.480> this<00:04:31.600> polish<00:04:32.080> they're<00:04:32.290> really

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
it's really this polish they're really

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:44.890 
it's really this polish they're really
terrific

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.810 

you<00:04:45.530> just<00:04:45.710> need<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.949> be<00:04:46.040> very<00:04:46.070> careful<00:04:46.639> moving

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
you just need to be very careful moving

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.300 
you just need to be very careful moving
for<00:04:47.090> these<00:04:47.240> sorts<00:04:47.540> of<00:04:47.600> spots<00:04:47.900> with<00:04:48.169> you<00:04:49.130> know

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
for these sorts of spots with you know

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.990 
for these sorts of spots with you know
with<00:04:49.580> them<00:04:49.820> deep<00:04:50.180> holes<00:04:50.479> littering<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.440> place

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
with them deep holes littering the place

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:07.120 
with them deep holes littering the place
the<00:04:53.000> easier<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.479> fall<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.320> one

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.730 

really<00:05:08.120> it's<00:05:08.690> really<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:09.020> case<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.560> this<00:05:09.680> sort

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
really it's really a case of this sort

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.500 
really it's really a case of this sort
of<00:05:10.040> um<00:05:10.630> picking<00:05:11.630> away<00:05:11.750> care<00:05:12.110> for<00:05:12.350> abortion

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
of um picking away care for abortion

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.880 
of um picking away care for abortion
just<00:05:14.510> switching<00:05:14.930> on<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.170> detector<00:05:15.620> when<00:05:15.740> you

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
just switching on the detector when you

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.880 
just switching on the detector when you
sort<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.130> come<00:05:16.280> across<00:05:16.550> some<00:05:16.730> likely<00:05:17.090> ground

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.210 

yeah

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
yeah

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.420 
yeah
the<00:05:22.730> stay<00:05:23.060> close<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:24.110> me<00:05:24.200> Justin<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.740> don't

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
the stay close to me Justin I don't

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.120 
the stay close to me Justin I don't
think<00:05:25.580> there'll<00:05:25.700> be<00:05:25.730> any<00:05:25.820> problems<00:05:26.300> here<00:05:26.540> but

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
think there'll be any problems here but

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:35.380 
think there'll be any problems here but
there's<00:05:28.130> got<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.340> be<00:05:28.400> careful<00:05:33.940> and<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:35.150> will

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
there's got to be careful and I will

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.090 
there's got to be careful and I will
switch<00:05:35.720> off<00:05:35.930> and<00:05:36.170> we'll<00:05:36.440> see<00:05:36.680> if<00:05:36.740> we<00:05:36.830> can<00:05:36.950> find

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
switch off and we'll see if we can find

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.380 
switch off and we'll see if we can find
something<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:37.670> get<00:05:37.880> back<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.240> some<00:05:38.360> more

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
something and get back to some more

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:46.610 
something and get back to some more
detecting

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:57.330 

you

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.340 

yeah<00:05:58.340> we<00:05:58.639> I'm<00:05:58.819> just<00:05:59.180> did<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.750> bit<00:05:59.870> of<00:05:59.900> test<00:06:00.199> of

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
yeah we I'm just did a bit of test of

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.020 
yeah we I'm just did a bit of test of
the<00:06:00.470> soil<00:06:00.770> there<00:06:01.100> and<00:06:01.310> found<00:06:01.520> it's<00:06:01.699> probably<00:06:02.000> a

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
the soil there and found it's probably a

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.219 
the soil there and found it's probably a
bit<00:06:02.150> deep<00:06:02.389> to<00:06:03.100> detect<00:06:04.100> in<00:06:08.080> that's<00:06:09.080> right

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
bit deep to detect in that's right

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:10.779 
bit deep to detect in that's right
Justin<00:06:09.590> said<00:06:09.770> five<00:06:10.039> thousand<00:06:10.520> probably

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
Justin said five thousand probably

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.029 
Justin said five thousand probably
wouldn't<00:06:11.000> cut<00:06:11.180> the<00:06:11.300> mustard

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
wouldn't cut the mustard

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.950 
wouldn't cut the mustard
yeah<00:06:13.039> you<00:06:13.819> got<00:06:13.970> to<00:06:14.090> obviously<00:06:14.180> make<00:06:14.599> sure<00:06:14.630> that

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
yeah you got to obviously make sure that

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.409 
yeah you got to obviously make sure that
you're<00:06:15.080> detecting<00:06:15.349> in<00:06:15.650> soil<00:06:15.949> that's<00:06:16.419> not

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
you're detecting in soil that's not

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:42.210 
you're detecting in soil that's not
excessively<00:06:17.930> um<00:06:18.259> deep<00:06:36.400> yeah<00:06:37.400> you<00:06:37.820> never<00:06:37.970> know

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.770 

do<00:06:43.220> these<00:06:43.340> little<00:06:43.520> piles<00:06:43.849> of<00:06:44.030> gravel<00:06:44.150> amongst

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
do these little piles of gravel amongst

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.760 
do these little piles of gravel amongst
these<00:06:44.930> trees<00:06:45.320> here<00:06:48.159> sometimes<00:06:49.159> it's<00:06:49.340> worth

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
these trees here sometimes it's worth

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.580 
these trees here sometimes it's worth
crashing<00:06:51.770> away<00:06:51.979> into<00:06:52.220> those<00:06:53.139> having<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.229> detect

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
crashing away into those having a detect

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:05.939 
crashing away into those having a detect
at<00:06:54.770> the

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:05.949 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:26.899 

yeah<00:07:06.909> I<00:07:07.180> need<00:07:07.479> to<00:07:07.569> release<00:07:07.810> the<00:07:08.340> 5,500<00:07:09.749> 6,000

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:32.730 

so<00:07:27.909> hope<00:07:30.240> just<00:07:31.240> the<00:07:31.479> edge<00:07:31.569> this<00:07:31.870> big<00:07:32.259> gravelly

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 
so hope just the edge this big gravelly

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:40.499 
so hope just the edge this big gravelly
area<00:07:33.159> up<00:07:33.310> here<00:07:38.849> maybe<00:07:39.849> just<00:07:40.120> worth<00:07:40.300> protecting

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:40.509 
area up here maybe just worth protecting

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:43.649 
area up here maybe just worth protecting
along<00:07:41.110> here<00:07:41.379> a<00:07:41.409> little<00:07:41.590> bit<00:07:41.770> dis<00:07:42.009> dumb<00:07:42.659> the

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:43.659 
along here a little bit dis dumb the

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:45.570 
along here a little bit dis dumb the
off-chance<00:07:43.840> some<00:07:44.560> spilled<00:07:44.919> down<00:07:45.129> over<00:07:45.490> the

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:45.580 
off-chance some spilled down over the

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.059 
off-chance some spilled down over the
edge<00:07:45.610> to<00:07:45.879> you<00:07:46.029> I<00:07:46.469> suspect<00:07:47.469> a<00:07:47.560> probably<00:07:47.919> people

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:48.069 
edge to you I suspect a probably people

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:49.589 
edge to you I suspect a probably people
with<00:07:48.279> tend<00:07:48.490> to<00:07:48.550> miss<00:07:48.669> this<00:07:48.879> spot<00:07:49.120> so<00:07:49.360> let's

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 
with tend to miss this spot so let's

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:58.460 
with tend to miss this spot so let's
give<00:07:49.750> it<00:07:49.779> a<00:07:49.870> go

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:58.470 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.530 

you
