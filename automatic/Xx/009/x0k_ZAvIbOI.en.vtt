00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
it from the very top bagnall to the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.010 
it from the very top bagnall to the
bottom<00:01:16.729> drive<00:01:16.940> them<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:17.690> know<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.869> got

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
bottom drive them so you know you got

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:31.640 
bottom drive them so you know you got
perfect<00:01:18.409> careful<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:22.280> put<00:01:22.790> one

now I've made the whole thing of it big
so<00:01:43.640> what<00:01:44.640> i<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.969> do<00:01:45.179> is<00:01:45.420> transform<00:01:46.700> stretch<00:01:48.770> 16

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
so what i can do is transform stretch 16

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.920 
so what i can do is transform stretch 16
okay<00:01:51.940> so

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
okay so

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.860 
okay so
get<00:01:54.470> another<00:01:54.620> one<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:55.250> it'll<00:01:55.400> be<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.520> same<00:01:55.870> so

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
get another one and it'll be the same so

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.220 
get another one and it'll be the same so
go<00:01:57.260> into<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:59.210> want<00:01:59.360> this<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.720> be<00:01:59.870> just<00:01:59.900> a

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
go into that you want this to be just a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:07.340 
go into that you want this to be just a
little<00:02:00.260> bit<00:02:00.560> slanted<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:03.020> go<00:02:03.200> down<00:02:03.440> one

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.630 

and<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> way<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and not go all the way from the so it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:22.059 
and not go all the way from the so it
looks<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:15.440> diagonal<00:02:16.440> view<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.640> one

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:33.600 

you<00:02:22.640> make

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.140 

done

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
done

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.699 
done
maybe<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.959> bit<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.650> side<00:02:38.569> because<00:02:39.709> that

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
maybe a bit to the side because that

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.080 
maybe a bit to the side because that
would<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:42.230> more<00:02:43.230> over<00:02:43.739> there<00:02:43.920> what<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.879> can't

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
would be more over there what you can't

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.770 
would be more over there what you can't
see<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.299> was<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.780> forgive<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.849> effect

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
this is going to be the last one that we

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:08.880 
this is going to be the last one that we
have<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.310> draw<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.580> diagonal

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.530 

you<00:03:09.430> got<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.640> try<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:09.910> make<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.150> wound<00:03:10.390> up

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
you got to try and make this wound up

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.780 
you got to try and make this wound up
quite<00:03:10.780> good

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.369 

I'm<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.569> make<00:03:18.689> this<00:03:18.750> one<00:03:18.959> look<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.170> bit

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
I'm going to make this one look a bit

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.479 
I'm going to make this one look a bit
smaller<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.959> I'm<00:03:22.230> going<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.409> put<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.680> right<00:03:22.980> in

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
smaller and I'm going to put it right in

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:33.550 
smaller and I'm going to put it right in
the<00:03:24.000> center<00:03:27.920> you'll<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.129> why<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.489> minute

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.620 

okay<00:03:34.220> good

okay good

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.970 
okay good
another<00:03:36.320> one<00:03:36.550> now<00:03:37.550> this<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.880> easiest<00:03:38.570> one

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.020

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.630 

now<00:03:51.600> one<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:51.900> my

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.910 

just<00:03:56.330> put<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.569> right<00:03:56.990> in<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.260> middle

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.470 

now<00:04:01.520> copy<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.120> paste<00:04:02.300> that<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.990> few<00:04:03.860> times

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.640 

and<00:04:10.019> now<00:04:10.230> copy<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.950> there<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:13.019> go<00:04:13.170> into<00:04:13.530> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
and now copy that there and go into it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.750 
and now copy that there and go into it
and<00:04:14.459> transform<00:04:14.819> me<00:04:15.480> roughly<00:04:15.690> oh<00:04:16.459> it's<00:04:17.459> off<00:04:17.579> to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
and transform me roughly oh it's off to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:27.410 
and transform me roughly oh it's off to
the<00:04:17.880> side<00:04:18.120> then<00:04:20.209> copy<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:23.090> paste<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.449> there

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420

hi

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
hi

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.890 
hi
now<00:04:45.550> we<00:04:45.610> don't<00:04:45.790> need<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.060> mirror<00:04:46.300> for<00:04:46.450> this<00:04:46.720> one

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
now we don't need to mirror for this one

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.160 
now we don't need to mirror for this one
cuz<00:04:47.140> this<00:04:47.230> is<00:04:47.880> exactly<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.810> we'll<00:04:49.990> see<00:04:50.110> what

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
cuz this is exactly so we'll see what

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.310 
cuz this is exactly so we'll see what
that<00:04:50.230> looks<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:51.270> there<00:04:52.270> we<00:04:52.360> go<00:04:52.480> spinning

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.200 

curry<00:04:56.320> on<00:04:56.470> my<00:04:56.620> real<00:04:56.800> coin

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.100 

okay<00:05:01.220> now<00:05:02.220> all<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.610> do<00:05:02.819> is<00:05:03.419> make<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:03.840> into<00:05:04.050> an

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
okay now all you do is make that into an

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:13.230 
okay now all you do is make that into an
object

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.260 

collision<00:05:14.240> with<00:05:14.920> flyer<00:05:18.310> 91<00:05:19.310> destroy<00:05:20.120> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
collision with flyer 91 destroy the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.340 
collision with flyer 91 destroy the
instant<00:05:20.690> self<00:05:23.440> score<00:05:24.440> tab<00:05:25.600> set<00:05:26.600> score<00:05:27.050> or

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
instant self score tab set score or

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:34.020 
instant self score tab set score or
proof<00:05:27.950> of<00:05:27.980> one<00:05:28.730> group<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.930> tick<00:05:30.530> relative<00:05:31.750> and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
proof of one group so tick relative and

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:47.180 
proof of one group so tick relative and
that's<00:05:35.030> it<00:05:35.440> then<00:05:36.440> put<00:05:36.890> that<00:05:37.100> in<00:05:37.220> your<00:05:37.250> room

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.879 

just<00:05:47.700> give<00:05:47.910> it

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.780 

ok

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790

ok
and<00:05:55.330> this<00:05:55.450> is<00:05:55.570> what<00:05:55.720> it<00:05:55.810> looked<00:05:55.990> like

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.640 
my next tutorial in the Mario playlist
will<00:06:06.090> probably<00:06:06.600> timers<00:06:07.199> which<00:06:07.380> look<00:06:07.620> like

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
will probably timers which look like

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.100 
will probably timers which look like
that<00:06:08.870> they<00:06:09.870> count<00:06:10.740> down<00:06:10.889> from<00:06:11.160> 400<00:06:12.060> or<00:06:12.419> you<00:06:12.960> can

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
that they count down from 400 or you can

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.460 
that they count down from 400 or you can
edit<00:06:13.259> the<00:06:13.500> time<00:06:13.740> but<00:06:15.020> maritime<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.110> usually

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
edit the time but maritime the usually

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.190 
edit the time but maritime the usually
all<00:06:17.009> good

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.450 

scores<00:06:23.010> up<00:06:23.220> there<00:06:24.860> just<00:06:25.860> in<00:06:25.980> case<00:06:26.010> you<00:06:26.250> don't

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
scores up there just in case you don't

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.839 
scores up there just in case you don't
know

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:32.110
