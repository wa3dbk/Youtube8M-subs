espresso machine it operates on a very

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.269 
espresso machine it operates on a very
simple<00:00:14.910> principle<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.260> the

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
simple principle that this is the the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.580 
simple principle that this is the the
filter<00:00:20.279> basket<00:00:20.460> combination<00:00:21.420> cylinder<00:00:22.289> and

filter basket combination cylinder and
filter<00:00:22.980> basket<00:00:23.510> this<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> Porta<00:00:25.380> filter

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
filter basket this is the Porta filter

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.999 
filter basket this is the Porta filter
frame<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.769> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:30.830> almost<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
frame and this is the almost like a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.490 
frame and this is the almost like a
leading<00:00:32.489> block<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.630> acts<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> as

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
leading block but this is acts as it as

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.940 
leading block but this is acts as it as
a<00:00:34.559> filter<00:00:35.460> tamper<00:00:36.350> that<00:00:37.350> goes<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:37.770> the

the<00:00:49.430> principle<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:50.789> simple<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.280> piston

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the principle is very simple the piston

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.319 
the principle is very simple the piston
goes<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:56.149> pushes<00:00:57.149> down

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
goes up when you it pushes down

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.880 
goes up when you it pushes down
through<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> cylinder<00:00:58.260> when<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> push<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
through the cylinder when you push the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.250 
through the cylinder when you push the
arms<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.809> this<00:01:00.980> piston<00:01:01.980> seal<00:01:02.899> this<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
arms down this piston seal this is the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.539 
arms down this piston seal this is the
original<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.909> solid<00:01:06.780> rubber<00:01:07.549> molded

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
original and it is solid rubber molded

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.359 
original and it is solid rubber molded
piece<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> solid<00:01:10.020> face<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:11.280> this

piece that has a solid face where this
was<00:01:11.580> cut<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> half<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.360> removal<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.830> can

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
was cut in half for removal as you can

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.300 
was cut in half for removal as you can
see<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.180> complicated<00:01:16.159> architecture<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
see is very complicated architecture of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.179 
see is very complicated architecture of
the<00:01:17.460> seal<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.630> part<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.320> fits<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> groove

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the seal this part here fits in a groove

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.219 
the seal this part here fits in a groove
on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> end<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> piston<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.689> holds<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> in

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
on the end of the piston and holds it in

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
on the end of the piston and holds it in
place<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.340> has<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.790> leading<00:01:24.450> edge<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:26.180> but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
place this has the leading edge here but

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.160 
place this has the leading edge here but
we<00:01:28.049> were<00:01:28.229> able<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.850> come<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> design

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
we were able to come up with a design

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.289 
we were able to come up with a design
that<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.710> both<00:01:31.920> hold<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> end<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that would both hold on to the end of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
that would both hold on to the end of
the<00:01:33.390> piston<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.759> produce<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.090> needed<00:01:37.490> seal

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the piston and produce the needed seal

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.390 
the piston and produce the needed seal
on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.119> front<00:01:39.299> edge<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> put<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
on the front edge you do have to put a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
on the front edge you do have to put a
lot<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.060> 111<00:01:42.689> lubricant<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
lot of down 111 lubricant in here to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.249 
lot of down 111 lubricant in here to
make<00:01:43.799> sure<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> seals<00:01:44.520> properly<00:01:45.259> since

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
make sure that it seals properly since

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.789 
make sure that it seals properly since
we<00:01:46.439> don't<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.040> solid<00:01:47.280> face<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:50.450> this

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
we don't have that solid face but this

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.640 
we don't have that solid face but this
is<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.460> said<00:01:53.490> an<00:01:53.820> espresso<00:01:54.119> machine

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
is as I said an espresso machine

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.780 
is as I said an espresso machine
it<00:01:56.010> does<00:01:56.190> not<00:01:56.310> brew<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:57.750> French<00:01:58.740> press<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.490> or

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
it does not brew a French press or or

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.950 
it does not brew a French press or or
drip<00:02:00.330> or<00:02:00.660> or<00:02:01.260> even<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.580> arobie<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> some<00:02:03.840> of
