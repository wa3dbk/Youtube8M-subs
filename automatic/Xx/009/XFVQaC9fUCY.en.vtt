00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
so here's an update on the bonding

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.730 
so here's an update on the bonding
process<00:00:07.240> I<00:00:07.870> paused<00:00:08.080> it<00:00:08.230> for<00:00:08.380> a<00:00:08.410> little<00:00:08.620> while

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
process I paused it for a little while

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.160 
process I paused it for a little while
because<00:00:09.150> Edward<00:00:10.150> had<00:00:10.450> a<00:00:10.480> little<00:00:10.660> infection<00:00:10.900> on

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
because Edward had a little infection on

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.990 
because Edward had a little infection on
his<00:00:11.290> ear<00:00:11.440> that<00:00:11.620> he<00:00:11.740> was<00:00:11.860> recovering<00:00:12.130> from<00:00:12.370> and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
his ear that he was recovering from and

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.299 
his ear that he was recovering from and
I<00:00:13.929> wanted<00:00:14.380> them<00:00:14.500> to<00:00:14.530> both<00:00:14.830> be<00:00:14.980> in<00:00:15.010> tip-top

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
I wanted them to both be in tip-top

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.730 
I wanted them to both be in tip-top
shape<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:15.969> today<00:00:16.599> I<00:00:16.630> had<00:00:16.900> a<00:00:16.930> follow-up<00:00:17.259> visit

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
shape and today I had a follow-up visit

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.970 
shape and today I had a follow-up visit
to<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.189> vet<00:00:18.430> and<00:00:18.759> so<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.090> decided<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:19.960> risk<00:00:20.710> it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
to the vet and so I decided to risk it

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.040 
to the vet and so I decided to risk it
and<00:00:21.279> put<00:00:21.490> them<00:00:21.640> both<00:00:21.760> in<00:00:21.940> the<00:00:22.090> same<00:00:22.300> carrier

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
and put them both in the same carrier

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.920 
and put them both in the same carrier
it's<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.740> large<00:00:24.010> carrier<00:00:24.550> it's<00:00:25.180> wide<00:00:25.420> open<00:00:25.449> now

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
it's a large carrier it's wide open now

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.300 
it's a large carrier it's wide open now
as<00:00:26.170> you<00:00:26.289> can<00:00:26.439> see<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:28.680> part<00:00:29.680> of<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.949> bonding

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
as you can see and part of the bonding

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.229 
as you can see and part of the bonding
process<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:30.880> use<00:00:31.300> fear<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:32.019> to<00:00:32.260> be<00:00:32.379> the<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
process to use fear and to be the to

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.540 
process to use fear and to be the to
give<00:00:34.420> them<00:00:34.600> an<00:00:34.949> opportunity<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.100> see<00:00:36.309> that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
give them an opportunity to see that

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.040 
give them an opportunity to see that
they<00:00:36.670> can<00:00:36.820> take<00:00:36.969> comfort<00:00:37.210> in<00:00:37.420> one<00:00:37.570> another<00:00:37.809> and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
they can take comfort in one another and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.479 
they can take comfort in one another and
so<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.410> worked<00:00:38.680> I<00:00:38.829> was<00:00:38.920> ready<00:00:39.160> with<00:00:39.370> an

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
so that worked I was ready with an

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.100 
so that worked I was ready with an
additional<00:00:39.820> carrier<00:00:40.210> in<00:00:40.329> case<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.630> didn't<00:00:40.899> and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
additional carrier in case it didn't and

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.560 
additional carrier in case it didn't and
they<00:00:42.040> were<00:00:42.100> both<00:00:42.399> you<00:00:43.180> know<00:00:43.210> mildly

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
they were both you know mildly

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.479 
they were both you know mildly
traumatized<00:00:44.230> by<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.469> vet<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:44.950> then<00:00:45.070> got<00:00:45.309> back

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
traumatized by the vet and then got back

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.639 
traumatized by the vet and then got back
in<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.730> same<00:00:45.910> carrier<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.870> we're<00:00:47.469> pretty

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
in the same carrier and we're pretty

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.260 
in the same carrier and we're pretty
relaxed<00:00:48.250> in<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.460> carrier<00:00:48.760> with<00:00:48.940> each<00:00:49.059> other

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
relaxed in the carrier with each other

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.600 
relaxed in the carrier with each other
and<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:49.780> put<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.110> carrier<00:00:50.350> into<00:00:50.980> this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
and so I put the carrier into this

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.790 
and so I put the carrier into this
bonding<00:00:52.210> pen<00:00:52.450> in<00:00:52.719> neutral<00:00:53.110> territory<00:00:53.289> and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
bonding pen in neutral territory and

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.080 
bonding pen in neutral territory and
opened<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.129> up<00:00:54.219> and<00:00:54.399> Edward<00:00:54.730> hopped<00:00:54.940> out

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
opened it up and Edward hopped out

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.959 
opened it up and Edward hopped out
Edwards<00:00:55.930> this<00:00:56.079> one<00:00:56.289> and<00:00:56.980> Louis<00:00:57.489> has<00:00:57.640> stayed<00:00:57.820> in

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
Edwards this one and Louis has stayed in

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.189 
Edwards this one and Louis has stayed in
there<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.360> they've<00:00:58.480> been<00:00:58.660> in<00:00:58.809> there<00:00:58.960> now<00:00:59.140> for

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
there and they've been in there now for

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.110 
there and they've been in there now for
over<00:00:59.739> an<00:00:59.829> hour

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
over an hour

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.000 
over an hour
Edward<00:01:01.570> whenever<00:01:01.930> he<00:01:02.079> gets<00:01:02.260> near<00:01:02.410> Louis<00:01:02.770> sort

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
Edward whenever he gets near Louis sort

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.130 
Edward whenever he gets near Louis sort
of<00:01:03.070> boxes<00:01:03.550> had<00:01:03.879> her<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> little<00:01:04.390> bit<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:04.869> if<00:01:04.989> she

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
of boxes had her a little bit and if she

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.350 
of boxes had her a little bit and if she
comes<00:01:05.410> out<00:01:05.619> he<00:01:06.160> boxes<00:01:06.610> out<00:01:06.759> her<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> little<00:01:07.210> bit

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
comes out he boxes out her a little bit

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.620 
comes out he boxes out her a little bit
but<00:01:08.290> slowly<00:01:09.130> but<00:01:09.310> surely<00:01:09.460> it's<00:01:10.060> actually<00:01:10.450> been

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
but slowly but surely it's actually been

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.350 
but slowly but surely it's actually been
sort<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.229> changing<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.920> I'm<00:01:12.040> just<00:01:12.360> letting

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
sort of changing and I'm just letting

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.179 
sort of changing and I'm just letting
them<00:01:13.570> relax<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.439> same<00:01:14.619> space<00:01:14.890> together

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
them relax in the same space together

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.620 
them relax in the same space together
you'll<00:01:15.369> see<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:15.700> I'm<00:01:15.790> not<00:01:16.000> in<00:01:16.270> there<00:01:16.450> with

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
you'll see that I'm not in there with

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.850 
you'll see that I'm not in there with
them<00:01:17.010> but<00:01:18.010> I<00:01:18.040> am<00:01:18.250> keeping<00:01:18.729> active<00:01:19.659> guard<00:01:19.930> and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
them but I am keeping active guard and

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.200 
them but I am keeping active guard and
I'm<00:01:20.979> just<00:01:21.159> sort<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.340> letting<00:01:21.549> them<00:01:21.759> sort<00:01:22.090> it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
I'm just sort of letting them sort it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.320 
I'm just sort of letting them sort it
out<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.450> little<00:01:22.780> bit<00:01:22.900> so<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.000> what<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.240> can

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
out a little bit so this is what it can

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.450 
out a little bit so this is what it can
look<00:01:25.390> like<00:01:25.509> later<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.710> process<00:01:27.189> in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
look like later in the process in

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.980 
look like later in the process in
bonding<00:01:27.909> they<00:01:28.030> are<00:01:28.150> certainly<00:01:28.420> not<00:01:28.509> bonded

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
bonding they are certainly not bonded

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.410 
bonding they are certainly not bonded
yet<00:01:29.229> but<00:01:29.619> I'm<00:01:29.799> just<00:01:30.549> sort<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.909> letting<00:01:31.270> them

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
yet but I'm just sort of letting them

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.840 
yet but I'm just sort of letting them
work<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.810> out<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.350> this<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.159> only<00:01:33.460> possible

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
work it out and this is only possible

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.240 
work it out and this is only possible
after<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.869> know<00:01:35.530> for<00:01:35.710> sure<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.979> they're<00:01:36.130> not

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
after you know for sure that they're not

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.450 
after you know for sure that they're not
going<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.430> go<00:01:36.579> after<00:01:36.759> each<00:01:37.060> other

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
going to go after each other

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.690 
going to go after each other
Louis<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.700> considering<00:01:40.390> coming<00:01:40.600> out<00:01:41.700> Edward

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
Louis is considering coming out Edward

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.640 
Louis is considering coming out Edward
isn't<00:01:42.880> reacting<00:01:43.210> which<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.750> good<00:01:44.110> well<00:01:44.500> you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
isn't reacting which is good well you

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.560 
isn't reacting which is good well you
can<00:01:44.799> see<00:01:44.979> him<00:01:45.130> go<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.579> little<00:01:45.880> bit<00:01:46.060> back<00:01:46.210> after

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
can see him go a little bit back after
