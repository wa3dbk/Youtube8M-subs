00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.900
 all right 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.550
 hello dear friends of youtube we are going to 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.119
 do a test with this program the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.599
 Cinema 20 is a request from a subscriber 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.150
 Okay I commented it the good to me I did not 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.460
 cost 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.670
 to do it and I say good because in 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.680
 Spanish, there is nothing related either 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.129
 which is very new in the processor that has 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.650
 acquired so good I'm going to do it and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.350
 so they really see the performance and 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.050
 it deserves or is not worth buying 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.070
 and so in you good opinion they say 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.840
 they talk 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.970
 and for that we are here to help 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:01.070
 the processor in question is the 47 90 k 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:05.330
 of intense that in 1150 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.590
 a4 gigahertz processor with turbo to 4 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.590
 with 4 gigahertz 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.960
 a truck you must cannon and processor 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.960
 in question 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:33.150
 it is configured with a gigabyte board 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:33.150
 chips z 97 x gigabyte game in g one is worth 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.940
 mounted with a ssd samsung evo 250 disk 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.780
 gb 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:54.230
 skid memory at 2400 megahertz 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:02:00.620
 with a very good low latency l 10 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:03.270
 and a graphics card gtx 780 and 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.370
 the asus brand 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.080
 and that 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.750
 is for you to know the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.790
 previous characteristics before doing 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:18.660
 this is that test 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.460
 now let's proceed to altes and let's 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.460
 to verify that the performance and that 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.180
 powerful is or if it deserves or does not deserve 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:32.420
 sorry then okay then 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.420
 let's go for the test and go on commenting 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.010
 so let's go rendering 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.430
 the processor the truth I am very 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.470
 happy four cores with four 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.470
 virtual total 8 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.220
 and I say that I am very happy with him 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.090
 I think it came out on day 1 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.910
 a mess of 2014 I have acquired almost 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.160
 just leave on day 2 on 3 days 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.660
 I seem to buy it 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.180
 and well we are on the 7th on the 7th of 2014 and 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.810
 it came out in this same month of this same 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.130
 year 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.010
 here rendering at full pill and 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.840
 let's see how powerful and what is a 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.880
 bang cinema 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.310
 and here we get the results 870 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:34.790
 of agreement has thrown us a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:37.970
 score of 870 points is worth it and I am 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.379
 doing with the cinema bang 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.099
 15 so it's 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:48.440
 115 if they are not called 15 and now to 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.090
 then let's see the power in 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.920
 open gl is worth the graph 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.819
 here 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.719
 we go 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.930
 that is to say that the memory is in xm 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:05.530
 that's what they call 2 thousand 400 thousand a 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.530
 sometimes too 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.250
 and here we are seeing what is the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.250
 testing on some images 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.090
 right now he will also throw us the 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:23.449
 punctuation I remember cpu 47 90 here 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:27.490
 you have relaxed 870 now we will see 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.490
 then what will you give us in 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.230
 to what is the open gl in graphics is 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.310
 processing to it 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:45.960
 and well, here he is telling us that 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.960
 the 47 70 throws 820 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:58.500
 from 37 76 62 the intel core i7 s 37 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.810
 20 pass them to 590 now let's see the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:06.030
 score that we just threw a 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:09.720
 clock at 122 with 36 france per second 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.810
 before it has given me in waste of 37 but 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.849
 good around this score for 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.610
 have an idea, think also 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.310
 what point more match pointed more for 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.409
 clearly down I'm obviously recording 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.860
 and this as it is done with software though 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.860
 I have 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.820
 a hd a capturing and would not consume 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.180
 almost barely resources but hey I've 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:39.350
 decided to do this program 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.910
 then 860 in what is the open gl cpu 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.950
 122 with 36 hours per second and nothing more 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.460
 Well, here I say a lot of goodbye 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.780
 thanks for watching the video and even the 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.060
 next friends 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.060
 dale like to subscribe until later
