00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 what wave band here again what superior 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.690
 talk in this new tutorial and today they 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.540
 I'm going to teach a new option that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.240
 they added in the update tv 15 and 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.610
 good is an update that barely 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.430
 just arrived at what is called in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.199
 kraft and well he has added many 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 options and among them a new function 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 which is to repair objects in the inventory 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.369
 and today I will explain 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.810
 I'm going to sleep because it's raining and the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.900
 I really would not like to record with the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.759
 background rain sound so let's go 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.800
 to start first of all for what 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.320
 serves this option as its name 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.329
 says is to repair the tools and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 objects that we have in whatever 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.739
 our world or that we have gotten 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.629
 in this case we are going to give some clear 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.350
 examples with some tools that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.930
 I have around here then how is this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 function at the beginning I thought that it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.039
 gave through the creation table 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.809
 but it does not work well what you have 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.149
 what to do is the following 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.699
 let's say we have a sword in this case 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.369
 of stone we have here an enchanted one 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.630
 very worn sore and another that is a 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.610
 little spent 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.210
 then let's say I have these two 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.369
 swords and I say I'm going to put them together to 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.280
 repair it that is more or less for 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.020
 so not so worn out or how it's done 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 to do both ways you can 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.610
 repair and good how this is done 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 first you are going to take the sword that you 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.880
 want in this case I'm going to take this and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.520
 in the lower left corner you go to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.860
 see what it says x repair then if 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.679
 you want for some twig you just give it to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.170
 xy is already in this case and repair it and 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.470
 it was not completed so the entire bar and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.319
 it's a bit there to begin with so that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.580
 is new alarm but good so it is and 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:53.549
 your weapon would be repaired now according to 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.490
 that should be able to repair a weapon 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.500
 delighted what happens is what they were 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.390
 seeing then it seems that there is a failure not 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.450
 I know but you can not repair a gun 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.310
 that is delighted with one that does not 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.799
 in the PC version it can be done but 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.140
 I do not know why in the xbox version I do not know 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.630
 they should have been , but then 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.960
 I think they will have forgotten 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.670
 of what 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.240
 updates because it took too much 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.490
 in coming but good those days are others 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.920
 issues now going on with the armors 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.080
 this is a bit strange also because 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.790
 you should be able to repair armor in 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.800
 this case I am giving to the X and not 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.920
 it works that is, they can not be repaired 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.930
 breastplates so what would these 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.490
 materials would already be iron not 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.280
 can repair I'm giving it and I do not know 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.770
 repair what would be leather either 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.630
 it is repaired which is a bit bad in 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.120
 this case I will do it with the helmets and 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.800
 it does not work either, much less with 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.950
 tools now yes they love are 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.290
 rather enchanted armor either 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.780
 they work then it is a very 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.850
 great since I expected rather than 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.770
 you could do this from the armors 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.360
 tools that what the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.060
 Tools like I do not care one 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.980
 little but what about the armor had it 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.230
 like that more contemplated and I was 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.690
 eager to have this option but for 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.970
 what I see then they have not added it and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.320
 it's a bit strange now also it 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.320
 you can do with tools 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.720
 any kind she would be iron or 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.040
 wood what you want we are going to do 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.739
 this example with hope 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.299
 iron I'm going to put these together and that's it and 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.310
 neither can it be done with tools 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.129
 enchanted which is a chicken like them 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.109
 I say with tools would already be peaks h 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.670
 so then these things also 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.879
 can repair in this case we are going to 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.849
 do with an iron peak and this one 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.980
 it's barely created and it's a bit worn 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.260
 and this one does not lack very little for 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.840
 break then let's put them together and 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.879
 it is already there and neither can it be with what 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.150
 it would be enchanted tools is a bit 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.250
 is in this topic but it will be necessary 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.980
 wait a bit for it to improve 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.560
 all this whole function of preparing these 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.720
 tools and I'm going to do take it with 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.700
 you're after gold and you're 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.530
 together and I tell you that with tools 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.329
 delighted does not work so it is 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.700
 is watching what we are going to do with a 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.129
 shovel we have already repaired and do not pass 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.750
 with this and well, this has been the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.849
 small tutorial so they know how 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.340
 repair objects through inventory 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.289
 it's a bit ugly since I tell them that to me 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.949
 I would have liked it if you could 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:25.440
 repair so I peto two helmets and all 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.780
 the armor and you can also love it 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.220
 in singing to put together and repair what 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.290
 it would be tools that are not 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.260
 delighted with enchanted but like 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.140
 they are seeing then it does not work and it does not 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.000
 they put a little bit like they told me 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.280
 with the desire for more so I hope that 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.170
 in a next update either 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.330
 in a very long time when it's 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.160
 then add the option to be able to do 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.370
 all this from the armors for 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.080
 repair them and can also be repaired 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.540
 tools still so unloved 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.950
 with enchanted tools so nothing 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.420
 I hope this little one has served you 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.790
 tutorial and to the truth I did not know until 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.280
 I was looking for a little bit out there what 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.800
 that would be to the inventory and you are seeing 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.750
 until I saw this function so nothing 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.490
 I hope you liked that you have 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.140
 gone super well this little tutorial 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.790
 that has served you and if you can give a 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.620
 like comment or share videos grows 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.120
 lot and because we are so 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.830
 next video the channel a very welcome 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.830
