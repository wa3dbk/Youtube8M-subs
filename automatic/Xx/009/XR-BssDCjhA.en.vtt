actually<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.020> humanoid<00:01:28.350> crocodile<00:01:28.950> kind

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
actually like a humanoid crocodile kind

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.030 
actually like a humanoid crocodile kind
of<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:29.700> guess<00:01:30.329> alligator<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:31.110> likely<00:01:31.439> more

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
of or i guess alligator more likely more

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
of or i guess alligator more likely more
like<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> um<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.299> wonder<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.570> they're<00:01:33.659> gonna

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
like it um so I wonder if they're gonna

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
like it um so I wonder if they're gonna
do<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.350> got<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> skin<00:01:35.070> disease

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.760 
do that or just got the skin disease
whatever<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.329> either<00:01:37.290> way<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> think

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
whatever have you either way I think

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
whatever have you either way I think
probably<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.850> Arkham<00:01:39.299> Asylum

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
probably will be more like Arkham Asylum

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
probably will be more like Arkham Asylum
Arkham<00:01:40.320> origins<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.670> he'll<00:01:41.820> probably

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Arkham origins kind of so he'll probably

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.929 
Arkham origins kind of so he'll probably
be<00:01:42.270> CG<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> Hulk<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.850> know

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
with the mocap all this stuff so it'd be

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
with the mocap all this stuff so it'd be
pretty<00:01:47.250> cool<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.610> though<00:01:47.939> either<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.329> I'm

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
pretty cool to see though either way I'm

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.130 
pretty cool to see though either way I'm
really<00:01:49.439> curious<00:01:49.649> why<00:01:50.009> killer<00:01:50.310> croc's<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
really curious why killer croc's in it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.200 
really curious why killer croc's in it
I'm<00:01:52.140> guessing<00:01:52.560> definitely<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I'm guessing definitely there will be a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.130 
I'm guessing definitely there will be a
Batman<00:01:54.860> scene<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.219> movie<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.759> speak

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
Batman scene in this movie so to speak

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.270 
Batman scene in this movie so to speak
that<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.350> probably<00:01:58.409> take<00:01:58.710> down<00:01:58.860> Killer<00:01:59.100> Croc

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that will probably take down Killer Croc

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.300 
that will probably take down Killer Croc
and<00:01:59.399> guessing<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.680> also<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.219> know

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and guessing so I'm also you know

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 
and guessing so I'm also you know
