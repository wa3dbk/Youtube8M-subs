00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
looking at everything you know as the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.499 
looking at everything you know as the
scripture<00:01:38.700> said<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:38.970> things<00:01:39.210> work<00:01:39.390> together

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
scripture said all things work together

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
scripture said all things work together
for<00:01:39.750> good<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.380> those<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.040> love<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.549> Lord<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
for good to those that love the Lord and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.850 
for good to those that love the Lord and
are<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.630> called<00:01:42.659> according<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.619> his<00:01:43.770> purpose

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
are the called according to his purpose

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670 
are the called according to his purpose
so<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.240> took<00:01:45.420> place<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.470> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so I think that took place in all in

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
so I think that took place in all in

plant the corn and the green see that to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.789 
plant the corn and the green see that to
die<00:04:18.520> for<00:04:19.030> newness<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.480> come<00:04:19.780> out<00:04:19.960> of<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.560> it

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
die for newness to come out of it and it

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.430 
die for newness to come out of it and it
had<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.070> stay<00:04:21.280> under<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.150> earth<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:23.020> certain

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
had to stay under the earth for certain

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.050 
had to stay under the earth for certain
for

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
for

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.450 
for
for<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.240> incubation<00:04:24.810> period<00:04:25.139> before<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:26.280> pops

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
for the incubation period before it pops

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.960 
for the incubation period before it pops
up<00:04:26.730> you<00:04:27.480> know<00:04:27.600> above<00:04:27.870> their<00:04:28.050> surface<00:04:28.639> and<00:04:29.639> I

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
up you know above their surface and I

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.790 
up you know above their surface and I
was<00:04:30.090> thinking<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.510> since<00:04:31.410> he<00:04:31.590> says

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
was thinking that since he says

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.670 
was thinking that since he says
germination<00:04:32.450> what<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.780> no<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.260> has<00:04:34.470> to

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
germination what is it no that has to

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.360 
germination what is it no that has to
die<00:04:34.889> for<00:04:35.520> newness<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.150> life<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.660> come<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:38.310> I

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
die for newness of life to come and so I

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.750 
die for newness of life to come and so I
start<00:04:38.639> looking<00:04:38.970> at<00:04:39.090> my<00:04:39.270> myself<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:41.310> know<00:04:41.430> and
