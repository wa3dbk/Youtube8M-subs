00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
use before applying well I was gonna

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.040 
use before applying well I was gonna
make<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.410> condom<00:04:04.950> joke<00:04:05.160> there<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:05.780> basically<00:04:06.780> I

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
think we should leave that out but

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640 
think we should leave that out but
