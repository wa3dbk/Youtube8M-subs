now<00:00:05.269> we<00:00:05.330> know<00:00:05.630> about<00:00:05.870> the<00:00:06.170> rule<00:00:06.319> of<00:00:06.350> thirds<00:00:06.819> we

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:07.819 
now we know about the rule of thirds we

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.940 
now we know about the rule of thirds we
know<00:00:07.970> where<00:00:08.330> to<00:00:08.360> place<00:00:08.750> our<00:00:08.959> single<00:00:09.530> focal

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
know where to place our single focal

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.129 
know where to place our single focal
point<00:00:10.190> and<00:00:10.549> we<00:00:11.000> know<00:00:11.150> where<00:00:11.389> to<00:00:11.570> put<00:00:11.809> the

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
point and we know where to put the

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.100 
point and we know where to put the
horizon<00:00:12.610> now<00:00:13.610> it's<00:00:13.790> time<00:00:14.089> to<00:00:14.120> take<00:00:14.629> a<00:00:14.660> look<00:00:14.960> at

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
horizon now it's time to take a look at

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.440 
horizon now it's time to take a look at
how<00:00:15.320> we<00:00:15.379> can<00:00:15.650> inject<00:00:15.980> that<00:00:16.189> illusion<00:00:16.759> of<00:00:17.150> the

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
how we can inject that illusion of the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.850 
how we can inject that illusion of the
third<00:00:17.720> dimension<00:00:18.140> within<00:00:19.009> our<00:00:19.570> 2-dimensional

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
third dimension within our 2-dimensional

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.819 
third dimension within our 2-dimensional
rectangle<00:00:22.509> that<00:00:23.509> illusive<00:00:24.020> feeling<00:00:24.410> of<00:00:24.529> depth

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
rectangle that illusive feeling of depth

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.639 
rectangle that illusive feeling of depth
that<00:00:25.070> can<00:00:25.309> be<00:00:25.399> so<00:00:25.610> very<00:00:26.180> dramatic<00:00:26.750> I've<00:00:27.619> a

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
that can be so very dramatic I've a

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.530 
that can be so very dramatic I've a
feeling<00:00:27.919> that<00:00:28.309> that<00:00:28.460> old<00:00:28.700> wooden<00:00:29.059> frame<00:00:29.360> we

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
feeling that that old wooden frame we

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.479 
feeling that that old wooden frame we
saw<00:00:29.660> earlier<00:00:30.050> might<00:00:30.619> come<00:00:30.800> in<00:00:30.919> very<00:00:31.130> useful

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
saw earlier might come in very useful

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:46.140 
saw earlier might come in very useful
here<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.239> let's<00:00:32.419> go<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:32.599> take<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.809> look

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.900 

here<00:00:47.080> I've<00:00:47.260> used<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.650> foreground<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.790> old

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
here I've used the foreground of the old

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.380 
here I've used the foreground of the old
framework<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.890> picture<00:00:51.310> of<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.580> view<00:00:51.910> with

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
framework for a picture of the view with

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.040 
framework for a picture of the view with
the<00:00:52.510> cottage<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:55.120> frameworks<00:00:55.660> actually

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
the cottage the frameworks actually

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.650 
the cottage the frameworks actually
acting<00:00:56.470> as<00:00:56.650> another<00:00:57.100> layer<00:00:57.400> but<00:00:58.240> I<00:00:58.270> can<00:00:58.540> see

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
acting as another layer but I can see

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.970 
acting as another layer but I can see
another<00:00:58.990> one<00:00:59.110> over<00:00:59.530> here

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
another one over here

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.460 
another one over here
let's<00:01:00.250> go<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:00.520> investigate<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:01.270> in<00:01:07.470> this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
let's go and investigate that in this

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.060 
let's go and investigate that in this
case<00:01:08.740> I'm<00:01:09.070> using<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.730> grass<00:01:10.300> as<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.660> layer<00:01:11.070> I've

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
case I'm using the grass as a layer I've

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.770 
case I'm using the grass as a layer I've
used<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.460> cottage<00:01:12.790> as<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.910> focal<00:01:13.330> point<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
used the cottage as a focal point the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.810 
used the cottage as a focal point the
grass<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> foreground<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.400> bitch<00:01:15.640> will

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
grass is a foreground that bitch will

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.090 
grass is a foreground that bitch will
have<00:01:15.940> a<00:01:16.060> tremendous<00:01:16.810> feeling<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.320> depth<00:01:17.620> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
have a tremendous feeling of depth the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.850 
have a tremendous feeling of depth the
third<00:01:18.460> dimension<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:20.170> also<00:01:20.380> got<00:01:20.680> lovely

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
third dimension it's also got lovely

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:31.630

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.230 

you

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.870 

once<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.320> start<00:01:39.860> looking<00:01:40.250> at<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.490> world<00:01:40.640> as<00:01:40.850> a

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
once you start looking at the world as a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.270 
once you start looking at the world as a
series<00:01:41.150> of<00:01:41.330> layers<00:01:41.690> you<00:01:41.960> begin<00:01:42.710> seeing<00:01:43.040> them

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
series of layers you begin seeing them

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.300 
series of layers you begin seeing them
everywhere<00:01:44.030> here<00:01:45.020> I've<00:01:45.320> not<00:01:45.710> actually<00:01:45.860> used

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
everywhere here I've not actually used

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.490 
everywhere here I've not actually used
the<00:01:46.460> cottage<00:01:46.910> as<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.090> focal<00:01:47.540> point<00:01:47.570> but<00:01:48.350> that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
the cottage as a focal point but that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.280 
the cottage as a focal point but that
wooden<00:01:48.980> framework<00:01:49.280> has<00:01:49.880> given<00:01:50.300> depth<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:51.260> a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
wooden framework has given depth to a

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.360 
wooden framework has given depth to a
view<00:01:51.650> of<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.890> bay

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
view of the bay

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.440 
view of the bay
it's<00:01:52.820> almost<00:01:53.180> three<00:01:53.570> dimensional<00:01:55.090> trees<00:01:56.090> and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
it's almost three dimensional trees and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.960 
it's almost three dimensional trees and
branches<00:01:56.660> are<00:01:57.110> particularly<00:01:58.040> useful<00:01:58.250> when

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
branches are particularly useful when

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.370 
branches are particularly useful when
photographing<00:01:59.570> landscapes<00:02:01.900> but<00:02:02.900> buildings

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
photographing landscapes but buildings

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.190 
photographing landscapes but buildings
too<00:02:03.680> can<00:02:04.280> be<00:02:04.369> treated<00:02:04.760> in<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.000> same<00:02:05.030> way<00:02:05.270> to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
too can be treated in the same way to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.449 
too can be treated in the same way to
add<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.650> depth<00:02:08.140> add<00:02:09.140> some<00:02:09.530> strong<00:02:10.009> back

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
add that depth add some strong back

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.610 
add that depth add some strong back
light<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:11.000> your<00:02:11.120> layers<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.690> are<00:02:12.140> really

light to your layers and are really

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.910 
light to your layers and are really
powerful<00:02:13.040> dramatic<00:02:13.910> image<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.390> result<00:02:14.920> even

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
powerful dramatic image can result even

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.100 
powerful dramatic image can result even
when<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> subject<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.820> tranquil<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.630> the
