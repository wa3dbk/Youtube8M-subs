00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.589 
that my suggestion is that you've got
words<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> Bible<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.029> that<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> accept

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
words in the Bible and that you accept

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.150

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
like the prophecy that you're attached

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.420 
like the prophecy that you're attached
to<00:00:32.279> Mohammed<00:00:33.050> which<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.260> weird<00:00:34.980> attached<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
to Mohammed which is weird attached to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.190 
to Mohammed which is weird attached to
the<00:00:35.520> Holy<00:00:35.640> Spirit<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.630> tennis<00:00:36.960> match

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the Holy Spirit so the tennis match

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.810 
the Holy Spirit so the tennis match
notice<00:00:37.620> how<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.800> spirit<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.430> moment

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
notice how we spirit know it's moment

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.680 
notice how we spirit know it's moment
and<00:00:39.829> then<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:42.000> say<00:00:42.180> about<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> major

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and then you say about the major

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
and then you say about the major
revisions<00:00:43.290> being<00:00:43.680> changed<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.969> Bible

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
revisions being changed but the Bible

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.920 
revisions being changed but the Bible
and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.620> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> ask<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.930> response

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and I just want to ask your response

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.979 
and I just want to ask your response
this<00:00:49.309> I'm<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> speed<00:00:51.239> gun<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
this I'm not a lot of speed gun so it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.729 
this I'm not a lot of speed gun so it
takes<00:00:52.170> me<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> bit<00:00:52.699> right<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
takes me a bit right so and that the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.420 
takes me a bit right so and that the
Bible<00:00:56.070> Translators<00:00:56.840> use<00:00:57.840> Greek<00:00:58.739> manuscripts

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
Bible Translators use Greek manuscripts

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
Bible Translators use Greek manuscripts
that<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.670> back<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> second<00:01:00.510> century<00:01:00.980> so

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that go back to the second century so

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
that go back to the second century so
another<00:01:02.460> argument<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.969> surely<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> can't

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
another argument that surely you can't

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.230 
another argument that surely you can't
say<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.220> Bible<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.790> revised

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
say is about that the Bible is revised

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840 
say is about that the Bible is revised
since<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> King<00:01:07.140> James<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.560> 1611<00:01:08.040> five<00:01:08.490> times

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
since the King James in 1611 five times

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.750 
since the King James in 1611 five times
so<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.689> can't<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.200> true<00:01:10.439> anymore<00:01:10.560> because<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so it can't be true anymore because the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
so it can't be true anymore because the
more<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.420> revised<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.380> century

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
more that they revised it this century

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
more that they revised it this century
have<00:01:14.070> found<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:14.549> manuscripts<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.540> go

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
have found more manuscripts that go

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
have found more manuscripts that go
further<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:17.220> use<00:01:17.430> these<00:01:17.670> Greek

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
further back and they use these Greek

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.760 
further back and they use these Greek
manuscripts<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.600> compare<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.590> these

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
manuscripts and compare it or like these

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.359 
manuscripts and compare it or like these
orpheens<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> question<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.740> how

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
orpheens do so the question is and how

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.660 
orpheens do so the question is and how

wrought by this sort of arguing because

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499
