but<00:06:22.750> I<00:06:22.810> think<00:06:23.080> with<00:06:23.200> the<00:06:23.290> fundamental<00:06:23.980> we<00:06:24.130> have

but I think with the fundamental we have

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.650 
but I think with the fundamental we have
right<00:06:24.550> now<00:06:24.580> I<00:06:24.970> think<00:06:25.030> that's<00:06:25.270> the<00:06:25.390> direction

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
right now I think that's the direction

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.580 
right now I think that's the direction
we<00:06:26.080> need<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.440> look<00:06:27.040> at<00:06:27.220> it<00:06:27.370> 2016<00:06:28.300> but<00:06:29.170> it's<00:06:29.440> not

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
we need to look at it 2016 but it's not

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.100 
we need to look at it 2016 but it's not
an<00:06:29.710> easy<00:06:29.860> job<00:06:30.250> every<00:06:30.880> hardly<00:06:31.150> everybody<00:06:31.930> have

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
to work together toward 2016 but I think

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.560 
to work together toward 2016 but I think
the<00:06:35.620> most<00:06:35.740> important<00:06:36.190> for<00:06:36.370> us<00:06:36.520> again<00:06:36.970> to<00:06:37.330> focus
