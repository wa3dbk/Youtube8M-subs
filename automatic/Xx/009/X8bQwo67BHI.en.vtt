what you deserved
now<00:01:43.350> obviously<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.979> bear<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.189> mind

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
now obviously we have to bear in mind

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
now obviously we have to bear in mind
that<00:01:44.460> he<00:01:44.579> doesn't<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.659> used<00:01:45.960> so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that he doesn't want these to be used so

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
that he doesn't want these to be used so
far<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.500> way<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.770> make<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.950> worse<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.360> worst

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
far the way you make it worse the worst

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
far the way you make it worse the worst
of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> worst<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.530> obviously<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
of the worst are because obviously a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.590 
of the worst are because obviously a
professor<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> university<00:01:50.670> isn't<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.479> be

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
professor at a university isn't gonna be

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
professor at a university isn't gonna be
like<00:01:51.720> yeah<00:01:51.899> actually<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.470> got<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> great<00:01:53.070> paper

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
like yeah actually I got a great paper

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.660 
like yeah actually I got a great paper
this<00:01:53.790> here's<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> website<00:01:54.509> yeah<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> have

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
this here's the website yeah but I have

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
this here's the website yeah but I have
to<00:01:56.820> imagine<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> quality

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
to imagine that if this is the quality

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.899 
to imagine that if this is the quality
of<00:01:58.530> look<00:01:58.740> I've<00:01:58.890> never<00:01:59.070> used<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.820> this

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
of look I've never used one but if this

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
of look I've never used one but if this
is<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> quality<00:02:00.630> why<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:01.049> people<00:02:01.259> continue

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
is the quality why would people continue

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
is the quality why would people continue
to<00:02:01.860> use<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.850> maybe<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.240> rely<00:02:03.570> on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to use it or maybe they just rely on

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.149 
to use it or maybe they just rely on
each<00:02:03.780> student<00:02:04.110> using<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> once<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.740> mean<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
each student using it once I mean that

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.560 
each student using it once I mean that
could<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.759> could<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> thing<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.360> think

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
could be that could be the thing I think

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
could be that could be the thing I think
we've<00:02:06.689> all<00:02:06.899> taken<00:02:07.110> those<00:02:07.380> classes<00:02:07.560> where

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
we've all taken those classes where

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.639 
we've all taken those classes where
no<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.939> you<00:02:09.329> need<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> specific<00:02:09.840> credit<00:02:10.379> maybe

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
no you you need a specific credit maybe

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.959 
no you you need a specific credit maybe
you<00:02:10.769> don't<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.159> want<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.579> there<00:02:11.790> and

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
you don't really want to be there and

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.399 
you don't really want to be there and
maybe<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:12.719> time<00:02:13.049> where<00:02:13.319> you're

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
maybe that's the one time where you're

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.319 
maybe that's the one time where you're
kind<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.709> tempted<00:02:14.159> like<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.519> don't<00:02:15.000> really<00:02:15.120> want

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
would hope that they had it ready before

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.199 
would hope that they had it ready before
turning<00:02:25.859> it<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.370> make<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.609> even<00:02:26.819> worse<00:02:26.970> he

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
turning it in to make it even worse he

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.670 
turning it in to make it even worse he
says<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.629> much<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.079> material<00:02:28.590> was

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
says that much of this material was

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.679 
says that much of this material was
actually<00:02:28.859> plagiarized<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.849> don't<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.510> why

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
actually plagiarized I don't know why

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.569 
actually plagiarized I don't know why
they<00:02:30.870> were<00:02:30.930> using<00:02:31.409> this<00:02:31.680> nonsense<00:02:32.280> quotes

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
they were using this nonsense quotes

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.190 
they were using this nonsense quotes
about<00:02:32.730> wizards<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.420> healers<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:33.959> whatever

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
about wizards and healers or whatever

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.179 
about wizards and healers or whatever
but<00:02:34.379> apparently<00:02:34.650> they<00:02:34.769> took<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:35.010> from

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
but apparently they took that from

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.069 
but apparently they took that from
something<00:02:35.489> else<00:02:35.629> so<00:02:36.629> they're<00:02:36.780> not<00:02:36.840> good<00:02:36.989> at

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
something else so they're not good at

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:37.940 
something else so they're not good at
writing<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.379> they're<00:02:37.470> also<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.680> good<00:02:37.859> at

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
writing and they're also not good at

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.789 
writing and they're also not good at
plagiarizing<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.739> was

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
plagiarizing and so because it was

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.830 
plagiarizing and so because it was
plagiarized<00:02:41.040> he<00:02:41.609> contacted<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.389> essay<00:02:42.629> nose

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
plagiarized he contacted the essay nose

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.300 
plagiarized he contacted the essay nose
and<00:02:43.049> he<00:02:43.109> said<00:02:43.319> look<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.620> want<00:02:43.769> my<00:02:43.829> money<00:02:44.099> back

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.420 
and he said look I want my money back

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
this isn't even original crap this is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.369 
this isn't even original crap this is
repurposed<00:02:47.430> crap<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.659> he<00:02:48.810> says<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.230> they

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
repurposed crap and he says that they

refuse to give the money saying that it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.970 
refuse to give the money saying that it
hadn't<00:02:51.000> been<00:02:51.060> copied<00:02:51.480> which<00:02:51.959> what<00:02:52.799> would<00:02:52.919> he

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980
