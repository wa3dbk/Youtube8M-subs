00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.170
 hello my name and dead claude 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.170
 this safe travel kit 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.950
 honor of money 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.170
 then a good twenty years we 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.960
 find a little of everything in flowers and there he 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.140
 are big cities like miami tampa 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.110
 that buzzes with activities all that there is 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.550
 smaller cities but with a 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.230
 special character whether the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.860
 lists would have as a saint Augustine 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.950
 or where bicycles hide a little Caribbean 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.670
 like kanye west for example we find 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.370
 also an amazing cultural vitality 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.070
 who is a suspect of several then 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.170
 there are important museums of the sites 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.390
 important historical also on the plane 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.280
 outdoor with a lot of experience 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.440
 aviv florida particular would not it be 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.570
 than in the famous Everglades Park 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.370
 who is well known then the guide of 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.260
 obviously one of his great strengths and 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.400
 to guide people precisely to go 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.020
 leleu invite them to go beyond the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.720
 beach of the traditional beach which is 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.890
 always we do not hide the reason 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.350
 first that makes people go in 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.610
 florida but often not very far to 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.380
 something interesting then 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.229
 the classic example that I often give 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.030
 people who go to the beach tournaments 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.549
 which is a year resorts a very 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.340
 very well known and very busy unless 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.530
 one hour drive north of Strait 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.840
 beach there is the beautiful city of st 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.460
 augustine not right then one is to be 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.549
 people were going to visit saint-augustin 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.039
 so at the beginning of the work or not we have 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.009
 set up a series of lester matic that 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.659
 therefore invites people to learn from the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.479
 attractions or experiences to live 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.369
 according to their interests then the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.630
 hands and the most beautiful beaches the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.399
 cultural activities and more 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.159
 interesting to nanterre so this kind of 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.869
 of doubt it quickly allows 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.399
 to identify the things that we 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.829
 interested because one of my heartbeat 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.490
 it's west that's at 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.619
 the extreme south of florida to the extreme 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.670
 south of the united states but my little asset 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.270
 here is a city that is really very 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 pleasant 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.490
 an atmosphere that is unique to him 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.850
 pleasant to ride by bike for example 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.680
 a renaudot lakers and st petersburg on 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.780
 the west coast of florida must not 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.840
 very far from tampa ars is a resort 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.600
 classic family seaside with the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.430
 beach 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.080
 water activities all this but in 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.080
 same time in the center of the city 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.240
 found a variety dating type 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.680
 really amazing cultural then 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.210
