00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.860
 hi I am in favor of Ferrari and teach 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.000
 you a different decoration for your 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.940
 Christmas tree 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.100
 the idea is to make in people from 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.770
 paper circles if I had already thought 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 Well, then do not come with me, you will. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 learn fast by taking a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.680
 circle and fold 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.050
 you will fold one several times in the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.620
 Truth doubles here in half after 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:43.980
 again in that good because this one here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.829
 will be your new template to it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.289
 stay that size 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.199
 unfolded and you will have your guide 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.660
 because we are going to cut all 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 circles following these rays that the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.149
 people just played 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.149
 so look there I ticked 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.700
 and I'll cut a thing q cells times 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.700
 I ask is ours everyone should have the same 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.710
 size is not necessary this is a 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.220
 work so a free you can 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.040
 do as you see fit 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.369
 goes cutting and leaves all the tabs 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.670
 loose so you can mark the other 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.979
 circles and also cut 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.399
 After you've done this, you 'll get to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.550
 results such as those of the 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.350
 the tabs are cut and we're going to use 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.539
 now a barbecue stick to roll up 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 How do I position on the toothpick here in the 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.340
 half carrying the flap 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:03.130
 the two parts this one 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.130
 and the other 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.759
 You keep rolling all eight matches. 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.250
 that you cut to form a star 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.310
 Look how she stays I already brought that 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.880
 ready she gets the eight lashes 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.060
 and you will do several of them 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.080
 because the beautiful one in xerÃ©m plays ball for 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.450
 leave the ornament nice for the tree 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 and after you've done it all, it's just 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.370
 to fit in 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.700
 So how do we do it? 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.770
 in a way that the nodes that our 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.540
 waters are not found and you 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.540
 sewing like a needle
