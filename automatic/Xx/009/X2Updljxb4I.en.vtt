00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.080
 Their role and positioning: usually, weapons become associated with the forces that manipulate them. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.679
 Help shape your identity 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.099
 Passed and passed legally good - this is a good man gun: 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.110
 The MP5. 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.710
 So how does it earn the hero status? 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.750
 What makes a counter-terrorism perfect match? 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 What is this slap in the face? 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.490
 The MP5 is a German weapon, manufactured by Heckler and Koch. 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.490
 The H&amp;K content was established in 1949 and was directly awakened by the Second World War. 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.110
 The company put its name from its two three co-founders: they are all before 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.670
 Mauser engineer: Alex Seidel, Edmund Keller and Theodore Koch. 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 At first, they made machine tools and precision metal parts - but in 1956 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.010
 The West German government issued a new rifle for the Federal Defence Force. 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 Weida proposed to design on the basis of G3, a gun designed by former Mauser engineers 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.420
 At CETME, the Spanish Technical College. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.020
 Their bid proved to be successful, and H&amp;K developed several G3 derived designs to suit different 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.400
 Role - with MP5 among them. 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.420
 Originally known as HK54, the work began in 1964 with the new SMG. 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 It triggers a 9mm Ruger round, a NATO standard caliber pistol. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.430
 The original magazine was straight, but there was a minor revision that gave the weapon in 1977, its unique 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.850
 And slightly bent 30 rounds of magazines. 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 Like its parent company G3, the MP5 has a roller delay backflush mechanism - a simple and effective 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.030
 Sufficient action is at the end of the war in Germany. 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.159
 There are quite a few MP5 variants available: from the original HK54, also known as 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:22.159
 MP5A1; fixed stock MP5A2 and A4; telescopic stock MP5A3; sliding stock MP5A5. 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.719
 The MP5K-Kurz or - is a shortened variant that is possible compared to the smallest package: 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.819
 This variant MP5SD has indispensable suppression, concealed use; and has a larger caliber 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.779
 Variants too much: such as MP5 / 10, this powerful automatic 10mm wheel; and MP5 / 40, 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.650
 This triggers 0.40 Smith and Wesson. 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.969
 a flexible, configurable weapon, then - and one has been heavily blessed 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.260
 Police and special forces. 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 In 1980, a specific event was fixed in the iconic status of MP5: siege on Iran 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.749
 Embassy in London. 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:15.749
 6 terrorists, hostages 26, a densely populated city location and live TV: 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:23.650
 This is a terrible one in a very tense situation and a lot of it will do. 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.239
 On the sixth day of the siege, the hostages were killed. This prompted immediate action to pass 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.609
 British special air service - the next code to operate Nimrod. 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:41.299
 17 minutes after their first default, 5 terrorists were killed and eventually captured - and all 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.689
 The rest of the hostages were rescued. 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.969
 The mission’s success has strengthened the SAD’s reputation with the Dadi Special Operations Force: 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:58.969
 These events have served as precision ads for SMG. 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.749
 Its good record and a city suitable for close-up battles 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:10.079
 Terrorism makes it a suitable choice for any counter-terrorism role - one must have 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.729
 Contain any game that depicts this power. 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:20.190
 SAS's "Legendary live-action exercises in the Killing House are described in this tutorial 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.190
 Call of Duty 4: Among them you drill the following tasks with the Plywood Phantom Project. 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.060
 The presence of MP5 here is really about life, this game shows the real training pastime 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.730
 The exercise showed that SAS will carry out the siege preparations in the embassy. 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.830
 And MP5 saw the best display tactical shooting game in the armory, then: this is a flagship 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.280
 The six series of weapons of the rainbow. 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.280
 When it comes to dealing with the threat of terrorism, nothing is better. 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.290
 A quirk, cropped during the reloading of MP5 is the notorious "Hong Kong Slap": an open hand 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.450
 Tap the firing bar to insert the fresh magazine and send the bolt forward 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.630
 The upper circle. 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.480
 This seems reckless to your weapon, but it is actually recommended operation: a 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.740
 A softer approach may not drive the gun home properly. 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.740
 In addition, the MP5 is a working weapon - and a housing that can withstand rougher. 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.730
 The 'slap' is not the only MP5 - but it's a cool move to help strengthen it 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.430
 Through the iconic nature of the novel, as well as the facts. 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.640
 Its unique on-screen presence and association with heroic behavior make it a prominent choice 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.140
 In the cinema. 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.860
 The weapon has turned into hundreds of films - usually in the hands of good people, 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.570
 But sometimes it reveals a more impetuous side. 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.020
 With the Die Hard 2 and the remarkable appearance matrix, the weapon appears outside 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.810
 The anti-terrorist role in the game, through the classic inspired action film. 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.210
 Games like Marx Payne and Modern Warfare 2 Indulge SMG's more arrogant side: far 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.150
 From the strictly controlled discipline-trained special forces, the MP5 can also 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.390
 Use spray and prayer tactics. 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.180
 It may waste ammunition, but it looks good on the screen - more empty impeach means more 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.340
 Stylish and heavy, with a full slap. 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.340
 Today, many more modern submachine guns and personal defense weapons are scrambling to replace 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.910
 50-year-old MP5 design. 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.910
 Weida even offers two options: a more modern and larger calibre UMP-45, 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:50.410
 And the short armored power MP7: but the classic 9mm SMG is still dominant 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:57.050
 Supreme: Loved by those who use it, and is everywhere with police around the world. 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:04.050
 A legendary submachine gun has earned a reputation for baptism through fire. 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.770
 Always calm in the crisis, its perfect anti-terrorism weapon: 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.100
 The MP5. 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.370
 confidence. 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.300
 Force order. 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.990
 The bane of terrorism. 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.820
 Thank you very much for watching - the iconic weapon will return: until next time, bid farewell.
