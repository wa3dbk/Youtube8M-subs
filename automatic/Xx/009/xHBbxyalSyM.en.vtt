00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.280
 Hello everyone! Today we are with Lisa 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.680
 We went to Tokyo Ranvey 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.780
 And since we came to Shin Yokohama 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.420
 And here is the Ramen Museum 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.640
 I was here a year ago but didnâ€™t shoot a video 

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.294
 And today came again 

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:27.614
 And as always for the first time 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.080
 Come on! 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.740
 We got these cute tickets from Maneki cats 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.560
 Here apparently various ramen are gathered from all over Japan. 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.480
 Many different types and everything looks so delicious! 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.840
 We went here and hit the Showa era 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.100
 Here is the atmosphere! 

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.524
 What place! 

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:10.895
 Heard the voice of a cat 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.220
 Ramen has come! 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.220
 We ordered a mini-portion, and she is so big! 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 Then what does a regular serving look like? 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.700
 And they ordered miso-ramen, I like it 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.840
 I do not know yet, but I will surely like it because I am very hungry 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 I have problems breaking sticks, yes 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.760
 It was hot 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 Tasty! I love miso ramen 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.720
 Yummy! 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.800
 I already love miso ramen 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.020
 And the atmosphere here is amazing. 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.220
 Here is something like a temple and there are even omikuji! 

00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:33.694
 I wonder what in such a place 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.120
 This is a ramen flavor with salt, a mini portion. 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.880
 Let's try 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.569
 He looks so cute 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.540
 Naruto! 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.520
 Yummy! 

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:15.835
 Not so fat for ramen 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.700
 Compared with the previous miso-ramen noodles more thin 

00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:24.353
 And not so fat 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.460
 Naruto! 

00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:30.254
 His color is also different. 

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:37.354
 It's easy to eat 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.900
 Good thing we left him last 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.180
 The taste is absolutely different from the previous one. 

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:51.353
 And its easier to eat 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.539
 Back to the present 

00:03:56.074 --> 00:03:58.074
 We are so full 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.360
 We two ate two mini portions 

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:07.334
 How do others eat a lot? 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.500
 Those who were here, how many plates did you eat? 

00:04:18.854 --> 00:04:20.854
 For two servings this is the limit. 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 It's hard to go x) 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.520
 And here are sold souvenirs 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.554
 let's get a look 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.220
 Here are different types of ramen from all over Japan 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.560
 It turns out plates for ramen also differ 

00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:52.114
 I did not know that it happens 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.700
 I saw this anime! There the cat prepares ramen 

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:03.354
 This is manga 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.700
 Why is the cat preparing ramen? 

00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:14.934
 So, we ate ramen 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.820
 Together in two portions 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.760
 But it was delicious! 

00:05:23.093 --> 00:05:25.093
 I haven't eaten ramen for a long time 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.840
 After all, usually girls are uncomfortable to go into ramenna 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.360
 Usually there are only men. 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.500
 But in such a place like a ramen museum it is quite normal to go.
