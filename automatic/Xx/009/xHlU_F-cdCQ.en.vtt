00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 if you have a menu completely new so from 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.799
 then want to create ground on yourself 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.599
 There are two options either they 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.280
 take an existing menu that you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.519
 already have or have adapted 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.460
 and just change all elements or 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.220
 you choose from the creative building blocks 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.430
 under disc menus there is an empty one 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 project I'm looking for this once 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.310
 empty main menu so it is completely empty 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.380
 it does not have 23 lines of text though 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.870
 simply adapt this goal 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.190
 and i see this menu once on mine 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.110
 existing to exchange this 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.850
 I click on this menu and open 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 and the disci tor 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.260
 and they see more or less 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 this menu lee there is simply one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.660
 textline here a second slightly smaller 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 and then two links film 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.160
 play or s10 selection 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.109
 if they do not like that too then 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.480
 You can also use these elements very much 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.480
 simply because blot out of this editor 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.080
 with the lead or remove button 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 and I still have these two 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 then I might text elements 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.760
 but I want to start now 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.840
 just to add a background or 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.310
 I can start linking 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.920
 text elements or so-called 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.350
 miniature buttons and so on 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.799
 to add a completely new 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.780
 build project 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.259
 whether you start with the background 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.759
 or start adding text elements 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.009
 is actually up to you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.009
 I'm looking once from my photos 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.049
 suitable background still needs the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.439
 delete search so that everything is beautiful 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.850
 is displayed once a picture that 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.860
 would be suitable 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.480
 as a background I'll take something like that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.910
 and drag the in this Handel and falls 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.130
 this is a graphic at the same time 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.770
 a lot of sky can be seen in this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.170
 I will then sky my elements 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.300
 Arrange and add if you have one 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.310
 I want to add the title 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.160
 just stopped here then can 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.260
 then do that via this symbol apc then 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.080
 is added a so-called text 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.510
 you will see them in the middle of this one 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.580
 menus and can do this easily with the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.220
 mouse here at the edge with these four arrow 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.170
 place symbol and then they go 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:35.120
 just enter a text via the keyboard 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 for example, discman another 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.280
 text line you can also turn 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.500
 about this abc add as for example 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.820
 I then subtitle for example 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.270
 something and let the main text place and 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.660
 maybe something else from the text size 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.660
 reduce that way
