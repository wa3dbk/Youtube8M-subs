00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
video for black ops because I don't know

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.639 
video for black ops because I don't know
I<00:00:59.910> used<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.090> good<00:01:01.210> at<00:01:01.270> black<00:01:01.540> ops<00:01:01.810> nuketown

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
I used to be good at black ops nuketown

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.280 
I used to be good at black ops nuketown
specifically<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.550> then<00:01:03.640> all<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:03.790> a<00:01:03.910> sudden

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
specifically and then all of a sudden

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.870 
specifically and then all of a sudden
I've<00:01:05.290> been<00:01:05.470> playing<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.920> recently<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.520> and

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
I've been playing it recently and and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.539 
I've been playing it recently and and
also<00:01:07.210> good<00:01:07.450> at<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.689> so<00:01:07.990> I<00:01:08.259> guess<00:01:09.100> being<00:01:09.369> on<00:01:09.520> a

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
also good at it so I guess being on a

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.260 
also good at it so I guess being on a
year<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:09.970> hiatus<00:01:10.180> of<00:01:10.720> playing<00:01:11.049> black<00:01:11.350> ops<00:01:11.530> has

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
year of hiatus of playing black ops has

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.230 
year of hiatus of playing black ops has
you<00:01:13.270> know<00:01:13.360> dwindled<00:01:13.899> my<00:01:14.079> power<00:01:14.409> of<00:01:14.859> the<00:01:15.399> game

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
you know dwindled my power of the game

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.959 
you know dwindled my power of the game
quite<00:01:16.899> significantly<00:01:17.649> if<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.009> will<00:01:18.159> but<00:01:18.819> you

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
quite significantly if you will but you

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.569 
quite significantly if you will but you
know<00:01:19.119> I<00:01:19.359> hope<00:01:19.569> to<00:01:19.899> gain<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.229> back<00:01:20.399> draft<00:01:21.399> of<00:01:21.549> my

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
know I hope to gain it back draft of my

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.219 
know I hope to gain it back draft of my
controllers<00:01:22.149> anyone<00:01:22.450> else<00:01:22.569> playing<00:01:22.869> it<00:01:23.109> it

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
controllers anyone else playing it it

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.489 
controllers anyone else playing it it
felt<00:01:23.530> like<00:01:23.649> it<00:01:23.799> was<00:01:23.889> a<00:01:23.920> little<00:01:24.130> too<00:01:24.280> slow<00:01:24.639> um

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
felt like it was a little too slow um

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.379 
felt like it was a little too slow um
but<00:01:26.499> you<00:01:26.709> know<00:01:26.740> that's<00:01:27.490> life<00:01:27.729> i<00:01:27.939> guess<00:01:28.119> alright

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
but you know that's life i guess alright

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.300 
but you know that's life i guess alright
so<00:01:28.929> after<00:01:29.049> all<00:01:29.319> probably<00:01:29.740> switch<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.100> up<00:01:30.159> a

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
so after all probably switch it up a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.520 
so after all probably switch it up a
little<00:01:30.429> next<00:01:30.759> time<00:01:30.939> this<00:01:31.899> is<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.079> my<00:01:32.259> first

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
little next time this is just my first

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.440 
little next time this is just my first
gameplay<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.310> when<00:01:33.729> I<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.240> like<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
gameplay so when I this is like the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.260 
gameplay so when I this is like the
first<00:01:34.630> time<00:01:34.780> playing<00:01:35.409> black<00:01:35.859> ops<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.909> past

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
first time playing black ops in the past

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.859 
first time playing black ops in the past
year<00:01:37.810> um<00:01:38.279> online<00:01:39.279> with<00:01:39.520> real<00:01:39.729> people<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.389> you

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
better and then all of a sudden the game

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.889
