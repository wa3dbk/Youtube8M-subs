16<00:02:51.430> activating<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.520> increases<00:02:52.880> your<00:02:52.910> speed<00:02:53.060> by

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
16 activating it increases your speed by

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.050 
16 activating it increases your speed by
fifty<00:02:53.360> percent<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.800> movement<00:02:55.640> speed<00:02:55.670> by<00:02:55.850> ten

fifty percent and movement speed by ten

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.160 
fifty percent and movement speed by ten
percent<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:56.450> your<00:02:56.600> attack<00:02:56.810> speed<00:02:57.020> by<00:02:57.110> fifty

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
percent so your attack speed by fifty

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.350 
percent so your attack speed by fifty
which<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.650> nice<00:02:57.800> because<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.240> this

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
which is nice because we have this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.420 
which is nice because we have this
ability<00:02:59.600> up<00:02:59.900> here<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.440> vampiric<00:03:00.800> assault<00:03:01.190> so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
ability up here the vampiric assault so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.100 
ability up here the vampiric assault so
you're<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.390> be<00:03:02.510> running<00:03:02.720> through

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.410 
you're going to be running through
minions<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.280> getting<00:03:04.730> lots<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.030> health<00:03:05.210> back
