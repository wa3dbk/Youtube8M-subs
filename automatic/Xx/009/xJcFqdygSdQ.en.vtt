and I like that so I'm going to try it
on<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.109> put<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.650> side<00:04:01.889> part<00:04:02.250> rain<00:04:02.459> because

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
on I put this side part rain because

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.099 
on I put this side part rain because
that's<00:04:03.000> how<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.150> really<00:04:03.419> want<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.629> wear<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.840> but
