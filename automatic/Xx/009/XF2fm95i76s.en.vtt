00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
so don't worry what might be similar to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.990 
so don't worry what might be similar to
me<00:02:49.640> may<00:02:49.850> not<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.150> very<00:02:50.270> similar<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.130> uh<00:02:52.130> and

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
a little awkward because I'm they're

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.290 
a little awkward because I'm they're
magnetized<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.590> that's<00:03:43.100> kind<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.520> nice<00:03:43.700> the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
magnetized so that's kind of nice the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.860 
magnetized so that's kind of nice the
palette<00:03:44.720> itself<00:03:44.810> or<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.530> container<00:03:46.660> feels<00:03:47.660> a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
palette itself or the container feels a

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.949 
palette itself or the container feels a
little<00:03:48.430> clumsy<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.790> cheap<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:50.420> that's<00:03:50.570> okay

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
little clumsy and cheap but that's okay

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.460 
little clumsy and cheap but that's okay
I'm<00:03:51.950> not<00:03:52.160> really<00:03:52.430> picky<00:03:52.790> about<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.270> um<00:03:53.660> but

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
I'm not really picky about that um but

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.890 
I'm not really picky about that um but
yeah<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:55.010> magnet<00:03:55.490> that<00:03:56.120> thing<00:03:56.420> is<00:03:56.660> that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
yeah it's the magnet that thing is that

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.750 
yeah it's the magnet that thing is that
when<00:03:57.080> they're<00:03:57.260> all<00:03:57.380> stacked<00:03:57.800> up<00:03:58.100> they<00:03:58.400> stick

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
when they're all stacked up they stick

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.330 
when they're all stacked up they stick
together<00:03:58.970> like<00:03:59.420> when<00:04:00.050> I<00:04:00.080> went<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.680> pull<00:04:01.220> this

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
together like when I went to pull this

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.670 
together like when I went to pull this
one<00:04:01.550> off<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:02.360> stick<00:04:02.690> together<00:04:02.840> but<00:04:03.380> this<00:04:03.530> one

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
one off this stick together but this one

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.180 
one off this stick together but this one
stuck<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.130> it<00:04:04.220> i<00:04:04.280> think<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:04.550> was<00:04:04.670> like<00:04:04.850> when

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
stuck to it i think it was like when

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.590 
stuck to it i think it was like when
muzzle<00:04:05.520> on<00:04:05.550> something<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.240> see<00:04:06.390> how<00:04:06.480> they

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
muzzle on something you see how they

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.860 
muzzle on something you see how they
stick<00:04:06.870> together<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:09.120> flung<00:04:09.540> one<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
stick together and I flung one in the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.440 
stick together and I flung one in the
floor<00:04:10.110> like<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.320> um<00:04:10.860> so<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:12.090> kind<00:04:12.390> of

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
floor like that um so that's kind of

wish that they had names maybe they are

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.130 
wish that they had names maybe they are
all<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.130> little<00:04:59.430> different<00:04:59.780> but<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:00.990> just

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
detail two watches of all these so the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.100 
detail two watches of all these so the
payoff<00:05:26.490> is<00:05:26.610> pretty<00:05:27.180> good<00:05:27.390> on<00:05:27.570> most<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:27.960> these

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
payoff is pretty good on most of these

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.040 
payoff is pretty good on most of these
it's<00:05:28.860> like<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:29.550> one<00:05:29.790> I<00:05:30.090> like<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.630> payoff<00:05:30.870> on

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
it's like this one I like the payoff on

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.600 
it's like this one I like the payoff on
this<00:05:31.080> this<00:05:31.560> is<00:05:31.710> really<00:05:31.950> really<00:05:32.190> great<00:05:32.370> but

than<00:05:32.760> that<00:05:32.940> maybe<00:05:33.750> he<00:05:33.900> doesn't<00:05:34.080> come<00:05:34.290> off<00:05:34.440> as

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
than that maybe he doesn't come off as

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.670 
than that maybe he doesn't come off as
dark<00:05:34.860> as<00:05:34.980> I'd<00:05:35.100> like<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.640> but<00:05:35.850> that's<00:05:35.970> okay

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680
