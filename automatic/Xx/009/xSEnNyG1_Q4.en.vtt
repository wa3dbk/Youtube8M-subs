00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
against the wall up at a height where

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.590 
against the wall up at a height where
you<00:01:48.430> can't<00:01:48.640> really<00:01:48.790> do<00:01:49.060> anything<00:01:49.330> in<00:01:49.570> the

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.039 
views and get the victory doesn't get
anything<00:03:20.069> he<00:03:20.370> dies<00:03:20.639> along<00:03:21.359> with<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.720> person

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
anything he dies along with the person

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.809 
anything he dies along with the person
that<00:03:22.079> he<00:03:22.260> killed<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.919> never<00:03:23.160> really<00:03:23.489> seen

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
that he killed I have never really seen

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.189 
that he killed I have never really seen
something<00:03:24.180> like<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.329> happened<00:03:24.810> before<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
something like this happened before and

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.409 
something like this happened before and
I've<00:03:25.260> never<00:03:25.440> even<00:03:26.099> imagined<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.209> zombie

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
I've never even imagined that a zombie

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.330 
I've never even imagined that a zombie
can<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:27.930> instant<00:03:28.349> explode<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.769> grenade<00:03:29.129> off

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
can just instant explode a grenade off

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.369 
can just instant explode a grenade off
of<00:03:29.519> swatting<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.269> guess<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.810> likeliness<00:03:31.139> is

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
of swatting it I guess the likeliness is

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.869 
of swatting it I guess the likeliness is
pretty<00:03:31.620> slim<00:03:31.949> of<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.190> zombie<00:03:32.459> actually<00:03:32.730> being

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
pretty slim of the zombie actually being

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.399 
pretty slim of the zombie actually being
able<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.120> hit<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.389> with<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.599> hands<00:03:33.959> off<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
able to hit it with the hands off of the

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.470 
able to hit it with the hands off of the
throw<00:03:34.709> but<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> pretty<00:03:35.699> insane<00:03:36.150> clip

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
throw but that is a pretty insane clip

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.330 
throw but that is a pretty insane clip

shorter<00:03:56.099> video<00:03:56.310> there<00:03:56.459> wasn't<00:03:56.699> as<00:03:56.760> many

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
shorter video there wasn't as many

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.449

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.259 
guess it cuts out some of the the fat
and<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.949> just<00:04:02.129> gets<00:04:02.340> straight<00:04:02.669> to<00:04:02.699> the<00:04:02.849> top<00:04:03.000> 5

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269
