even with all the costs that we knew of
going<00:01:13.579> into<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.939> I<00:01:14.090> don't<00:01:14.240> think<00:01:14.420> we<00:01:14.659> had<00:01:14.840> any

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
going into it I don't think we had any

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.230 
going into it I don't think we had any
idea<00:01:15.350> exactly<00:01:15.979> what<00:01:16.729> all<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:16.939> was<00:01:17.060> going<00:01:17.180> to

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
idea exactly what all it was going to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.350 
idea exactly what all it was going to
cost<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:17.990> were<00:01:18.140> our<00:01:18.439> initial<00:01:19.340> calculations<00:01:20.030> I

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
cost we were our initial calculations I

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.999 
cost we were our initial calculations I
think<00:01:21.290> would<00:01:21.409> have<00:01:21.470> been<00:01:21.619> way<00:01:21.799> off

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009
