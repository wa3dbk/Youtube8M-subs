conditions can get very difficult this
is<00:00:10.420> usually<00:00:10.809> when<00:00:11.290> it's<00:00:11.680> around<00:00:12.070> 32<00:00:12.460> degrees

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
in snowing and these conditions

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.620 
in snowing and these conditions
sometimes<00:00:15.250> there's<00:00:15.940> no<00:00:16.119> really<00:00:16.449> good

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
sometimes there's no really good

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.950 
sometimes there's no really good
solution<00:00:17.230> for<00:00:17.410> waxing<00:00:18.100> and<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:19.600> might<00:00:19.750> end<00:00:19.900> up

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
solution for waxing and you might end up

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.050 
solution for waxing and you might end up
using<00:00:20.110> no<00:00:20.350> like<00:00:20.529> skis<00:00:20.920> or<00:00:21.250> a<00:00:21.310> chemical<00:00:21.640> basis

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
using no like skis or a chemical basis

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.620 
using no like skis or a chemical basis
as<00:00:22.179> a<00:00:22.210> rubber<00:00:22.390> base<00:00:22.570> or<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.949> we<00:00:24.039> call<00:00:24.189> Harry's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
as a rubber base or what we call Harry's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.200 
as a rubber base or what we call Harry's
Harry's<00:00:25.630> is<00:00:25.869> when<00:00:26.679> you<00:00:26.769> use<00:00:26.919> sandpaper<00:00:27.490> and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
Harry's is when you use sandpaper and

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.640 
Harry's is when you use sandpaper and
you<00:00:28.269> roughing<00:00:28.720> up<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.960> middle<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.470> kick

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
you roughing up the middle of the kick

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.090 
you roughing up the middle of the kick
zone<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:31.079> and<00:00:32.079> then<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.619> treat<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:32.980> with

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
zone and and then you treat it with

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.330 
zone and and then you treat it with
something<00:00:33.640> like<00:00:33.760> helix<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.620> can<00:00:35.800> be<00:00:35.920> really

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
something like helix it can be really

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.150 
something like helix it can be really
really<00:00:36.610> effective<00:00:37.079> work<00:00:38.079> quite<00:00:38.289> well<00:00:38.469> as<00:00:38.649> and

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
really effective work quite well as and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160 
really effective work quite well as and
be<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.430> best<00:00:39.579> solution<00:00:40.000> for<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.180> day<00:00:40.329> so<00:00:41.050> let

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
be the best solution for the day so let

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.299 
be the best solution for the day so let
me<00:00:41.230> show<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.500> little<00:00:41.770> bit<00:00:41.860> about<00:00:41.920> how<00:00:42.100> to

me show you a little bit about how to
apply<00:00:42.640> Harry's<00:00:43.090> one<00:00:43.780> key<00:00:43.989> point<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.469> so<00:00:44.620> there

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
apply Harry's one key point is so there

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.770 
apply Harry's one key point is so there
Harry<00:00:45.399> applying<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.030> kind<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.270> a<00:00:46.359> science

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
which I've had great success with over

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.970 
which I've had great success with over
the<00:00:59.260> years<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:02.140> you're<00:01:02.289> making<00:01:02.440> Harry's<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
the years when you're making Harry's the

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.140 
the years when you're making Harry's the
first<00:01:03.219> thing<00:01:03.399> you<00:01:03.489> need<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.609> do<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:03.910> make<00:01:04.120> sure

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
first thing you need to do is make sure

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.820 
first thing you need to do is make sure
that<00:01:04.300> your<00:01:04.540> kick<00:01:04.809> wax<00:01:04.960> no<00:01:05.230> one<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.410> completely

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
that your kick wax no one is completely

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.400 
that your kick wax no one is completely
clean<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.420> should<00:01:07.600> also<00:01:07.810> have<00:01:07.930> your<00:01:08.140> glide

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
clean you should also have your glide

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.650 
clean you should also have your glide
wax<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:09.250> erase<00:01:09.490> wax<00:01:09.760> for<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.030> day<00:01:10.150> completely

finished when you're doing Harry's you

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.660 
finished when you're doing Harry's you
can<00:01:15.130> use<00:01:15.630> sandpaper<00:01:16.630> anywhere<00:01:17.470> from<00:01:17.680> 50<00:01:18.490> grit

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
can use sandpaper anywhere from 50 grit

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.630 
can use sandpaper anywhere from 50 grit
to<00:01:19.090> 100<00:01:19.420> grit<00:01:19.890> sometimes<00:01:20.890> people<00:01:21.190> use<00:01:21.340> a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
to 100 grit sometimes people use a

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280 
to 100 grit sometimes people use a
coarser<00:01:22.030> grit<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.450> middle<00:01:22.720> where<00:01:23.170> it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
coarser grit in the middle where it's

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.660 
coarser grit in the middle where it's
more<00:01:23.410> difficult<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.830> have<00:01:23.980> contact<00:01:24.460> with<00:01:24.580> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
more difficult to have contact with the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.600 
more difficult to have contact with the
snow<00:01:25.590> simply<00:01:26.590> take<00:01:26.770> your<00:01:26.800> sandpaper<00:01:27.340> on<00:01:27.490> a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
snow simply take your sandpaper on a

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.600 
snow simply take your sandpaper on a
block<00:01:27.910> so<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.510> stays<00:01:28.860> flat<00:01:29.860> on<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.100> base<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
block so it stays flat on the base and

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.950 
block so it stays flat on the base and
what<00:01:33.730> I<00:01:33.760> like<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.060> do<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.480> go<00:01:34.600> straight<00:01:34.900> up

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
what I like to do is to go straight up

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.620 
what I like to do is to go straight up
and<00:01:35.200> down<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> lot<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.450> pressure<00:01:39.630> I've

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
and down with a lot of pressure I've

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.150 
and down with a lot of pressure I've
been<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.870> past<00:01:41.020> I've<00:01:41.290> used<00:01:41.320> circles<00:01:41.920> I've

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
been the past I've used circles I've

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.700 
been the past I've used circles I've
used<00:01:42.400> sideways<00:01:42.940> marks<00:01:43.840> I've<00:01:44.050> used<00:01:44.290> angled

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
used sideways marks I've used angled

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.410 
used sideways marks I've used angled
marks<00:01:45.010> but<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:45.610> think<00:01:45.820> going<00:01:45.910> straight<00:01:46.210> up<00:01:46.300> and

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
marks but I think going straight up and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.540 
marks but I think going straight up and
down<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.930> most<00:01:47.080> common<00:01:47.710> application

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
down is the most common application

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.300 
down is the most common application
method<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:49.840> definitely<00:01:50.200> effective

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
take some helix spray it on there enough

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.890 
take some helix spray it on there enough
to<00:02:13.989> make<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.230> wet<00:02:15.420> there's<00:02:16.420> what<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.660> helix

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
to make it wet there's what the helix

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900 
to make it wet there's what the helix
looks<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:17.260> after<00:02:18.040> one<00:02:18.310> minute<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.610> drying

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
looks like after one minute of drying

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.720 
looks like after one minute of drying
time<00:02:19.030> I've<00:02:19.750> mooing<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.170> little<00:02:20.349> bit<00:02:20.440> as<00:02:20.530> well

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
time I've mooing a little bit as well

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.580 
time I've mooing a little bit as well
what<00:02:21.730> I'd<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:21.879> to<00:02:21.940> do<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.330> stick<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.440> a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
what I'd like to do is stick in a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.039 
what I'd like to do is stick in a
fluorocarbon<00:02:24.250> dedicated<00:02:25.090> nylon<00:02:25.599> polishing

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
fluorocarbon dedicated nylon polishing

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.860 
fluorocarbon dedicated nylon polishing
brush<00:02:26.280> then<00:02:27.280> lightly<00:02:28.030> just<00:02:28.209> rough<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.630> up<00:02:28.720> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
brush then lightly just rough it up a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.170 
brush then lightly just rough it up a
little<00:02:28.959> bit<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.530> powdery<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.790> helix<00:02:31.060> is

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
little bit so it's powdery the helix is

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.680 
little bit so it's powdery the helix is
also<00:02:31.480> very<00:02:31.720> well<00:02:31.810> affixed<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:34.239> Harries

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
also very well affixed to the Harries

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.420 
also very well affixed to the Harries
and<00:02:35.200> then<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.410> take<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.739> sandpaper<00:02:35.980> I'll<00:02:36.340> do

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
and then I take the sandpaper I'll do

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.520 
and then I take the sandpaper I'll do
the<00:02:36.519> same<00:02:36.730> thing<00:02:36.790> again<00:02:37.079> right<00:02:38.079> through<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the same thing again right through the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:49.880 
the same thing again right through the
helix<00:02:39.870> what<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.049> does<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:47.140> give<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.650> sharp

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
helix what this does is give you sharp

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.089 
helix what this does is give you sharp
strong<00:02:50.970> hairs<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.540> kick<00:02:52.750> off<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.950> also

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
strong hairs to kick off of but it also

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.670 
strong hairs to kick off of but it also
needs<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.700> hydrophobic<00:02:55.180> if<00:02:56.139> you<00:02:56.319> don't<00:02:56.530> do

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
needs it to hydrophobic if you don't do

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.920 
needs it to hydrophobic if you don't do
this<00:02:56.829> step<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:57.730> helix<00:02:58.060> might<00:02:58.239> clog<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:58.750> your

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
this step then helix might clog up your

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.690 
this step then helix might clog up your
hairs<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.470> little<00:02:59.500> bit<00:02:59.799> you'll<00:03:00.040> get<00:03:00.220> worse<00:03:00.400> kick

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
hairs a little bit you'll get worse kick

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.330 
hairs a little bit you'll get worse kick
so<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:02.859> is<00:03:03.010> still<00:03:03.190> very<00:03:03.250> hydrophobic<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:05.340> at

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
so this is still very hydrophobic and at

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.489 
so this is still very hydrophobic and at
this<00:03:06.519> point<00:03:07.200> we're<00:03:08.200> done<00:03:08.470> not<00:03:08.680> going<00:03:08.950> ski<00:03:09.340> on
