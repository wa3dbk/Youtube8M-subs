route<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.880> players<00:02:31.180> capable<00:02:31.480> players

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
route it to the players capable players

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
for example back drive video you can see

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.060 
for example back drive video you can see
there<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.300> red<00:02:34.570> X<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.990> audio<00:02:35.410> device<00:02:35.680> because

there is a red X on audio device because

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.920 
there is a red X on audio device because

I'll<00:04:27.760> get<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.180> my<00:04:28.360> picture<00:04:28.810> back<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.500> reason

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
I'll get that my picture back the reason

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.160 
I'll get that my picture back the reason
is<00:04:29.920> because<00:04:29.950> it's<00:04:30.430> all<00:04:30.640> stored<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.930> sheet

is because it's all stored on the sheet

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.320 
is because it's all stored on the sheet

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
rational computer becomes wake-on-lan

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.110 
rational computer becomes wake-on-lan
command<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.380> you<00:04:50.470> can<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.550> index<00:04:51.910> and

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
command so you can have the index and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.850 
command so you can have the index and
wake<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.480> appropriate<00:04:52.960> disk<00:04:53.230> when<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.590> need

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
wake the appropriate disk when you need

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.970 
wake the appropriate disk when you need
it<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:55.150> will<00:04:55.360> incur<00:04:56.020> some<00:04:56.290> delay<00:04:56.560> until<00:04:56.710> the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
it it will incur some delay until the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.680 
it it will incur some delay until the
computer<00:04:57.490> wakes<00:04:57.730> up<00:04:58.000> but<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.270> can<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.660> course

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
computer wakes up but you can of course

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.890 
computer wakes up but you can of course
become<00:04:59.260> green<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.070> there<00:05:00.280> are<00:05:00.630> now<00:05:01.630> what

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
become green and so there are now what

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.020 
become green and so there are now what
is<00:05:02.080> now<00:05:02.560> let's<00:05:02.830> little<00:05:03.160> bit<00:05:03.310> about<00:05:03.550> Marvel

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
is now let's little bit about Marvel

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.500 
is now let's little bit about Marvel
cincy<00:05:04.600> they<00:05:04.750> are<00:05:04.840> hosting<00:05:05.290> us<00:05:05.850> ok<00:05:06.850> so<00:05:06.910> far<00:05:07.270> any

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
cincy they are hosting us ok so far any

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.730 
cincy they are hosting us ok so far any
questions<00:05:07.960> nope

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
questions nope

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.020 
questions nope
so<00:05:11.650> Marvel<00:05:12.650> basically<00:05:13.460> came<00:05:13.580> up<00:05:13.729> with<00:05:13.910> this

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
so Marvel basically came up with this

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.839 
so Marvel basically came up with this
concept<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:14.690> is<00:05:14.870> single<00:05:15.259> chip<00:05:15.530> computer<00:05:16.130> it

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
concept this is single chip computer it

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.659 
concept this is single chip computer it
has<00:05:16.910> i<00:05:17.419> think<00:05:18.139> i've<00:05:18.710> been<00:05:18.889> gigabyte<00:05:19.280> of<00:05:19.490> memory

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
has i think i've been gigabyte of memory

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.629 
has i think i've been gigabyte of memory
and<00:05:20.240> storage<00:05:20.389> and<00:05:21.380> what<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:21.800> is<00:05:21.979> if<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:22.490> is

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
and storage and what it is if it is

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.219 
and storage and what it is if it is
they'll<00:05:23.060> stay<00:05:23.330> with<00:05:23.539> single<00:05:23.870> application

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
they'll stay with single application

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.159 
they'll stay with single application
computing<00:05:24.830> it's<00:05:24.979> a<00:05:25.130> it's<00:05:25.490> implying<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.930> buy

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
computing it's a it's implying you buy

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.740 
computing it's a it's implying you buy
something<00:05:27.530> software<00:05:28.160> hardware<00:05:28.340> package<00:05:28.819> in

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
something software hardware package in

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.120 
something software hardware package in
the<00:05:29.900> store<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:30.259> plug<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.650> in<00:05:30.770> it<00:05:30.919> does

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
the store you plug it in it does

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.460 
the store you plug it in it does
something<00:05:31.580> but<00:05:31.940> only<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.449> unlike<00:05:32.930> computer

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
something but only that unlike computer

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.379 
something but only that unlike computer
which<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:33.919> know<00:05:34.099> you<00:05:34.610> upload<00:05:35.090> something

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
which you know you upload something

which you know you upload something
Microsoft<00:05:36.229> changes<00:05:36.620> something<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.699> so<00:05:37.940> it's

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
Microsoft changes something and so it's

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.510 
Microsoft changes something and so it's
like<00:05:38.690> something<00:05:39.410> something<00:05:39.770> suddenly

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
like something something suddenly

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.140 
like something something suddenly
something<00:05:40.940> that<00:05:41.180> worked<00:05:41.509> stops<00:05:42.699> okay<00:05:43.699> and<00:05:43.940> you

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
something that worked stops okay and you

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.879 
something that worked stops okay and you
all<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.690> time<00:05:44.930> have<00:05:45.199> to<00:05:45.349> maintain<00:05:45.500> your

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
all the time have to maintain your

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.059 
all the time have to maintain your
computer<00:05:46.460> okay<00:05:47.360> amount<00:05:47.630> of<00:05:47.870> time<00:05:48.110> that<00:05:48.470> you

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
computer okay amount of time that you

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.879 
computer okay amount of time that you
invest<00:05:49.490> if<00:05:50.419> you<00:05:50.569> count<00:05:50.930> how<00:05:51.199> much<00:05:51.380> it<00:05:51.590> costs

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
invest if you count how much it costs

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.740 
invest if you count how much it costs
you<00:05:53.380> okay<00:05:54.380> so<00:05:54.830> this<00:05:55.250> is<00:05:55.490> basically<00:05:55.750> single

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
you okay so this is basically single

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.839 
you okay so this is basically single
applications<00:05:57.380> very<00:05:57.800> low<00:05:58.759> power<00:05:59.740> and<00:06:00.740> it's<00:06:01.610> as

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
applications very low power and it's as

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.520 
applications very low power and it's as
you<00:06:01.970> can<00:06:02.150> see<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.419> just<00:06:02.780> plugs<00:06:02.960> in<00:06:03.169> and<00:06:03.199> does

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
you can see it just plugs in and does

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.100 
you can see it just plugs in and does
something

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
something

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.100
