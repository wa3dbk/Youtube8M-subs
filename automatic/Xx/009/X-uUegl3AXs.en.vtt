 called di alga the nightmare of time 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.100
 I created my pasta was the idea of ​​a knot 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.950
 change a video stream that was that thing 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.830
 I do not think it was a pokémon or if 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.620

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.170
 pokémon has done this this is a 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.970
 total trauma the last thing I remember 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.980
 have seen before they brought me to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.620
 this mental hospital was a shadow 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.560
 giant at the foot of my bed telling me 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.380
 slowly the time will stop and you 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 soul will be mine I could not stand to hear that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.510
 I felt that time really stopped 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.180
 it was as if as if that game will charge 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.040
 life 'll tell you why I spent 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.769
 this and why the hell am I in this 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.050
 mental hospital everything started one afternoon 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.030
 it was Friday I left school and I 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.980
 I was heading to my house thinking about playing 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.230
 game that my parents took care of for 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.080
 I was nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.750
 pokémon diamond for nintendo ds I know 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.850
 that is a somewhat old game but that 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.190
 I loved the game because the pokemon 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.769
 the cover was algae and it was my pokemon 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.019
 favorite since I always had it in my 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.030
 emulator for my pc but I wanted it to 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.640
 be able to exchange pokemon with all the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.459
 world I came back to my house and there was a 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.130
 letter from my mother that said darling we 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.170
 We went on a trip, I 'm sorry I did not tell you 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.109
 stay alone with your brother 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.359
 I hope you do not bother and there's your 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.170
 game financed by you as you say 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.090
 have fun with bad love me 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.280
 I was surprised to stay alone 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.230
 well, I would not just stay with my 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.410
 brother but how do I know he is going with his 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.670
 girlfriend I would practically be left alone 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.160
 he was used to it was not weird in the end 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.320
 I turned on my console and put the game was 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.620
 great to see the intro in my console ds 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.450
 but there was something strange the screen of 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.700
 home just said pokemon and silhouette 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.579
 dial was completely black and 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.620
 I remember it was dark blue but it was not 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.650
 I gave it a lot of importance because it was a 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.080
 jack or something like that but finally I started 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.240
 play the game was in 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.030
 heart out of the team base 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.880
 galaxy the team that I had was a star 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.580
 actor a job a self float a gastro 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.440
 Done an acrobat and a rose reid when 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.299
 I had already arrived with him 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.180
 have defeated several members of the 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.760
 galaxy team the me told me you are the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.490
 only person who can stop this you 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.440
 you are the only one who can stop this in 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.360
 that was heard the cry of dialogue and the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.180
 screen turned black as by three 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.140
 minutes I said what the hell is wrong with this 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.210
 what the fuck they scammed me fuck when 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.580
 the screen became normal was in the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.890
 column launches but there was something odd 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.530
 shredded galaxy team members 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.570
 from his limbs my rival was there 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.200
 pulled and came out a text box 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.650
 saying hehe and that pokemon is too much 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.800
 strong you do not give up you are strong I know 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.840
 they're a devil made me like this 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.790
 that you should not die as I will already 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.390
 that damn pokemon devoured me 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.030
 legs and only points left in that I 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.160
 approach where I was daily I stayed 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.800
 surprised to see the spirit 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.140
 it was a day black seaweed with its red eyes 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.230
 and where you see your diamond sphere looks 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.240
 green as with a kind of red eye 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.940
 I did not give importance to it because I thought that 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.670
 they had hacked but the question is how 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.060
 but finally he began the battle against 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.100
 dial ga the spirit was terrifying in its 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.680
 face had blood and apparently had the 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.690
 head of him I was black and the dya more 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.400
 outside it was green and the eyes I had on 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.860
 I felt like they were looking at me 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.530
 background of my being the scream was heard 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.600
 distorted I sent first to the lion 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.970
 and the dial caused an attack that never 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.110
 I had seen it was called temporary abyss 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.240
 what the hell temporary abyss that attack 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.340
 does not exist and that he had played the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.200
 Pokémon games black and white 2i no 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.260
 there is pokemon that has learned it or 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.630
 finally there was only one that came out 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.610
 black hole as if gap was used 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.890
 black but you could see some hands that 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.050
 they absorbed my lion ampo were listening 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.300
 the screams of me on pole on and then it 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.130
 he saw his soul leave his body and go 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.400
 in the target sphere as if it were a giga 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.280
 drained and a text box said time 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.210
 dead lion 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.850
 what the hell died like I did not give 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.710
 importance and so it was with all 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.750
 pokemon of my team until only 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.240
 I saw my spirit the funny thing was that 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.030
 had my original name giovanni and 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.160
 said Giovanni used blow and it was seen that 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.919
 hit him with what he could and the 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.900
 dialogue used the same attack my spirit 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.700
 it was seen that he cut his head and looked 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.250
 blood on the screen 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.820
 the battle ended and a human said 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.100
 trying to challenge me I do not believe your human 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.919
 that is behind this device where I've 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.740
 been trapped for many years you'll see 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.050
 that soon I will go for you in that I launched my ds 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.470
 Through the window I thought I was safe 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.900
 I lay on my bed but I felt something 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.790
 in my house I felt a great cold and 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.000
 I felt how I felt more and more 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.070
 heavy the air was almost intolerable no 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.560
 I could breathe and I saw through the window and 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.419
 was in the shadow of daily scream with 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.910
 all the strength he had for terror 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:22.669
 in that my brother arrived that shadow 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.620
 disappeared he was in fetal position and 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.230
 crying and screaming that pokemon is coming 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.080
 for me 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.460
 for my sake because of my brother called my 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.730
 my parents and they took me to the hospital 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.710
 mentally and well now I'm here and not
