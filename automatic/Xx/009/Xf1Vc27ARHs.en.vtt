half<00:01:15.920> bent<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.250> half<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.689> show<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
half bent in half so if you can show you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
half bent in half so if you can show you
this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.549> bent<00:01:24.020> completely<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.140> half<00:01:25.409> it's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
this is it bent completely in half it's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.510 
this is it bent completely in half it's
it's<00:01:26.549> still<00:01:26.790> pretty<00:01:27.030> long<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.829> at<00:01:28.829> least<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it's still pretty long but at least it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.170 
it's still pretty long but at least it
gives<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> layered<00:01:30.450> look<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:31.579> opposed<00:01:32.579> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
gives it a layered look as opposed to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
gives it a layered look as opposed to
the<00:01:34.020> middle<00:01:34.439> where<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.299> even<00:01:36.299> longer<00:01:37.189> like

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the middle where it's even longer like

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.170 
the middle where it's even longer like
so<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.020> shorter<00:01:40.020> towards<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> top<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
so so it's shorter towards the top and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.520 
so so it's shorter towards the top and
then<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> gradually<00:01:43.439> gets<00:01:44.040> longer<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:46.189> yeah<00:01:47.189> um

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
then it gradually gets longer as yeah um

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.859 
then it gradually gets longer as yeah um
