teaching mathematics of data management
or<00:00:05.759> probability<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.779> statistics<00:00:07.280> this<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
or probability and statistics this is a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.370 
or probability and statistics this is a
problem<00:00:08.940> from<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.360> students<00:00:09.780> homework<00:00:09.990> where

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
problem from the students homework where

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.470 
problem from the students homework where
they<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> sample<00:00:11.370> from<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.700> normally

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
they have a sample from a normally

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780 
they have a sample from a normally
distributed<00:00:12.630> variable<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.490> want<00:00:14.670> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
distributed variable and we want to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.609 
distributed variable and we want to
calculate<00:00:15.020> probabilities<00:00:16.020> based<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
calculate probabilities based on the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.609 
calculate probabilities based on the
sample<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.660> would<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.170> enter<00:00:19.500> this

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
sample so they would have to enter this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.220 
sample so they would have to enter this
into<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> calculator<00:00:20.100> or<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.029> iPad<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.020> one

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
into the calculator or the iPad so one

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800 
into the calculator or the iPad so one
thing<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.529> might<00:00:22.710> ask<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.310> well<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.510> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
thing I might ask them is well is that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.230 
thing I might ask them is well is that
sample<00:00:25.289> actually<00:00:25.800> normally<00:00:26.460> distributed<00:00:26.640> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
sample actually normally distributed I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
sample actually normally distributed I
mean<00:00:27.539> some<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.859> should<00:00:29.070> check<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
mean some what we should check that I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 
mean some what we should check that I
wonder<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> histogram<00:00:30.779> looks<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.260> or<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
wonder what a histogram looks like or a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.670 
wonder what a histogram looks like or a
box<00:00:31.890> plot<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.899> them<00:00:34.140> enter<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
box plot so I would have them enter that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.340 
box plot so I would have them enter that
into<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.880> particular<00:00:36.329> app<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
into the particular app that I like to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.729 
into the particular app that I like to
use<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.640> course<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.960> app<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.379> we'll

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
use for for my course the app that we'll

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.030 
use for for my course the app that we'll
be<00:00:40.860> using<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.309> statistics<00:00:42.030> visualizer<00:00:43.040> right

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
be using a statistics visualizer right

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.139 
be using a statistics visualizer right
here<00:00:45.559> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.800> free<00:00:47.190> app<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> does<00:00:47.910> have

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
here this is a free app but it does have

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
here this is a free app but it does have
a<00:00:48.570> pay<00:00:48.809> extension<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.800> extra<00:00:50.160> features<00:00:51.620> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
a pay extension for extra features so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470 
a pay extension for extra features so
what<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.270> them

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
what I have them do is I would have them

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.700 
what I have them do is I would have them
enter<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.410> their<00:00:55.710> data<00:00:55.980> into<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.940> app<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> all

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
enter all their data into the app so all

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.160 
enter all their data into the app so all
30<00:00:59.039> values<00:00:59.550> they<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> same

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
30 values they would have to do the same

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.810 
30 values they would have to do the same
in<00:01:01.320> their<00:01:01.440> calculator<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.160> well<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.609> they<00:01:02.760> were

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
in their calculator as well if they were

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
in their calculator as well if they were
using<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> calculator<00:01:03.480> instead<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.680> pop<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
using a calculator instead but I pop it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.530 
using a calculator instead but I pop it
I<00:01:06.090> pad<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> better<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.850> what<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.360> we

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I pad is better and what we can do we

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.179 
I pad is better and what we can do we
can<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.810> various<00:01:10.140> things<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.860> sample

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
can do various things with this sample

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.760 
can do various things with this sample
so<00:01:11.580> I've<00:01:12.030> selected<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.810> variable<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
so I've selected the variable here and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.940 
so I've selected the variable here and
then<00:01:14.670> I'll<00:01:14.790> press<00:01:14.970> GO<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:16.259> asks<00:01:16.530> me<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
then I'll press GO it asks me what do I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.969 
then I'll press GO it asks me what do I
want<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.150> sample<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.619> might

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
want to do with this sample so I might

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.760 
want to do with this sample so I might
ask<00:01:20.130> students<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.540> sample<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.229> normally

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
ask students if the sample is normally

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
ask students if the sample is normally
distributed<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.610> should<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.240> sort<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
distributed it should have sort of a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
distributed it should have sort of a
bell<00:01:25.020> curve<00:01:25.290> shape<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:26.250> won't<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.549> perfect

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
bell curve shape it won't be perfect

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
bell curve shape it won't be perfect
because<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.020> sample<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.500> 30<00:01:28.710> values

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
because it's just a sample of 30 values

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.460 
because it's just a sample of 30 values
but<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> should<00:01:29.700> look<00:01:29.909> somewhat<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> bell

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
but it should look somewhat like a bell

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.600 
but it should look somewhat like a bell
curve<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> look<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> histogram

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
curve so we have a look at the histogram

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.080 
curve so we have a look at the histogram
and<00:01:36.439> it<00:01:37.439> does<00:01:37.619> seem<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:37.890> sort<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.939> bell

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and it does seem like sort of a bell

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210 
and it does seem like sort of a bell
curve<00:01:39.329> shape<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.130> can

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
curve shape and what we can do we can

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.330 
curve shape and what we can do we can
play<00:01:41.549> along<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.200> change<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.500> interval

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
play along with change the interval

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
play along with change the interval
widths<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.869> how<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.110> affects<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
widths and see how that affects the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
widths and see how that affects the
graph<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.670> point<00:01:48.570> from<00:01:48.689> earlier<00:01:49.079> in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
graph it's just a point from earlier in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780 
graph it's just a point from earlier in
the<00:01:49.320> semester<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.220> choice<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the semester that the choice of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.670 
the semester that the choice of
intervals<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.509> affect<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> appearance<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
intervals can affect the appearance of a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.370 
intervals can affect the appearance of a
graph<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:54.329> seem<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.960> normally

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
graph so it does seem like it's normally

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
graph so it does seem like it's normally
distributed<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.729> based<00:01:57.210> on

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
what is a box plot look like for a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.819 
what is a box plot look like for a
normally<00:02:05.490> distributed<00:02:05.670> sample<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.649> can

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
normally distributed sample so they can

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.440 
normally distributed sample so they can
also<00:02:08.009> click<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.429> go<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:10.020> they<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.009> choose

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
also click on go and they can choose

also click on go and they can choose
boxplot<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:13.720> called<00:02:14.110> quintile<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
boxplot here called quintile in the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.400 
boxplot here called quintile in the
program<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.600> find<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> quartiles

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
program but you can find the quartiles

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.120 
program but you can find the quartiles
and<00:02:17.800> put<00:02:18.250> them<00:02:18.430> into<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.730> box<00:02:18.970> plot<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.980> they

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
and put them into a box plot so they

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.380 
and put them into a box plot so they
would<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.460> how<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.330> interpret<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.050> graph

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
would know how to interpret that graph

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.840 
would know how to interpret that graph
so<00:02:25.740> might<00:02:26.740> ask<00:02:26.950> them<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.430> what<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.730> would

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
so might ask them is this what you would

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.910 
so might ask them is this what you would
expect<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.450> box<00:02:28.660> plot<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.080> look<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:29.470> if<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
expect the box plot to look like if the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.080 
expect the box plot to look like if the
variable<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.610> normally<00:02:31.090> distributed<00:02:33.090> so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
variable is normally distributed so

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.610 
variable is normally distributed so

what<00:03:25.030> we're<00:03:25.209> trying<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.540> calculate<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:26.650> was

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
what we're trying to calculate this was

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.340 
what we're trying to calculate this was
sixty<00:03:28.570> seven<00:03:28.990> point<00:03:29.320> three<00:03:29.590> seven<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:32.170> this

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
sixty seven point three seven and this

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.870 
sixty seven point three seven and this
was<00:03:32.620> 17<00:03:34.020> so<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.290> question<00:03:35.709> on<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.220> paper<00:03:36.490> says

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
was 17 so the question on the paper says

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.240 
was 17 so the question on the paper says
what<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.020> probability<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.740> typical

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
what is the probability a typical

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.010 
what is the probability a typical
shoppers<00:03:39.700> purchase<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.330> more<00:03:40.600> than<00:03:40.720> $60<00:03:41.730> so

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
shoppers purchase is more than $60 so

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:52.680 
shoppers purchase is more than $60 so
this<00:03:46.170> knife<00:03:47.170> found<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:48.070> a<00:03:48.220> sixty<00:03:50.430> okay

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
this knife found in a sixty okay

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.320 
this knife found in a sixty okay
so<00:03:53.400> when<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:54.550> press<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.910> done<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.940> will<00:03:58.090> find

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
so when we press it done it will find

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.740 
so when we press it done it will find
the<00:03:58.480> answer<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:58.840> us<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:01.060> they<00:04:01.390> need<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.600> know

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
the answer for us so they need to know

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.390 
the answer for us so they need to know
how<00:04:01.960> to<00:04:02.080> calculate<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.650> manually<00:04:03.100> but<00:04:03.220> it's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
how to calculate that manually but it's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.490 
how to calculate that manually but it's
a<00:04:03.520> way<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.820> looking<00:04:04.330> at<00:04:04.660> their<00:04:04.870> answer<00:04:05.260> and

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
a way of looking at their answer and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.030 
a way of looking at their answer and
shows<00:04:05.740> a<00:04:06.100> visual<00:04:06.820> display<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:08.560> their<00:04:08.680> answer

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
shows a visual display for their answer

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.980 
shows a visual display for their answer
this<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:09.940> area<00:04:10.450> we're<00:04:10.630> trying<00:04:10.870> to

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
this is the area we're trying to

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.500 
this is the area we're trying to
calculate<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.700> comparison<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.330> the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
calculate so in comparison to the

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.330 
calculate so in comparison to the
graphing<00:04:13.900> calculator<00:04:13.930> which<00:04:14.830> can<00:04:15.070> do<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
graphing calculator which can do the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.699 
graphing calculator which can do the
same<00:04:15.550> thing<00:04:15.880> but<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:16.870> not<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.200> color<00:04:17.440> it's

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
same thing but it's not in color it's

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.300 
same thing but it's not in color it's
not<00:04:17.920> a<00:04:17.950> big<00:04:18.250> screen<00:04:21.330> it's<00:04:22.330> not<00:04:22.570> as<00:04:22.720> quick<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:24.250> I

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
not a big screen it's not as quick so I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.980 
not a big screen it's not as quick so I
think<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.850> an<00:04:24.970> upgrade<00:04:25.330> on<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.600> graphing

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
think it's an upgrade on the graphing

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.500 
think it's an upgrade on the graphing
calculator<00:04:26.310> plus<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:27.550> more<00:04:27.850> useful<00:04:28.060> for

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
calculator plus it's more useful for

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.870 
calculator plus it's more useful for
other<00:04:28.960> courses<00:04:29.350> as<00:04:29.650> well<00:04:29.680> another<00:04:30.370> app<00:04:30.610> that

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
other courses as well another app that

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.090 
other courses as well another app that
we'll<00:04:31.060> be<00:04:31.150> using<00:04:31.300> in<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.600> course<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:32.170> called

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
we'll be using in the course is called

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.250 
we'll be using in the course is called
data<00:04:33.370> analysis<00:04:34.030> here<00:04:34.300> this<00:04:34.540> is<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.750> free<00:04:35.080> app

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
data analysis here this is a free app

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.550 
data analysis here this is a free app
there's<00:04:35.590> no<00:04:35.970> additional<00:04:36.970> cost<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.510> it<00:04:37.630> we've

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
there's no additional cost to it we've

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.080 
there's no additional cost to it we've
been<00:04:38.710> looking<00:04:39.010> for<00:04:39.040> an<00:04:39.520> app<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.910> does

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
been looking for an app that does

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.660 
been looking for an app that does
regression<00:04:41.220> nonlinear<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.400> linear

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
regression nonlinear and linear

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.750 
regression nonlinear and linear
regression<00:04:42.750> so<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.140> one<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.610> does<00:04:45.610> it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
regression so this is one that does it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.730 
regression so this is one that does it
pretty<00:04:45.970> well<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.860> it<00:04:47.950> looks<00:04:48.130> like<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.550> and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
pretty well so it looks like this and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.850 
pretty well so it looks like this and
click<00:04:50.740> on<00:04:51.270> these<00:04:52.270> are<00:04:52.540> some<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.990> data<00:04:53.470> sets

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
click on these are some of the data sets

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.620 
click on these are some of the data sets
that<00:04:54.010> have<00:04:54.160> been<00:04:54.250> answered<00:04:54.430> already<00:04:54.700> or<00:04:55.120> some

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
that have been answered already or some

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.060 
that have been answered already or some
that<00:04:55.810> I've<00:04:56.050> put<00:04:56.740> in<00:04:56.890> there<00:04:57.100> so<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:58.300> have<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:59.070> test

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
that I've put in there so I have a test

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.100 
that I've put in there so I have a test
set<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.430> values<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:00.940> I've<00:05:01.090> entered<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.870> one

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
set of values that I've entered this one

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.450 
set of values that I've entered this one
here<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:05.050> you<00:05:05.170> have<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.500> have<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:05.950> learn<00:05:06.100> some

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
here so you have to have to learn some

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.190 
here so you have to have to learn some
of<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.670> format<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.330> how<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.570> enter<00:05:07.840> in<00:05:08.169> values

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
of the format of how to enter in values

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.460 
of the format of how to enter in values
but<00:05:08.770> it's<00:05:08.919> really<00:05:09.690> not<00:05:10.690> too<00:05:10.870> much<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:11.230> remember

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
but it's really not too much to remember

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.430 
but it's really not too much to remember
just<00:05:11.830> for<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:13.000> accent<00:05:13.480> end<00:05:13.660> space<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.320> then

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
just for the accent end space and then

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.000 
just for the accent end space and then
the<00:05:14.620> Y<00:05:15.190> value<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:16.660> I've<00:05:16.840> entered<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.320> my<00:05:17.530> set<00:05:17.890> of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
the Y value so I've entered in my set of

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.060 
the Y value so I've entered in my set of
values<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.870> if<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.050> want<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.350> plot<00:05:20.620> them<00:05:20.860> in<00:05:20.950> a

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
values and if I want to plot them in a

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.340 
values and if I want to plot them in a
scatter<00:05:21.370> plot<00:05:22.110> down<00:05:23.110> here<00:05:23.500> plot<00:05:25.110> plots<00:05:26.110> the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
scatter plot down here plot plots the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.210 
scatter plot down here plot plots the
values<00:05:27.100> for<00:05:27.400> us<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:28.620> probably<00:05:29.620> we<00:05:29.830> want<00:05:30.070> to

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
values for us and probably we want to

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.670 
values for us and probably we want to
know<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.550> equation<00:05:30.910> of<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.419> line<00:05:31.630> and<00:05:31.990> the

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
know the equation of the line and the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.760 
know the equation of the line and the
how<00:05:33.130> well<00:05:33.340> does<00:05:33.490> it<00:05:33.550> fit<00:05:33.850> or<00:05:33.970> not<00:05:34.560> or<00:05:35.560> if<00:05:35.650> we

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
how well does it fit or not or if we

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.070 
how well does it fit or not or if we
want<00:05:35.950> to<00:05:36.040> try<00:05:36.250> different<00:05:36.810> types<00:05:37.810> of

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
want to try different types of

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.440 
want to try different types of
regression<00:05:38.590> we<00:05:38.740> can<00:05:38.919> do<00:05:39.040> that<00:05:39.250> so<00:05:40.060> if<00:05:40.180> we<00:05:40.240> press

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
regression we can do that so if we press

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.940 
regression we can do that so if we press
this<00:05:40.690> button<00:05:40.960> here<00:05:41.200> this<00:05:41.410> shows<00:05:41.680> us<00:05:41.919> the

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
this button here this shows us the

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.060 
this button here this shows us the
different<00:05:42.190> types<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:42.760> fits<00:05:43.030> that<00:05:43.150> we<00:05:43.360> can<00:05:43.540> do

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
different types of fits that we can do

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.070 
different types of fits that we can do
so<00:05:45.070> do<00:05:45.250> we<00:05:45.370> want<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.669> do<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:46.270> line<00:05:46.630> of<00:05:46.660> best<00:05:46.930> fit

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
so do we want to do a line of best fit

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.890 
so do we want to do a line of best fit
or<00:05:47.440> maybe<00:05:47.820> some<00:05:48.820> kind<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.210> curve<00:05:49.450> will<00:05:49.690> fit

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
or maybe some kind of curve will fit

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.490 
or maybe some kind of curve will fit
better<00:05:50.110> maybe<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:50.860> logarithm<00:05:52.169> so<00:05:53.169> we<00:05:53.320> can

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
better maybe a logarithm so we can

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.400 
better maybe a logarithm so we can
choose<00:05:53.790> what<00:05:54.790> kind<00:05:55.030> of<00:05:55.480> regression<00:05:55.900> we<00:05:56.169> want

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
choose what kind of regression we want

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.490 
choose what kind of regression we want
to<00:05:56.560> do<00:05:56.740> and<00:05:57.430> then<00:05:57.669> down<00:05:57.940> here<00:05:57.970> we're<00:05:58.390> told<00:05:58.660> the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
to do and then down here we're told the

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.429 
to do and then down here we're told the
slope<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.100> y-intercept<00:06:00.820> down<00:06:01.060> here

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.679 

and<00:06:04.159> more<00:06:04.339> also<00:06:04.489> calculate<00:06:05.269> R<00:06:05.929> squared<00:06:06.349> for<00:06:06.559> us
