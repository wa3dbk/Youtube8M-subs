00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
two points into that center line you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
two points into that center line you
just<00:00:25.439> created<00:00:33.980> when<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.160> part<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.489> done

just created when that part is done

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.780 
just created when that part is done
you're<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> fold<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.500> next<00:00:37.860> edge<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.399> to

flat edge up against the center line

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.080 
flat edge up against the center line
just<00:00:59.390> like<00:00:59.540> we<00:00:59.690> were<00:00:59.810> doing<00:01:00.080> previously

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
just like we were doing previously

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
you're going to fold the tip back so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.780 
you're going to fold the tip back so
that<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.430> top<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.150> matches<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.170> back

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
that the top of it matches that back

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.180 
that the top of it matches that back
fold<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.290> you<00:01:30.290> can<00:01:30.440> see<00:01:30.619> there<00:01:30.830> how<00:01:30.860> that

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
fold and you can see there how that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.950 
fold and you can see there how that
works

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
works

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.910 
works
so<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.050> can<00:01:33.200> wiggle<00:01:33.350> that<00:01:33.530> around<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.890> little

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
so you can wiggle that around a little

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.710 
so you can wiggle that around a little
til<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.340> lines<00:01:34.550> up<00:01:34.670> properly<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.100> set

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
til it lines up properly and that is set

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.190 
til it lines up properly and that is set
you<00:01:38.720> want<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:39.020> turn<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.380> over<00:01:40.750> fold<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.900> piece

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
you want to turn it over fold the piece

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.250 
you want to turn it over fold the piece
in<00:01:42.440> half<00:01:42.680> lengthwise<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.360> two<00:01:44.570> long<00:01:44.869> ends

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
in half lengthwise so the two long ends

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.400 
in half lengthwise so the two long ends
match<00:01:45.470> up

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.100 

now<00:01:52.460> turn<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> over<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.150> this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.870> head

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
now turn it over and this is the head

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.830 
now turn it over and this is the head
here<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.620> that<00:01:55.980> back<00:01:56.190> end<00:01:56.400> is<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> tail<00:01:56.940> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
here and that back end is the tail so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.570 
here and that back end is the tail so
we're<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.140> work<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.560> head<00:01:58.770> you're

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
we're going to work on the head you're

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.100 
we're going to work on the head you're
going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.760> take<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> hold<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.720> head<00:02:00.870> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
going to take a hold of the head and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
going to take a hold of the head and
give<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.500> pull<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.280> you'll<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
give it a pull up and you'll see that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.170 
give it a pull up and you'll see that
the<00:02:03.300> neck<00:02:04.140> area<00:02:04.380> folds<00:02:04.980> out<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.370> you<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the neck area folds out for you and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.790 
the neck area folds out for you and
you've<00:02:06.300> got<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> straight<00:02:06.900> up<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.200> down<00:02:07.260> give

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
you've got it straight up and down give

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.960 
you've got it straight up and down give
it<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> crease<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.670> stays<00:02:08.910> put<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:10.610> now<00:02:11.610> pull

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

out to straight chin again squish down
the<00:02:16.560> neck<00:02:16.770> area<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:18.030> once<00:02:18.209> you've<00:02:18.330> got<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.540> in

the position you like it looks straight

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.970 
the position you like it looks straight
now<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> nose<00:02:24.090> part<00:02:24.510> itself<00:02:24.950> we're<00:02:25.950> going

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
now on the nose part itself we're going

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.449 
now on the nose part itself we're going
to<00:02:26.250> give<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.670> fold<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.870> shorten<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.380> nose<00:02:28.590> so

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
to give it a fold to shorten the nose so

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.780 
to give it a fold to shorten the nose so
fold<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> nose<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.420> half<00:02:30.630> backwards<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.860> give

fold the nose in half backwards and give

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.110 
fold the nose in half backwards and give
it<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.970> crease<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.580> once<00:02:35.580> you've<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:35.910> that

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
creased nicely we're going to fold it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.440 
creased nicely we're going to fold it
under<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:40.080> fold<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.770> inside<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.239> nose

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
under so fold it inside so that the nose

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.770 
under so fold it inside so that the nose
is<00:02:42.660> shorter<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> duck<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
is shorter and there you have a duck it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.390 
is shorter and there you have a duck it
can<00:02:48.959> stand<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.830> fluff<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.340> a
