00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 City filter 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.759
 left a lot of time ago 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.830
 but no less advantageous 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.900
 grafon and so much so that FIG 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 I will sip the review only now when finally 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.219
 saved money for a video card which 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.500
 this grafon is present in the game 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.810
 a lot of all the techniques of golf cart with 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.070
 quick -fry potatoes and strikes ah 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.920
 same rival again airplanes with 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.880
 intuitive controls 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.530
 intuitive helicopter 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 management and all sorts of other tanks 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.890
 since the movie bottle has shot you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.760
 should get ready for what you 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.940
 will kill many very many phrases 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.020
 therefore the safest 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.309
 pastime here traditionally 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 are fun fun on the finger i 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.570
 but you can still have fun like this 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.399
 for example when recording this moment 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.920
 the whole room is splashed with joy 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.329
 process 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.329
 both guys are bravo 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.439
 run away with the commandant that is impossible 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.289
 However, if you are not like 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.789
 moments you won't have all your 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.070
 existence in this game will be 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.100
 come down to wanderings in the fields or 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.329
 lying in the bushes and you will inevitably come 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.750
 to fun entertainment based i damn 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.789
 my voice in the movie bottle where 3 out of 4 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.649
 a lot of class improvements for 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.409
 different types of each trunk 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.679
 flying robots or anti-tank mines 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.569
 but you have already heard it all or I will hear 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.179
 I want to mention such an important 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.250
 aspect as destructible 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.619
 in fairness, she does 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.470
 one day the whole aerial tower didnâ€™t fall 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.270
 Yes, I have seen the evidence and he will not 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.069
 still there are turnstiles 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.959
 they really don't work as expected but 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.610
 you know that because of the bourgeois there 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.380
 everything is flimsy just war there everything 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.170
 immediately breaks here and here we 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.239
 Moscow metro 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.329
 Well, the last of the shortcomings is the plot 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.980
 Russia is fighting the United States in fact it 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.329
 a vivid example of successful zombies 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 brains are philistines by world government 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.200
 with nut planning being global 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
 wars after issuing such a strategic 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.910
 secrets I got to get in a madhouse 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.100
 while I give you one piece of advice, wear hats 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.100
 foil only street
