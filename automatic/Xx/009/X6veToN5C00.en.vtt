 forehead for the most natural 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.969
 result will really be no countries 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.969

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.450
 drawn with the bronzer then draw i was 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.490
 turn a quarter turn 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 spoke neither the width in that dolphins 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.430
 I actually move the bots 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.140
 completely blending out 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.030
 that a very nice natural subtle 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 shadow on the street and last 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.810
 it brings us under my jaw 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.909
 cat mug app from the edge at minus or 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.979
 plus about my jaw book and the brings you 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.659
 on our not on the edge it looks to me 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.160
 with under times and the pointing side that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.720
 I did it completely and of course 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.289
 I will repeat the same steps 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289
 the link edge 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.270
 I always give a little bit of my 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.490
 nose started with a little bronzer 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.740
 with the brush very subtle along both 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.540
 sides of the nose and I am 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.190
 in form it can be used simply 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.360
 little bit on our smoke and on it 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.360
 tip of my nose 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.990
 and now we continue with the blush and the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.570
 I blush this is in use 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.280
 which is from brand names curt finch with that 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.870
 is really one of my favorite time 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.850
 also a little warmer shade so ideal for that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.650
 this time of year now for fall 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.450
 and I apply it with a special one 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.870
 guest after with the bloopers of real 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.459
 techniques 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.459
 ideal for teaching 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.470
 the plus at exactly and on and so you are 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.630
 actually just above the part where I am 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.190
 not the bronzer and with the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.989
 brush with very subtle in a dabbing 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.580
 apply movement plugs 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.620
 I don't immediately do this too much 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.269
 product that returns my cheeks and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.799
 I had always some on the force than 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.920
 he thinks precisely and on the apple of 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.920
 app 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.060
 and as the last step of this tutorial 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.129
 I show a highlighter always 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.840
 and in the net and favorite 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.909
 highlighter this moment and I the mac 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.870
 mineralize skin finish in the dye and 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.519
 gentle 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.920
 with a super nice shine I can do it now 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.299
 in the camera and I speak with 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.239
 namely a brush of real techniques 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:43.190
 the setting bridge as the first can do it 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.970
 highlighter on top of mine 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.680
 cheekbone 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.629
 so exactly above the part 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.010
 where I have now applied too quickly 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.790
 now it can be very subtle in a patting one 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.790
 movement 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.849
 after that I always connect the highlighter 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.230
 with my forehead so bring a small one 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.629
 bit on the temple of mine 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.129
 think forehead and decades in connection 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.139
 really not with the highlighter this just on 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.430
 my cheekbone applied and also on 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.680
 a little bit on my eyebrow bone 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.030
 this makes for a very nice yellow and 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.379
 everything that I have on the one hand is mine 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.590
 ease does of course also to the other 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.590
 side 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.630
 I always bring a little bit 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.350
 highlighter to exactly that my nose 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.090
 back and a little bit in the field 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:37.740
 from my upper lip that my lips advice 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:39.630
 to me and then this is it 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.100
 end result in a very subtle way 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.810
 way i have eaten 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.160
 and applied a little bit of blush and 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.660
 a little bit highlighter for one 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.340
 very nice natural shine 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.690
