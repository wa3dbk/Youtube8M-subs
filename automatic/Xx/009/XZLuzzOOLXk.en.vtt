many<00:00:59.550> other<00:00:59.640> months<00:01:00.120> those<00:01:00.780> jump<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.290> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
many other months those jump in it this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.140 
many other months those jump in it this
basically<00:01:01.890> during<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> time<00:01:02.610> when<00:01:02.820> Rome<00:01:03.120> was

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
basically during the time when Rome was

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.380 
basically during the time when Rome was
divided<00:01:03.720> up<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.220> facing<00:01:05.670> massive<00:01:05.880> threats

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
divided up it was facing massive threats

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
divided up it was facing massive threats
from<00:01:06.570> barbarians<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.070> north<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
from barbarians in the north and the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.149 
from barbarians in the north and the
east<00:01:08.940> invasion<00:01:09.900> even<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.350> their<00:01:10.500> own<00:01:10.530> homeland

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
east invasion even in their own homeland

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.010 
east invasion even in their own homeland
they<00:01:12.060> were<00:01:12.560> stretched<00:01:13.560> extremely<00:01:14.490> thin

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
they were stretched extremely thin

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.190 
they were stretched extremely thin
so<00:01:16.680> basically<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.420> game<00:01:18.600> puts<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
so basically the game puts you in the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.139 
so basically the game puts you in the
situation<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.829> even<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> Romans<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:21.060> you

the<00:02:23.190> tribes<00:02:23.609> to<00:02:24.359> no<00:02:24.570> avail<00:02:24.870> they<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.829> seemed

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the tribes to no avail they just seemed

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.650 
the tribes to no avail they just seemed
to<00:02:26.010> one<00:02:26.310> have<00:02:26.489> war<00:02:26.790> that's<00:02:27.000> weapon<00:02:27.329> firm<00:02:27.510> in

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
to one have war that's weapon firm in

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.970 
to one have war that's weapon firm in
equal<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.109> since<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:28.500> actually<00:02:28.769> more

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
equal to since it's actually more

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.520 
equal to since it's actually more
diplomatic<00:02:29.959> construct<00:02:30.959> into<00:02:31.109> it<00:02:31.290> but

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
diplomatic construct into it but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.500 
diplomatic construct into it but
nevertheless<00:02:31.799> there's<00:02:32.489> also<00:02:32.700> Hadrian's<00:02:33.329> Wall

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
nevertheless there's also Hadrian's Wall

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.860 
nevertheless there's also Hadrian's Wall
and<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:34.560> created<00:02:34.890> by<00:02:34.980> Emperor<00:02:35.400> Hadrian

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
and it was created by Emperor Hadrian

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.699 
and it was created by Emperor Hadrian
back<00:02:36.870> during<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:37.320> Rome<00:02:37.530> was<00:02:37.650> still<00:02:37.829> great

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
back during when Rome was still great

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.199 
back during when Rome was still great
there's<00:02:40.709> also<00:02:40.829> many<00:02:41.130> other<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.609> landmarks

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
there's also many other little landmarks

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.819 
there's also many other little landmarks
they're<00:02:42.390> just<00:02:42.600> there<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:42.780> little<00:02:43.140> i<00:02:43.320> detail

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
they're just there for little i detail

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.039 
they're just there for little i detail
so<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.519> adds<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.970> whole<00:02:45.150> splendid

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
so it just adds the whole splendid

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.150 
so it just adds the whole splendid
splendor<00:02:46.980> area<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.209> mud

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
have a secure zone except for the picks
north<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.790> didn't<00:03:05.540> really<00:03:05.660> encounter<00:03:06.200> them

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880

the<00:03:07.880> main<00:03:08.030> area<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.420> want<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.690> watching

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the main area you want to be watching

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.200 
the main area you want to be watching
now<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.860> Europe<00:03:10.280> because<00:03:10.760> that's

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
now is in Europe because that's

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.640 
now is in Europe because that's
generally<00:03:11.420> where<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.110> Gothic<00:03:12.440> tribes

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650

generally where all the Gothic tribes
are<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.280> other<00:03:13.730> barbarian<00:03:14.300> tribes<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:14.960> you're

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
are and other barbarian tribes so you're

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.500 
are and other barbarian tribes so you're
gonna<00:03:15.500> be<00:03:15.710> probably<00:03:16.520> focusing<00:03:16.970> much<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.360> that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
gonna be probably focusing much on that

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.120 
gonna be probably focusing much on that
but<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:17.930> can't<00:03:18.200> also<00:03:18.410> forget<00:03:18.830> about<00:03:18.920> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
but you can't also forget about the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.530 
but you can't also forget about the
eastern<00:03:19.580> nations<00:03:19.730> because<00:03:20.330> they're

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
eastern nations because they're

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.850 
eastern nations because they're
generally<00:03:20.930> have<00:03:21.110> higher<00:03:21.140> levels<00:03:21.710> for<00:03:21.830> a

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
generally have higher levels for a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.490 
generally have higher levels for a
billion<00:03:22.480> see<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.900> nearly<00:03:24.050> combat

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
billion see but you can nearly combat

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.430 
billion see but you can nearly combat
them<00:03:24.650> with<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.920> armies<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.850> have<00:03:26.060> there<00:03:26.440> but

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
them with the armies you have there but

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.960 
them with the armies you have there but
it<00:03:27.950> just<00:03:28.010> proved<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.490> be<00:03:28.520> more<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.820> nuisance

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
it just proved to be more of a nuisance

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.450 
it just proved to be more of a nuisance
Spain<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.960> Africa<00:03:30.260> on<00:03:30.710> the<00:03:30.800> other<00:03:30.920> hand<00:03:31.190> they

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
Spain and Africa on the other hand they

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.760 
Spain and Africa on the other hand they
were<00:03:31.490> I<00:03:32.090> could<00:03:32.660> not<00:03:32.840> get<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.200> those<00:03:33.350> because<00:03:33.680> I

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
were I could not get to those because I

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.220 
were I could not get to those because I
was<00:03:33.860> too<00:03:34.010> busy<00:03:34.160> watching<00:03:34.400> Europe<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.230> Asia

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
was too busy watching Europe and Asia

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.380 
was too busy watching Europe and Asia
and<00:03:36.710> I<00:03:37.160> did<00:03:37.310> not<00:03:37.460> have<00:03:37.640> enough<00:03:37.820> soldiers<00:03:38.060> in

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
and I did not have enough soldiers in

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.390 
and I did not have enough soldiers in
Spain<00:03:38.870> or<00:03:39.140> Africa<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.590> combat<00:03:40.040> any<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
Spain or Africa to combat any of the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.330 
Spain or Africa to combat any of the
armies<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.150> many<00:03:41.480> returned<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.080> rebellion<00:03:42.380> but

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
armies so many returned to rebellion but

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.800 
armies so many returned to rebellion but
this<00:03:43.490> part<00:03:43.700> is<00:03:43.790> very<00:03:43.820> good<00:03:44.150> adds<00:03:44.360> many<00:03:44.570> new

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
this part is very good adds many new

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.350 
this part is very good adds many new
units<00:03:45.490> new<00:03:46.490> concept<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.030> game<00:03:47.270> play<00:03:49.330> what<00:03:50.330> I

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
units new concept to game play what I

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.680 
units new concept to game play what I
like<00:03:50.600> what<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.260> usually<00:03:51.680> like<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.340> do<00:03:52.520> is

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
the East was actually really good

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.720

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.360 
not really many enemies to have to worry
about<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.090> East<00:04:44.270> was<00:04:44.420> good<00:04:44.660> Europe<00:04:45.470> was<00:04:46.340> a
