only with this mode you can never
actually<00:02:21.310> lose<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:23.050> once<00:02:23.170> you've<00:02:23.290> made<00:02:23.470> your

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
decisions there you're presented with a

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.610 
decisions there you're presented with a
track<00:02:25.420> list<00:02:25.750> you'll<00:02:25.959> have<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.230> pick<00:02:26.470> your

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
track list you'll have to pick your

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.260 
track list you'll have to pick your
track<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.400> then<00:02:27.490> after<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.090> get<00:02:28.240> to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
track and then after that you get to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.970 
track and then after that you get to
pick<00:02:28.480> your<00:02:28.630> difficulty<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.410> your<00:02:29.530> intensity

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
pick your difficulty in your intensity

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.800 
pick your difficulty in your intensity
so<00:02:30.220> we're<00:02:30.370> difficulty<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.390> has<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.570> do

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so we're difficulty it just has to do

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.300 
so we're difficulty it just has to do
with<00:02:32.140> how<00:02:32.410> many<00:02:32.590> ships<00:02:32.890> are<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.220> be
