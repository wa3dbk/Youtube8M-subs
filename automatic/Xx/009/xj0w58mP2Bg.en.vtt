anime but if it were anything more it
probably<00:02:47.900> would<00:02:48.080> have<00:02:48.140> ruined<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.560> show<00:02:48.800> the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
probably would have ruined the show the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.610 
probably would have ruined the show the
romantic<00:02:49.970> moments<00:02:50.330> are<00:02:50.450> appeasing<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
heart but don't do much the overall plot

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.490 
heart but don't do much the overall plot
they<00:02:55.760> are<00:02:55.880> subtle<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:56.540> nothing<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:56.930> forced<00:02:57.350> out

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
they are subtle so nothing is forced out

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.229 
they are subtle so nothing is forced out
but<00:02:57.830> just<00:02:58.160> flows<00:02:58.489> from<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.730> setting<00:02:59.150> in

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
but just flows from the setting in

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.180 
but just flows from the setting in
situations<00:02:59.870> although<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.560> do<00:03:00.680> feel<00:03:00.920> there<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:01.099> a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
situations although I do feel there is a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.710 
situations although I do feel there is a
relationship<00:03:01.640> between<00:03:01.790> Pacific<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.599> her

brother that is a little closer than it

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.180 
brother that is a little closer than it
