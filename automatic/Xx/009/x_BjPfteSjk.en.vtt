00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.250

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.250
 today from 100 kilometers per hour 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.330
 yesterday the turn of the other five 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.330
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 today she is half rebellious does not want 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.940
 sound change 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.540
 I think I'm catching a wind 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 against here 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.530
 105 plus one downhill 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.530
 come on speedy position 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.020
 are miles per hour the cable rolled up 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.320
 that's all there is to it. 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.320
 new 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.360
 There seems to be less wind, she's already there. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.360
 to 105 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:36.030
 then the team side wall 110 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:42.350
 now woke up bitch intruder 125 110 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 miles per hour wanting to go to 115 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.650
 almost 10 thousand turns I will not 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.650
 to go over it 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.130
 115 kilometers per hour 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.049
 116 with optimism 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.049
 I think this is her record . 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.440
 semi position asks 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.920
 115 kilometers per hour 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.390
 back to 110 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.450
 I get you a good Venturi condition. 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.020
 who has a 125 knows that the wind is a 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.440
 ally or enemy and does enough 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.440
 difference 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.819
 back to the smallest wind 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.819
 climb here 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.300
 I used a fan 150 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.300
 proud 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.580
 but every day 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:18.110
 What are you doing, some motorcycles? 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:20.900
 now these are the good things about 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.500
 beer with a structure will have 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.080
 in which she will ask to walk the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:34.860
 70 km per hour and which has the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:49.560
 motorcyclists here stopping 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:52.310
 so we changed the bike and brought a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.920
 truck nervous 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.660
 the nilson 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.660
 do not try to get out of their way 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.189
 on the street or face the cell phone and everything goes 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.560
 To face this path, we will not get there. 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:17.190
 the truck on the other camera can see 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:19.169
 who does not come close he also has the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.410
 speed good descent it more center 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.830
 Today already here to 95 kilometers per 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.830
 hour 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.250
 the money is going on 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.120
 to the 100 kilometers per hour 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.780
 we left the truck behind 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.430
 It's over time he said that fighters still 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.430
 by the shoulder 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.410
 hurry up there 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.750
 The day is enjoying a walk like me. 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.690
 I've been here almost 90 kilometers. 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.770
 for an hour traveling on the highway 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.770
 beautiful to my right 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:26.480
 the beautiful forest is probably 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.480
 eucalyptus 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.540
 enjoying this is so good here is not 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.990
 very hot it 's not too cold 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.990
 I can see the landscape 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.570
 I 'm kidding but it's the following 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.540
 much difference is that you walk with a 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.570
 most powerful bike one at 125 so that 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.260
 You still have the dream of taking a trip. 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.370
 with intruders because the 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.350
 experiences are completely 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.050
 many different 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.130
 as 125 is thus required to innovate 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:09.150
 between 80 and 70 depending on the 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.840
 another of the land at 100 per hour is claimed 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.390
 per hour 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.610
 so you enjoy the road one way 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:19.940
 completely different you will have to 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.940
 pay more not to force too much death 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.260
 because if you have like the bike of 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.180
 martin redrado 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.180
 if you are going to the city of smaller 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.020
 There is no way to enjoy the road with 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.400
 low-engine motorcycle a motorcycle 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.880
 high capacity is completely 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.360
 different but the other two things are 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:47.889
 pleasant 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:51.550
 when the quick stop here to help 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.820
 rest a little at the time of 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.820
 rest
