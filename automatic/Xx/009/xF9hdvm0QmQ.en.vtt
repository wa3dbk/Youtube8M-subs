00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.959 
USB cable this is a USB powered of
microphone<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.020> no<00:00:52.320> need<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.860> preamp<00:00:53.309> one

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
microphone so no need for a preamp one

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.520 
microphone so no need for a preamp one
of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> big<00:00:54.300> reasons<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.780> did<00:00:55.260> buy<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of the big reasons I did buy this

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
of the big reasons I did buy this
microphone<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> didn't<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
microphone is because I didn't want to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.500 
microphone is because I didn't want to
bother<00:00:57.210> having<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.500> handle<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.270> preamp<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
bother having to handle a preamp and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.609 
bother having to handle a preamp and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
with a bunch of cool features we have

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
with a bunch of cool features we have
the<00:02:09.569> multi<00:02:09.840> pattern<00:02:11.239> which<00:02:12.239> allows<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.959> let

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the multi pattern which allows you let

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.869 
the multi pattern which allows you let
me<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:17.120> okay<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.989> multi<00:02:19.879> pattern

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
me just okay so we have a multi pattern

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.930 
me just okay so we have a multi pattern
condenser<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.340> three<00:02:23.730> little

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
condenser and we have three little

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.869 
condenser and we have three little
things<00:02:24.269> right<00:02:24.510> here<00:02:24.840> which<00:02:25.549> show<00:02:26.549> us<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
things right here which show us the

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.670 
things right here which show us the
three<00:02:27.120> different<00:02:27.420> recording<00:02:28.079> types<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.560> we

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
three different recording types so we

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.259 
three different recording types so we
got<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.819> omnidirectional<00:02:30.299> which<00:02:31.079> allows<00:02:31.650> it

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
got the omnidirectional which allows it

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.970 
got the omnidirectional which allows it
fused<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.750> side<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.140> allows<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> pick

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
fused to the side it allows it to pick

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.030 
fused to the side it allows it to pick
up<00:02:35.190> everything<00:02:35.970> around<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> microphone<00:02:37.410> then

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
up everything around the microphone then

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.369 
up everything around the microphone then
the<00:02:38.190> one<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.610> middle<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> super<00:02:39.480> card<00:02:40.019> I

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
the one in the middle is a super card I

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.020 
the one in the middle is a super card I
forget<00:02:41.069> how<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.190> pronounce<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:41.879> it's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
forget how to pronounce it but it's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.210 
forget how to pronounce it but it's
pretty<00:02:42.450> much<00:02:42.599> it<00:02:42.780> only<00:02:42.989> records<00:02:43.799> from<00:02:44.069> one

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
pretty much it only records from one

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.699 
pretty much it only records from one
direction<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.790> it'll<00:02:45.060> only<00:02:45.299> record<00:02:45.840> from<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
direction so it'll only record from the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.849 
direction so it'll only record from the
front<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.250> nothing<00:02:47.790> else<00:02:48.090> around<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.349> then

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
front and nothing else around and then

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.910 
front and nothing else around and then
we<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.790> third<00:02:51.030> option<00:02:51.590> which<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
we have the third option which is the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.710 
we have the third option which is the
bi-directional<00:02:53.099> which<00:02:53.849> will<00:02:54.060> record<00:02:54.510> any

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
bi-directional which will record any

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.809 
bi-directional which will record any
sound<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.230> comes<00:02:55.440> from<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.769> front<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.250> from

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
sound that comes from the front and from

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.940 
sound that comes from the front and from
the<00:02:57.060> back<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> microphone<00:02:58.049> now<00:02:58.739> turning

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the back of the microphone now turning

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.750 
the back of the microphone now turning
it<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.280> its<00:02:59.489> back<00:02:59.549> we<00:03:00.389> have<00:03:01.160> two<00:03:02.160> more<00:03:02.310> things

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
it on its back we have two more things

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.140 
it on its back we have two more things
two<00:03:03.269> more<00:03:03.420> options<00:03:03.660> right<00:03:04.109> here<00:03:04.139> we<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
two more options right here we have the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.400 
two more options right here we have the
gain<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:08.690> don't<00:03:09.690> even<00:03:09.810> know<00:03:09.989> what<00:03:10.109> they<00:03:10.200> call<00:03:10.380> it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
gain I don't even know what they call it

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.140 
gain I don't even know what they call it
but<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.769> it's<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.340> extra<00:03:11.639> gain<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:12.030> you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
but it's it's like the extra gain so you

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.839 
but it's it's like the extra gain so you
can<00:03:12.269> have<00:03:12.450> zero<00:03:12.840> gain<00:03:13.109> or<00:03:13.380> minus<00:03:13.889> ten<00:03:14.489> decibels

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
can have zero gain or minus ten decibels

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.699 
can have zero gain or minus ten decibels
of<00:03:15.269> gain<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.250> then<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.720> believe<00:03:19.049> this

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
of gain and then we have I believe this

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.330 
of gain and then we have I believe this
was<00:03:20.400> low<00:03:20.760> frequency<00:03:21.419> and<00:03:21.569> high<00:03:21.810> frequency

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
was low frequency and high frequency

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.800 
was low frequency and high frequency
filter<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.370> want<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.700> high<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.180> low<00:03:24.299> frequency

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
filter I want the high and low frequency

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.960 
filter I want the high and low frequency
filter<00:03:25.169> it<00:03:25.799> just<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.370> cuts<00:03:27.120> out<00:03:27.329> those<00:03:27.810> like

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
filter it just it cuts out those like

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.250 
filter it just it cuts out those like
cuts<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.120> unnecessary<00:03:30.720> noises<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.200> you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
cuts out unnecessary noises that you

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.839 
cuts out unnecessary noises that you
don't<00:03:31.410> need<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.799> your<00:03:31.829> recording<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.609> it's<00:03:32.760> a

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
don't need in your recording so it's a

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.550 
don't need in your recording so it's a
really<00:03:33.090> nice<00:03:33.329> feature<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.079> built-in

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
really nice feature to have it built-in

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.339 
really nice feature to have it built-in
otherwise<00:03:35.340> with<00:03:35.549> mode<00:03:35.700> microphone<00:03:36.329> if<00:03:37.169> it

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
otherwise with mode microphone if it

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.699 
otherwise with mode microphone if it
doesn't<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.769> built-in<00:03:38.419> usually<00:03:39.419> are

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
doesn't have it built-in usually are

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.789 
doesn't have it built-in usually are
stuck<00:03:40.709> doing<00:03:41.489> all<00:03:42.030> sorts<00:03:42.389> of<00:03:42.450> audio<00:03:43.319> editing

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
stuck doing all sorts of audio editing

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.180 
stuck doing all sorts of audio editing
app<00:03:44.459> towards<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.450> take<00:03:46.049> out<00:03:46.230> all<00:03:46.769> the

app towards to take out all the
unnecessary<00:03:47.430> garbage<00:03:49.579> now<00:03:50.579> let's<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:50.849> kind

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
unnecessary garbage now let's just kind

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.599 
unnecessary garbage now let's just kind
of<00:03:51.780> put<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.290> together<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.919> took<00:03:53.099> me<00:03:53.280> when<00:03:53.549> I

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
of put it together it took me when I

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:54.860 
of put it together it took me when I
first<00:03:53.790> took<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.060> out<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.299> box<00:03:54.450> I'm<00:03:54.690> like

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
first took it out of the box I'm like

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.780 
first took it out of the box I'm like
how<00:03:55.049> do<00:03:55.109> I<00:03:55.260> attach<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.010> text<00:03:56.430> and

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
how do I attach this to the text and

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.759 
how do I attach this to the text and
because<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.239> made<00:03:57.629> absolutely<00:03:57.840> no<00:03:58.230> sense<00:03:58.319> and

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
because it made absolutely no sense and

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.800 
because it made absolutely no sense and
there<00:03:58.859> was<00:03:58.950> no<00:03:59.220> real<00:03:59.970> instructions<00:04:00.359> in<00:04:00.720> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
there was no real instructions in the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.240 
there was no real instructions in the
book<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.199> how<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.380> put<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.650> together<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.070> what<00:04:02.220> I

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
book of how to put it together so what I

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.360 
book of how to put it together so what I
realized<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:02.850> get<00:04:03.150> a

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
realized is you get a

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:13.500 
realized is you get a
unscrew<00:04:04.299> this<00:04:05.489> bad<00:04:06.489> boy<00:04:09.390> grab<00:04:10.390> this<00:04:12.390> put<00:04:13.390> it

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
unscrew this bad boy grab this put it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:22.260 
unscrew this bad boy grab this put it
like<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:16.620> back<00:04:17.620> on<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:20.609> then<00:04:21.609> just<00:04:21.639> grabbing<00:04:22.180> a

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
like so back on and then just grabbing a

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:34.590 
like so back on and then just grabbing a
quarter<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.750> taking<00:04:23.139> this<00:04:23.380> out<00:04:32.940> or<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:33.970> key<00:04:34.330> for

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
quarter and taking this out or a key for

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.159 
quarter and taking this out or a key for
that<00:04:34.630> matter<00:04:34.960> I'm<00:04:35.080> just<00:04:35.260> gonna<00:04:35.380> use<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.680> key

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
that matter I'm just gonna use the key

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:52.860 
that matter I'm just gonna use the key
you<00:04:38.169> just<00:04:38.410> need<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.680> get<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:51.030> check<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.180> out<00:04:52.300> and

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
you just need to get it check it out and

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.159 
you just need to get it check it out and
then<00:04:53.169> just<00:04:53.530> do<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.130> desk<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.750> at<00:04:58.900> first

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
then just do it to the desk and at first

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.860 
then just do it to the desk and at first
when<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.039> first<00:05:00.130> saw<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:00.940> little<00:05:01.270> tiny<00:05:01.539> in

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
when I first saw this little tiny in

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.750 
when I first saw this little tiny in
this<00:05:02.050> tab<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.740> didn't<00:05:03.190> actually<00:05:03.310> think<00:05:03.520> it

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
this tab I didn't actually think it

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.189 
this tab I didn't actually think it
would<00:05:03.880> be<00:05:04.000> able<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.300> hold<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.690> weight<00:05:04.810> of<00:05:05.020> the

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
would be able to hold the weight of the

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.719 
would be able to hold the weight of the
microphone<00:05:05.680> but<00:05:05.889> it<00:05:05.979> actually<00:05:06.250> does<00:05:06.610> a<00:05:06.699> really

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
microphone but it actually does a really

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.170 
microphone but it actually does a really

know<00:05:20.410> something<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:21.010> is<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:22.979> mean<00:05:23.979> it's

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
know something that is I mean it's

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.710 
know something that is I mean it's
obviously<00:05:24.490> not<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.760> best<00:05:24.910> microphone<00:05:25.479> on<00:05:25.630> the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
obviously not the best microphone on the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.600 
obviously not the best microphone on the
market<00:05:26.050> but<00:05:26.200> as<00:05:26.289> far<00:05:26.500> as<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.680> USB<00:05:26.950> microphone

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
market but as far as the USB microphone

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.010 
market but as far as the USB microphone
goes<00:05:27.789> I<00:05:27.820> think<00:05:28.150> this<00:05:28.270> is<00:05:28.539> one<00:05:28.690> of<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.870> better

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
goes I think this is one of the better

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.700 
goes I think this is one of the better
ones<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:30.010> go<00:05:30.160> for<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:30.550> even<00:05:30.669> though<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.710> believe

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
ones to go for it even though I believe

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.650 
ones to go for it even though I believe
this<00:05:32.979> model<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:33.669> don't<00:05:33.849> I<00:05:34.120> don't<00:05:34.240> know<00:05:34.449> if<00:05:34.539> they

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
this model I don't I don't know if they

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.650 
this model I don't I don't know if they
have<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.840> newer<00:05:35.139> model<00:05:35.349> than<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.680> co<00:05:36.130> 3<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:37.360> but

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
have a newer model than the co 3 you but

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.810 
have a newer model than the co 3 you but
this<00:05:37.780> model<00:05:37.960> came<00:05:38.229> out<00:05:38.349> like<00:05:38.590> in<00:05:38.830> 2006<00:05:39.699> or

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
this model came out like in 2006 or

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.740 
this model came out like in 2006 or
something<00:05:40.120> like<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.389> so<00:05:40.510> it's<00:05:40.630> actually

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
something like that so it's actually

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.290 
something like that so it's actually
pretty<00:05:40.990> old<00:05:41.260> but<00:05:41.620> it's<00:05:41.860> still<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.520> pretty<00:05:42.910> good

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
pretty old but it's still a pretty good

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.510 
pretty old but it's still a pretty good
product<00:05:43.930> so<00:05:44.889> now<00:05:44.979> I'm<00:05:45.039> just<00:05:45.160> gonna<00:05:45.280> do<00:05:45.490> a

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
product so now I'm just gonna do a

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.070 
product so now I'm just gonna do a
comparison<00:05:45.970> of<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.720> audio<00:05:47.500> from<00:05:47.830> my<00:05:47.889> t1<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:48.340> and

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
comparison of the audio from my t1 I and

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.839 
comparison of the audio from my t1 I and
vs.<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.620> audio<00:05:51.010> that<00:05:51.160> comes<00:05:51.220> out<00:05:51.639> of<00:05:51.760> the

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
vs. the audio that comes out of the

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.640 
vs. the audio that comes out of the
sampson<00:05:52.510> microphone<00:05:55.260> so<00:05:56.260> now<00:05:56.349> I'm<00:05:56.410> just<00:05:56.530> gonna

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
sampson microphone so now I'm just gonna

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.460 
sampson microphone so now I'm just gonna
compare<00:05:57.099> the<00:05:57.250> two<00:05:57.430> microphones<00:05:58.349> against<00:05:59.349> each

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
compare the two microphones against each

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.120 
compare the two microphones against each
other<00:05:59.710> this<00:06:00.010> is<00:06:00.220> currently<00:06:00.849> the<00:06:00.910> Canon<00:06:01.419> t1<00:06:01.780> I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130

built-in microphone and you can see it's
very<00:06:05.800> grainy<00:06:06.340> and<00:06:06.639> it<00:06:06.760> picks<00:06:06.940> up<00:06:07.060> a<00:06:07.389> lot<00:06:07.449> of

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
very grainy and it picks up a lot of

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.700 
very grainy and it picks up a lot of
unnecessary<00:06:08.580> sounds<00:06:09.580> that<00:06:10.240> take<00:06:10.960> away<00:06:11.139> from

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
unnecessary sounds that take away from

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.190 
unnecessary sounds that take away from
your<00:06:12.099> production<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:12.849> now<00:06:13.719> I'm<00:06:13.840> just<00:06:14.020> going

your production and now I'm just going
to<00:06:14.469> be<00:06:14.590> testing<00:06:15.039> out<00:06:15.190> and<00:06:15.610> compare

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
to be testing out and compare

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.070 
to be testing out and compare
in<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.580> Samsun<00:06:17.180> 300<00:06:17.660> you<00:06:18.280> microphone<00:06:20.020> this<00:06:21.020> is
