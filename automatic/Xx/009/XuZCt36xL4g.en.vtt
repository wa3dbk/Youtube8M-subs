00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.360
 I had a snack and if they read me, it was a 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.920
 piece of small fruit or something light 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.759

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.780
 after the strawberries I'm going to take a 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.720
 teaspoon of this sugar that is low 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.100
 in calories is one of the Koran natural tea 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.530
 with all the flavor of sugar and has 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.180
 many fewer calories and one 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.160
 teaspoon of this is equivalent to 2 of 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.750
