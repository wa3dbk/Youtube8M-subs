00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
in European cities when there's not much

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:14.720 
in European cities when there's not much
fruit<00:00:06.240> around<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:13.860> hearing<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.340> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
fruit around so we're hearing this and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.859 
fruit around so we're hearing this and
it's<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> city<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.279> city<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:18.119> Europe

but unfortunately it's often it it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.460 
but unfortunately it's often it it
doesn't<00:01:38.579> work<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.930> depends<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
doesn't work because it depends on the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
doesn't work because it depends on the
batch<00:01:40.710> sometimes<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> got

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
be a lot better than any supermarket so

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.339 
be a lot better than any supermarket so
yeah<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.209> wanted<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.780> encourage<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.199> guys

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
yeah I just wanted to encourage you guys

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.270 
yeah I just wanted to encourage you guys
to<00:04:16.530> take<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:18.299> easy<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.660> yourself<00:04:19.019> do<00:04:19.769> your<00:04:19.949> best

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
to take it easy on yourself do your best

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.060 
to take it easy on yourself do your best
but<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.150> know<00:04:21.500> essentially<00:04:22.500> at<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.860> end<00:04:22.889> of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
but you know essentially at the end of

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.770 
but you know essentially at the end of
the<00:04:23.160> base<00:04:23.280> do<00:04:23.669> what<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:24.000> actually<00:04:24.360> want<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> do

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
the base do what you actually want to do

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.420 
the base do what you actually want to do
so<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.199> know<00:04:25.440> if<00:04:25.560> you're<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:26.039> you're<00:04:26.070> just

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
so you know if you're if you're just

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.370 
so you know if you're if you're just
like<00:04:26.580> totally<00:04:27.150> fed<00:04:27.570> up<00:04:27.599> with<00:04:27.780> dates<00:04:28.199> and

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
like totally fed up with dates and

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.640 
like totally fed up with dates and
bananas<00:04:29.270> eat<00:04:30.270> some<00:04:30.479> sweet<00:04:30.720> potato<00:04:31.020> but<00:04:31.440> of

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
bananas eat some sweet potato but of

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.689 
bananas eat some sweet potato but of
course<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:31.979> doesn't<00:04:32.310> really<00:04:32.460> satisfy

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
course that doesn't really satisfy

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.520 
course that doesn't really satisfy
either<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.690> guess<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:33.990> really<00:04:34.020> got<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.470> get

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
either so I guess you really got to get

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.960 
either so I guess you really got to get
to<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.770> tropics<00:04:35.190> if<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:35.430> want<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.669> be<00:04:35.760> totally
