00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.980 
to like pull the cap off it's definitely
a<00:01:42.960> twist<00:01:43.320> cap<00:01:43.590> which<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.280> um<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.840> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
a twist cap which I do like um because I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.690 
a twist cap which I do like um because I
feel<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:46.979> eyeliners<00:01:47.580> have

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
feel like some of my eyeliners have

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
feel like some of my eyeliners have
dried<00:01:47.939> out<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.330> past<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.049> didn't

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
dried out in the past because I didn't

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.170 
dried out in the past because I didn't
click<00:01:49.830> them<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.400> but<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.030> like

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
click them all the way but this one like

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480 
click them all the way but this one like
I<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.930> fully<00:01:52.260> closed<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I know it's fully closed because like I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.630 
I know it's fully closed because like I
can't<00:01:53.760> twist<00:01:54.150> it<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> twist<00:01:56.100> cap<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
can't twist it so it is a twist cap and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.570 
can't twist it so it is a twist cap and
then<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> felt<00:01:57.659> tip<00:01:57.900> eyeliner<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.950> felt

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
then it has a felt tip eyeliner or felt

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.999 
then it has a felt tip eyeliner or felt
tip<00:01:59.790> like<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> says<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.290> shorter<00:02:01.740> felt

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
tip like it says it is a shorter felt

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
tip like it says it is a shorter felt
tip<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.400> nice<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.090> it'll<00:02:04.080> give<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
tip which is nice because it'll give you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.720 
tip which is nice because it'll give you
nice<00:02:04.560> precision<00:02:05.360> sometimes<00:02:06.360> I

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
nice precision sometimes I

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.880 
nice precision sometimes I
like<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.300> longer<00:02:07.690> felt<00:02:07.990> tips<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.590> tip<00:02:08.860> is

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
like the longer felt tips the tip is

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.390 
like the longer felt tips the tip is
flimsier<00:02:09.550> because<00:02:10.000> it's<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:11.080> longer<00:02:11.350> tip<00:02:12.130> I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
flimsier because it's a longer tip I

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.020 
flimsier because it's a longer tip I
like<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.570> it's<00:02:13.720> short<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.800> we're<00:02:15.520> at<00:02:15.760> right

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
like that it's short and we're at right

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.080 
like that it's short and we're at right
after<00:02:16.420> we're<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.110> screw<00:02:17.460> marks<00:02:18.460> are<00:02:18.640> it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
after we're like the screw marks are it

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.850 
after we're like the screw marks are it
kind<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.840> gives<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.110> good<00:02:20.170> place<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.650> hold

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
kind of gives you a good place to hold

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.430 
kind of gives you a good place to hold
it<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.430> work<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:21.850> your<00:02:21.940> eye<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.510> think

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it so you can work on your eye I think

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.200 
it so you can work on your eye I think
this<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.680> good<00:02:23.890> for<00:02:23.920> people<00:02:24.430> who<00:02:24.460> are

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
this is good for people who are

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.540 
this is good for people who are
beginners<00:02:26.200> because<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> felt<00:02:27.130> tip<00:02:27.310> and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
beginners because it is a felt tip and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.720 
beginners because it is a felt tip and
you<00:02:27.640> are<00:02:27.820> going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.060> be<00:02:28.180> able<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:29.550> control<00:02:30.550> it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
you are going to be able to control it

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.410 
you are going to be able to control it
really<00:02:30.970> easily<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.490> think<00:02:33.850> if<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.180> are<00:02:34.390> a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
really easily so I do think if you are a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.990 
really easily so I do think if you are a
beginner<00:02:34.840> you'll<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:36.310> doesn't<00:02:36.730> dry

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
beginner you'll like this it doesn't dry

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.350 
beginner you'll like this it doesn't dry
to<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.210> completely<00:02:37.930> matte<00:02:38.230> finish<00:02:39.000> that's<00:02:40.000> just

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
to a completely matte finish that's just

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
to a completely matte finish that's just
one<00:02:40.600> stroke<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.410> eyeliner<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:42.280> a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
one stroke of the eyeliner so it is a

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.240 
one stroke of the eyeliner so it is a
very<00:02:42.670> very<00:02:42.880> black<00:02:43.300> formula<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.260> once<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.130> let

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
very very black formula and once you let

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.470 
very very black formula and once you let
it<00:02:45.400> dry<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:46.420> does<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:48.490> does<00:02:48.790> like<00:02:49.030> resist

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
it dry it does it does like resist

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.380 
it dry it does it does like resist
smudging<00:02:49.930> pretty<00:02:50.170> well<00:02:50.380> um<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.850> doesn't<00:02:52.240> dry

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
smudging pretty well um it doesn't dry

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.420 
smudging pretty well um it doesn't dry
to<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.570> completely<00:02:53.140> matte<00:02:53.380> finish<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.920> kind<00:02:54.250> of

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
to a completely matte finish it kind of

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.180 
to a completely matte finish it kind of
dries<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:55.180> an<00:02:55.360> almost<00:02:55.660> satiny<00:02:56.560> finish<00:02:56.590> it's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
dries like an almost satiny finish it's

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.560 
dries like an almost satiny finish it's
not<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.550> maddox<00:02:57.970> I've<00:02:58.120> seen<00:02:58.330> but<00:02:58.480> it

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
not the maddox I've seen but it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.540 
not the maddox I've seen but it
definitely<00:02:58.720> isn't<00:02:59.050> like<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.500> shiny<00:03:00.070> factor

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
definitely isn't like a shiny factor

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.940 
definitely isn't like a shiny factor
it's<00:03:00.730> pretty<00:03:01.000> much<00:03:01.120> dry<00:03:01.390> now<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.080> as<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.590> can

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
it's pretty much dry now and as you can

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.040 
it's pretty much dry now and as you can
see<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.430> I'm<00:03:03.670> rubbing<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.300> pretty<00:03:04.660> hard

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
see like I'm rubbing on it pretty hard

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.120 
see like I'm rubbing on it pretty hard
and<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:07.180> not<00:03:07.510> really<00:03:07.990> going<00:03:08.200> anywhere<00:03:08.410> it's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
and it's not really going anywhere it's

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.620 
and it's not really going anywhere it's
pretty<00:03:09.490> it's<00:03:09.730> staying<00:03:10.000> pretty<00:03:10.150> well<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.480> did

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
pretty it's staying pretty well it did

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.600 
pretty it's staying pretty well it did
fade<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> little<00:03:11.080> bit<00:03:11.440> like<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:11.950> one<00:03:12.010> spot

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
fade a little bit like in that one spot

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.070 
fade a little bit like in that one spot
but<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.090> mean<00:03:13.420> come<00:03:13.840> on

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
but I mean come on

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.040 
but I mean come on
that<00:03:14.770> does<00:03:14.980> pretty<00:03:15.190> well<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.820> Justin<00:03:16.780> drying

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
that does pretty well for Justin drying

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.040 
that does pretty well for Justin drying
I<00:03:17.380> used<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.520> on<00:03:18.790> my<00:03:19.000> eyeliner<00:03:19.180> now<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.840> will

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
I used it on my eyeliner now and I will

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.880 
I used it on my eyeliner now and I will
like<00:03:20.200> go<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.709> demo<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.340> me<00:03:21.670> using<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.450> now<00:03:22.890> but

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
like go to a demo of me using it now but

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.800 
like go to a demo of me using it now but
I<00:03:23.950> do<00:03:24.070> think<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.580> does<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> great<00:03:25.030> job<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.630> does

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
I do think it does a great job it does

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.720 
I do think it does a great job it does
apply<00:03:26.050> really<00:03:26.380> easily<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.190> does<00:03:27.370> like

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
apply really easily and it does like

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.229 
apply really easily and it does like
glide<00:03:28.239> on<00:03:28.570> really<00:03:29.020> nicely<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:30.520> works<00:03:30.970> well

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
glide on really nicely it works well

this eyeliner would glide smoothly over
cream<00:03:48.400> which<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:49.030> did<00:03:49.300> which<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.630> was<00:03:49.780> really

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020

cream which it did which I was really
really<00:03:50.170> surprised<00:03:50.620> about<00:03:50.800> some<00:03:51.220> eyeliners<00:03:51.760> do

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
really surprised about some eyeliners do

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.820

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
not glide over creams very well at all

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.949 
not glide over creams very well at all
sometimes<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.370> feel<00:03:54.489> like<00:03:54.550> they<00:03:54.700> get<00:03:54.850> like<00:03:55.060> they

maybe

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
maybe

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.410 
maybe
seven<00:04:08.530> or<00:04:08.620> eight<00:04:08.770> times<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.910> still<00:04:10.210> seems

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
seven or eight times and it still seems

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.330 
seven or eight times and it still seems
to<00:04:10.600> be<00:04:10.840> going<00:04:11.050> strong<00:04:11.590> as<00:04:11.830> far<00:04:12.040> as<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
to be going strong as far as the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.120 
to be going strong as far as the
pigmentation<00:04:13.270> and<00:04:13.570> liquid<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.140> concerned<00:04:14.590> and

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
pigmentation and liquid is concerned and

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.500 
pigmentation and liquid is concerned and
like<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.490> said<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:15.880> do<00:04:16.000> have<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.239> shake<00:04:16.480> it

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
like I said you do have to shake it

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.240 
like I said you do have to shake it
every<00:04:16.780> once<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.110> while<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.890> think<00:04:17.950> it's

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
every once in a while and I think it's

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.400 
every once in a while and I think it's
just<00:04:18.580> to<00:04:18.790> like<00:04:18.970> get<00:04:19.780> everything<00:04:19.900> flowing

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
just to like get everything flowing

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.610 
just to like get everything flowing
again<00:04:20.830> but<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.940> do<00:04:22.090> really<00:04:22.420> like<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.140> would

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
again but I do really like it I would

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.590 
again but I do really like it I would
recommend<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:24.250> if<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.580> had<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.910> like<00:04:25.090> judge<00:04:25.450> it

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
recommend it if I had to like judge it

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.680 
recommend it if I had to like judge it
off<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.780> pigmentation<00:04:26.650> staying<00:04:27.550> power<00:04:27.820> how<00:04:28.510> it

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
off of pigmentation staying power how it

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.510 
off of pigmentation staying power how it
is<00:04:28.810> controlled<00:04:29.050> like<00:04:29.560> easy<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:30.040> control<00:04:30.400> with

satin<00:05:24.850> ish<00:05:25.510> finish<00:05:26.230> to<00:05:26.470> it<00:05:26.500> but<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.160> don't<00:05:27.310> mind

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
satin ish finish to it but I don't mind

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.490 
satin ish finish to it but I don't mind
it<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.180> if<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.419> if<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.810> really<00:05:28.960> bothers<00:05:29.169> you

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
it and if you if it really bothers you

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.720 
it and if you if it really bothers you
you<00:05:29.530> can<00:05:29.620> always<00:05:29.860> just<00:05:30.100> throw<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.310> little<00:05:30.520> bit

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
you can always just throw a little bit

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.370 
you can always just throw a little bit
of<00:05:30.820> black<00:05:30.970> shadow<00:05:31.300> on<00:05:31.390> top<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.320> think

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
of black shadow on top of it and I think

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.950 
of black shadow on top of it and I think
you'll<00:05:32.770> be<00:05:32.950> just<00:05:33.160> fine<00:05:33.250> so<00:05:34.000> overall<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.480> would

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
you'll be just fine so overall I would

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.540 
you'll be just fine so overall I would
recommend<00:05:35.470> this<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:35.830> think<00:05:36.190> it's<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.400> great

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
recommend this I think it's a great

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.370 
recommend this I think it's a great
drugstore<00:05:37.180> eyeliner<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:37.870> don't<00:05:38.050> think<00:05:38.260> it

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
drugstore eyeliner and I don't think it

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.650 
drugstore eyeliner and I don't think it
costs<00:05:38.770> too<00:05:38.919> much<00:05:38.980> I<00:05:39.340> also<00:05:39.850> like<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.330> fact<00:05:40.360> that

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
costs too much I also like the fact that

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.080 
costs too much I also like the fact that
it<00:05:40.960> screws<00:05:41.500> shut<00:05:42.070> like<00:05:42.370> it<00:05:42.550> twist<00:05:42.850> shut

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
it screws shut like it twist shut

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.090 
it screws shut like it twist shut
because<00:05:43.300> you<00:05:44.260> don't<00:05:44.500> have<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.800> worry<00:05:44.980> about

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
because you don't have to worry about

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.800 
because you don't have to worry about
not<00:05:45.520> clicking<00:05:45.940> it<00:05:46.090> all<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.360> way<00:05:46.450> because<00:05:46.660> I

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
not clicking it all the way because I

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.600 
not clicking it all the way because I
had<00:05:47.110> one<00:05:47.380> eyeliner<00:05:47.800> that<00:05:48.070> I<00:05:48.100> thought<00:05:48.400> I<00:05:48.430> was

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
had one eyeliner that I thought I was

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.890 
had one eyeliner that I thought I was
clicking<00:05:48.850> all<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.120> way<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.450> then<00:05:49.570> one<00:05:49.720> day<00:05:49.750> I

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
clicking all the way and then one day I

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.360 
clicking all the way and then one day I
clicked<00:05:50.260> it<00:05:50.380> further<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.860> I'm<00:05:50.980> like<00:05:51.100> that's

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
clicked it further and I'm like that's

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.100 
clicked it further and I'm like that's
why<00:05:51.550> they<00:05:51.700> were<00:05:51.820> drying<00:05:52.060> out<00:05:52.330> at<00:05:52.510> me<00:05:52.660> so<00:05:52.810> fast

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
why they were drying out at me so fast

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.590 
why they were drying out at me so fast
