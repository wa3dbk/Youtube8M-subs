it's quite old-fashioned doing it like
that<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.670> thing<00:01:24.880> gets<00:01:25.150> stuck<00:01:25.450> all

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
that because the thing gets stuck all

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:39.920 
that because the thing gets stuck all
the<00:01:25.630> time

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:50.210
