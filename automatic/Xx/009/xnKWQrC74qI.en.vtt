00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
really complain about it and so i took

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.470 
really complain about it and so i took
the<00:00:25.350> sheet<00:00:25.740> home<00:00:25.980> washed<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.519> dried<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.970> with

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the sheet home washed and dried it with

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
the sheet home washed and dried it with
fitted<00:00:27.840> sheets<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:29.010> cut<00:00:29.429> off<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
fitted sheets I like to cut off the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
fitted sheets I like to cut off the
elastic<00:00:30.359> around<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> entire<00:00:31.140> outer<00:00:31.439> edge<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
elastic around the entire outer edge and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.459 
elastic around the entire outer edge and
cut<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> corner<00:00:33.120> seems<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> will

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
cut up the corner seems so that it will

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.410 
cut up the corner seems so that it will
lay<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.860> flat<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.219> possible<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.149> way

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
lay as flat as possible and that way

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
lay as flat as possible and that way
when<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.660> cut<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.230> pattern<00:00:37.590> pieces<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:38.280> not

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
when I cut out my pattern pieces I'm not

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
when I cut out my pattern pieces I'm not
having<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> worry<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.440> grain

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
having to worry so much about the grain

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.040 
having to worry so much about the grain
line<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> how<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.270> could<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.540> pulling<00:00:42.930> around

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
line and how it could be pulling around

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.330 
line and how it could be pulling around
the<00:00:43.260> edges<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.770> everything<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> um<00:00:46.340> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the edges and everything and so um the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.729 
the edges and everything and so um the
sheet<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.000> ready<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> went

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
sheet is all ready to use and so I went

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.790 
sheet is all ready to use and so I went
ahead<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> measure<00:00:50.550> myself<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.680> compared<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
ahead and measure myself and compared it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.889 
ahead and measure myself and compared it
to<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.180> measurements<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.629> pattern

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to the measurements on the pattern

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.040 
to the measurements on the pattern
envelope<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:56.100> pattern<00:00:56.430> i<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.210> sizes<00:00:57.719> six

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
envelope the pattern i have is sizes six

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040 
envelope the pattern i have is sizes six
eight<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.320> ten<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.910> by<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> way<00:01:00.750> have

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
eight and ten which by the way have

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.380 
eight and ten which by the way have
nothing<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.579> sizes<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
nothing to do with the sizes that you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.859 
nothing to do with the sizes that you
would<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.870> buy<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> store<00:01:05.600> patterns<00:01:06.600> are

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
would go and buy at a store patterns are

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.200 
would go and buy at a store patterns are
sized<00:01:07.110> completely<00:01:07.740> differently<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.430> i<00:01:09.090> am

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pattern and for some people that might

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.940 
pattern and for some people that might
be<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> problem<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.570> i<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.930> ways<00:01:19.290> around<00:01:19.590> this

be a problem but i know ways around this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280 
be a problem but i know ways around this
and<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.490> i<00:01:20.520> want<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> share<00:01:21.210> some<00:01:21.750> tips<00:01:21.780> for

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and so i want to share some tips for

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.580 
and so i want to share some tips for
this<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> pattern<00:01:23.670> i<00:01:23.790> am<00:01:23.970> using<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this now the pattern i am using is for a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.280 
this now the pattern i am using is for a
very<00:01:26.009> loose<00:01:26.340> fitted<00:01:26.759> dress<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.450> i<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
very loose fitted dress so i have a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
very loose fitted dress so i have a
couple<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> options<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> first<00:01:29.880> one

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
couple of options and the first one

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
couple of options and the first one
would<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:31.020> nothing<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
would be to do nothing to the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
would be to do nothing to the
measurements<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.670> hope<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
measurements and just hope that there is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.740 
measurements and just hope that there is
enough<00:01:34.250> extra<00:01:35.250> looseness<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.090> dress<00:01:36.479> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
enough extra looseness in the dress that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.679 
enough extra looseness in the dress that
it<00:01:36.990> would<00:01:37.140> still<00:01:37.409> fit<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.600> would

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it would still fit and I that would

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.499 
it would still fit and I that would
probably<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.140> fine<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.790> still<00:01:42.180> want<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
probably be fine but I still want the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.340 
probably be fine but I still want the
dress<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:43.259> loose<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.799> me<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.899> options

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
dress to be loose on me so I my options

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
dress to be loose on me so I my options
are<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:47.040> take<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.460> slightly<00:01:47.850> smaller<00:01:48.060> seam

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
are to take a slightly smaller seam

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
are to take a slightly smaller seam
allowance<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.259> all<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.159> sides<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:52.280> go<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
allowance at all the sides and like go a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.520 
allowance at all the sides and like go a
little<00:01:53.729> bit<00:01:53.909> smaller<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.689> each<00:01:55.229> seam

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
little bit smaller on each seam

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.319 
little bit smaller on each seam
allowance<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.219> will<00:01:56.369> gain<00:01:56.549> me<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> little

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
allowance and that will gain me a little

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.950 
allowance and that will gain me a little
extra<00:01:57.540> space<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:59.040> um<00:01:59.549> there<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.540> still<00:02:00.810> one

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
extra space but um there is still one

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.160 
extra space but um there is still one
more<00:02:01.170> option<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.149> is<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.329> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
more option and that is because this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
more option and that is because this
dress<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> very<00:02:05.040> simple<00:02:05.310> dress<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
dress is a very simple dress and so the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.900 
dress is a very simple dress and so the
front<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> back<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.740> both<00:02:07.950> cut<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
front and the back are both cut on the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.540 
front and the back are both cut on the
fold<00:02:09.119> instead<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.319> placing<00:02:10.530> my<00:02:10.890> pattern<00:02:11.310> piece

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
fold instead of placing my pattern piece

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.030 
fold instead of placing my pattern piece
on<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.060> fold<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.599> actually

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
on the fold I'm actually

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.179 
on the fold I'm actually
to<00:02:13.219> place<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.819> half<00:02:14.390> an<00:02:14.540> inch<00:02:14.629> away<00:02:15.189> which

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
to place it a half an inch away which

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.390 
to place it a half an inch away which
gains<00:02:16.969> me<00:02:17.329> my<00:02:17.659> two<00:02:17.719> inches<00:02:18.469> because<00:02:18.769> there's<00:02:19.310> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400
