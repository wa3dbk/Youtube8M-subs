00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
welcome to my third team of the week and

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.130 
welcome to my third team of the week and
I<00:00:02.580> think<00:00:02.820> that<00:00:02.939> there<00:00:03.120> were<00:00:03.300> some<00:00:03.570> pretty<00:00:03.870> good

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I think that there were some pretty good

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.930 
I think that there were some pretty good
games<00:00:04.410> played<00:00:04.680> over<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:04.980> weekend<00:00:05.460> once<00:00:05.640> again

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
games played over the weekend once again

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.610 
games played over the weekend once again
and<00:00:06.180> so<00:00:06.540> i'll<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.870> looking<00:00:07.020> at<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.379> players

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
and so i'll be looking at the players

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.560 
and so i'll be looking at the players
who<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.859> think<00:00:08.250> performed<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> best<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.300> so

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
who I think performed the best and so

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.749 
who I think performed the best and so
first<00:00:09.900> off<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:10.349> have<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.469> hero<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.920> mine<00:00:11.280> Brad

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
just so dominant in the air and if I was

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.740 
just so dominant in the air and if I was
cash<00:00:44.370> only<00:00:44.579> I'd<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> bit<00:00:45.329> worried<00:00:45.690> about

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
cash only I'd be a bit worried about

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
weekend in the left mid position I know
he's<00:00:57.120> not<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> natural<00:00:57.750> left<00:00:57.930> mid<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> Robert

against tottenham and ultimately

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
against tottenham and ultimately
probably<00:01:03.390> should<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.600> scored<00:01:03.809> more<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

between<00:01:22.860> cazorla<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.700> Diaby<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.450> ultimately

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
between cazorla or Diaby but ultimately

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
between cazorla or Diaby but ultimately
i<00:01:25.229> chose<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> RB<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.610> people

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
i chose the RB just because people

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
i chose the RB just because people
weren't<00:01:27.210> expecting<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.350> him<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.799> I

petersburg<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.760> i<00:02:43.790> would<00:02:43.849> have<00:02:44.150> really<00:02:44.540> liked

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
petersburg but i would have really liked

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.330 
petersburg but i would have really liked
to<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.049> him<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> Premier<00:02:45.650> League<00:02:45.680> he<00:02:46.160> was

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
to see him in the Premier League he was

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.490 
to see him in the Premier League he was
linked<00:02:46.670> with<00:02:46.700> Chelsea<00:02:47.299> really<00:02:47.720> heavily<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.410> I
