00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
thought that I could just bought these

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.930 
thought that I could just bought these
down<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.640> little<00:03:53.880> bit<00:03:54.120> more<00:03:54.390> into<00:03:54.870> her<00:03:55.940> sippy

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
down a little bit more into her sippy

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.780 
down a little bit more into her sippy
cup<00:03:57.300> because<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:58.310> don't<00:03:59.310> want<00:03:59.370> her<00:03:59.610> drinking

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
cup because I don't want her drinking

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.730 
cup because I don't want her drinking
squash<00:04:00.360> anymore<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:00.960> she<00:04:01.110> won't<00:04:01.290> drink<00:04:01.470> water

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
squash anymore but she won't drink water

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.590 
squash anymore but she won't drink water
so<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.280> thought<00:04:02.640> this<00:04:02.820> was<00:04:03.000> kind<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.390> better

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
so I thought this was kind of a better

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.570 
so I thought this was kind of a better
alternative<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.350> squash<00:04:04.830> their<00:04:05.100> kind<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.400> more

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
alternative to squash their kind of more

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.440
