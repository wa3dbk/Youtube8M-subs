three actuators this is a sensor
controller<00:00:28.590> an<00:00:28.740> actuator<00:00:29.220> now<00:00:29.849> we're<00:00:30.090> going

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
controller an actuator now we're going

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.659 
controller an actuator now we're going
to<00:00:30.630> make<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.080> anytime<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.650> press<00:00:32.009> space<00:00:32.369> a
