00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.430
 it also deliberately to the chosen 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.200
 usually it is like that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 Maneuver to the end is there will be the whole 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.190
 war equipment transported by ship 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.620
 or by rail but no you wanted 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.640
 make it quite conscious about land it 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.510
 should be a sign of connectedness 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.460
 show that you are in solidarity 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.190
 and background is just ukraine 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.290
 crisis so the way over land 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 because you are very conscious in contact with the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.770
 Population wanted to have it now 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.610
 we take a few aerial pictures 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.220
 look at 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.170
 accompanied by a Polish camera team 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.980
 namely the convoy she said everything 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.610
 Thousands of kilometers drive the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.430
 convoys of 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.600
 several tanks are just as many 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.730
 support vehicles helicopter 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.920
 Hundreds of soldiers are several of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.200
 voice in Poland is also on the way 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.580
 part of the maneuver should you want to practice 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 turn off the repair charge and 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.850
 so on and the three convoys is 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.940

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.470
 they will be in bavaria at the beginning of april 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.770
 expects currency if you are so now 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.140
 no fear of contact looks around 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.150
 joy here in the bunch actually very big 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.010
 that the us soldiers are her stations 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.080
 do if you happen world of 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.580
 last weeks months and years looks 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.860
 it's the relatively rare that 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.260
 US soldiers the G1 with open arms 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.060
 to be received almost cheering why are 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.050
 the poles are so happy that the americans are there 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.090
 of course that has already been with the 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.820
 Ukraine crisis to do the skepticism 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.230
 is against courageous against Russia 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.380
 Huge and here is also a lot 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.170
 strong feeling of terror one is afraid 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.880
 that the russian they are afraid of 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.190
 a Russian aggression as well as it in the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.630
 vienna is ukraine and that is the reason 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.940
 you see the things before all things 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.519
 united states the protective power 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.650
 ideas from a europe medis them out 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.140
 brussels came to be rejected here 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.180
 actually only the usa trusts too well in 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.760
 to stop in any way 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.590
 and for the soldiers soul of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.150
 Americans probably should 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.989
 balsam say something also experience the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.340
 not every day 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.060
 they may have to talk to him 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.660
 the mood among the American 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.660
 soldiers 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.670

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.489
 they already have that in the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.780
 The Baltic States enjoyed the most 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.380
 friendly reception here is the same 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.330

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.139
 Fear than that for me in the end 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.969

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.539
 worrying development
