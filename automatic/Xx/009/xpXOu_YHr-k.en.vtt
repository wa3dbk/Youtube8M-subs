that I discovered I had bought this zoom
h1<00:00:13.110> which<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> digital<00:00:15.210> audio<00:00:15.360> recorder<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
h1 which is a digital audio recorder I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410 
h1 which is a digital audio recorder I
wasn't<00:00:17.070> really<00:00:17.190> sure<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.119> point<00:00:18.270> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
wasn't really sure what the point of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.439 
wasn't really sure what the point of
these<00:00:18.539> things<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:19.850> it<00:00:20.850> has<00:00:20.970> really<00:00:21.210> great

these things was it has really great

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.439 
these things was it has really great
audio<00:00:22.100> but<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> also<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.850> lav<00:00:24.090> mic

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
audio but I also got like this lav mic

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
audio but I also got like this lav mic
that<00:00:24.930> I'm<00:00:25.140> speaking<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:25.980> right<00:00:26.220> now<00:00:26.369> I'm

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that I'm speaking into right now I'm

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
that I'm speaking into right now I'm
actually<00:00:26.670> using<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> zoom<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> record<00:00:27.869> this

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
actually using the zoom to record this

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200 
actually using the zoom to record this
right<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> big<00:00:29.699> surprise<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
right now but the big surprise that

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.089 
right now but the big surprise that
you're<00:00:30.480> gonna<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.900> video<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:32.040> I

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you're gonna see this video is that I

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.450 
you're gonna see this video is that I
also<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.320> lav<00:00:34.530> mic<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.219> used

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
also have the same lav mic and I used

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.090 
also have the same lav mic and I used
this<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.940> splitter<00:00:36.390> thing<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
this little splitter thing it's the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.510 
this little splitter thing it's the
rocket<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:39.230> $12<00:00:40.230> $13<00:00:40.770> from<00:00:40.920> Amazon<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
rocket it's like $12 $13 from Amazon and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700 
rocket it's like $12 $13 from Amazon and
this<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.300> makes<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.960> actually

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this one makes it so you can actually

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.459 
this one makes it so you can actually
use<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.670> lab<00:00:44.850> mic<00:00:45.120> directly<00:00:45.750> into<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> iPhone

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
use the lab mic directly into the iPhone

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
use the lab mic directly into the iPhone
so<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.860> shooting<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> iPhone<00:00:47.850> or

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
so if you're shooting with the iPhone or

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
so if you're shooting with the iPhone or
if<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> put<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.469> directly<00:00:49.649> into

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
if you want to put this directly into

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
if you want to put this directly into
computer<00:00:50.840> then<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.110> actually<00:00:52.260> capture

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
computer then you can actually capture

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.040 
computer then you can actually capture
audio<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.410> video<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> same<00:00:56.039> time<00:00:57.050> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
audio and video at the same time and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.310 
audio and video at the same time and
have<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.440> synched<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.600> a<00:01:00.600> couple

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
have it all synched up because a couple

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.270 
have it all synched up because a couple
problems<00:01:01.559> I've<00:01:01.980> had<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> work

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
problems I've had with this the work

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.330 
problems I've had with this the work
flow<00:01:05.489> through<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> zoom<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> lot

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
flow through the zoom is one I get a lot

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
flow through the zoom is one I get a lot
of<00:01:08.460> audio<00:01:08.820> drift<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.420> end<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.630> having<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> sync

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
of audio drift I end up having to sync

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.880 
of audio drift I end up having to sync
up<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.189> audio<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.750> video<00:01:12.990> in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
up the audio to the video in

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.830 
up the audio to the video in
post-production<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:15.360> adds<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.720> extra<00:01:15.960> step

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
post-production that adds an extra step

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.090 
post-production that adds an extra step
the<00:01:18.840> other<00:01:19.020> problem<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the other problem that I have is that

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.510 
the other problem that I have is that
it's<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.540> mono<00:01:21.930> mic<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's this is a mono mic and this is a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.420 
it's this is a mono mic and this is a
stereo<00:01:24.180> recorder<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.500> everything<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.100> goes

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
stereo recorder so everything just goes

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.880 
stereo recorder so everything just goes
records<00:01:27.390> into<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> left<00:01:28.380> channel<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
records into just the left channel I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.870 
records into just the left channel I
think<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> pretty<00:01:29.549> standard

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
think this is a pretty standard

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.940 
think this is a pretty standard
procedure<00:01:29.939> -<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.140> post-production<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
procedure - in post-production you that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.819 
procedure - in post-production you that
I<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.930> open<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:33.960> audacity<00:01:34.619> or

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
I have to just like open up audacity or

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
I have to just like open up audacity or
some<00:01:35.040> program<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.759> make<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:36.450> come

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
some program and make it actually come

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.859 
some program and make it actually come
through<00:01:37.130> both<00:01:38.130> channels<00:01:38.460> left<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.210> but

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
through both channels left and right but

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
through both channels left and right but
the<00:01:39.990> interesting<00:01:40.320> thing<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.860> when<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the interesting thing was that when I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
the interesting thing was that when I
was<00:01:41.100> using<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.520> splitter<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.210> iPhone<00:01:42.780> I

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
was using this splitter on the iPhone I

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
was using this splitter on the iPhone I
haven't<00:01:43.560> checked<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.009> imagine<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
haven't checked it I imagine also if I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.620 
haven't checked it I imagine also if I
just<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.960> directly<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.409> computer<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.630> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
just go directly in a computer that it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.270 
just go directly in a computer that it
automatically<00:01:49.140> gets<00:01:49.290> split<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:49.740> both

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
automatically gets split into both

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.639 
automatically gets split into both
channels<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.960> will<00:01:52.110> dramatically

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
channels so this will dramatically

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.359 
channels so this will dramatically
reduce<00:01:53.189> my<00:01:53.970> post-production<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:55.250> go<00:01:56.250> ahead

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
reduce my post-production time go ahead

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.740 
reduce my post-production time go ahead

see I like them so much that I actually

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.130 
see I like them so much that I actually
bought<00:02:33.160> two<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.670> them<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.150> reason<00:02:34.420> why<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.810> like

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
bought two of them the reason why I like

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.140 
bought two of them the reason why I like
them<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.620> they're<00:02:35.770> cardioid<00:02:36.340> mics<00:02:36.580> they

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
them is that they're cardioid mics they

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.870 
them is that they're cardioid mics they
don't<00:02:37.300> pick<00:02:37.480> up<00:02:38.250> very<00:02:39.250> much<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.580> street

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
don't pick up very much of the street

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.170 
don't pick up very much of the street
sound<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.300> live<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.630> very<00:02:40.810> busy<00:02:40.960> street<00:02:42.180> so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
sound I live on a very busy street so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.410 
sound I live on a very busy street so
that's<00:02:43.270> why<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:44.100> like<00:02:45.100> them<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.370> much<00:02:45.700> they

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
that's why I like them so much they

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.840 
that's why I like them so much they
might<00:02:46.630> not<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.990> best<00:02:47.140> sound<00:02:47.470> quality

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
might not be the best sound quality

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
this is way better first of all but it

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.460 
this is way better first of all but it
is<00:04:50.650> not<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.610> would<00:04:51.730> be<00:04:51.820> nice<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.120> have<00:04:52.660> like<00:04:53.140> one

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
is not it would be nice to have like one

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.270 
is not it would be nice to have like one
less<00:04:53.740> step<00:04:54.100> in<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.490> post-production<00:04:54.880> process

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
less step in the post-production process

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.800 
less step in the post-production process
depending<00:04:57.280> on<00:04:57.370> how<00:04:57.550> what<00:04:58.030> that's<00:04:58.240> worth<00:04:58.510> to

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
depending on how what that's worth to

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.159 
depending on how what that's worth to
you<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.620> could<00:04:59.830> be<00:04:59.860> worth<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:01.390> have<00:05:01.600> a

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
you it could be worth it to to have a

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.390 
you it could be worth it to to have a
lower<00:05:03.100> sound<00:05:03.490> quality<00:05:03.940> but<00:05:04.419> have<00:05:04.630> quicker

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
lower sound quality but have quicker

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.820 
lower sound quality but have quicker
production<00:05:06.400> post-production<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:08.230> that's<00:05:08.680> the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
production post-production so that's the

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.360 
production post-production so that's the
reason<00:05:08.980> why<00:05:09.160> I'm<00:05:09.550> examining<00:05:09.940> this
