00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
you will work with all three of these

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.110 
you will work with all three of these
quad<00:00:13.889> copters<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.429> all<00:00:14.670> three<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> these

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
quad copters and all three of these

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.060 
quad copters and all three of these
controllers<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:16.049> all<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> exact<00:00:16.980> same

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
controllers they all have the exact same

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.760 
controllers they all have the exact same
functions<00:00:17.730> except<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> x12<00:00:19.289> doesn't<00:00:19.619> have

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
functions except the x12 doesn't have

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.109 
functions except the x12 doesn't have
any<00:00:19.980> camera<00:00:20.430> buttons<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> I'm<00:00:23.760> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> put

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
any camera buttons so I'm going to put

going to show you with the Syma x12

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.350 
going to show you with the Syma x12
controller<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> use<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.360> syma

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
bind it up and down a little power and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.630 
bind it up and down a little power and
I'm<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> show<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> left

I'm going to show you what the left

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.800 
I'm going to show you what the left
stick<00:01:35.820> does<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:37.970> let's<00:01:38.970> stick<00:01:39.210> house<00:01:39.390> side<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
stick does now let's stick house side to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.359 
stick does now let's stick house side to
side<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:42.680> little<00:01:43.680> power<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.159> show<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
side now a little power will show you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.240 
side now a little power will show you
the<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.670> stick<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.350> right<00:01:46.350> stick<00:01:46.619> has<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the right stick here right stick has a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.870 
the right stick here right stick has a
yaw<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.149> now

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
yaw on it now

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.330 
yaw on it now
okay<00:01:50.109> so<00:01:51.109> that's<00:01:51.229> how<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.469> switch<00:01:51.799> from<00:01:52.130> mode

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
okay so that's how you switch from mode

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.969 
okay so that's how you switch from mode
2<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:53.030> mode<00:01:53.210> 4<00:01:53.570> in<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.289> book<00:01:54.469> they<00:01:54.619> call<00:01:54.829> it

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
2 to mode 4 in the book they call it

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.950 
2 to mode 4 in the book they call it
mode<00:01:55.189> 1<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:55.579> 2<00:01:55.729> but<00:01:56.679> far<00:01:57.679> as<00:01:57.799> my<00:01:57.950> research

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
mode 1 and 2 but far as my research

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.490 
mode 1 and 2 but far as my research
actually<00:01:59.960> mode<00:02:00.320> 2<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.590> mode<00:02:00.770> 4<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:03.170> can't

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
actually mode 2 and mode 4 you can't

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.469 
actually mode 2 and mode 4 you can't
switch<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:04.039> throttle<00:02:04.460> all<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:05.060> can<00:02:05.240> switch

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
switch the throttle all you can switch

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.699 
switch the throttle all you can switch
is<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.780> yaw<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.289> your<00:02:07.009> side<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.909> side<00:02:08.090> roll<00:02:08.709> so

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
is the yaw and your side to side roll so

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.339 
is the yaw and your side to side roll so
if<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.310> want<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.519> switch<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.789> back<00:02:11.230> turn<00:02:12.230> it

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
if you want to switch it back turn it

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.610 
if you want to switch it back turn it
off<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.879> hold<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> same<00:02:14.510> button<00:02:14.780> again<00:02:14.870> turn

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
off you hold the same button again turn

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.940 
off you hold the same button again turn
it<00:02:15.739> back<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:15.920> long<00:02:16.700> beep<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:18.470> we'll<00:02:18.590> see<00:02:18.799> it's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
it back on long beep and we'll see it's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.970 
it back on long beep and we'll see it's
back<00:02:19.129> to<00:02:19.310> normal<00:02:19.640> here<00:02:23.349> y'all<00:02:24.349> is<00:02:24.500> back<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.860> the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
down to the right quadcopter starts

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.520 
down to the right quadcopter starts
flashing<00:03:48.190> stop<00:03:49.190> flashing<00:03:49.900> your<00:03:50.900> gyros<00:03:51.349> are

number three so these hacks I just
showed<00:03:59.329> you<00:03:59.389> will<00:03:59.720> work<00:03:59.930> with<00:03:59.959> all<00:04:00.350> three<00:04:00.620> of

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
showed you will work with all three of

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.200 
showed you will work with all three of
these<00:04:00.859> quad<00:04:01.160> copters

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
these quad copters

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.990 
these quad copters
all<00:04:02.300> three<00:04:02.570> of<00:04:02.660> these<00:04:02.810> controllers<00:04:03.260> and

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
all three of these controllers and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.370 
all three of these controllers and
everything<00:04:05.000> here<00:04:05.210> is<00:04:05.330> interchangeable<00:04:05.930> you

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
everything here is interchangeable you

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.470 
everything here is interchangeable you
can<00:04:06.560> use<00:04:06.740> this<00:04:07.370> controller<00:04:07.820> with<00:04:08.090> all<00:04:08.210> three

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
can use this controller with all three

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.150 
can use this controller with all three
of<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.690> controller<00:04:09.080> work<00:04:09.620> with<00:04:09.830> all<00:04:09.920> three

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
of this controller work with all three

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.280 
of this controller work with all three
or<00:04:10.370> this<00:04:10.700> controller<00:04:11.120> will<00:04:11.480> work<00:04:11.990> with<00:04:12.170> all

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
or this controller will work with all

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.370 
or this controller will work with all
three<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.590> these<00:04:12.680> quad<00:04:12.980> copters<00:04:13.960> there<00:04:14.960> you<00:04:15.050> go

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
three of these quad copters there you go

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.590 
three of these quad copters there you go
hopefully<00:04:15.980> this<00:04:16.160> video<00:04:16.310> was<00:04:16.610> helpful<00:04:16.640> thank
