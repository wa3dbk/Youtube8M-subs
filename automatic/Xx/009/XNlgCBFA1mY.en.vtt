00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.670
Villain of the Triforce and leader of Gerudos
, let's meet the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.670
personality of Ganondorf. Ganondorf or Ganon
for the most intimate , is the evil villain

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:13.270
from The Legend of Zelda series. it
is also the king of Gerudos , a race of desert

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.490
thieves who only receives one male sex every 100 years . This frightening

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.140
appearance and megalomaniac , is
always in search of the power of the Triforce

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.750
, the sacred artifact created by the goddesses
Din , Farore and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.750
Nayru soon after the creation of Hyrule and
that grants unimaginable power to whom posses it. Also

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.340
known as King of Darkness, Ganondorf
appears initially in the stories of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.759
Ocarina of Time . Here the villain , so far
only leader of Gerudos , used to visit the

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.910
castle
Hyrule representing his people and showing

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.200
a false allegiance to the King , however,
their

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.069
hazy appearance and grasping spirit did not
transmit confidence to Princess Zelda , who

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.020
provided a cursed event based on their dreams
, the same Link , and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.020
all foreshadowed the wave of future events
in the history of the game .

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.940
As Link learns the Song of Time , which has
the power to open the Door of Time and access

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.299
United Sacred ( Sacred Realm ) , Ganondorf
takes advantage of the moment to give a push

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.150
to
open and see the Temple of Time the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.780
last strongholds of templais so far and who
guards the Master

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.640
Sword and the Triforce . Before the powers
of this triangle of power , is well known,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.969
and highly
recommended that she be untouched by evil

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:03.969
entities .
However , the seal is finally broken by Ganondorf

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.980
, who , not wasting the opportunity
to carry out their plans , tries to steal

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.370
the Triforce . But he had not a detail , that
the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.900
the sacred artifact also has the power of
choice and refusal to surrender completely

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.989
to
it. Thus, only absorbing Ganondorf ends of

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.579
the three parts of the Triforce in the
power. Have the other parties , the courage

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.579
and wisdom , stay with Link and Princess Zelda
respectively. The name Ganon was also widely

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.700
used to refer to his beast form , a kind
reborn of the origins of Demise in The Legend

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.669
of Zelda : Skyward Sword . Amid
all these events , we can see on Ganondorf

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:15.669
, an evil spirit and destroyer . its headquarters
the power and the way it spread chaos and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.480
suffering built their characteristic
higher .

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.480
Loaded with high malice and anger, plus the
power of the Triforce , subsequently , the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.040
result could not be different : all culminate
in the transformation of a large demon

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.340
appearance with pork and superhuman strength
, enough to wreak havoc throughout the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.120
Hyrule . But Link and Zelda were there to
impedÃ­lo

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.770
committing his future plans , and after
many efforts, you can LacRALO

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.770
within the Dark World .
But the guy always comes back and is present

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.750
in several other games in the franchise ,
fleeing the Dark World , influencing other

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.090
villains , turning them
in puppetry and up

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.520
even being raised by his faithful servants
, as in Oracle of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.520
Ages / Seasons .
Ganondorf is also considered one of the most

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.470
experienced fighters in the Smash Bros. series.
,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.479
having a great physique , quite athletic , but
a little heavy , and , for this reason ,

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.569
a bit slow in their movements . On the other
hand , he keeps it one of the most

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:20.569
concentration of powerful forces and attack
all game, getting a pair of Captain Falcon

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:27.689
.
Even being so greedy , among many other negative

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.500
adjectives , Ganondorf won
hearts of gamers and consolidated as one of

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.199
the most stylish and beloved villains around the
world of games .
