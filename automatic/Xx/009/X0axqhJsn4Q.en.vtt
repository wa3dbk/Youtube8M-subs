00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.790
 But at the time Emperor Augustus came to the homepage of the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 Roman Empire a bid cost 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.309
 that all the world would be appreciated 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.109
 And so Joseph Oscar made his start to let it go again 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.829
 Light given 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.099
 he is now they have joined the xing group from the house to the sex 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.840
 closed the pliers 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.989
 and was looking forward to meeting veins of its shared context 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.470
 with it when Maria 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.840
 who changed her facebook status to hochschwanger 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 and she gave birth to her first son 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.370
 and put them in a crib 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.130
 and in the same area shepherds in the field were the guardians of one night 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.490
 conducts 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.270
 and every part of an angel tweeted to them and they were surely afraid 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.990
 and the angel wrote 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.200
 do not be afraid 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.550
 behold, I proclaim you great joy that will befall all the people 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.190
 if you 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.620
 is today the Savior 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.360
 more than 140 characters 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.030
 the title holder did not 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 because the news was uploaded to Wikileaks Buck made it all 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.990
 wrapped in diapers there 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.020
 so the angels soon had many followers 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.980
 the easy god, tasting the glory of God in the highest and peace 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.170
 Earth 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 and the people a pleasure 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.610
 and Maria 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.450
 added the genesis 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.520
 as a contact 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.880
 as the angels went to heaven 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.830
 sat down who held some computers 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.030
 and Google Chrome the healer 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.240
 but look there 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.399
 These must have had no wikipedia entry 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.220
 let alone a myspace page 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.860
 See 1990 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 So they looked at Google Maps where the flu was 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.559
 Names of their iPhones 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.559
 let us now 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.789
 and they found the child borrow 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.339
 they filmed the Savior 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.669
 and shattered bring on YouTube 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.419
 and since Jesus was born 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.189
 the three kings came from the East and spoke 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 Vogue is the newborn king 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.679
 "We have come 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:38.969
 Gumppenberg to block 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.969
 he is the Next Big Thing 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.789
 and you here 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.199
 they found the child borrow 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.449
 for Google Street View 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:52.229
 as ioc-chef and 7 in the comparison stall 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.229
 and found the child borrowing with Mary 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.259
 they fell IDE and gave him gold, too 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.499
 they had just bid on low and despite the item condition 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.779
 new with signs of wear 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.649
 I'm happy Prof 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.729
 in communication 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.729
 is nothing like it was 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:18.879
 Christmas 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.309
 stays Christmas
