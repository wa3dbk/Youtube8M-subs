general<00:00:28.170> no<00:00:30.529> but<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.980> set<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:34.309> have<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
general no but I set this up I have a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.850 
general no but I set this up I have a
sliding<00:00:35.760> bullet<00:00:36.300> weight<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:39.440> it<00:00:40.440> ends<00:00:40.739> up

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
sliding bullet weight and it ends up

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.000 
sliding bullet weight and it ends up
down<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:43.969> bead<00:00:45.020> against<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.140> knot<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
down on a bead against a knot and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.150 
down on a bead against a knot and
there's<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.579> swivel<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
there's the swivel and then I have I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.420 
there's the swivel and then I have I
guess<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.850> feet<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> line<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.039> have

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
guess about two feet of line and I have

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
guess about two feet of line and I have
an<00:00:53.550> offset<00:00:54.000> hook<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.510> don't<00:00:54.719> usually<00:00:55.020> use

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
an offset hook that I don't usually use

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
an offset hook that I don't usually use
because<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.070> consider<00:00:56.489> these<00:00:56.670> kinds<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> hooks

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
because I consider these kinds of hooks

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.290 
because I consider these kinds of hooks
too<00:00:57.629> dangerous<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:59.270> somebody<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:02.300> like

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
too dangerous for somebody like me like

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.289 
too dangerous for somebody like me like
circle<00:01:03.750> hooks<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.470> keep<00:01:04.650> me<00:01:04.860> out<00:01:05.010> of

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
circle hooks because they keep me out of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.740 
circle hooks because they keep me out of
stabbing<00:01:06.299> myself<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.180> doing<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
stabbing myself so what I'm doing is I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.340 
stabbing myself so what I'm doing is I
have<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.960> big<00:01:10.200> Nightcrawler<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.350> I'm

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have a big Nightcrawler here and I'm

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.289 
have a big Nightcrawler here and I'm
threading<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.070> Nightcrawler<00:01:15.830> onto<00:01:16.830> this

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
threading the Nightcrawler onto this

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.760 
threading the Nightcrawler onto this
offset<00:01:18.299> hook<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:22.670> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> try<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> put<00:01:24.770> if

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
offset hook and I want to try to put if

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.999 
offset hook and I want to try to put if
possible<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> entire<00:01:27.119> Nightcrawler

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
possible the entire Nightcrawler

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.580 
possible the entire Nightcrawler
on<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.909> hook<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:31.020> onto<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> line<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
on this hook up onto the line so it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.870 
on this hook up onto the line so it's
going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> lie<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.400> bottom<00:01:37.759> there's<00:01:38.759> the
