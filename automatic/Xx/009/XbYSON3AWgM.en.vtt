00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
that all part there we dropped off all
these<00:00:19.980> lines<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.640> we're<00:00:21.090> pulling<00:00:21.360> fully<00:00:21.630> from

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
these lines so we're pulling fully from

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.070 
these lines so we're pulling fully from
the<00:00:22.140> squab<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:23.570> coming<00:00:24.570> through<00:00:24.690> the<00:00:24.869> system

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the squab are coming through the system

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.990 
the squab are coming through the system
or<00:00:25.410> coming<00:00:25.710> through<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:26.010> heater<00:00:26.190> and<00:00:26.760> over

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
or coming through the heater and over

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.580 
or coming through the heater and over
here<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.330> want<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.600> turn<00:00:27.779> off<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.380> pool

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
returns so you've got this one that's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
returns so you've got this one that's
just<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.350> a<00:00:31.680> water<00:00:32.220> runs<00:00:32.489> through<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
just it's just a water runs through the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
just it's just a water runs through the
spa<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.629> it<00:00:33.660> overflow<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.530> this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
spa just to make it overflow with this

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.500 
spa just to make it overflow with this
one<00:00:34.949> and<00:00:35.400> that's<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.120> water<00:00:36.300> actually

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
one and that's where your water actually

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
one and that's where your water actually
goes<00:00:36.780> back<00:00:37.020> into<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> pool<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.680> returns<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
goes back into the pool the returns in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
goes back into the pool the returns in
there<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.670> right<00:00:38.910> we're<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
there so right we're going to use this

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
there so right we're going to use this
one<00:00:39.899> we're<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> override<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:41.010> all

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
one we're going to override them all

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
one we're going to override them all
okay<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> again<00:00:42.630> we're<00:00:42.780> going

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
okay so we're going to again we're going

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.270 
okay so we're going to again we're going
to<00:00:42.960> point<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.469> toward<00:00:43.680> discrete<00:00:44.070> just

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
to point this one toward discrete just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.010 
to point this one toward discrete just
like<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.520> did<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> spa<00:00:45.059> suction<00:00:45.630> right

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
like we did with the spa suction right

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.330 
like we did with the spa suction right
and<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> off<00:00:46.860> part<00:00:47.160> right<00:00:47.309> there

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and there's the off part right there

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.950 
and there's the off part right there
that's<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.790> a<00:00:47.820> wall<00:00:48.059> nothing's<00:00:48.540> going<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.410 
on what your current temperature is 85
degrees<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:32.160> floating<00:01:32.640> yeah<00:01:33.149> but<00:01:33.300> you're

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
degrees or floating yeah but you're

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.669 
degrees or floating yeah but you're
going<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.599> see<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:33.959> steadily<00:01:34.259> climbed

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
going to see it just steadily climbed

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.390 
going to see it just steadily climbed
till<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> let's<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:35.640> 94<00:01:36.179> yeah

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
till we get up to let's say 94 yeah

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.730 
till we get up to let's say 94 yeah
once<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.210> turn<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.630> heater<00:01:38.870> off<00:01:38.960> but<00:01:39.410> you'll

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
once you turn the heater off but you'll

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.620

bit<00:01:41.810> I'm<00:01:42.050> basically<00:01:42.470> what<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:42.890> doing<00:01:43.190> is

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
bit I'm basically what it's doing is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.040 
bit I'm basically what it's doing is
cooling<00:01:43.730> itself<00:01:44.090> down<00:01:44.300> like<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.810> video

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
cooling itself down like a video

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.000 
cooling itself down like a video
projector<00:01:46.090> runs<00:01:47.090> after<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:47.830> don't<00:01:48.830> touch

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
projector runs after this don't touch

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.450 
projector runs after this don't touch
this<00:01:49.190> very<00:01:49.550> very<00:01:49.790> hot<00:01:50.830> now<00:01:51.830> for<00:01:52.130> making

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
this very very hot now for making

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.190 
this very very hot now for making
bubbles<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.150> pool<00:01:53.360> that's<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.840> switch

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
bubbles in the pool that's the switch

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.170 
bubbles in the pool that's the switch
for<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.500> blow<00:01:54.890> up<00:01:55.190> very<00:01:55.790> important<00:01:58.120> and<00:01:59.120> that

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
for the blow up very important and that

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.690 
for the blow up very important and that
that<00:01:59.960> which<00:02:00.380> we<00:02:00.620> just<00:02:00.830> showed<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.100> there<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
that which we just showed you there to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.280 
that which we just showed you there to
put<00:02:01.910> on

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.340 
turn the spar off and put things back
normally<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.520> controls<00:02:17.030> go<00:02:17.360> up<00:02:17.600> for<00:02:17.960> thus<00:02:18.080> far

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
normally so controls go up for thus far

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.460 
normally so controls go up for thus far
right<00:02:18.860> going<00:02:19.160> straight<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.640> sky<00:02:20.470> similar

here at the spa or over there goes up
into<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.280> air<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:26.420> die<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.080> that's<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.500> yep
