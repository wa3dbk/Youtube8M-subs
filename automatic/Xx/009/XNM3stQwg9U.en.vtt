00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
how big this hatch is compared to my

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.310 
how big this hatch is compared to my
feet<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.649> course<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.030> legs

feet and of course if you go and legs
forward<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.579> rotate<00:00:38.790> 90<00:00:39.360> degrees<00:00:39.390> in

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
forward you have to rotate 90 degrees in

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
forward you have to rotate 90 degrees in
order<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.070> where<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.550> feet

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
order to get them in to where your feet

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
order to get them in to where your feet
can<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.210> get<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.719> rest<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> yet<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.290> come

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
can actually get the rest of yet to come

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.340 
can actually get the rest of yet to come
down<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.420> haven't<00:00:45.690> yet<00:00:45.899> figured<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
down in so I haven't yet figured out a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.000 
down in so I haven't yet figured out a
proper<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> doing<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.910> bear<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.450> me

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.990 

you<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.219> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.550> getting<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you will not want to be getting out of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.240 
you will not want to be getting out of
here<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> tank<00:00:57.449> was<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.690> fire

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.290 

um

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:24.719 

you

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.889 

now<00:01:25.729> my<00:01:25.850> leghul<00:01:26.149> on<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.360> wrong<00:01:26.479> side<00:01:26.689> of<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
now my leghul on the wrong side of the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.700 
now my leghul on the wrong side of the
gearbox<00:01:28.810> after<00:01:29.810> having<00:01:30.079> finally<00:01:30.320> managed<00:01:30.679> to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
gearbox after having finally managed to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.380 
gearbox after having finally managed to
get<00:01:31.159> myself<00:01:31.310> into<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.759> position<00:01:31.850> where<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:32.240> can

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
get myself into a position where I can

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.179 
get myself into a position where I can
reach<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.780> controls<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:33.560> actually<00:01:33.979> pretty

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
reach the controls it's actually pretty

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.300 
reach the controls it's actually pretty
simple<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.759> easily<00:01:35.360> laid<00:01:35.539> out<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:37.100> can't

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
simple and easily laid out you can't

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.069 
simple and easily laid out you can't
argue<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.060> driver<00:01:38.390> does<00:01:38.600> not<00:01:38.630> have<00:01:38.929> good

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
argue that the driver does not have good

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.679 
argue that the driver does not have good
visibility<00:01:39.259> between<00:01:40.219> that<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:41.390> two

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
visibility between that and the two

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.080 
visibility between that and the two
periscopes<00:01:42.409> which<00:01:42.799> are<00:01:42.950> rotatable<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.670> can

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
periscopes which are rotatable and can

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.630 
periscopes which are rotatable and can
be<00:01:44.179> moved<00:01:44.420> up<00:01:44.719> and<00:01:45.439> down<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.799> elevation<00:01:45.950> if<00:01:46.520> you

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
be moved up and down in elevation if you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.120 
be moved up and down in elevation if you
actually<00:01:46.789> got<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.179> pretty<00:01:47.539> good<00:01:47.750> view<00:01:48.130> only

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
actually got a pretty good view only

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.370 
actually got a pretty good view only
catch<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.459> course<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.849> it's<00:01:50.659> got<00:01:50.899> metal<00:01:51.110> on<00:01:51.349> top

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
catch of course is it's got metal on top

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.990 
catch of course is it's got metal on top
of<00:01:51.709> them<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.130> can't<00:01:52.340> stick<00:01:52.549> its<00:01:52.700> head<00:01:52.849> at

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
of them so we can't stick its head at

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.449 
of them so we can't stick its head at
the<00:01:53.119> top<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.630> only<00:01:53.659> way<00:01:53.959> in<00:01:54.170> or<00:01:54.289> out<00:01:54.459> is

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
the top the only way in or out is

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.839 
the top the only way in or out is
through<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.880> very<00:01:56.240> narrow<00:01:56.539> compartment

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
through that very narrow compartment

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.699 
through that very narrow compartment
most<00:01:58.849> of<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.149> instruments<00:01:59.750> are<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.380> left

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
most of the instruments are to the left

ammunition<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.820> don't<00:04:53.000> know<00:04:53.090> if<00:04:53.150> they<00:04:53.240> ever

ammunition I don't know if they ever

ammunition I don't know if they ever
thought<00:04:53.960> about<00:04:54.110> putting<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.560> into<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.860> base

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
thought about putting it into the base

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.700 
thought about putting it into the base
it<00:04:55.220> but<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.370> guess<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.669> was<00:04:55.790> possible<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:57.500> last

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
it but I guess it was possible the last

it but I guess it was possible the last
thing<00:04:57.919> I'll<00:04:58.070> note<00:04:58.310> in<00:04:58.640> here<00:04:58.820> in<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.000> driver's

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
thing I'll note in here in the driver's

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.180 
thing I'll note in here in the driver's
compartment<00:04:59.390> to<00:05:00.020> my<00:05:00.110> front<00:05:00.410> left<00:05:00.680> just<00:05:01.040> that<00:05:01.160> a

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
compartment to my front left just that a

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.670 
compartment to my front left just that a
camera<00:05:01.580> shot<00:05:01.850> is<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.419> access<00:05:03.020> for<00:05:03.530> the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
camera shot is the access for the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.560 
camera shot is the access for the
lubrication<00:05:04.250> systems<00:05:04.760> that<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:05.030> mentioned

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
lubrication systems that I mentioned

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.909 
lubrication systems that I mentioned
from<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.250> suspension<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.610> you'll<00:05:08.330> also<00:05:08.479> note

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
from the suspension and you'll also note

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.860 
from the suspension and you'll also note
possibly<00:05:09.919> that<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.400> interior<00:05:11.180> this<00:05:11.390> vehicle

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
possibly that the interior this vehicle

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.890 
possibly that the interior this vehicle
is<00:05:12.080> narrower<00:05:12.590> than<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.580> exterior<00:05:14.240> would

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
is narrower than the exterior would

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.920 
is narrower than the exterior would
imply<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:15.860> again<00:05:16.340> this<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.669> a<00:05:16.700> fact<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.360> the

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
imply and again this is a fact of the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.620 
imply and again this is a fact of the
Chrissie<00:05:18.680> suspension<00:05:19.310> system<00:05:19.729> taking<00:05:20.540> up

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
Chrissie suspension system taking up

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
the inside crew compartment is just much
