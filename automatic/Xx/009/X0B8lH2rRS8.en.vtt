silicone<00:02:55.550> mat<00:02:55.760> now<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.959> took<00:02:57.080> too<00:02:57.500> long<00:02:57.530> to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
silicone mat now I took too long to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
had a couple of the things I needed to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.130 
had a couple of the things I needed to
do<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.160> between<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.790> when<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.420> finally<00:03:02.720> took<00:03:02.990> a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
do in between and when I finally took a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.470 
do in between and when I finally took a
spoonful<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.740> frosting<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.430> try<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.670> pour

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
it onto the cake cubes it was way too

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.730 
it onto the cake cubes it was way too
thick<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.540> had<00:03:08.690> started<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.110> hardening<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.560> does

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
thick it had started a hardening it does

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.370 
thick it had started a hardening it does
it<00:03:09.860> very<00:03:10.070> quickly<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.840> solve<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.260> problem

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
it very quickly so to solve that problem

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.560 
it very quickly so to solve that problem
I<00:03:12.830> took<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.160> container<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.820> icing<00:03:14.209> put<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.510> in

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
I took the container of icing put it in

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.690 
I took the container of icing put it in
the<00:03:14.630> microwave<00:03:15.080> for<00:03:15.110> about<00:03:15.410> 40<00:03:16.010> seconds<00:03:16.430> or<00:03:16.520> so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
the microwave for about 40 seconds or so

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.330 
the microwave for about 40 seconds or so
until<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.660> heated<00:03:17.870> up<00:03:18.020> again<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.560> then<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.100> put

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
until it heated up again and then I put

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.850 
until it heated up again and then I put
it<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.520> a<00:03:19.580> pastry<00:03:19.730> bag<00:03:19.910> with<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.470> large<00:03:21.470> round

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
it in a pastry bag with a large round

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.250 
it in a pastry bag with a large round
tip<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.459> as<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.910> can<00:03:23.060> see<00:03:23.300> it<00:03:23.540> flowed<00:03:23.900> quite

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
tip and as you can see it flowed quite

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.890 
tip and as you can see it flowed quite
nicely<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.340> secret<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.000> this<00:03:26.300> poured

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
nicely so the secret to this poured

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.380 
nicely so the secret to this poured
fondant<00:03:27.140> icing<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.890> once<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.760> make<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.180> you

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
fondant icing is once you make it you

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.600 
fondant icing is once you make it you
have<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.810> keep<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.170> warm<00:03:30.200> because<00:03:30.830> that's<00:03:31.160> when

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
have to keep it warm because that's when

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.240 
have to keep it warm because that's when
it<00:03:31.700> flows<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.390> best<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:34.070> kept

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
it flows the best and I just kept

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.160 
it flows the best and I just kept
putting<00:03:34.400> mine<00:03:34.700> back<00:03:34.940> in<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.180> microwave<00:03:35.690> if<00:03:35.900> it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
putting mine back in the microwave if it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.030 
putting mine back in the microwave if it
started<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.980> thicken<00:03:37.760> up<00:03:38.769> now<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.830> other

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
started to thicken up now the other

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
even if it seems like a lot because you

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.710 
even if it seems like a lot because you
end<00:03:57.230> up<00:03:57.470> using<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.280> lot<00:03:58.430> when<00:03:59.330> you're<00:03:59.480> coding

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
end up using a lot when you're coding

end up using a lot when you're coding
these<00:03:59.989> little<00:04:00.200> cakes<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.799> use<00:04:01.010> more<00:04:01.310> than<00:04:01.459> you

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
these little cakes you use more than you

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.030 
these little cakes you use more than you
think<00:04:01.700> you're<00:04:01.850> going<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.060> use<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.590> realized

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
think you're going to use so I realized

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.800 
think you're going to use so I realized
I<00:04:04.280> ran<00:04:04.549> out<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.730> frosting<00:04:05.000> about<00:04:05.570> halfway

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
I ran out of frosting about halfway

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.680 
I ran out of frosting about halfway
through<00:04:05.989> my<00:04:06.320> little<00:04:06.470> cakes<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.299> of<00:04:08.299> course

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
through my little cakes and of course

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.360 
through my little cakes and of course
most<00:04:08.959> of<00:04:09.049> its<00:04:09.200> is<00:04:09.350> fallen<00:04:09.920> on<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.190> that

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
most of its is fallen on to that

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.970 
most of its is fallen on to that
silicone<00:04:10.880> mat<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:11.630> what<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.810> did<00:04:12.140> was<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:12.950> just

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
silicone mat so what I did was I just

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.800 
silicone mat so what I did was I just
took<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.400> silicone<00:04:13.820> mat<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.150> scraped<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.660> back

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
took the silicone mat I scraped it back

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.590 
took the silicone mat I scraped it back
into<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.260> bowl<00:04:15.410> heated<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.489> up<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:16.850> then

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
into the bowl heated it up and then

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.890 
into the bowl heated it up and then
continue<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.200> coat<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> cakes<00:04:19.630> now<00:04:20.630> another

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
continue to coat the cakes now another

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.659 
continue to coat the cakes now another
thing<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.229> found<00:04:21.530> is<00:04:21.739> after<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.130> coated<00:04:22.430> them

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
thing I found is after I coated them

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.659 
thing I found is after I coated them
once<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:24.080> coating<00:04:24.320> is<00:04:24.620> pretty<00:04:24.950> but<00:04:25.310> it's<00:04:25.460> also

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
once the coating is pretty but it's also

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.150 
once the coating is pretty but it's also
very<00:04:25.820> sheer<00:04:26.510> like<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.440> can<00:04:27.590> see<00:04:27.800> through<00:04:28.070> it

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
very sheer like you can see through it

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.060 
very sheer like you can see through it
you<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.310> see<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.880> middle<00:04:29.510> layer<00:04:29.690> so<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.440> tried

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
you can see that middle layer so I tried

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.290 
you can see that middle layer so I tried
coating<00:04:31.490> them<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.729> second<00:04:32.150> time<00:04:33.130> just<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:35.030> try

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
coating them a second time just to try

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.150 
coating them a second time just to try
to<00:04:35.360> make<00:04:35.900> the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
to make the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.740 
to make the
at<00:04:36.190> coding<00:04:36.670> a<00:04:36.760> little<00:04:36.940> thicker<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.660> you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
at coding a little thicker so that you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.130 
at coding a little thicker so that you
couldn't<00:04:37.990> see<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.500> layers<00:04:38.710> on<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.100> sides<00:04:39.370> and

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
couldn't see the layers on the sides and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.280 
couldn't see the layers on the sides and
I<00:04:41.140> didn't<00:04:41.380> have<00:04:41.590> enough<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.790> icing<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:44.110> be

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
I didn't have enough of the icing to be

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.310 
I didn't have enough of the icing to be
able<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.650> go<00:04:44.950> over<00:04:44.980> each<00:04:45.400> cake<00:04:45.700> twice<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:46.990> in

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
able to go over each cake twice so in

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.650 
able to go over each cake twice so in
the<00:04:47.440> final<00:04:47.830> photos<00:04:48.190> you'll<00:04:48.430> see<00:04:48.670> some<00:04:49.000> that

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
the final photos you'll see some that

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.300 
the final photos you'll see some that
have<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.140> double<00:04:50.410> coating<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:50.890> some<00:04:51.130> that

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
have the double coating and some that

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.530 
have the double coating and some that
don't<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.670> kind<00:04:51.850> of<00:04:51.910> gives<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.150> an<00:04:52.270> idea<00:04:52.360> what

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
don't it kind of gives you an idea what

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.380 
don't it kind of gives you an idea what
it<00:04:52.810> looks<00:04:53.020> like<00:04:53.670> so<00:04:54.670> once<00:04:54.850> your<00:04:55.000> little<00:04:55.120> cakes

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
it looks like so once your little cakes

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.320 
it looks like so once your little cakes
are<00:04:55.570> all<00:04:55.690> coated<00:04:55.960> just<00:04:56.440> let<00:04:56.590> them<00:04:56.740> sit<00:04:56.980> there

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
are all coated just let them sit there

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.850 
are all coated just let them sit there
for<00:04:58.330> about<00:04:58.420> an<00:04:58.660> hour<00:04:58.720> or<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.560> they<00:04:59.710> will

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
for about an hour or so and they will

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.830 
for about an hour or so and they will
dry<00:05:00.370> nicely<00:05:00.790> dry<00:05:01.150> enough<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.600> can<00:05:01.690> pick

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
dry nicely dry enough so you can pick

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.450 
dry nicely dry enough so you can pick
them<00:05:01.960> up<00:05:02.080> without<00:05:02.380> smudging<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:03.010> frosting

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
them up without smudging the frosting

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.420 
them up without smudging the frosting
and<00:05:03.640> then<00:05:04.480> decorate<00:05:04.690> them<00:05:05.020> as<00:05:05.200> desired<00:05:05.680> now

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430

flowers<00:05:24.250> are<00:05:24.520> simple<00:05:25.360> drop<00:05:25.870> flowers<00:05:26.230> using<00:05:26.800> a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
flowers are simple drop flowers using a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.240 
flowers are simple drop flowers using a
1m<00:05:27.550> tip<00:05:27.760> which<00:05:27.970> is<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.120> star<00:05:28.510> tip<00:05:28.860> so<00:05:29.860> basically

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
1m tip which is a star tip so basically

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.460 
1m tip which is a star tip so basically
you<00:05:30.550> take<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:31.060> piping<00:05:31.570> bag<00:05:31.720> hold<00:05:32.050> at<00:05:32.170> 90

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
you take the piping bag hold at 90

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.410 
you take the piping bag hold at 90
degrees<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:32.980> cake<00:05:33.310> almost<00:05:33.580> touching<00:05:34.330> the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
degrees to the cake almost touching the

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.810 
degrees to the cake almost touching the
cake<00:05:34.650> squeeze<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:35.920> as<00:05:36.010> you're<00:05:36.220> squeezing

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
cake squeeze and as you're squeezing

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.110 
cake squeeze and as you're squeezing
give<00:05:37.090> it<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.300> 90<00:05:37.690> degree<00:05:37.960> turn<00:05:38.200> with<00:05:38.230> your<00:05:38.620> wrist

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
give it a 90 degree turn with your wrist

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.240 
give it a 90 degree turn with your wrist
release<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.330> pressure<00:05:40.540> and<00:05:40.750> lift<00:05:41.110> off<00:05:41.440> so

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
release the pressure and lift off so

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.300 
release the pressure and lift off so
squeeze<00:05:42.760> turn<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.600> lift<00:05:43.870> super<00:05:44.470> simple<00:05:44.980> to<00:05:45.130> do

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
squeeze turn and lift super simple to do

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.430 
squeeze turn and lift super simple to do
just<00:05:45.670> takes<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:46.030> little<00:05:46.150> bit<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.420> practice<00:05:46.630> so

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
just takes a little bit of practice so

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.140 
just takes a little bit of practice so
prepare<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:47.830> piping<00:05:48.220> bag<00:05:48.250> of<00:05:48.580> your<00:05:48.700> frosting

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
prepare a piping bag of your frosting

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.510 
prepare a piping bag of your frosting
and<00:05:49.270> just<00:05:49.450> practice<00:05:49.900> on<00:05:50.080> a<00:05:50.200> cutting<00:05:50.920> board<00:05:51.190> or

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
and just practice on a cutting board or

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.159 
and just practice on a cutting board or
a<00:05:51.790> piece<00:05:52.060> of<00:05:52.210> waxed<00:05:52.510> paper<00:05:52.570> or<00:05:52.810> something

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
a piece of waxed paper or something

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.870 
a piece of waxed paper or something
until<00:05:53.380> you<00:05:53.470> get<00:05:53.650> them<00:05:53.830> right<00:05:54.040> they're<00:05:54.610> very

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
until you get them right they're very

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.290 
until you get them right they're very
easy<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.540> make<00:05:55.890> then<00:05:56.890> I<00:05:57.130> took<00:05:57.250> some<00:05:57.790> yellow

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
easy to make then I took some yellow

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.120 
easy to make then I took some yellow
frosting<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.320> just<00:05:59.530> put<00:05:59.680> a<00:05:59.710> little<00:05:59.890> dollop

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
frosting and I just put a little dollop

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.610 
frosting and I just put a little dollop
of<00:06:00.460> it<00:06:00.610> in<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:00.910> center<00:06:01.300> and<00:06:01.480> then<00:06:02.080> some<00:06:02.440> green

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
of it in the center and then some green

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.120 
of it in the center and then some green
frosting<00:06:03.160> with<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.669> leaf<00:06:04.030> tip<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.740> made<00:06:05.740> some

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
frosting with a leaf tip and made some

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.510 
frosting with a leaf tip and made some
little<00:06:06.280> leaves<00:06:09.419> now<00:06:10.419> these<00:06:10.570> are<00:06:10.720> very<00:06:10.930> simple

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
little leaves now these are very simple

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.270 
little leaves now these are very simple
but<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:12.580> think<00:06:12.669> they're<00:06:13.000> also<00:06:13.120> very<00:06:13.419> cute<00:06:13.750> and

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
but I think they're also very cute and

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.460 
but I think they're also very cute and
there<00:06:15.280> they<00:06:15.460> all<00:06:15.640> are<00:06:15.669> on<00:06:16.300> a<00:06:16.330> plate<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:16.960> thought

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
there they all are on a plate I thought

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.320 
there they all are on a plate I thought
they<00:06:17.680> look<00:06:17.890> so<00:06:18.160> nice<00:06:18.370> all<00:06:18.669> together<00:06:19.000> on<00:06:19.300> a

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
they look so nice all together on a

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.450 
they look so nice all together on a
little<00:06:19.570> paper<00:06:19.810> doily<00:06:20.050> very<00:06:20.800> fancy<00:06:21.430> looking

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
little paper doily very fancy looking

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.600 
little paper doily very fancy looking
now<00:06:22.360> here's<00:06:22.660> an<00:06:22.840> example<00:06:23.140> of<00:06:23.470> the<00:06:23.860> two<00:06:24.100> kinds

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
now here's an example of the two kinds

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.970 
now here's an example of the two kinds
of<00:06:24.669> cakes<00:06:24.910> in<00:06:25.240> the<00:06:25.900> foreground<00:06:26.350> on<00:06:26.620> the<00:06:26.770> right

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
of cakes in the foreground on the right

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.409 
of cakes in the foreground on the right
you<00:06:27.160> have<00:06:27.190> one<00:06:27.310> that's<00:06:27.610> been<00:06:27.820> double<00:06:28.090> coated

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
you have one that's been double coated

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.240 
you have one that's been double coated
and<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.810> one<00:06:28.990> on<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.230> left<00:06:29.440> has<00:06:29.710> a<00:06:29.740> single

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
and the one on the left has a single

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.370 
and the one on the left has a single
coat<00:06:30.460> so<00:06:31.060> you<00:06:31.120> can<00:06:31.300> see<00:06:31.510> how<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:31.780> can<00:06:32.110> see<00:06:32.260> the

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
coat so you can see how you can see the

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.260 
coat so you can see how you can see the
layers<00:06:32.590> come<00:06:32.980> showing<00:06:33.310> through<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.730> was

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
layers come showing through I was

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.670 
layers come showing through I was
actually<00:06:34.419> very<00:06:34.720> happy<00:06:34.990> with<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.410> way<00:06:35.530> these

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
actually very happy with the way these

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.260 
actually very happy with the way these
turned<00:06:35.980> out<00:06:36.130> considering<00:06:36.640> it<00:06:36.730> was<00:06:36.790> my<00:06:36.970> first

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
turned out considering it was my first

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.020 
turned out considering it was my first
try<00:06:37.600> at<00:06:37.840> Pitt<00:06:38.350> seafood<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:39.010> my<00:06:39.220> first<00:06:39.520> try<00:06:39.790> at

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
try at Pitt seafood and my first try at

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.350 
try at Pitt seafood and my first try at
using<00:06:40.300> poured<00:06:41.110> fondant<00:06:41.500> icing<00:06:41.860> and<00:06:42.400> I'm<00:06:43.180> sure

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
using poured fondant icing and I'm sure

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.340 
using poured fondant icing and I'm sure
the<00:06:43.510> next<00:06:43.720> time<00:06:43.840> I<00:06:43.930> make<00:06:44.020> them<00:06:44.200> they'll

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
the next time I make them they'll

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.230 
the next time I make them they'll
probably<00:06:44.530> be<00:06:44.860> a<00:06:44.890> lot<00:06:45.250> prettier<00:06:45.520> and<00:06:45.970> a<00:06:46.030> lot

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
probably be a lot prettier and a lot
