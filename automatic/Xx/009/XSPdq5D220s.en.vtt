00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
shouldn't take a space

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.570 
shouldn't take a space
put<00:03:03.810> Panza<00:03:04.140> flue<00:03:04.320> black<00:03:04.580> high-temperature

put Panza flue black high-temperature

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.110 
put Panza flue black high-temperature
paint<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.350> made<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.560> little<00:03:07.770> adapter<00:03:08.760> up

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
paint I made that little adapter up

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.300 
paint I made that little adapter up
there<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.980> flue<00:03:11.160> goes

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
there this is so so the flue goes

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940 
there this is so so the flue goes
through<00:03:11.580> sealing<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:12.870> side<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.560> our

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
through sealing on one side of it is our

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.790 
through sealing on one side of it is our
rafter<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.270> other<00:03:15.420> side<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.320> ridge<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.710> a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
rafter the other side is the ridge of a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.890 
rafter the other side is the ridge of a
standing<00:03:17.160> seam<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.700> we<00:03:18.360> didn't<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> lot<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
standing seam so we didn't have a lot of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.860 
standing seam so we didn't have a lot of
room<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.140> put<00:03:19.410> anything<00:03:19.590> else<00:03:19.740> up<00:03:19.950> there<00:03:20.870> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
room to put anything else up there the

sure good stuff all right our glass is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.760 
sure good stuff all right our glass is
getting<00:03:35.910> pretty<00:03:36.510> clear<00:03:36.840> now<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.560> would

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
getting pretty clear now is that would

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.220 
getting pretty clear now is that would
spur<00:03:37.980> enough<00:03:38.510> it's<00:03:39.510> time<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.780> add<00:03:39.870> more<00:03:40.050> fuel

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
spur enough it's time to add more fuel

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.960 
spur enough it's time to add more fuel
we're<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.340> throw<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.580> some<00:03:41.640> when<00:03:41.850> it's

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
we're going to throw in some when it's

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.309 
we're going to throw in some when it's
on

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.349 

that's<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:51.890> just<00:03:51.980> fill<00:03:52.159> her<00:03:52.219> up<00:03:55.269> once<00:03:56.269> the

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
that's it we just fill her up once the

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.940 
that's it we just fill her up once the
glass<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.719> clear<00:03:56.900> again<00:03:56.989> we'll<00:03:57.500> damp<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.799> down

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
glass is clear again we'll damp it down

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.750 
glass is clear again we'll damp it down
and<00:03:58.670> we'll<00:03:58.849> burn<00:03:59.000> for<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.239> couple<00:03:59.480> hours<00:04:00.760> okay

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
and we'll burn for a couple hours okay

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.459 
and we'll burn for a couple hours okay
so<00:04:02.090> all<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.450> suttas<00:04:02.810> burned<00:04:03.019> off<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.409> the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
so all the suttas burned off of the

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.289 
so all the suttas burned off of the
window<00:04:03.709> now<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:03.859> it's<00:04:04.069> completely<00:04:04.459> clear<00:04:04.670> so

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
window now and it's completely clear so

window now and it's completely clear so
we<00:04:05.420> are<00:04:05.510> ready<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.840> turn<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.170> down<00:04:06.290> we<00:04:06.950> usually

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
we are ready to turn it down we usually

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.860 
we are ready to turn it down we usually
put<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.489> at<00:04:07.579> about<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.819> quarter<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.659> can<00:04:08.780> go

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
put it at about a quarter but you can go

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.270 
put it at about a quarter but you can go
all<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.079> way<00:04:09.260> down<00:04:09.439> actually<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:10.010> can<00:04:10.159> make

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
all the way down actually you can make

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.300 
all the way down actually you can make
it<00:04:10.400> go<00:04:10.430> all<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.909> way<00:04:10.939> down<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.959> close<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:13.129> can

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
it go all the way down to close you can

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.429 
it go all the way down to close you can
see<00:04:13.340> up<00:04:13.730> there<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.689> the<00:04:14.750> top<00:04:14.989> half<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.349> the

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
see up there and the top half of the

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.409 
see up there and the top half of the
stove<00:04:15.709> that's<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.579> secondary<00:04:17.000> combustion

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
stove that's the secondary combustion

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.420 
stove that's the secondary combustion
going<00:04:17.810> on<00:04:17.900> it's<00:04:18.049> that<00:04:18.109> crazy<00:04:18.410> swirly<00:04:19.009> flame<00:04:19.250> up

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
going on it's that crazy swirly flame up

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.900 
going on it's that crazy swirly flame up
there<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:20.470> there's<00:04:21.470> little<00:04:22.280> oxygen<00:04:22.520> tubes

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
there and there's little oxygen tubes

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.909 
there and there's little oxygen tubes
that<00:04:23.090> take<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.570> up<00:04:23.780> there<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.560> there's<00:04:24.860> a

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
that take it up there and there's a

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.620 
that take it up there and there's a
whole<00:04:24.949> secondary<00:04:25.639> combustion<00:04:26.000> happening<00:04:26.509> up

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
whole secondary combustion happening up

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.029 
whole secondary combustion happening up
here<00:04:26.840> in<00:04:26.930> this<00:04:26.990> chamber<00:04:27.199> which<00:04:27.530> means<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:27.949> it

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
here in this chamber which means that it

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.490 
here in this chamber which means that it
burns<00:04:28.250> up<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.699> lot<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.509> nasty<00:04:29.900> soot<00:04:30.380> and

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
burns up a lot of the nasty soot and

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.170 
burns up a lot of the nasty soot and
smoke<00:04:30.710> before<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:31.099> guess<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.430> chimney<00:04:31.729> which

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
smoke before I guess the chimney which

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.520 
smoke before I guess the chimney which
is<00:04:32.300> why<00:04:32.419> it's<00:04:32.539> able<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.810> burn<00:04:33.020> really<00:04:33.229> clean

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
is why it's able to burn really clean

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.480 
is why it's able to burn really clean
and<00:04:33.800> almost<00:04:34.190> smokeless<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.870> I'm<00:04:35.930> pretty<00:04:36.139> sure

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
and almost smokeless so I'm pretty sure

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.870 
and almost smokeless so I'm pretty sure
EPA<00:04:37.490> certification<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.479> 7.5<00:04:39.440> or<00:04:39.979> less<00:04:40.610> and

EPA certification is 7.5 or less and

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.580 
EPA certification is 7.5 or less and
this<00:04:40.970> one<00:04:41.120> has<00:04:41.240> about<00:04:41.330> 3.5<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.169> it's<00:04:42.289> super

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
this one has about 3.5 so it's super

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.110 
this one has about 3.5 so it's super
clean<00:04:42.770> burning<00:04:43.099> really<00:04:43.639> nice<00:04:43.820> small

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
clean burning really nice small

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.540 
clean burning really nice small
