 you can choose a beep 3 24 bits only 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.630
 as it is a radar of 100 kilometers 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.320
 per hour 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.269
 we'll select the radar of 100 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.730
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.420
 the radar is not the warning of 100 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.420
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.430
 then made that selection that you 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.019

 this is the sound you want to select 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.320
 Often only give a beep you 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.240
 will neither make nor choose to select 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.390
 only warn if the pt is in the path 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.930

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.930
 procedure for all countries is that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.680
 in this case they have not given notices of 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.100
