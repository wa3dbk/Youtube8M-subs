00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.759 
that's not I hope that's not the move I
think<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.540> hopefully<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.200> get<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.590> like

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
think it is hopefully I get it it like

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.330
