2000s<00:02:55.920> forward<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:56.519> Mazda<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.030> an<00:02:57.150> automatic

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
2000s forward or Mazda with an automatic

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.009 
2000s forward or Mazda with an automatic
transmission<00:02:57.860> knows<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.019> weak

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
transmission knows that that is the weak

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.199 
transmission knows that that is the weak
point<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.069> my<00:03:02.549> transmission<00:03:03.060> is

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
point and so my transmission is

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.970 
point and so my transmission is
basically<00:03:03.569> going<00:03:03.900> out<00:03:04.019> like<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.380> have<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
basically going out like I have a

basically going out like I have a
problem<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.639> torque<00:03:05.880> converter<00:03:05.970> lockup

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
problem with the torque converter lockup

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.900 
problem with the torque converter lockup
solenoid<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.590> slipping<00:03:08.190> clutch<00:03:08.370> man<00:03:08.579> so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
solenoid and a slipping clutch man so

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.240 
solenoid and a slipping clutch man so
pretty<00:03:09.750> much<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.560> would<00:03:10.709> be<00:03:10.829> an<00:03:11.100> incredible

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
pretty much it would be an incredible

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.039 
pretty much it would be an incredible
amount<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.700> money<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.060> fix<00:03:12.239> all<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.480> unless

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
amount of money to fix all that unless

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.509 
amount of money to fix all that unless
we<00:03:13.230> did<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> all<00:03:13.620> ourselves<00:03:13.650> which<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.280> can't

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
we did it all ourselves which we can't

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.280 
we did it all ourselves which we can't
do<00:03:14.730> because<00:03:15.049> that<00:03:16.049> means<00:03:16.970> complete

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
do because that means complete

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.539 
do because that means complete
