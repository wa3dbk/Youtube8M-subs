all the way through at this point it's

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.539 
all the way through at this point it's
good<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.290> check<00:02:33.499> that<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.069> can<00:02:34.219> still<00:02:34.430> move

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549

the core freely in and out of the neck
of<00:02:37.219> the<00:02:37.310> splice<00:02:40.510> then<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.599> take<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.870> cover

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
of the splice then we take the cover

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.770 
of the splice then we take the cover
again<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:43.670> load<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.969> fit<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.359> time<00:02:44.569> using

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
again we load the fit this time using

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.759 
again we load the fit this time using

the bigger feed and we're going to go in

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:56.740 
the bigger feed and we're going to go in
that's<00:02:49.459> our<00:02:49.669> mark<00:02:49.939> and<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:56.060> need<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.329> cover<00:02:56.510> a

once<00:03:13.330> you've<00:03:13.480> covered<00:03:13.720> one<00:03:13.959> feed<00:03:14.170> length<00:03:14.380> you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
once you've covered one feed length you

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.050 
once you've covered one feed length you
can<00:03:14.650> come<00:03:14.860> out<00:03:15.300> all<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.330> way<00:03:16.569> through<00:03:18.060> we're

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
can come out all the way through we're

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.699 
can come out all the way through we're
going<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.239> take<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.720> core<00:03:20.170> down<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.590> make

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
going to take for the core down to make

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.410 
going to take for the core down to make
the<00:03:20.830> splice<00:03:21.099> neater<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.510> add<00:03:22.599> strength<00:03:23.310> so

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the splice neater and to add strength so

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.140 
the splice neater and to add strength so
pull<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.540> put<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.110> slack<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.010> take<00:03:27.880> out

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
pull it put up the slack and take out

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.840 
pull it put up the slack and take out
some<00:03:29.910> stitches<00:03:30.910> from<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.780> cover<00:03:32.850> slowly

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
some stitches from the cover slowly

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.880 
some stitches from the cover slowly
working<00:03:34.150> down<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.989> rope<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:40.180> we've<00:03:40.300> done<00:03:40.480> that

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
working down the rope so we've done that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:52.600 
working down the rope so we've done that
and<00:03:41.890> cut<00:03:42.160> these<00:03:42.310> offenses

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.110 

to<00:03:53.210> tell<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.600> end<00:03:57.460> now<00:03:58.460> we<00:03:58.520> can<00:03:58.730> pull<00:03:58.940> the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
to tell you the end now we can pull the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.870 
to tell you the end now we can pull the
cover<00:03:59.780> back<00:03:59.990> down<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.410> bury<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.670> core

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
cover back down to bury the the core

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.000 
cover back down to bury the the core
back<00:04:02.060> down<00:04:02.210> to<00:04:02.360> bury<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.690> cover<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.680> we<00:04:03.860> can

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
back down to bury the cover and we can

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.770 
back down to bury the cover and we can
take<00:04:04.130> this<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.610> pull<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.120> making<00:04:05.510> sure<00:04:05.540> we

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
take this and pull this making sure we

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:15.440 
take this and pull this making sure we
don't<00:04:05.900> twist<00:04:06.460> the<00:04:07.460> cores<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.910> put<00:04:08.090> in

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.840 

so<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.290> smoothed<00:04:16.620> out<00:04:16.889> all<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.370> slack<00:04:17.639> in

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
so you smoothed out all the slack in

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.720 
so you smoothed out all the slack in
there<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.840> splice<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.500> then<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.250> what's

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
there in the splice and then the what's

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.240 
there in the splice and then the what's
going<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:22.380> finish<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:22.830> all

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
going to be the I and to finish this all

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.470 
going to be the I and to finish this all
we<00:04:23.400> need<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.610> do<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.760> pull<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.000> slack<00:04:24.240> back

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
we need to do is pull the slack back

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.360 
we need to do is pull the slack back
over<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.050> pull<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.500> core<00:04:25.740> back<00:04:25.889> inside<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
over and pull the core back inside the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.879 
over and pull the core back inside the
rope<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.600> start<00:04:27.960> by<00:04:28.139> just<00:04:28.169> milking<00:04:28.770> up

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
rope so you start by just milking up

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:41.659 
rope so you start by just milking up
towards<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:39.860> keep<00:04:40.860> making<00:04:41.070> up<00:04:41.310> milking<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
towards the I keep making up milking the

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:53.570 
towards the I keep making up milking the
slack<00:04:41.910> up<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:51.110> finish<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.889> need<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.160> hold<00:04:53.370> the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
slack up and finish you need to hold the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.360 
slack up and finish you need to hold the
the<00:04:54.419> eye<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.260> splice<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.800> just<00:04:56.100> melt<00:04:56.280> the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
the eye of the splice and just melt the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:05.500 
the eye of the splice and just melt the
slack<00:04:56.580> up<00:04:56.760> over<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:58.160> core<00:04:59.479> until<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.600> pops<00:05:00.810> in

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.960 

there<00:05:06.510> we<00:05:06.600> have<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:06.840> one<00:05:07.320> finish<00:05:07.620> splice<00:05:07.970> final

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
there we have it one finish splice final

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.850 
there we have it one finish splice final
trim<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.419> just<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.780> pull<00:05:09.990> this<00:05:10.139> slack<00:05:10.590> up<00:05:10.770> a

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
trim is just to pull this slack up a

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:19.510 
trim is just to pull this slack up a
little<00:05:11.010> bit<00:05:11.250> on<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.639> core<00:05:13.729> cut<00:05:14.729> that<00:05:14.910> free<00:05:15.270> and

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.640 

then<00:05:20.520> pull<00:05:20.700> down<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:21.090> DI<00:05:21.600> so<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:22.169> bury<00:05:22.470> the

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
then pull down the DI so you bury the

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.950 
then pull down the DI so you bury the
tail

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.100 

there<00:05:26.960> we<00:05:27.050> have<00:05:27.200> double<00:05:27.710> rice<00:05:27.860> plus
