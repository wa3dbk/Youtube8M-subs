00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.150
 or the ballad welcome to ma luge style 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.400
 I am bad and this time I come to 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.900
 show you how to show you a small tip of 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.750
 how to fix our hair when 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.669
 we are very very hurry good 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.070
 we usually do not have much 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.070
 time in the morning to go to work or 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.559
 leave the children in general and in these 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.660
 parties if you are a housewife or such 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:32.390
 because you have to make food the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.309
 things the house the kids anyway a lot 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.760
 of things not then I'll show you 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.850
 a very practical way to employ what 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.120
 be hot iron to make curls when 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.219
 water and good use is quite 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.079
 great since it does not require much 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.899
 neither a lot of work for 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.149
 leave enough hair combed now 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.609
 If you want to work a little more 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.260
 It would be another type of technique that 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.269
 I'll be showing you another time 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.839
 good as you see my hair is like this 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.339
 as crazy and good the two tips that 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.740
 I'm going to give you the heat protector 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.350
 remember to always apply before 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.360
 Dry your hair if you already have it dry and 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.710
 you did not put on heat shield 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.450
 then I recommend you what 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.000
 apply again and it will happen again 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.410
 the dryer and then just use what 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.230
 what is the iron if you want it 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.530
 perform or this type of tools what 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.680
 What we are going to do is divide the hair 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:32.870
 ok I'm going to divide it let's fine tune what 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.580
 is the top of the hair good 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.640
 We divide the hair remember that 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.820
 we are without time I already have hot what 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.900
 What is my wish to curl? 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.940
 grab strands let's grab like this 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.450
 quickie let's count to ten one 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.869
 two three four five six seven eight 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.710
 nine ten ready we let's grab another 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.200
 tuft quoted 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.619
 so we can work locks 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.420
 pretty thick I recommend you too 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.119
 that you put the iron of the option more 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.869
 hot I can so that this way 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.970
 grip the shape faster 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.080
 we are doing the action when not 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.180
 we have a long time to fix them 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.260
 but we want to at least be 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.230
 presentable 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.510
 so there 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.519
 let's try to do well this part 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.250
 as I'm telling you, it's the part that's going to go 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.890
 forward then I grab back 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.780
 because now they're going to see the volume that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.980
 it stays pretty nice if it's that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.870
 you have fringe we are 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.690
 in the back we always go to 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.840
 do so because as we are not 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.760
 seeing 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.330
 we do not want to burn you can not 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.060
 let's do it forward in the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.569
 lock I have here 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.569
 to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.860
 apart we're going to work a little bit more 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.770
 as I already tell you how is the part of 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.430
 later on to make it look a lot 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.910
 more hairstyle we do it like that we turn a 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.910
 iron 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.900
 we closed this lock also quoted 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.900
 dead 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.940
 and we let go 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.220
 and we do this process as well as they can 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.010
 see there 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.250
 we divided a while we grabbed what is 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.730
 the fingers we put here 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.280
 We split a little bit, we close again 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.410
 the iron and we do this 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.000
 this is to give you a little bit of 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.000
 volume the back 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.500
 do not worry right now we fix everything 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.910
 to the sides 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.590
 two 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.819
 we turn a little 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.799
 once we have so what we are going to 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.110
 do now is to comb a little the 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.600
 hair like that 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.330
 how can you see there and we're going to work 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.600
 a little bit the front part we are going to 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.859
 and divide the hair for a while bar 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.620
 The fringe 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.430
 let's turn the iron yes quickie 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.430
 and it is already 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.800
 we turn 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.340
 and that 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.070
 I do not know if you can see there is like that 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:47.530
 we give hair fall a little lacquer 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.530
 let's do this movement there is 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.930
 how to bend 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.100
 but believe me it's going to be noticed as the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.130
 hair a little more combed as with more 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.930
 shine with more volume and good for those 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.350
 days I'm super hurried that I do not 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.610
 have a lot of time to form 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.400
 to make a hairstyle to do the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.410
 hair with this type of iron that 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.450
 They are so thick because it helps us 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.820
 well and if you want to do a hairstyle 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.670
 as it already has form and volume the only thing 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:22.020
 what I would do is pick up the hair so 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:25.580
 with a buckle or something like that know the 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.080
 volume that gives the hair the fall 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.120
 where we have a little time then 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.909
 we can fix our hair in a 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.990
 I'll be in 5 minutes if we have 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.189
 tools like this and if you do not have 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.439
 tools like this I have a lot 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.599
 of videos teaching you how to do 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.310
 Also various hairstyles otherwise 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.319
 also wait for more videos that I'll be 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.729

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.259
 type of tool and you can do it 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.090
 in your house with things you have in the 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.500
