00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.050 
better well I think so I'm inspired when
I<00:03:05.450> see<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.620> way<00:03:06.799> in<00:03:07.010> which<00:03:07.190> people<00:03:07.220> use<00:03:07.790> their

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
I see the way in which people use their

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.390 
I see the way in which people use their
phones<00:03:08.359> to<00:03:09.260> make<00:03:09.290> their<00:03:09.560> lives<00:03:09.799> better<00:03:09.950> of

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
phones to make their lives better of

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.430 
phones to make their lives better of
course<00:03:10.640> that's<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:11.000> whole<00:03:11.120> purpose<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.780> any

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
course that's the whole purpose of any

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.619 
course that's the whole purpose of any
technology<00:03:12.859> if<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.849> doesn't<00:03:14.150> make<00:03:14.269> your<00:03:14.390> life

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
technology if it doesn't make your life

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
better it's not good technology you have

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.250 
better it's not good technology you have
a<00:03:16.970> sense<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.299> satisfaction

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
a sense of satisfaction

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.009 
a sense of satisfaction
are<00:03:18.739> you<00:03:19.130> gratified<00:03:19.579> with<00:03:20.209> what<00:03:20.690> your

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
contribution is to a communications well

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.550 
contribution is to a communications well
for<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.030> most<00:03:26.239> part<00:03:26.510> yes<00:03:26.690> but<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.079> think<00:03:27.440> we've

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
for the most part yes but I think we've

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.170 
for the most part yes but I think we've
only<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:27.889> started<00:03:28.099> I<00:03:28.519> think<00:03:28.639> that<00:03:29.000> the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
only just started I think that the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.830 
only just started I think that the
potential<00:03:30.099> for<00:03:31.239> improving<00:03:32.239> people's<00:03:32.599> lives

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
potential for improving people's lives

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.699 
potential for improving people's lives
by<00:03:33.560> connecting<00:03:34.190> them<00:03:34.569> using<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.750> phone<00:03:36.230> using

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
by connecting them using the phone using

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.000 
by connecting them using the phone using
computer<00:03:37.160> technology<00:03:38.260> using<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.410> internet

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
computer technology using the internet

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.220 
computer technology using the internet
the<00:03:40.489> potential<00:03:41.000> is<00:03:41.150> much<00:03:41.540> much<00:03:41.780> greater<00:03:41.840> than

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
the potential is much much greater than

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.370 
the potential is much much greater than
what<00:03:42.560> we've<00:03:42.739> done<00:03:42.769> we<00:03:43.220> were<00:03:43.280> about<00:03:43.549> to<00:03:43.730> have

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
what we've done we were about to have

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.650 
what we've done we were about to have
revolutions<00:03:45.380> that<00:03:45.620> will<00:03:45.829> make<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.819> cell

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
revolutions that will make the cell

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.009 
revolutions that will make the cell
phone<00:03:47.870> revolution<00:03:48.440> fail<00:03:49.040> really<00:03:49.930> did<00:03:50.930> you

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
phone revolution fail really did you

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.009 
phone revolution fail really did you
have<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> lot<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.500> naysayers<00:03:52.370> back<00:03:53.359> in<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.840> day

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019
