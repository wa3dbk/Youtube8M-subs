00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay so what we have here is the hobbies

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.420 
okay so what we have here is the hobbies
on<00:00:03.090> supercup<00:00:03.570> great<00:00:03.959> plain<00:00:04.230> when<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:04.859> first<00:00:05.279> got

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
on supercup great plain when I first got

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.039 
on supercup great plain when I first got
it<00:00:05.580> seven<00:00:05.850> months<00:00:06.029> ago<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.390> put<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> couple

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
it seven months ago I put on a couple

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.379 
it seven months ago I put on a couple
little<00:00:07.500> modifications<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.370> gave<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> bigger

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
little modifications I gave a bigger

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.480 
little modifications I gave a bigger
landing<00:00:09.750> gear<00:00:09.929> because<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.860> smaller<00:00:11.130> landing

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
landing gear because the smaller landing

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.009 
landing gear because the smaller landing
gear<00:00:11.670> or<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.269> mean<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.480> nosed<00:00:12.630> over<00:00:12.750> whenever

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
gear or you mean it nosed over whenever

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.919 
gear or you mean it nosed over whenever
I<00:00:13.200> flew<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.500> fields<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.480> reinforced<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> area

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
I flew in fields I reinforced the area

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.500 
I flew in fields I reinforced the area
where<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> way<00:00:16.260> needs<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.590> keeps<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> lodge<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
where the way needs to keeps a lodge and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.740 
where the way needs to keeps a lodge and
I<00:00:18.510> put<00:00:18.930> little<00:00:19.199> strut<00:00:19.619> mounts<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> bottom

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
I put little strut mounts on the bottom

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.240 
I put little strut mounts on the bottom
see<00:00:21.750> these<00:00:21.930> they're<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.320> paper<00:00:22.470> foot<00:00:22.710> that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
see these they're little paper foot that

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.390 
see these they're little paper foot that
I've<00:00:23.400> bent<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.390> enables<00:00:25.019> me<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.470> put<00:00:26.070> struts

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
I've bent this enables me to put struts

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.429 
I've bent this enables me to put struts
on<00:00:26.519> easily<00:00:27.000> instead<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.510> unscrewing<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
on easily instead of unscrewing them and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.400 
on easily instead of unscrewing them and
screwing<00:00:28.619> them<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.279> used<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:30.349> but<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
screwing them in like I used to but the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
screwing them in like I used to but the
most<00:00:31.980> recent<00:00:32.309> modification<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.239> made<00:00:33.450> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
most recent modification that I made to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.209 
most recent modification that I made to
my<00:00:33.630> plane<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.410> swapped<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.890> all<00:00:35.100> all

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
my plane is that I swapped out all all

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
my plane is that I swapped out all all
the<00:00:35.340> new<00:00:35.460> electric<00:00:35.850> field<00:00:36.180> electronics<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the new electric field electronics and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
the new electric field electronics and
put<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.620> two<00:00:37.739> new<00:00:37.770> ones<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.850> normal<00:00:39.510> ones

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
put in two new ones like normal ones

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.610 
put in two new ones like normal ones
that<00:00:40.110> don't<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> big<00:00:41.070> black<00:00:41.309> box<00:00:42.170> in<00:00:43.170> here

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
that don't have a big black box in here

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.170 
that don't have a big black box in here
you'll<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:45.350> two<00:00:46.350> servos<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
you'll see that I have two servos a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.260 
you'll see that I have two servos a
receiver<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.450> an<00:00:48.899> ESC<00:00:49.820> where<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
receiver and an ESC where I'm in the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.880 
receiver and an ESC where I'm in the
normal<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> set<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> big<00:00:52.140> black<00:00:52.350> box<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
normal one you set a big black box that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.420 
normal one you set a big black box that
was<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> middle<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> here

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
was right in the middle of all and here

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.599 
was right in the middle of all and here
is<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> satellite<00:00:57.539> receiver<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:59.340> set

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
is a satellite receiver which you set

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.160 
is a satellite receiver which you set
the<00:00:59.820> normal<00:01:00.300> receiver<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:02.989> yeah<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the normal receiver and yeah it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
the normal receiver and yeah it's
definitely<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:05.040> big<00:01:05.549> improvement<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
definitely a big improvement over the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810 
definitely a big improvement over the
normal<00:01:06.570> stuff<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.189> want<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.549> can

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
normal stuff because now if I want I can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.960 
normal stuff because now if I want I can
add<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.210> L'Orange<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.810> plane<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
add a L'Orange to my plane so that's a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.050 
add a L'Orange to my plane so that's a
bonus<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:16.340> transmitter<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.430> receiver<00:01:17.729> set

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
bonus and a transmitter and receiver set

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.020 
bonus and a transmitter and receiver set
that<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> use<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:19.200> from<00:01:19.259> exceed<00:01:19.799> RC<00:01:20.159> it's

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that I use are from exceed RC it's

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
that I use are from exceed RC it's
called<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> exceed<00:01:21.750> RC<00:01:22.080> 6<00:01:22.350> channel<00:01:22.710> digital

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
called the exceed RC 6 channel digital

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
called the exceed RC 6 channel digital
proportional<00:01:23.610> radio<00:01:23.820> control<00:01:24.150> system<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
proportional radio control system and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.010 
proportional radio control system and
it's<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.710> 2.4<00:01:26.280> gigahertz<00:01:26.460> technology<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it's got 2.4 gigahertz technology so you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.789 
it's got 2.4 gigahertz technology so you
can<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.560> sure<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:30.140> think<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.619> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
can I'm not sure but I think that you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.499 
can I'm not sure but I think that you
can<00:01:31.979> bind<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.549> any<00:01:32.700> binding<00:01:33.060> slide<00:01:33.299> Lane

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
can bind it to any binding slide Lane

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.609 
can bind it to any binding slide Lane
that's<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.380> there<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:36.659> prefer<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.439> over

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that's out there and I prefer this over

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
that's out there and I prefer this over
spectrum<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.790> money<00:01:38.909> issues<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.540> don't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
spectrum just for money issues I don't

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.719 
spectrum just for money issues I don't
have<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.770> didn't<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> lot<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> money<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
have I didn't have a lot of money when I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.950 
have I didn't have a lot of money when I
was<00:01:41.820> making<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.210> upgrade<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.780> whole

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
was making this upgrade this whole

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.649 
was making this upgrade this whole
upgrade<00:01:43.320> cost<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.520> total<00:01:44.670> 80<00:01:45.090> bucks

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
upgrade cost in total 80 bucks

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
upgrade cost in total 80 bucks
if<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:47.640> spectrum<00:01:48.509> radio<00:01:48.810> alone<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:50.220> probably

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
if a spectrum radio alone would probably

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.260 
if a spectrum radio alone would probably
cost<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.320> 150<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> 250<00:01:52.860> dollars<00:01:53.270> this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
cost you about 150 to 250 dollars this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.440 
cost you about 150 to 250 dollars this
thing<00:01:54.479> right<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:55.560> cost<00:01:55.770> me<00:01:55.950> $60<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
thing right here just cost me $60 the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.149 
thing right here just cost me $60 the
only<00:01:57.630> thing<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
only thing that this has that the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.819 
only thing that this has that the
spectrum<00:01:59.790> doesn't<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.290> ability<00:02:01.380> to

plane personally I don't think I'm going

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.380 
plane personally I don't think I'm going
to<00:02:11.849> have<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.209> many<00:02:12.480> planes<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.110> I'm<00:02:13.200> going

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
to have that many planes that I'm going

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.520 
to have that many planes that I'm going
need<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.600> remember<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.960> settings<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.380> them

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
need to remember the settings on them

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.220 
need to remember the settings on them
and<00:02:15.210> just<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.420> couple<00:02:16.600> minutes<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:17.020> tweaking

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
and just a couple minutes of tweaking

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.590 
and just a couple minutes of tweaking
every<00:02:17.890> time<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.220> switch<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.940> really<00:02:19.480> not

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
every time you switch it is really not

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.190 
every time you switch it is really not
that<00:02:19.660> much<00:02:19.990> as<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:21.040> me<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.870> yeah<00:02:23.020> this

and<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.840> system<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.700> ESD<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.180> I

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and the system and then the ESD that I

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.530 
and the system and then the ESD that I
got<00:02:37.420> was<00:02:37.810> from<00:02:38.489> hobby<00:02:39.489> City<00:02:39.850> they're<00:02:40.330> good

thing<00:02:48.100> um<00:02:49.680> you're<00:02:50.680> probably<00:02:50.709> gonna<00:02:51.040> need<00:02:51.190> to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
thing um you're probably gonna need to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.190 
thing um you're probably gonna need to
put<00:02:51.430> on<00:02:51.519> rail<00:02:51.820> mounts<00:02:52.150> when<00:02:52.870> you're<00:02:52.989> making

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
put on rail mounts when you're making

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.140 
put on rail mounts when you're making
this<00:02:53.260> point<00:02:53.530> because<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.370> servos<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:54.880> got

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
this point because the servos that I got

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.400 
this point because the servos that I got
are<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> little<00:02:56.230> too<00:02:56.440> small<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.420> um<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.230> fit

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
are a little too small to be um to fit

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.320 
are a little too small to be um to fit
in<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.620> normal<00:02:59.920> spot<00:03:00.100> that's<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> bigger

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
in the normal spot that's the bigger

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.479 
in the normal spot that's the bigger
ones<00:03:01.570> going<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.800> can<00:03:02.950> see<00:03:03.070> how<00:03:03.190> they're

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
ones going you can see how they're

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.890 
ones going you can see how they're
written<00:03:06.180> these<00:03:07.180> are<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.390> rail<00:03:07.540> mouse<00:03:07.720> right

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
written these are the rail mouse right

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.479 
written these are the rail mouse right
here<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.350> right<00:03:08.800> here<00:03:13.980> really<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.310> hard

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
here and right here really not that hard

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.420 
here and right here really not that hard
to<00:03:15.580> make<00:03:15.730> all<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.000> need<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.209> do<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:17.250> draw<00:03:18.250> out

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
to make all you need to do is draw out

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.039 
to make all you need to do is draw out
what<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.120> inside<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.480> your<00:03:19.540> plane<00:03:19.720> looks<00:03:19.900> like

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
what the inside of your plane looks like

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.840 
what the inside of your plane looks like
on<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.410> real<00:03:20.620> mounts<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.130> then<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.579> need<00:03:21.790> to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
on the real mounts and then you need to

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.880 
on the real mounts and then you need to
cut<00:03:22.000> them<00:03:22.060> out<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.450> use<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.200> hobby<00:03:23.410> knife<00:03:23.590> but

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
cut them out I use the hobby knife but

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.990 
cut them out I use the hobby knife but
you'd<00:03:24.040> probably<00:03:24.070> be<00:03:24.400> better<00:03:24.519> off<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:24.940> a

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
you'd probably be better off with like a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.600 
you'd probably be better off with like a
little<00:03:25.120> saw<00:03:25.390> or<00:03:25.540> something<00:03:26.130> although<00:03:27.130> use<00:03:27.310> was

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
little saw or something although use was

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.699 
little saw or something although use was
like<00:03:27.790> own<00:03:27.970> shingle<00:03:28.870> woods<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> would

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
like own shingle woods that you would

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.550 
like own shingle woods that you would
get<00:03:29.920> in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.310> pack<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:31.720> yeah<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.230> really

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
get in the pack but yeah it's really

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.080 
get in the pack but yeah it's really
really<00:03:33.010> simple<00:03:33.130> most<00:03:33.579> people<00:03:33.850> think<00:03:33.940> it's

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
really simple most people think it's

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.979 
really simple most people think it's
going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.269> be<00:03:34.329> hard<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.540> swap<00:03:34.750> out<00:03:34.900> the

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
going to be hard to swap out the

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.530 
going to be hard to swap out the
electronics<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.579> TV<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.880> want<00:03:37.060> as<00:03:37.209> once

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
electronics it's a TV you want as once

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.680 
electronics it's a TV you want as once
you<00:03:37.690> see<00:03:37.930> step<00:03:38.739> one<00:03:38.769> order<00:03:39.310> your<00:03:39.430> stuff<00:03:39.690> step

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
you see step one order your stuff step

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.569 
you see step one order your stuff step
two<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.900> put<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:41.290> step<00:03:41.590> three<00:03:41.860> tweak<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.370> so

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
two you put it in step three tweak it so

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.420 
two you put it in step three tweak it so
it's<00:03:42.760> ready<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.000> go<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.450> yeah<00:03:44.440> that's<00:03:45.010> my<00:03:45.130> soup
