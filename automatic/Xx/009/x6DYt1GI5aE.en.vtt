00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 well how about here they bring double what is 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.830
 the video about roma version 3 of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.690
 philippines 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.120
 good as you can see it 's very good 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 is the spring that you can 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.929
 observe if we maintain 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.619
 pressed on the padlock where is the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.840
 hour tells us that we have to download it 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.130
 to unlock it and as you see it has been 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.349
 unlocked let's see 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.539
 it also tells us that here is the camera 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.020
 if the potato if we can lower it 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.980
 camera messages 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.370
 the phone then for example let's 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.370
 the camera 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.440
 Y 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.440
 here it is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 well also that this can be the dial 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.230
 marker 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.480
 As you can see, it's very fast, it's still 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.620
 is in English and the only bad thing that I have 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.500
 could see but there are some applications 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.229
 that they might translate it and that's not 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 would be to investigate it as you can see 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.810
 here is this the interface 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.970
 what it does is update it but not 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.210
 delete any application in this case I 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 I worked to do this and be able to see 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.990
 everything as is clearly how can 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.590
 send the supersur super bus express me 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.130
 has changed the way this and also here 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.160
 this a new a novelty that if 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.860
 us this one we keep personado the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.650
 Home key opens the administrator 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.170
 Of applications 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.780
 something that I think that in others 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.020
 directions could not be done and also 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.540
 pressing the key on one side of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.590
 windows can also be something is very 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.140
 useful then now what we're going to do 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.030
 is to teach them what is the kind of 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.970
 keyboard that includes that is the torso at 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.970
 same version 5 we open it 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.500
 and here it tells us that first we have to 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.500
 is to activate it 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.700
 who goes to language on ipod and what 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.280
 activate now let's go back 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.650
 tells us that we activate it we're going to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.189
 activate and we select it 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.730
 then he tells us that there are some edinsons 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.150
 then what normal or normal good 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.599
 language 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.310
 and they offer us a lot of language 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:42.010
 by the language 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.010
 we give in spanish for you to download 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.450
 and let's wait 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:03:01.319
 and as you see now here is already the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.280
 Spanish we give you here and it says secondary 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.290
 then spanish and we give it in 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.290
 good but let's go back 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.530
 behind 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.470
 behind 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.380
 and we give in done 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.060
 well now let's see how he has 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.880
 We are going to put this case to see 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.900
 and the application of messages 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.900
 but new 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.180
 and as you see that it does not appear what is the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.100
 keyboard 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.320
 let's use it in the hand 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.820
 whoever is not here, we give him in 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.820
 settings of that language 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.140
 spanish 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.090
 and here it tells us that if we get which one 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.310
 we give in that there 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.160
 as you see here would be then to put 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.080
 a word would have to grab it by 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.680
 example here 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.680
 the 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.430
 but good exercise there is any 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.910
 Star word can learn to 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:18.269
 use it for example here 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.980
 and daddy good as you can see is a 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.140
 very good application as accesses wipe 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:28.110
 it looks a lot and this being what 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:32.220
 did they use so only what 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:37.790
 least choose us to make an adjustment of 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.790
 true then here where it says 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:45.100
 wood and here on the keyboard what 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.090
 deactivate 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.660
 we go backwards back and if we can 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.880
 we have here to put something is already 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.840
 normal block 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.840
 good this and as you see is very good 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:09.529
 is very good if I recommend that the 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:11.659
 download this and finally tell them that 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:14.419
 I'm going to upload a video of the best 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.800
 keyboards with this it's clear that I have 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.169
 was going until the time they are for 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.259
 android as you know I have tried in 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.360
 alcatel how long during little 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.270
 I would also be uploading games and as 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.249
 know this what is for this channel or 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.589
 that for everything that is compatible 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:33.229
 you can say some but this is not 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:34.369
 new but what I want is to help 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.259
 that you can install it in your 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:38.449
 alcatel and that they see that they correspond with 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.749
 problems and can not say I have to 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.490
 risk good then you already know and 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:46.840
 Until next time I hope you have 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.500
 liked the video and 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.500
 goodbye
