your hair is wet which is really cool I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
your hair is wet which is really cool I
never<00:00:42.989> personally<00:00:43.770> tried<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.460> wet<00:00:45.350> straight

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.709 
never personally tried a wet straight
kind<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.950> straightener<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.090> hair<00:00:48.420> tool

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
kind of straightener or a hair tool

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.410 
kind of straightener or a hair tool
because<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.230> always<00:00:49.739> thought<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:51.000> hair

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
because I always thought if you use hair

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
because I always thought if you use hair
tools<00:00:51.750> when<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.350> hair<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.590> wet<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.129> hair

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
tools when your hair is wet your hair

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.029 
tools when your hair is wet your hair
will<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:54.090> completely<00:00:54.629> ruined<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.770> this

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
will be completely ruined but this

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
will be completely ruined but this
actually<00:00:56.600> conditions<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.899> hair<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.469> dries

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
actually conditions your hair and dries

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.180 
actually conditions your hair and dries
it<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.910> straightens<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it and straightens it all in one and I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
it and straightens it all in one and I
actually<00:01:02.430> tried<00:01:02.910> out<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> waiver<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.170> I

actually tried out the waiver so I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.440 
actually tried out the waiver so I
haven't<00:01:04.500> opened<00:01:04.769> these<00:01:05.519> straightener<00:01:06.150> ones

hair because you can also use it on dry
hair<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.650> tool<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.040> different<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.580> it's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
hair this tool is different because it's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.130 
hair this tool is different because it's
basically<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> two-in-one

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
basically a two-in-one

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.260 
basically a two-in-one
so<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.009> saves<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> lot<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.549> time<00:01:23.670> too

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so and it saves a lot of time too

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.539 
so and it saves a lot of time too
because<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.710> me<00:01:25.860> since<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.220> hair<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
because I know for me since my hair is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
because I know for me since my hair is
very<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.509> long<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.259> takes<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:28.979> 30<00:01:29.369> minutes

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
very very long it takes about 30 minutes

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.270 
very very long it takes about 30 minutes
for<00:01:30.060> my<00:01:30.150> hair<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> completely<00:01:31.020> dry<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
for my hair to completely dry and then I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.910 
for my hair to completely dry and then I
wave<00:01:33.000> my<00:01:33.030> hair<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.720> after<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.470> usually

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
wave my hair right after so usually

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.859 
wave my hair right after so usually
takes<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.340> an<00:01:35.579> hour<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.570> tool

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
takes about an hour but with this tool

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.499 
takes about an hour but with this tool
since<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> two-in-one<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.340> said<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
since it's a two-in-one like I said it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
since it's a two-in-one like I said it
only<00:01:39.750> takes<00:01:40.200> half<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> time<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.640> just

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
only takes half of the time so it just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.969 
only takes half of the time so it just
heats<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.540> water<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.049> your<00:01:43.079> hair<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
heats up the water in your hair and it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.980 
heats up the water in your hair and it
dries<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.240> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> hear<00:01:45.750> like

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
dries it like that you kind of hear like

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
dries it like that you kind of hear like
sizzling<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.979> starts<00:01:47.340> heating<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
sizzling and it starts heating and

about<00:03:31.650> five<00:03:32.100> seconds<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.910> then<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.810> move<00:03:34.110> it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
about five seconds and then I move it

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.950 
about five seconds and then I move it
down<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.710> next<00:03:35.070> section<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.180> try<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.630> make

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
down the next section and I try to make

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.350 
down the next section and I try to make
the<00:03:37.140> waves<00:03:37.350> match<00:03:37.770> so<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.640> more<00:03:38.910> flowy

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
the waves match so it's just more flowy

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.770 
the waves match so it's just more flowy
and<00:03:39.720> looks<00:03:39.930> more<00:03:40.200> natural<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:42.420> it's<00:03:42.600> very

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
and looks more natural so it's very

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.530 
and looks more natural so it's very
simple<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.500> use<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.160> as<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.520> can<00:03:44.700> see<00:03:45.000> I'm
