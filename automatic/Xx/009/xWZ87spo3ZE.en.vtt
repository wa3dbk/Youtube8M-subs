00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.210
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.919
 this video test of grid play 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.170
 a very fun and useful application 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.170
 to create creative tile videos 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 the application allows you to split a 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.860
 video project of a video in various 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 boxes and record for each box 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.910
 a different scene 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.610
 the final video can be exported 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.410
 on social media or saved on film 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.970
 photographic 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.480
 then let's see how it works 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.190
 the app clicking on start will open a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.320
 project we can choose the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.260
 rear or front camera 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.199
 by making a swipe we can choose to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.750
 combine cells or divide them and to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.960
 choose the format then from a 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.839
 simple a simple division of the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.610
 screen with a square pattern or 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.640
 even coming upstream more 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.159
 cells you can then decide which ones 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 record cells so just tap 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.159
 a cell to activate it record 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 that cell 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.560
 but we can also like to make a swipe 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.600
 and record a whole series all one 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.909
 zone in short, a series of cells but not 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.090
 just so we are also going back and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.229
 record a shape maybe you can 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.789
 register another form 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.219
 subsequently 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.780
 the app is very very versatile below 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.520
 this point of view 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.189
 so let's give it a try we choose 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.079
 of the minor cells here we record a 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.679
 video we put the duration we can 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.939
 choose from 0.5 to 15 seconds with the 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.009
 basic version 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.299
 if we should not buy with a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.880
 purchase in the app 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.520
 the full version is practically 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.859
 extend the duration up to 5 minutes 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 we record with just one second per 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:59.399
 try this is a scene we record 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.030
 another maybe we do so on one 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.909
 Test then it is these two then maybe the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.069
 we connect and register the same 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.979
 scene 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.580
 now it's a test video but we can 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.580
 already notice from the preview he has 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.020
 recorded various various scenes just for 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.750
 let you see that one is created then 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.380
 timeline from which we can then do 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.380
 audio adjustments though 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.910
 follow the track choose the volume one 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.670
 Once the video is finished we can 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.000
 go ahead we can insert a 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.680
 song on our device 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.310
 choose to crop the video more 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.660
 it is then precisely to export it then 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.250
 save it put it on instagram 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.200
 the application supports that 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.860
 instagram resolution that we say 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.570
 square therefore 640 x 640 we can 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.910
 upload it to youtube on facebook tumblr 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.440
 or send it by email 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.690
 now I am attaching a demonstration video 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.360
 created with the application done with 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.710
 of the clips taken from our videos on 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.990
 youtube from our channel 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.120
 I registered with the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.820
 iPhone camera on the screen of the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.430
 mac and then I inserted the soundtrack 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.970
 background that our initials 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.970
 in conclusion 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.660
 if you are also following the video tutorials 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.480
 on imovie for ios that I'm doing and that 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.060
 we are almost at the end of this 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.070
 application certainly could 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.140
 be useful to associate some 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.850
 creative effect to the assembly of a 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.440
 video of a project about his movies 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.090
 simply import from 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.160
 roll photo our creation well me 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.540
 thank you for following me there 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.540
 see you at the next video
