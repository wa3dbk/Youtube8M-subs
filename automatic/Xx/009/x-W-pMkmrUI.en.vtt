00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.570
 number 12 mega man zero collection 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.930
 this game 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.870
 not rather as the name implies is a compilation of the sagas of games 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.100
 of the co-star of the mega man games 0 as many know 0 he had a saga 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.599
 of four games for the Microsoft console 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.250
 all with a good average gameplay history but if they varied several things 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.420
 between games then he thought nintendo then simple to extinguish the 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.199
 four games second and gave notice to the nintendo ds and not only joined the 4 in 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.219
 1 if not add extra things such as a story mode but not one 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.949
 simple if you do not play the whole story or logically become heavy in the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.460
 first game then when not finished you've magically taken caution to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.750
 second and so on, adding also the difficulty 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 feature of these games you will want 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.980
 cited a good couple of hours of entertainment on the nintendo ds 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.410
 number 11 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 animal crossing 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.830
 is that I have not played this game I do not know what to say 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.620
 do not fuck me 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.960
 I have not played 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.230

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.660
 Hahahaha luck that I brought a report of the games of the boy mole to know 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.330
 this x3 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.370
 chucho if this has saved my life xd now yes with an eleven with the next 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.680
 Sunday 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.350
 for the community because it's a video game for nintendo ds that 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.500
 belongs to the sainte animal crossing of nintendo 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.330
 and all the functional graphic aspects are not an online wi-fi system that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.490
 lets play with anyone on the entire planet 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.280
 the player only needs in addition to the console and the game a router with 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.740
 wi-fi connection or the nintendo wi-fi usb connector 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.240
 You can also connect in some places that offer Wi-Fi connection 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.340
 free as some airports 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.530
 in his synopsis the player is a human who lives in a town with neighbors 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.400
 animals all with different personality some are stingy other if you talk to 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.200
 they give you other things that do not support you and others who love you 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.219
 madly 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.229
 As you progress through the game you discover the possibility of furnishing 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:16.299
 home 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.370
 to buy send letters etc. in the game there are different types of bugs or 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.849
 of fish that can marry the fishing rod or the net 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.769
 when you have all the possible species they will give you the rod and the network of 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.759
 gold with which you can fish much better or hunt also much better 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.729
 when you get a fish 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:39.469
 I fossil or picture you can sell it to cork to the neighbors put it in the house or 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.399
 donate it to the museum if you donate all specimens of bugs and fish that 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.399
 will give the gold network and the gold cane respectively 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.859
 if I owe you a good one, let me continue 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.699
 number 10 the legend of zelda 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:58.019
 the legend of zelda also known as from reading cell is one of the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.259
 best and best known games for nintendo ds for the console until the 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.589
 date of this video there are two games the first one is reading cell both the 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:11.889
 mouras I will only talk about this one since the later l going zelda spirit tracks not 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.209
 it was much more like it was playing a new story without basically anything from 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.900
 renewal 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.609
 just change the boat with 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.199
 as the pact did not Brussels was a very striking game since it had those 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.169
 graphics something 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.889
 angels of the world do 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.889
 what of the camera opting for the one that is always above 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.869
 as it is characteristic in several games adapted to the ds also a 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.659
 interesting gameplay since the game touched 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.989
 a gameplay based on the band 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:41.990
 in group 1 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.579
 leaving the buttons 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.809
 confessed his horned 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.309
 number 9 so young 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:53.609
 also placed is a graphic adventure game in which we embody the skin of a 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.219
 young student name and health 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.339
 titans a young 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.739
 that's why he's about to turn years but when he woke up that morning he finds 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.129
 something very strange note that your room has changed 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.129
 even the floor is different if your pet 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.249
 the mall sector arrives with the inauguration of the hall 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.540
 but not with his uncle 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.019
 who the night before appeared asking for money as usual 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.160
 and so new parents and asks him what is happening this one answers him that 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.940
 yes it's okay since you should know that your parents after an accident 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.870
 disappeared without any trace 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.300
 over for some reason they ask to try to show him the pen that he was wearing 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.789
 cat but your uncle can not see it 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.879
 this is where the adventure begins 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.039
 in which through the pen jolopo the pen mentioned above 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.869
 We will resolve several ministries while we search for data on the whereabouts of 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:48.139
 parents of it and bess great game no doubt I recommend a lot 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.090
 Number 8 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.650
 ace attorney was nick swift 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.060
 what would I think if I told you that a game about something as unexciting as being 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.509
 a lawyer would not be if it were otherwise a game that hooks you hours 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:02.630
 and hours to the console 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.770
 for your information such a game exists and is nothing more and nothing less than 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.250
 makes the tournament ace attorney is a game of lawyers in which we embody the 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.180
 phoenix skin wright a young lawyer who just started in the race the 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.480
 game has very complex cases 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.370
 Sometimes you get a bit of your brain every once in a while 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.550
 along with very interesting characters for this one 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.509
 very possibly 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.930
 one of your favorite games so far there are three sagas that of phoenix 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.519
 wright that is the longest has three games the support enough 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.120
 this last one we wait for the espanyol betis 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.570
 Attention 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.089
 cheap advertising is approaching 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.089
 do you like actor art 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.349
 possibly we are 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.169

 that is the game itself 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.070
 similar to this one just that changing several things has very graphic 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.670

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.420
