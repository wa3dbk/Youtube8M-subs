00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.740
 Yes, before signing the contract I had to take another test: 

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:01.314
 As usual, a medicine check. 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.300
 This includes a blood sample, 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.600
 a fitness test, 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.760
 a joint control with all the trimmings. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.860
 As far as everything went well and the results look good. 

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:15.061
 1. FC NÃ¼rnberg is a great club, 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.880
 and inside of me it burns naturally. 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.820
 There is a certain amount of anticipation 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.400
 and I can not wait to train with the team. 

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:26.214
 Of course, I still have some training backlog, 

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:29.263
 but in the end I also trained independently during the holidays. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 It will not be long and I'm fit again. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.640
 Yes, of course it was a great start time in Hannover: 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.820
 I had a good start, 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.594
 played constantly, 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.180
 was able to score in the first Bundesliga 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.780
 and that greatly simplified things for me. 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.280
 The integration into the first team of Hannover 96 went smoothly. 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.580
 The team had also received me very well. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.040
 From game to game, I came more and more used 

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:02.554
 and after four or five weeks I played from the beginning. 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.880
 I was close to becoming a regular player. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.480
 Of course, this disease (meningitis) then put a heavy strain on me 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.940
 and thrown back enormously. 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.420
 As a result, I needed time in Switzerland (at FC Thun and the BSC Young Boys) to catch up. 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.280
 I used this time well. 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.340
 Now I am ready for a new challenge 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 and I feel very good.
