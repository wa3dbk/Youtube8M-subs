the<00:03:02.440> best<00:03:02.620> leaders<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.220> I've<00:03:03.640> learned<00:03:04.630> so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
the best leaders and I've learned so

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.090 
the best leaders and I've learned so
much<00:03:04.990> from<00:03:05.050> each<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.470> every<00:03:05.590> one<00:03:05.710> of<00:03:05.770> them<00:03:05.890> is

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
much from each and every one of them is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.740 
much from each and every one of them is
I<00:03:06.280> could<00:03:06.550> go<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.880> for<00:03:07.150> 20<00:03:07.390> minutes<00:03:07.660> about

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
I could go on for 20 minutes about

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.940 
I could go on for 20 minutes about
everything<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.800> we<00:03:08.920> have<00:03:09.100> but<00:03:09.460> I<00:03:09.870> think<00:03:10.870> that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
everything that we have but I think that

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.170 
everything that we have but I think that
the<00:03:11.950> most<00:03:12.130> thing<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.520> that<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:12.940> be

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
the most thing is that you can be

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.520 
the most thing is that you can be
talented<00:03:13.420> while<00:03:13.780> being<00:03:13.960> good<00:03:14.110> leader<00:03:14.320> it

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
talented while being good leader it

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.620 
talented while being good leader it
that's<00:03:14.860> what<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.160> all<00:03:15.280> take<00:03:15.550> out<00:03:15.790> from<00:03:16.120> them

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that's what it all take out from them

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.240 
that's what it all take out from them
and<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:17.110> they<00:03:17.320> just<00:03:17.350> like<00:03:17.680> showed<00:03:17.920> us<00:03:18.100> how<00:03:18.220> to

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
and then they just like showed us how to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.650 
and then they just like showed us how to
get<00:03:18.490> there<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:18.970> now<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.300> our<00:03:19.420> turn<00:03:19.600> to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
get there and so now it's our turn to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.980 
get there and so now it's our turn to
show<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.320> underclassmen
