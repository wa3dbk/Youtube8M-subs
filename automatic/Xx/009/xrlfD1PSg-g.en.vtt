00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
by making the batter that you're gonna

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
by making the batter that you're gonna
soak<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> toast<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.230> before<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> fry<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
soak the toast in before you fry it the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
soak the toast in before you fry it the
bulk<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.390> usually<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.170> eggs<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
bulk of this is usually just eggs but I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
bulk of this is usually just eggs but I
like<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> incorporate<00:00:56.430> milk<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
like to incorporate milk just so it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
like to incorporate milk just so it
doesn't<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.350> such<00:00:58.620> an<00:00:58.770> eggy<00:00:58.980> flavor<00:00:59.239> also

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
doesn't have such an eggy flavor also

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.490 
doesn't have such an eggy flavor also
this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> good<00:01:00.780> time<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.260> incorporate

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this is a good time to incorporate

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
this is a good time to incorporate
flavor<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> add<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.090> bit
