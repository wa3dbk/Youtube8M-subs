fogger<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> new<00:00:16.350> greenhouse<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> fogger

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
fogger in the new greenhouse the fogger

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.679 
fogger in the new greenhouse the fogger
is<00:00:18.779> down<00:00:18.990> here<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.710> middle<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.689> it

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
is down here in the middle and it

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.310 
is down here in the middle and it
consists<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> 45<00:00:23.039> gallon<00:00:23.070> tank<00:00:24.199> there's<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
consists of a 45 gallon tank there's a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
consists of a 45 gallon tank there's a
fan<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.250> side<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> tank<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.300> blows

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
fan on this side of the tank which blows

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.460 
fan on this side of the tank which blows
air<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:29.460> air<00:00:30.060> goes<00:00:30.449> excuse<00:00:31.230> me<00:00:31.380> I'm

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
air in the air goes excuse me I'm

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.530 
air in the air goes excuse me I'm
talking<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.800> fog<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.550> air<00:00:32.730> goes<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.180> across

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
talking on fog the air goes in across

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.750 
talking on fog the air goes in across
the<00:00:33.600> surface<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> water<00:00:34.410> where<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.250> comes

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the surface of the water where it comes

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.750 
the surface of the water where it comes
in<00:00:35.880> contact<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.469> 2/9<00:00:37.469> discs<00:00:37.920> ultrasonic

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
in contact with 2/9 discs ultrasonic

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
in contact with 2/9 discs ultrasonic
foggers<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.050> comes<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.739> little

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
foggers and then comes up this little

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
foggers and then comes up this little
crack<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> other<00:00:41.670> side<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.450> blows

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
crack on the other side here and blows

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590 
crack on the other side here and blows
out<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.920> fan<00:00:44.340> over<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.059> essential

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
out so that fan over here is essential

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.479 
out so that fan over here is essential
for<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.840> thing<00:00:46.020> working

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
for this thing working

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
for this thing working
it<00:00:47.489> comes<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:50.239> it<00:00:51.239> blows<00:00:51.420> through

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it comes out and up and it blows through

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
it comes out and up and it blows through
the<00:00:51.809> dracula's<00:00:52.520> through<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> second<00:00:54.030> shelf

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the dracula's through the second shelf

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.319 
the dracula's through the second shelf
here<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:55.110> master<00:00:55.500> values<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.039> Dracula's<00:00:56.640> up

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
here with master values and Dracula's up

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
here with master values and Dracula's up
here<00:00:57.690> onto<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> Highland<00:00:58.559> Nepenthes<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.460> low

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
here onto the Highland Nepenthes the low

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.920 
here onto the Highland Nepenthes the low
E<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.989> macro<00:01:00.989> phyla<00:01:01.469> they<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.789> some<00:01:03.180> some<00:01:03.660> fog

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
E I macro phyla they get some some fog

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
E I macro phyla they get some some fog
as<00:01:04.199> well<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.710> humidity<00:01:06.290> comes<00:01:07.290> down<00:01:07.530> here

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
as well some humidity comes down here

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.090 
as well some humidity comes down here
onto<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> helis<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.350> some<00:01:10.680> some

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
onto the helis so they get some some

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
onto the helis so they get some some
nice<00:01:11.280> fog<00:01:11.780> down<00:01:12.780> onto<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> massive<00:01:13.619> alien

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
nice fog down onto the massive alien

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
nice fog down onto the massive alien
down<00:01:14.070> below<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.259> was<00:01:16.259> quite<00:01:16.439> worried<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
down below here I was quite worried that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
down below here I was quite worried that
this<00:01:17.100> some<00:01:17.400> fog<00:01:17.820> er<00:01:17.850> wasn't<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.479> big

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
this some fog er wasn't going to be big

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.380 
this some fog er wasn't going to be big
enough<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.259> greenhouse<00:01:19.710> being<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
enough for this greenhouse being that it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.060 
enough for this greenhouse being that it
was<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> smaller<00:01:22.110> greenhouse<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.950> this

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
was in the smaller greenhouse and this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
was in the smaller greenhouse and this
is<00:01:23.250> double<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> size<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> seems<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> be

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
is double the size but it seems to be

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.340 
is double the size but it seems to be
working<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:25.920> fine<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.140> see

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
working just fine in here as you can see

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.999 
working just fine in here as you can see
it<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.770> pumps<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> fog<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.680> fogger

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it really pumps up the fog so the fogger

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
it really pumps up the fog so the fogger
is<00:01:32.280> set<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> come<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.659> humidity

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
is set to come on when the humidity

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.649 
is set to come on when the humidity
drops<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.340> humidity<00:01:35.850> usually<00:01:36.180> drops<00:01:36.450> when

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
drops the humidity usually drops when

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.520 
drops the humidity usually drops when
the<00:01:36.780> temperature<00:01:37.140> rises<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:39.540> allows<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the temperature rises so this allows the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.080 
the temperature rises so this allows the
temperature<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> rise<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> humidity

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
temperature to rise and the humidity

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
temperature to rise and the humidity
will<00:01:42.420> keep<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> temperature<00:01:43.500> rising

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
will keep up with the temperature rising

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.490 
will keep up with the temperature rising
and<00:01:44.130> create<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> warm<00:01:45.149> humid<00:01:45.659> environment<00:01:46.290> for

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and create a warm humid environment for

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130 
and create a warm humid environment for
the<00:01:46.649> plants<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.189> opposed<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.180> warm<00:01:48.750> dry

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the plants as opposed to a warm dry

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.660 
the plants as opposed to a warm dry
environment<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.009> plant<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> maybe<00:01:53.460> what

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
environment for the plant so maybe what

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.020 
environment for the plant so maybe what
I<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:55.200> hard<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.920> here

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
I will do it's hard to see in here

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.010 
I will do it's hard to see in here
wasn't<00:01:57.030> actually<00:01:57.240> planning<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.600> filming<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
wasn't actually planning on filming it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.270 
wasn't actually planning on filming it
right<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.649> kind<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.890> kicked<00:01:59.100> on

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
right now but it just kind of kicked on

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.690 
right now but it just kind of kicked on
I<00:01:59.610> will<00:02:00.560> stop<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.740> video<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.280> few<00:02:02.310> minutes

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I will stop this video in a few minutes

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120 
I will stop this video in a few minutes
and<00:02:02.930> just<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.110> drawing<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and just do a little drawing of it and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
and just do a little drawing of it and
I'll<00:02:05.430> put<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.759> at<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> end<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.450> video

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
I'll put that at the end of this video

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.719 
I'll put that at the end of this video
and<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.039> exactly<00:02:08.429> how<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and that way you can see exactly how the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.479 
and that way you can see exactly how the
fogger<00:02:09.090> system<00:02:09.509> works<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.069> meant<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
fogger system works it was meant for the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.730 
fogger system works it was meant for the
other<00:02:11.670> greenhouse

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
other greenhouse

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.310 
other greenhouse
and<00:02:12.860> normally<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.540> couldn't<00:02:14.810> see<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.230> was

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
and normally you couldn't see it it was

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.540 
and normally you couldn't see it it was
out<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.590> way<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:15.770> it's<00:02:16.100> kind<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> an<00:02:16.400> ugly

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
out of the way so it's kind of an ugly

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.620 
out of the way so it's kind of an ugly
setup<00:02:17.060> right<00:02:17.210> now<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.380> works<00:02:18.560> really<00:02:18.650> well

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
setup right now but it works really well

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.790 
setup right now but it works really well
one<00:02:20.630> half<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.050> lid<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.350> Rubbermaid

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
one half of the lid of the Rubbermaid

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.160 
one half of the lid of the Rubbermaid
tub<00:02:22.070> other<00:02:22.880> half<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.270> just<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.480> piece<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.690> black

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
tub other half is just a piece of black

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.460 
tub other half is just a piece of black
Plexiglas<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:26.660> leave<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.230> little

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
Plexiglas and you leave just a little

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.890 
Plexiglas and you leave just a little
slot<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.030> forces<00:02:29.630> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
slot in there so it really forces the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.520 
slot in there so it really forces the
fog<00:02:30.140> out<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:32.510> other<00:02:32.690> fans<00:02:32.990> are<00:02:33.170> turned<00:02:33.350> off

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
fog out the other fans are turned off

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.650 
fog out the other fans are turned off
right<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:33.890> for<00:02:34.130> filming<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.210> fog<00:02:35.390> is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
right now for filming so the fog is

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.820 
right now for filming so the fog is
acting<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.020> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.410> different<00:02:36.710> than

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
acting a little bit different than

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.640 
acting a little bit different than
normal<00:02:36.980> it's<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.430> little<00:02:37.640> bit<00:02:37.760> heavier<00:02:38.410> if<00:02:39.410> I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
normal it's a little bit heavier if I

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.290 
normal it's a little bit heavier if I
put<00:02:39.860> up<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.070> shade<00:02:40.310> cloth<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.880> we<00:02:41.060> talked

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
put up the shade cloth that we talked

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.780 
put up the shade cloth that we talked
about<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.750> last<00:02:41.990> video<00:02:42.370> which<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.520> can't

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
about in the last video which I can't

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.720 
about in the last video which I can't
quite<00:02:44.060> do<00:02:44.270> yet<00:02:44.300> because<00:02:44.960> I'm<00:02:45.460> don't<00:02:46.460> have<00:02:46.610> the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
quite do yet because I'm don't have the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.970 
quite do yet because I'm don't have the
stool<00:02:46.970> over<00:02:47.000> there<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.200> would<00:02:48.320> block<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
stool over there but it would block the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.150 
stool over there but it would block the
Sun<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.000> sunny<00:02:50.330> day<00:02:50.440> yet<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.560> fogger<00:02:51.860> would

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
Sun on a sunny day yet the fogger would

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.850 
Sun on a sunny day yet the fogger would
still<00:02:52.370> be<00:02:52.460> running<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.060> side<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
still be running in this side so all the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.940 
still be running in this side so all the
Mastiff<00:02:55.760> alias<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.300> Dracula's<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.230> Highland

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
Mastiff alias and Dracula's and Highland

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.760 
Mastiff alias and Dracula's and Highland
Nepenthes<00:02:58.460> would<00:02:59.240> be<00:02:59.450> shaded<00:03:00.140> from<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
Nepenthes would be shaded from the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.700 
Nepenthes would be shaded from the
bright<00:03:01.580> summer<00:03:01.850> Sun<00:03:02.120> will<00:03:02.300> say<00:03:02.510> Plus<00:03:03.410> have<00:03:03.590> the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
bright summer Sun will say Plus have the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.290 
bright summer Sun will say Plus have the
bonus<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.220> extra<00:03:04.580> humidity<00:03:04.880> being

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
bonus of the extra humidity being

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.900 
bonus of the extra humidity being
trapped<00:03:05.600> into<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.990> smaller<00:03:06.530> sized<00:03:07.340> greenhouse

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
trapped into a smaller sized greenhouse

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.490 
trapped into a smaller sized greenhouse
because<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.510> shade<00:03:08.720> cloth<00:03:08.960> if<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.320> makes

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
because of the shade cloth if that makes

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.280 
because of the shade cloth if that makes
sense<00:03:09.590> kind<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.700> shade<00:03:10.880> cloth<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.780> traps

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
sense kind of the shade cloth just traps

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.620 
sense kind of the shade cloth just traps
the<00:03:12.470> humidity<00:03:12.920> back<00:03:13.070> here<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:14.150> allows<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:14.540> to

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
the humidity back here it allows it to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.120 
the humidity back here it allows it to
really<00:03:14.810> get<00:03:14.990> foggy<00:03:15.290> just<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.950> old

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
really get foggy just like the old

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.710 
really get foggy just like the old
greenhouse<00:03:16.670> did<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:22.310> I'll<00:03:22.430> put<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.820> shade

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
greenhouse did but I'll put the shade

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.640 
greenhouse did but I'll put the shade
cloth<00:03:23.930> back<00:03:24.290> down<00:03:24.530> for<00:03:24.770> now<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:26.480> as<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.530> can

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
cloth back down for now and as you can

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.710 
cloth back down for now and as you can
see<00:03:27.710> it's<00:03:28.040> actually<00:03:28.220> there's<00:03:28.970> fog<00:03:29.240> over<00:03:29.510> here

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
see it's actually there's fog over here

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.880 
see it's actually there's fog over here
I<00:03:29.750> don't<00:03:29.990> know<00:03:30.050> if<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.260> will<00:03:30.500> show<00:03:30.650> up<00:03:30.740> on

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
I don't know if that will show up on

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.700 
I don't know if that will show up on
camera<00:03:31.160> or<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:32.050> but<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.110> can<00:03:33.260> see<00:03:33.440> in<00:03:33.530> this

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
camera or not but you can see in this

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.150 
camera or not but you can see in this
reaching<00:03:34.160> its<00:03:34.310> way<00:03:34.430> over<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.790> here<00:03:36.160> it's

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
reaching its way over to here it's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.650 
reaching its way over to here it's
definitely<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.880> takes<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.150> little<00:03:38.270> bit<00:03:38.390> longer

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
definitely it takes a little bit longer

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.390 
definitely it takes a little bit longer
because<00:03:38.870> there's<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:39.350> much<00:03:39.470> more<00:03:39.710> volume<00:03:40.220> in

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
because there's so much more volume in

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.610 
because there's so much more volume in
this<00:03:40.520> greenhouse<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:41.210> air<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.930> has<00:03:42.050> to<00:03:42.350> to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
this greenhouse of air that it has to to

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.910 
this greenhouse of air that it has to to
work<00:03:45.620> with<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.150> was<00:03:47.930> really<00:03:48.350> really<00:03:48.530> worried

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
work with so I was really really worried

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.950 
work with so I was really really worried
that<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.160> wouldn't<00:03:49.370> keep<00:03:49.520> up<00:03:49.700> but<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.240> does<00:03:50.750> it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
that it wouldn't keep up but it does it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.520 
that it wouldn't keep up but it does it
keeps<00:03:51.110> up<00:03:51.350> just<00:03:51.590> fine<00:03:52.930> in<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.050> summer<00:03:54.290> time

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
keeps up just fine in the summer time

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.410 
keeps up just fine in the summer time
when<00:03:54.770> it's<00:03:54.950> really<00:03:55.160> cooking<00:03:55.460> and<00:03:55.850> all<00:03:56.120> three

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
when it's really cooking and all three

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.080 
when it's really cooking and all three
vents<00:03:56.780> are<00:03:56.900> open<00:03:57.340> maybe<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.490> different<00:03:58.820> story

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
vents are open maybe a different story

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.240 
vents are open maybe a different story
but<00:03:59.420> again<00:04:00.140> that's<00:04:00.350> why<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.530> shade<00:04:01.010> cloth

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
but again that's why the shade cloth

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.340 
but again that's why the shade cloth
when<00:04:01.460> it<00:04:01.550> goes<00:04:01.700> across<00:04:02.030> will<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:03.020> create

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
when it goes across will just create

just<00:06:20.390> the<00:06:20.570> lid<00:06:20.750> of<00:06:20.870> a<00:06:20.960> Rubbermaid<00:06:21.380> tote<00:06:21.590> and

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
just the lid of a Rubbermaid tote and

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.410 
just the lid of a Rubbermaid tote and
then<00:06:22.310> just<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.550> piece<00:06:22.670> of<00:06:22.700> plastic<00:06:22.880> on<00:06:23.270> this

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
then just a piece of plastic on this

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.010 
then just a piece of plastic on this
side<00:06:23.630> right<00:06:23.660> here<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:25.160> plastic<00:06:25.640> is<00:06:26.510> a<00:06:26.660> few

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
side right here the plastic is a few

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.780 
side right here the plastic is a few
inches<00:06:29.170> off<00:06:30.170> the<00:06:30.230> edge<00:06:30.680> here<00:06:31.010> so<00:06:31.310> that<00:06:31.490> air<00:06:31.640> can

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
inches off the edge here so that air can

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.240 
inches off the edge here so that air can
escape<00:06:31.880> in<00:06:32.330> this<00:06:33.080> Rubbermaid<00:06:33.560> tote<00:06:33.740> there<00:06:34.070> is

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
escape in this Rubbermaid tote there is

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.270 
escape in this Rubbermaid tote there is
a<00:06:34.280> fan<00:06:35.050> it<00:06:36.050> is<00:06:36.230> just<00:06:36.380> a<00:06:36.470> little<00:06:36.710> fan<00:06:36.860> I<00:06:36.890> got<00:06:37.130> from

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
a fan it is just a little fan I got from

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.830 
a fan it is just a little fan I got from
a<00:06:37.340> hydroponics<00:06:37.880> store

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
a hydroponics store

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.500 
a hydroponics store
so<00:06:39.260> air<00:06:39.950> will<00:06:40.250> go<00:06:40.400> in<00:06:40.580> when<00:06:40.790> the<00:06:40.940> fogger<00:06:41.210> turns

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
so air will go in when the fogger turns

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.070 
so air will go in when the fogger turns
on<00:06:42.100> the<00:06:43.100> water<00:06:43.340> level<00:06:43.550> is<00:06:43.790> like<00:06:43.970> this<00:06:44.150> there

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
on the water level is like this there

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.180 
on the water level is like this there
are<00:06:45.110> two<00:06:45.560> foggers<00:06:46.190> in<00:06:46.340> there<00:06:47.650> both<00:06:48.650> foggers

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
are two foggers in there both foggers

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.210 
are two foggers in there both foggers
have<00:06:49.430> nine<00:06:49.760> disks<00:06:50.419> and<00:06:50.690> they<00:06:51.590> create<00:06:51.889> the<00:06:52.010> fog

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
have nine disks and they create the fog

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.450 
have nine disks and they create the fog
so<00:06:53.150> this<00:06:53.750> fan<00:06:53.990> is<00:06:54.350> key<00:06:54.800> to<00:06:54.919> getting<00:06:55.100> the<00:06:55.220> fogger

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
so this fan is key to getting the fogger

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.450 
so this fan is key to getting the fogger
to<00:06:55.669> work<00:06:55.820> properly<00:06:56.139> when<00:06:57.139> the<00:06:57.889> fog<00:06:58.100> is<00:06:58.250> turned

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
to work properly when the fog is turned

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.310 
to work properly when the fog is turned
on<00:06:58.610> the<00:06:59.060> fan<00:06:59.270> turns<00:06:59.510> on<00:06:59.660> its<00:06:59.840> same<00:07:00.050> time

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
on the fan turns on its same time

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.990 
on the fan turns on its same time
they're<00:07:00.590> all<00:07:00.710> on<00:07:00.860> the<00:07:00.980> same<00:07:01.010> power<00:07:01.400> bar<00:07:01.760> and

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
they're all on the same power bar and

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.409 
they're all on the same power bar and
they're<00:07:02.660> all<00:07:02.780> on<00:07:02.960> the<00:07:03.110> same<00:07:03.520> humidistat<00:07:04.520> so

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
they're all on the same humidistat so

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.570 
they're all on the same humidistat so
the<00:07:05.720> fan<00:07:05.900> turns<00:07:06.169> on<00:07:06.380> the<00:07:06.710> fogger<00:07:06.919> turn<00:07:07.190> on<00:07:07.310> same

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
the fan turns on the fogger turn on same

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.150 
the fan turns on the fogger turn on same
time<00:07:07.790> air<00:07:08.060> goes<00:07:08.300> in<00:07:08.540> air<00:07:08.570> goes<00:07:09.320> forced<00:07:09.919> along

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
time air goes in air goes forced along

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.540 
time air goes in air goes forced along
here<00:07:10.520> and<00:07:11.080> the<00:07:12.080> air<00:07:12.229> and<00:07:12.260> the<00:07:12.620> fog<00:07:12.950> goes

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
here and the air and the fog goes

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.360 
here and the air and the fog goes
shooting<00:07:13.970> up<00:07:14.229> but<00:07:15.229> as<00:07:15.380> I<00:07:15.500> say<00:07:15.680> this<00:07:15.889> fan<00:07:16.100> here

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
shooting up but as I say this fan here

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.580 
shooting up but as I say this fan here
is<00:07:16.550> key<00:07:16.820> to<00:07:17.060> making<00:07:17.300> this<00:07:17.570> fog<00:07:17.810> go<00:07:18.080> if<00:07:18.260> this<00:07:18.410> fan

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
is key to making this fog go if this fan

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.379 
is key to making this fog go if this fan
doesn't<00:07:18.919> work<00:07:19.040> the<00:07:19.400> fog<00:07:19.610> just<00:07:19.639> kind<00:07:20.060> of<00:07:20.150> floats

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:20.389 
doesn't work the fog just kind of floats

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.909 
doesn't work the fog just kind of floats
because<00:07:20.630> it's<00:07:20.750> actually<00:07:20.840> heavier<00:07:21.320> so<00:07:21.800> it

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 
because it's actually heavier so it

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.650 
because it's actually heavier so it
needs<00:07:22.130> them<00:07:22.310> a<00:07:22.520> bit<00:07:22.820> of<00:07:22.940> airflow<00:07:23.180> to<00:07:23.300> get<00:07:23.570> it

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660 
needs them a bit of airflow to get it

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.640 
needs them a bit of airflow to get it
going<00:07:24.340> so<00:07:25.340> yeah<00:07:25.580> that<00:07:26.150> is<00:07:26.300> just<00:07:26.450> a<00:07:26.510> simple<00:07:26.660> sort

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
going so yeah that is just a simple sort

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.080 
going so yeah that is just a simple sort
of<00:07:27.680> explanation<00:07:28.040> on<00:07:28.460> how<00:07:28.490> it<00:07:28.669> works<00:07:28.790> I<00:07:29.169> use<00:07:30.169> the

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.090 
of explanation on how it works I use the

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.860 
of explanation on how it works I use the
zoom<00:07:32.090> mid<00:07:32.360> I<00:07:33.070> don't<00:07:34.070> even<00:07:34.130> what's<00:07:34.400> called

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
zoom mid I don't even what's called

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.840 
zoom mid I don't even what's called
human<00:07:35.870> stat<00:07:36.080> thermometer<00:07:37.040> thing<00:07:37.460> that's

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:37.850 
human stat thermometer thing that's

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.730 
human stat thermometer thing that's
meant<00:07:38.000> for<00:07:38.060> reptiles<00:07:38.479> to<00:07:39.139> run<00:07:39.530> the<00:07:39.800> fogger<00:07:40.280> and

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740 
meant for reptiles to run the fogger and

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.270 
meant for reptiles to run the fogger and
yeah<00:07:42.740> really<00:07:43.610> simple<00:07:43.940> so<00:07:44.810> anyways<00:07:45.350> I<00:07:45.650> hope<00:07:46.160> you
