00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
about 45 minutes we've kept the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.609 
about 45 minutes we've kept the
temperature<00:00:14.280> between<00:00:14.490> 150<00:00:15.330> 155<00:00:15.960> degrees<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
temperature between 150 155 degrees and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.500 
temperature between 150 155 degrees and
really<00:00:16.859> that's<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> hardest<00:00:17.940> part<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.390> this

process<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:19.529> keeping<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.980> temperature

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
process like keeping that temperature

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.790 
process like keeping that temperature
between<00:00:20.550> 150<00:00:21.390> 155<00:00:21.779> degrees<00:00:22.020> take<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> most

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
between 150 155 degrees take the most

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279 
between 150 155 degrees take the most
work<00:00:23.070> after<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.519> war<00:00:24.390> smooth<00:00:24.660> sailing<00:00:24.960> okay

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
do now is as it's coming to a boil we're

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.179 
do now is as it's coming to a boil we're
going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.170> ahead<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.380> add<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.890> sugar

we're going to refresh

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.969 
we're going to refresh
this<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.900> dry<00:01:31.140> malt<00:01:31.350> extract<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this is just dry malt extract and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.070 
this is just dry malt extract and
Stephen<00:01:32.790> had<00:01:32.970> poured<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.510> I'm<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> stir

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
Stephen had poured and I'm going to stir

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.020 
Stephen had poured and I'm going to stir
very<00:01:34.409> vigorously<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.340> does<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
very vigorously as he does because this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
very vigorously as he does because this
stuff<00:01:36.210> clumps<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.710> want<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> clump

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
stuff clumps up we don't want to clump

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
stuff clumps up we don't want to clump
up<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.550> we<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.119> rest<00:01:39.330> on<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
up and we don't want to rest on the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
up and we don't want to rest on the
bottom<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.200> bottom<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:40.680> burn

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
bottom because the bottom it will burn

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.480 
bottom because the bottom it will burn
on<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> bottom<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.650> I'm<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> keep

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
on the bottom so I'm just going to keep

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.250 
on the bottom so I'm just going to keep
staring<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:44.940> he<00:01:45.060> keeps<00:01:45.210> pointing<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
staring one he keeps pointing it and

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.080 
staring one he keeps pointing it and
keep<00:01:46.650> in<00:01:46.770> mind<00:01:46.920> your<00:01:47.220> recipe<00:01:47.550> may<00:01:47.670> call<00:01:47.880> for

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
keep in mind your recipe may call for

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.050 
keep in mind your recipe may call for
syrup<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.500> calls<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.950> dry<00:01:50.100> malt<00:01:50.310> same

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
syrup this one calls for dry malt same

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.730 
syrup this one calls for dry malt same
principle<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:51.990> pouring<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.410> syrup

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
principle you're just pouring the syrup

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.890 
principle you're just pouring the syrup
in<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.850> act<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.180> sugar<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
in there to act as sugar that's going to

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.540 
in there to act as sugar that's going to
become<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.409> fermentable<00:01:56.009> sugars<00:01:56.400> and

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
become the fermentable sugars and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.460 
become the fermentable sugars and
alcohol<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> end<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:58.110> right<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.350> you've

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
alcohol in the end all right so you've

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.350 
alcohol in the end all right so you've
got<00:01:58.500> ourselves<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.759> about<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.060> full

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
got ourselves up to just about a full

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.030 
got ourselves up to just about a full
rolling<00:02:00.570> boil<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.619> time<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.800> add<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
rolling boil and it's time to add the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.590 
rolling boil and it's time to add the
hops<00:02:02.340> sure<00:02:02.820> enough<00:02:02.970> now<00:02:03.300> there's<00:02:03.539> three

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
hops sure enough now there's three

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
hops sure enough now there's three
basically<00:02:04.410> three<00:02:04.680> periods<00:02:04.950> where<00:02:05.250> you're

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
basically three periods where you're

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.680 
basically three periods where you're
going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> add<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> hops<00:02:05.970> you're<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> do

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
going to add the hops you're going to do

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.870 
going to add the hops you're going to do
it<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:06.840> bittering<00:02:07.410> flavor<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.340> aroma<00:02:08.369> right

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
it for bittering flavor and aroma right

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.919 
it for bittering flavor and aroma right
now<00:02:09.000> we're<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> add<00:02:09.420> our<00:02:09.509> bittering

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
now we're going to add our bittering

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.390 
now we're going to add our bittering
hops<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> 60<00:02:11.280> minute

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
hops and this is going to be a 60 minute

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.180 
hops and this is going to be a 60 minute
boil<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.300> timer<00:02:12.510> starts<00:02:12.840> at<00:02:12.959> 60<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.560> then

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
boil so the timer starts at 60 and then

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.920 
boil so the timer starts at 60 and then
with<00:02:14.340> maybe<00:02:14.519> 15<00:02:15.000> minutes<00:02:15.330> left<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.750> boil

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
with maybe 15 minutes left in the boil

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.110 
with maybe 15 minutes left in the boil
will<00:02:16.170> go<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> flavoring<00:02:16.890> hops<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.459> then

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
will go the flavoring hops and then

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.670 
will go the flavoring hops and then
possibly<00:02:18.390> with<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.110> couple<00:02:19.230> minutes<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
possibly with just a couple minutes to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380 
possibly with just a couple minutes to
go<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.160> would<00:02:20.280> add<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> third<00:02:20.730> edition<00:02:21.150> work

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
go you would add a third edition work

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.449 
go you would add a third edition work
and<00:02:21.690> aroma<00:02:22.170> characteristics<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.190> again

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
and aroma characteristics and again

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.920 
and aroma characteristics and again
always<00:02:23.640> follow<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.030> recipe<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.540> recipe<00:02:24.840> will

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
always follow the recipe the recipe will

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.600 
always follow the recipe the recipe will
tell<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> when<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.769> hops<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.400> how

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
tell you when down the hops and what how

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.430 
tell you when down the hops and what how
much<00:02:26.850> dad<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.810> I'm<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.080> put<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.320> into

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
much dad so I'm going to put it into

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.750 
much dad so I'm going to put it into
this<00:02:28.590> we're<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> film<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.340> whole<00:02:29.550> bag

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
this we're the film in this whole bag

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030 
this we're the film in this whole bag
and<00:02:30.060> that's<00:02:30.870> basically<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.560> same<00:02:31.739> kind<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and that's basically the same kind of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
and that's basically the same kind of
bag<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.459> grain<00:02:32.760> bag<00:02:32.970> except<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.750> just

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
bag as the grain bag except for it just

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.390 
bag as the grain bag except for it just
let<00:02:34.110> them<00:02:34.290> float<00:02:34.470> around<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.100> we'll

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
let them float around there and we'll

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.220 
let them float around there and we'll
just<00:02:35.519> keep<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.790> out<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.540> we'll

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
just keep that out like this and we'll

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.340 
just keep that out like this and we'll
push<00:02:37.380> those<00:02:37.560> down<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.660> when<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.750> get<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.959> 15

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
push those down and when we get to 15

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.960 
push those down and when we get to 15
minutes<00:02:40.500> left<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.860> our<00:02:40.890> boil<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.459> will<00:02:41.579> add<00:02:41.820> our

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
minutes left in our boil we will add our

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.780 
minutes left in our boil we will add our
flavoring<00:02:42.360> homes<00:02:43.100> okay<00:02:44.100> well<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.400> got<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.700> up

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
flavoring homes okay well we got it up

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.130 
flavoring homes okay well we got it up
few<00:02:45.120> minutes<00:02:45.329> left<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.570> our<00:02:45.600> boil<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.019> it's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
few minutes left in our boil so it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140 
few minutes left in our boil so it's
time<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.530> add<00:02:46.620> our<00:02:46.650> flavor<00:02:46.980> hops<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.820> I'm<00:02:48.060> just

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
time to add our flavor hops and I'm just

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.460 
time to add our flavor hops and I'm just
going<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.329> put<00:02:48.630> them<00:02:48.720> back<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.019> same<00:02:49.260> bag

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
going to put them back in the same bag

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.199 
going to put them back in the same bag
and<00:02:49.769> good<00:02:50.640> up<00:02:50.850> those<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:52.790> try<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.880> get<00:02:54.000> him<00:02:54.060> in

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
and good up those in try and get him in

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.900 
and good up those in try and get him in
the<00:02:54.269> bag<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.950> that's<00:02:55.950> okay<00:02:56.220> if<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:56.610> have<00:02:56.730> some

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
the bag and that's okay if we have some

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.910 
the bag and that's okay if we have some
hops<00:02:57.120> floating<00:02:57.989> around<00:02:58.049> in<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.620> war<00:02:58.769> because

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
hops floating around in the war because

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.800 
hops floating around in the war because
we're<00:02:59.190> going<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.370> filter<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.880> out<00:03:00.000> anyway<00:03:00.600> this

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
we're going to filter it out anyway this

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.250 
we're going to filter it out anyway this
is<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.049> secondary<00:03:01.860> precautions<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.079> just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
is a secondary precautions so we just

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.190 
is a secondary precautions so we just
added<00:03:04.410> our<00:03:04.620> flavor<00:03:05.370> pumps<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.090> with<00:03:06.600> about<00:03:06.780> 15

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
added our flavor pumps and with about 15

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.199 
added our flavor pumps and with about 15
minutes<00:03:07.380> left<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.769> boil<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.910> time<00:03:09.060> to

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209

optional ingredient you lose your never

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.660 
optional ingredient you lose your never
bear<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.500> inexpensive<00:03:25.739> why<00:03:26.489> not

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
bear it but it's so inexpensive why not

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.849 
bear it but it's so inexpensive why not
do<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.269> favor<00:03:27.450> look<00:03:27.600> better<00:03:27.840> I'm<00:03:28.470> going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.709> put

to go from a clear beer all right now
more<00:03:37.360> time<00:03:37.540> we've<00:03:37.780> got<00:03:37.930> we're<00:03:38.170> down<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.410> about

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
more time we've got we're down to about

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.900 
more time we've got we're down to about
five<00:03:38.740> minutes<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.460> we're<00:03:39.610> going<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.790> go<00:03:39.850> ahead

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
five minutes so we're going to go ahead

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.210 
five minutes so we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:40.060> add<00:03:40.270> our<00:03:40.300> aroma<00:03:40.960> hops<00:03:41.170> those<00:03:42.010> are<00:03:42.100> going

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
to go in the same bag again and it's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:51.080 
to go in the same bag again and it's
going<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.810> go<00:03:43.900> for<00:03:44.080> about<00:03:44.170> five<00:03:44.410> minutes

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.059 

okay<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.420> we<00:03:52.510> finished<00:03:52.780> our<00:03:52.900> boil<00:03:53.290> now<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.739> now

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
okay so we finished our boil now and now

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.680 
okay so we finished our boil now and now
we<00:03:54.129> really<00:03:54.489> need<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.640> cool<00:03:54.879> this<00:03:55.030> word<00:03:55.300> off<00:03:55.450> so

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
we really need to cool this word off so

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.820 
we really need to cool this word off so
what<00:03:55.840> we're<00:03:55.930> going<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.110> do<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.319> take<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
what we're going to do is take it and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.290 
what we're going to do is take it and
put<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.040> into<00:03:57.250> an<00:03:57.519> ice<00:03:57.670> bath<00:03:57.700> that<00:03:58.150> we've

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
put it into an ice bath that we've

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:08.000 
put it into an ice bath that we've
created

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.120 

so<00:04:09.010> now<00:04:09.190> our<00:04:10.140> ward<00:04:11.140> is<00:04:11.350> an<00:04:11.470> ice<00:04:11.620> bath<00:04:11.920> that's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
so now our ward is an ice bath that's

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.060 
so now our ward is an ice bath that's
coming<00:04:12.550> down<00:04:12.730> now<00:04:13.720> as<00:04:14.050> it<00:04:14.320> cools<00:04:14.560> down<00:04:14.740> it's

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
coming down now as it cools down it's

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.069 
coming down now as it cools down it's
very<00:04:15.250> important<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:15.910> we<00:04:16.120> don't<00:04:16.450> let

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
very important that we don't let

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.920 
very important that we don't let
anything<00:04:18.070> get<00:04:18.459> in<00:04:18.519> here<00:04:19.120> because<00:04:19.510> once<00:04:19.780> you

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
anything get in here because once you

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.090 
anything get in here because once you
get<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.230> temperature<00:04:20.940> below<00:04:21.940> about<00:04:22.420> 150<00:04:23.410> 160

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
get to a temperature below about 150 160

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.970 
get to a temperature below about 150 160
60<00:04:24.790> you<00:04:25.570> run<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.840> risk<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:26.320> airborne

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
60 you run the risk of airborne

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.950 
60 you run the risk of airborne
infections<00:04:27.580> things<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.240> can't<00:04:28.450> even<00:04:28.690> see

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
infections things you can't even see

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.620 
infections things you can't even see
getting<00:04:29.920> into<00:04:30.100> your<00:04:30.370> beer<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:30.820> it's<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.480> rather

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
getting into your beer and it's a rather

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.120 
getting into your beer and it's a rather
tempting<00:04:31.930> target<00:04:32.500> now<00:04:32.620> because<00:04:32.950> it's

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
tempting target now because it's

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.580 
tempting target now because it's
Sweetwater<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:34.450> an<00:04:34.720> infection<00:04:35.230> would<00:04:35.350> love

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
Sweetwater that an infection would love

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.200 
Sweetwater that an infection would love
to<00:04:35.800> get<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.980> start<00:04:36.430> on<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.910> on<00:04:37.180> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
to get a start on the on the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.320 
to get a start on the on the
fermentation<00:04:37.840> process<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.530> nothing<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.670> we

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
fermentation process and nothing that we

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.760 
fermentation process and nothing that we
don't<00:04:40.480> put<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.200> going<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.440> wind<00:04:41.650> up

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
don't put in is going to wind up

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.060 
don't put in is going to wind up
improving<00:04:42.430> our<00:04:42.610> beer<00:04:42.880> absolutely<00:04:43.800> when<00:04:44.800> this

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
improving our beer absolutely when this

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.830 
improving our beer absolutely when this
cools<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.730> a<00:04:45.760> certain<00:04:46.120> point<00:04:46.300> we'll<00:04:46.600> go<00:04:46.720> ahead

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
cools to a certain point we'll go ahead

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.200 
cools to a certain point we'll go ahead
and<00:04:46.960> cover<00:04:47.320> it<00:04:47.470> let<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.740> cool<00:04:48.010> some<00:04:48.400> more<00:04:48.640> we

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
and cover it let it cool some more we

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.940 
and cover it let it cool some more we
don't<00:04:49.330> want<00:04:49.540> any<00:04:49.750> ice<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.140> fall<00:04:50.350> into<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.830> we

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
don't want any ice to fall into it we

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.830 
don't want any ice to fall into it we
don't<00:04:51.040> want<00:04:51.220> any<00:04:51.340> water<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.760> get<00:04:51.850> into<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.180> we

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
don't want any water to get into it we

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.840 
don't want any water to get into it we
basically<00:04:53.200> want<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.590> get<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.920> down<00:04:54.190> in<00:04:54.640> its

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
basically want to get this down in its

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.940 
basically want to get this down in its
two-gallon<00:04:55.660> version<00:04:56.080> here<00:04:56.320> somewhere<00:04:56.770> in<00:04:56.890> the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
two-gallon version here somewhere in the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.480 
two-gallon version here somewhere in the
neighborhood<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.310> about<00:04:57.430> 120<00:04:58.419> 110<00:04:59.080> degrees

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
neighborhood of about 120 110 degrees

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.520 
neighborhood of about 120 110 degrees
because<00:05:00.490> at<00:05:00.730> that<00:05:00.940> temperature<00:05:01.390> cold<00:05:02.169> water

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
because at that temperature cold water

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.920 
because at that temperature cold water

fridge that mixes and goes into our
formatter<00:05:07.000> winds<00:05:07.780> up<00:05:07.870> balancing<00:05:08.110> everything

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
formatter winds up balancing everything

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.400 
formatter winds up balancing everything
at<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.130> nice<00:05:09.550> cool<00:05:10.090> temperature<00:05:10.660> below<00:05:10.900> 80

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
at a nice cool temperature below 80

at a nice cool temperature below 80
degrees<00:05:11.800> Fahrenheit<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.460> that's<00:05:13.210> an<00:05:13.419> ideal

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
degrees Fahrenheit and that's an ideal

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.240 
degrees Fahrenheit and that's an ideal
temperature<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.350> start<00:05:14.620> our<00:05:14.860> fermentation

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
temperature to start our fermentation

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.670 
temperature to start our fermentation
process<00:05:16.030> okay<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:16.870> we're<00:05:17.140> ready<00:05:17.230> we're<00:05:17.530> going

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
process okay so we're ready we're going

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.470 
process okay so we're ready we're going
to<00:05:17.800> strain<00:05:18.160> this<00:05:18.310> through<00:05:18.610> our<00:05:18.850> two<00:05:19.060> strangers

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
to strain this through our two strangers

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:40.110 
to strain this through our two strangers
and<00:05:19.660> our<00:05:19.780> funnel<00:05:20.190> get<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.310> into<00:05:21.460> our<00:05:22.320> cabin

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.129 

now<00:05:41.120> we're<00:05:41.270> just<00:05:41.300> going<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.600> go<00:05:41.720> ahead<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:41.930> add

we've got all of our wort in here now we

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.170 
we've got all of our wort in here now we
don't<00:05:51.380> have<00:05:51.470> our<00:05:51.620> yeast<00:05:52.520> in<00:05:52.699> yet<00:05:52.850> but<00:05:53.000> what<00:05:53.120> we

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
don't have our yeast in yet but what we

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.580 
don't have our yeast in yet but what we
need<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.389> do<00:05:53.479> before<00:05:53.570> pro<00:05:53.930> Houston<00:05:54.320> is<00:05:54.410> we<00:05:54.500> need

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
need to do before pro Houston is we need

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.320 
need to do before pro Houston is we need
to<00:05:54.680> aerate<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.070> wort<00:05:55.400> okay<00:05:55.699> we<00:05:56.090> need<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.270> add

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
to aerate the wort okay we need to add

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.600 
to aerate the wort okay we need to add
oxygen<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:57.289> this<00:05:57.440> work<00:05:57.680> now<00:05:58.220> there's<00:05:58.400> a<00:05:58.460> few

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
oxygen to this work now there's a few

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.909 
oxygen to this work now there's a few
different<00:05:58.699> methods<00:05:59.270> of<00:05:59.960> doing<00:06:00.380> this<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:00.860> know

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
different methods of doing this I know

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.200 
they sell stones that you can that will
add<00:06:03.259> bubbles<00:06:03.800> into<00:06:04.100> it<00:06:04.220> and<00:06:04.370> I've<00:06:04.789> seen<00:06:05.120> people

add bubbles into it and I've seen people
have<00:06:05.449> warns<00:06:06.020> of<00:06:06.169> oxygen<00:06:06.740> I<00:06:07.509> just<00:06:08.509> prefer<00:06:08.690> to

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
have warns of oxygen I just prefer to

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.469 
have warns of oxygen I just prefer to

we've iterated our work it's time to
pitch<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:27.050> yeast<00:06:27.080> so<00:06:27.770> I'll<00:06:28.009> give<00:06:28.160> this<00:06:28.250> a

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
pitch the yeast so I'll give this a

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.890 
pitch the yeast so I'll give this a
couple<00:06:28.550> of<00:06:28.669> shakes<00:06:28.940> break<00:06:29.509> up<00:06:29.660> anything

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
couple of shakes break up anything

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.400 
couple of shakes break up anything
that's<00:06:30.229> sediment<00:06:30.710> at<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:30.830> bottom<00:06:30.919> and

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
that's sediment at the bottom and

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.659 
that's sediment at the bottom and
Matthew<00:06:33.410> if<00:06:33.500> you<00:06:33.590> want<00:06:33.740> to<00:06:33.800> open<00:06:33.949> the<00:06:34.190> lid<00:06:34.340> the

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
Matthew if you want to open the lid the

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.760 
Matthew if you want to open the lid the
lid<00:06:34.840> it's<00:06:35.840> important<00:06:36.169> out<00:06:36.289> that<00:06:36.410> we<00:06:36.500> let<00:06:36.650> this

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
lid it's important out that we let this

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.879 
lid it's important out that we let this
get<00:06:37.220> to<00:06:37.280> room<00:06:37.490> temperature<00:06:37.789> before<00:06:38.380> we<00:06:39.380> before

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889 
get to room temperature before we before

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.290 
get to room temperature before we before
you<00:06:40.130> open<00:06:40.340> it<00:06:40.630> okay<00:06:42.820> you<00:06:43.820> should<00:06:44.000> be<00:06:44.150> a<00:06:44.180> little

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
you open it okay you should be a little

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.969 
you open it okay you should be a little
pop<00:06:44.539> but<00:06:44.870> that's<00:06:45.289> how<00:06:45.440> you<00:06:45.500> know<00:06:45.650> that<00:06:45.800> it's

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
pop but that's how you know that it's

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:51.820 
pop but that's how you know that it's
probably<00:06:46.370> still<00:06:46.639> alive<00:06:46.849> and<00:06:47.030> working

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.110 

and<00:06:52.830> that's<00:06:52.980> it<00:06:53.130> can<00:06:53.340> open<00:06:53.550> a<00:06:53.610> cork<00:06:53.760> on<00:06:53.910> right

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
and that's it can open a cork on right

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
and that's it can open a cork on right
now<00:06:54.150> and<00:06:54.480> then<00:06:54.600> we're<00:06:54.750> going<00:06:54.840> to<00:06:54.900> get<00:06:55.020> the

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
now and then we're going to get the

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.170 
now and then we're going to get the
airlock<00:06:55.410> ready<00:06:55.650> all<00:06:56.220> right<00:06:56.400> well<00:06:56.640> we're

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
airlock ready all right well we're

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.940 
airlock ready all right well we're
pretty<00:06:57.330> much<00:06:57.480> done<00:06:57.540> here<00:06:57.810> we've<00:06:58.230> we've<00:06:58.770> got

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
pretty much done here we've we've got

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.790 
pretty much done here we've we've got
our<00:06:59.070> beer<00:06:59.340> it's<00:06:59.730> fermenting<00:07:00.270> away<00:07:00.330> so<00:07:01.290> go

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
our beer it's fermenting away so go

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.880 
our beer it's fermenting away so go
ahead<00:07:01.890> and<00:07:02.010> put<00:07:02.880> the<00:07:02.970> air<00:07:03.120> lock<00:07:03.330> on<00:07:03.570> and<00:07:04.080> then

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
ahead and put the air lock on and then

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.170 
ahead and put the air lock on and then
we're<00:07:04.980> going<00:07:05.070> to<00:07:05.130> take<00:07:05.310> this<00:07:05.460> into<00:07:05.700> a<00:07:05.850> dark

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
we're going to take this into a dark

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.270 
we're going to take this into a dark
room<00:07:06.270> and<00:07:06.690> let<00:07:07.380> it<00:07:07.470> ferment<00:07:07.770> out<00:07:07.980> and

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
room and let it ferment out and

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.850
