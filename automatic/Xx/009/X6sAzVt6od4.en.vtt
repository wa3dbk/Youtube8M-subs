00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As you can see, a lot of things have
been published about me in the media.

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:11.000
There has been a lot of speculation,
fabrication and misunderstandings.

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:15.800
Some of the stories don't even make me mad, they make me curious.

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:20.800
Who creates this nonsense?
Where do these controversies come from?

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:26.000
To find out I decided to visit a celebrity
gossip website to better understand...

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.000
How gossip websites work

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.500
Sergio, thanks for having me.

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:37.000
Dont worry, Rafinha. Its a pleasure to
have here one of the pilars of our bussiness.

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:41.600
Sergio, I see people on all around me
working, walking around...what is this place?

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:50.000
Rafinha, this is a gossip website. Behind me theres more
than 50 employees working 24h/day in horse shit.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Everything that the world thinks is vulgar,
dirty, and sometimes inhumane... here is gold.

00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:01.000
I guess that means that you guys know that your job is garbage?

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:09.500
Not garbage, garbage can be clean. Us? Never!
Come on, Rafinha. I am going to show you around.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:19.300
Our team is made with bad people. Losers.
Mainly frustrated human beings. For example, I am shit.

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:29.000
That girl: Sexually repressed. This guy over here: Premature ejaculator. That team in the back: Bullying victims.

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:37.300
These people use all these sad experiences for evil.
To destroy carrers of people like you.

00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:40.500
You mean that the goal here is to destroy carrers?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.300
No. Rafinha, our job is divided in 3 parts:

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:49.500
Hurt the reputation of artists that we like.

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:54.500
Launch the popularity of failed celebrities:
Former Big Brothers and funk dancers.

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:57.500
Search for pictures of Nana GouveiaÂ´s butt.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You treat the crap very serious here, right?

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.000
Right. And the most important
thing here is to have fun with tragedy.

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.001
Fabiolo, what are you watching?

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:12.000
Old men falling. Very good!

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.600
This is rotten. He used to work for Veja magazine.

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:19.100
How do you choose people to work in the website?

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:23.000
Its very simple, Rafinha. We put all candidates in front of a screen.

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:30.000
They watch videos of murders, people getting hit by cars,
forro videos. The one who have the best time, gets the job.

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.200
Forro videos?

00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:38.400
Heavy, huh? I know. Its because we
need the worst human beings possible.

00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:42.100
Yes! I got the job! Its my job!

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.000
Another hired!

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:47.200
Another son of a bitch to create bullshit about me.

00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:52.100
I see that you are getting the system, Rafinha.

00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:54.000
Opa.

00:02:54.001 --> 00:03:00.500
I was thinking... our stories are useless,
untruthfull, but the numbers are growing like crazy.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:04.001
I imagine that you must have a good research team here.

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:08.301
No. It is because of our torture system.

00:03:08.302 --> 00:03:14.000
The journalist publish a story. This content is posted in our website.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:19.501
The amount of people reading the piece will dictate the
size of the object that the employee will shove up his ass.

00:03:19.502 --> 00:03:24.500
The smaller the number, the bigger the object.

00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:30.000
Hey Wanderson. Gonna use the fire extinguisher today?

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:40.000
Look at here. He deserved. "Legendarios, the new
thing in the brazilian TV". Who cares about it?

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:50.100
Sergio, thanks for having me here today. It was cool to meet
the useless and sad life that you guys live here in a gossip website.

00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:58.000
Rafinha, thanks to you. It was nice to have you here.
Lets keep up this nice partnership.

00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:03.500
You keep doing your jokes and we keep fucking your ass.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.200
Rafinha Bastos, I am a huge fan. Can I take a picture with you?

00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:17.500
Wanessa, take this picture. Like this. Buddies.
