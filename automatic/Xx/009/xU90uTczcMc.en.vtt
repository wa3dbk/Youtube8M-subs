window seal let's be on the outside the
siding<00:00:32.730> overlap<00:00:33.620> then<00:00:34.620> i<00:00:34.710> use<00:00:34.890> more<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
siding overlap then i use more of this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.720 
siding overlap then i use more of this
on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> outside<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.920> i'm<00:00:38.040> trying<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
on the outside but i'm trying to see the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.770 
on the outside but i'm trying to see the
lad<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.670> won't<00:00:41.670> damage<00:00:41.910> anything<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
lad up for it won't damage anything it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
lad up for it won't damage anything it
starts<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.170> dribble<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> front<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.250> I'll

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
starts to dribble in the front then I'll

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.529 
starts to dribble in the front then I'll
notice<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.059> quicker<00:00:46.910> as<00:00:47.910> opposed<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
notice it a lot quicker as opposed to it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.560 
notice it a lot quicker as opposed to it
getting<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> wall<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> front

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
getting down in the wall on the front

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.010 
getting down in the wall on the front
what<00:00:51.570> I'll<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.960> use<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> light<00:00:52.559> foil<00:00:53.430> tape

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
what I'll do is use a light foil tape

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
what I'll do is use a light foil tape
and<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.199> around<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> won't<00:00:56.670> get

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and go around so that way it won't get

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
and go around so that way it won't get
to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> wood<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.660> does<00:00:57.809> anything<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> will

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to the wood it does anything it will

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.900 
to the wood it does anything it will
dribble<00:00:58.590> down<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> front<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.609> spot<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
dribble down the front and I can spot a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.569 
dribble down the front and I can spot a
catcher<00:01:00.239> catch<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> quicker<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.489> ever

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
catcher catch it quicker if it ever

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.810 
catcher catch it quicker if it ever
decides<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:05.540> start<00:01:06.540> dribbling<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.700> got<00:01:08.700> this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
decides to start dribbling I got this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
decides to start dribbling I got this
specific<00:01:09.360> 8,000<00:01:09.990> BTU<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.590> had<00:01:10.710> some

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
specific 8,000 BTU because they had some

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.590 
specific 8,000 BTU because they had some
features<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.460> liked<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.299> when

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.170 
features that I liked I don't like when
the<00:01:12.689> units<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.229> run<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.280> time<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.850> this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the units that run all the time and this

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.840 
the units that run all the time and this
one's<00:01:15.390> got<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> remote<00:01:15.840> temperature<00:01:16.409> sensor

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
one's got a remote temperature sensor

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.140 
one's got a remote temperature sensor
does<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> other<00:01:18.330> cool<00:01:18.600> things<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> i

you can see what I did to the the bottom
most<00:01:44.399> windy<00:01:44.790> units<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:46.369> rail<00:01:47.369> or

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
most windy units have a rail or

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
sill of a window so I just gouged that

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.520 
sill of a window so I just gouged that
out<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.270> all<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> way<00:01:54.600> across<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:55.320> one

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
out of all the way across this one

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.840 
out of all the way across this one
doesn't<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.340> goes<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.700> way

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
doesn't have when it goes all the way

about<00:04:38.419> a<00:04:38.569> time<00:04:38.869> we've<00:04:39.169> calculated<00:04:40.089> the

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:41.089 
about a time we've calculated the

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:43.989 
about a time we've calculated the
full-size<00:04:41.629> bed<00:04:42.399> we<00:04:43.399> didn't<00:04:43.639> really<00:04:43.759> have

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:43.999 
full-size bed we didn't really have

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.790 
full-size bed we didn't really have
enough<00:04:44.029> wall<00:04:44.509> space<00:04:44.539> for<00:04:45.169> cabinetry<00:04:45.409> or

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
enough wall space for cabinetry or

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.829 
enough wall space for cabinetry or
anything<00:04:46.189> like<00:04:46.219> that<00:04:46.369> so<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.419> just<00:04:47.569> went<00:04:47.719> ahead

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:47.839 
anything like that so I just went ahead

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.469 
anything like that so I just went ahead
and<00:04:48.020> covered<00:04:48.469> that<00:04:48.649> one<00:04:48.800> up<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:49.969> used<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.449> up

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
and covered that one up and used it up

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.739 
and covered that one up and used it up
front<00:04:51.429> to<00:04:52.429> windows<00:04:52.819> in<00:04:52.969> there<00:04:53.149> as<00:04:53.300> opposed<00:04:53.629> to

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:53.749 
front to windows in there as opposed to

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.409 
front to windows in there as opposed to
back<00:04:53.959> here<00:04:54.379> so<00:04:55.159> this<00:04:55.309> wall<00:04:55.580> here<00:04:55.879> i<00:04:55.939> can<00:04:56.240> have

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
back here so this wall here i can have

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.499 
back here so this wall here i can have
storage<00:04:57.349> and<00:04:57.679> cabinetry<00:04:58.219> and<00:04:58.459> then<00:04:59.179> behind

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
storage and cabinetry and then behind

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.209 
storage and cabinetry and then behind
this<00:04:59.779> wall<00:05:00.110> here<00:05:00.709> between<00:05:01.639> it<00:05:02.149> in<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.959> window

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
this wall here between it in the window

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.699 
this wall here between it in the window
i'm<00:05:04.219> going<00:05:04.399> to<00:05:04.459> go<00:05:04.580> ahead<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.819> build<00:05:05.029> a<00:05:05.709> small

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:06.709 
i'm going to go ahead and build a small

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:09.339 
i'm going to go ahead and build a small
area<00:05:07.039> for<00:05:07.430> storage<00:05:07.849> right<00:05:08.059> there<00:05:08.119> i<00:05:08.719> think<00:05:09.259> i

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
area for storage right there i think i

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:15.820 
area for storage right there i think i
can<00:05:09.409> give<00:05:09.649> up<00:05:09.800> enough<00:05:10.099> space<00:05:10.399> there<00:05:14.680> but<00:05:15.680> you

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
can give up enough space there but you

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.189 
can give up enough space there but you
see<00:05:16.099> i<00:05:16.369> have<00:05:16.669> got<00:05:17.089> the<00:05:17.209> blocking<00:05:17.449> here<00:05:17.869> so<00:05:18.050> i've
