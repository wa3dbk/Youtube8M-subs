lower abs when you connect them you

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.819 
lower abs when you connect them you
create<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> hip<00:01:50.280> circle<00:01:51.020> now<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.229> hip<00:01:52.439> circle

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
create a hip circle now this hip circle

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.340 
create a hip circle now this hip circle
is<00:01:53.009> traveling<00:01:53.630> outside<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:55.110> normal

is traveling outside of your normal

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.130 
is traveling outside of your normal
alignment<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.579> you're<00:01:56.700> standing

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
alignment so when you're standing

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
alignment so when you're standing
neutral<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.130> normal<00:01:59.430> alignment

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
neutral this is your normal alignment

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.399 
neutral this is your normal alignment
but<00:01:59.909> when<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> push<00:02:00.360> into<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> large<00:02:01.170> hip

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
but when you push into the large hip

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.499 
but when you push into the large hip
circle<00:02:01.710> you're<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> come<00:02:02.369> outside<00:02:03.119> of

circle you're going to come outside of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:26.930 
circle you're going to come outside of
that<00:02:04.430> let's<00:02:05.430> try<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:05.850> music

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:53.150 

let's<00:02:27.940> try<00:02:28.150> going<00:02:28.420> into<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.690> other<00:02:28.870> direction

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.470 

so<00:02:54.160> that's<00:02:54.340> how<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.520> do<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.700> basic<00:02:54.880> large

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
so that's how you do a basic large

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.770 
so that's how you do a basic large
exterior<00:02:56.050> hip<00:02:56.410> circle
