00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello to all his novels end up 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.029
 for a new video on 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.309
 the development of an aerial terrain 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.010
 for face first thing you will need a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.190
 terrarium type phonard yom which if 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.850
 perfect that is 37 meters from my 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.250
 so a substrate so be penny not 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.960
 there a care of the newspaper 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.519
 Or you can quote the soil is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.500
 more aesthetic or coughing you have here 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.470
 and impulser risa land for them 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.559
 drink water so this is perfect 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.120
 to start a way call with that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.440
 you have everything to make a field on 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.170
 see now move to the layout 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.120
 it's a little hard he also does everything to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.120
 to finish we will tack 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:58.550
 we will take the soup leaves 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.550
 alain we'll put them in the terrarium 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.689
 another leaf one serves alain more 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.710
 practice blowing because it 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.180
 sing you can change very easily 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.180
 so also the ivy that will be changed 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 every month every week I do not 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:34.110
 too much what is the frequencies so 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.689
 that's it for the substrates but not sad 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.829
 team but very practical 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:48.299
 here is sopalin then we ask you 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:52.380
 branches like this one for there you 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:02:00.540
 put to different different authors 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:04.890
 levels here are three so we're going to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:12.060
 so have the branches here I have 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:14.069
 one last here it reassures me 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.920
 So eat the leaves should 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.470
 change from time to time that's it 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.560
 very very simple so she never 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.209
 put bold or because in fact the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.580
 face not drink it must have 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.160
 humility breakage desired effect a bowl 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.599
 of low water they will drown 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.160
 I finally saw my plans here 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.349
 so cell yesterday you can also 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.420
 to put brambles I believe what these 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.209
 points facing the stick do not take that 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.510
 for your face what could their 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.230
 to be fatal no we will talk a little about 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.640
 faso it's the stick insect it was an ace and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.519
 so who camouflages himself with his 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.870
 environment moncaut the stickiness that gvt 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.690
 acquired 7.1 face me stick so that's it 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.150
 we talk about them here is a terrarium 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.120
 plastic like this one can be 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.650
 very very well you put ivy to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.840
 inside and that's perfect so all 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.140
 days once or twice a day for 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.060
 spray with a sprayer 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.549
 So here then there's no better 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.239
 you see I could not check 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.930
 directly on them makes its effect 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.930
 that will go to drink and then 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.299
 ivy has changed rotten side that's when 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.379
 there is more the substrate has changed 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.480
 when he is alone 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.750
 be careful not to confuse 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.329
 eyes with poop that's nonsense 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.590
 make 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.700
 so that's very very simple 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.440
 layout you can add 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.959
 other decorations like little rocks 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.150
 but hey it's not essential me 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.200
 do the minimum necessary to do it 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.120
 that's all there is to it 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.670
 places to roost so I have 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.239
 made a little hastily available 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.380
 branches 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.790
 so we could do better so here we go 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:14.489
 very good terrarium think 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:17.019
 here are ivy leaves info narnia 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:22.539
 a sprayer that's all he 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:26.080
 must be here now you know 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:29.860
 how to build a terrarium for face 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.289
 how to maintain and how to do 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.849
 drink the faces takes care of it and so to 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.470
 a next video when I will have liked 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.490
 face for you to present them 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.490
 go ciao
