00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.149
 a few days ago we bring you the analysis of 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.129
 the color campaign I say this and we 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.139
 It's great to present our analysis of 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.879
 the most important part today of 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.480
 a game from the saga of activision in the 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.480
 multiplayer mode 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.439
 it is known to all that what the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.480
 saga call of duty best-selling was his 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.460
 refreshing and addictive multiplayer that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.730
 we were all surprised six years ago 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.829
 with call of duty 4 modern warfare its 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.780
 scoring system its game modes 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.820
 and brilliant level design we have 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.470
 kept all stuck for hours 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.780
 of video to the television but good 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.640
 protection we tell ourselves and the saga is 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.620
 losing steam over the years and because of 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.470
 lack of changes in that respect from that 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.000
 past success the first thing that we 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.920
 we found when starting mode 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.199
 multiplayer ghosts is a renewed 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.299
 class system we can select 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.430
 a kind of soldier and customize those 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.199
 the so much therefore in arms and advantages 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.930
 as we were used to as in 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.119
 clothes like flash and even sex if 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.860
 you heard right like in the mode 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.509
 campaign is also the first time 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.189
 we can select a character 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.950
 female to fight our 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.930
 enemies customizing classes 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.420
 It has also been renovated resulting 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.009
 even a little messy at the beginning to 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.960
 from now on we will no longer need 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.939
 go up to a certain level to 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.440
 be able to access certain advantages or 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.480
 best weapons 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.550
 now we will be winning the so-called points 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.710
 of platoon completing challenges 10 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.510
 points will serve to unlock what 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.300
 that we want in the order that 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.070
 we want as we said before 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.410
 something messy for all those users 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.180
 veterans of the saga but certainly a 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.130
 hit to create your class 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.660
 perfect without having to play hours and 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.660
 hours reaching the maximum level 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.660
 with regard to the design of maps in the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.490
 that we can play is from knew 100 is 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.900
 something totally different comes to the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.940
 contrary to previous deliveries 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.490
 where the maps were mostly 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.440
 small and fast this year almost all 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 the maps are very wide in which 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.340
 you will have to play with head and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.410
 quiet another added in these 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.090
 new designs is the possibility of what 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.980
 that tie which 4 have baptized 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.800
 as evolution but in this case 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.200
 much less pronounced for putting a 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 example in octane and a gas station in the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.250
 which we can exploit and that the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.050
 roof of it falls down and creates if another 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.720
 point of resistance that before 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.880
 there was another one on the same map 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.709
 aspects of estelÃ­ volution de ghosts es 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.630
 the possibility of activating the pump that 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.520
 employs typical nuclear smoke up of the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.320
 previous deliveries that apart from finishing 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.990
 with all the enemy team changes the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.180
 map completely in reality in many 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.130
 maps we will really have a 2 for 1 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.640
 as if a supermarket offer was 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.640
 treat 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.900
 however one of the aspects 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.940
 negative of these new maps is that 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.740
 They are too big for the generation 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.990
 current so the xbox 360 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.090
 playstation3 the maximum amount of 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.790
 players by games are 12 leaving 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.850
 the usual 18 for the future net if 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.850
 the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.110
 something that we did not like anything is the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.720
 decompensation of weapons in this 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.910
 colloquium ticos in television time 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.770
 we are lovers of the sneijder and in 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.870
 this delivery we consider that it is not very 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.880
 useful to use a precision rifle when 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.790
 an assault rifle literally kills us 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.500
 of two bullets with this we have a mixture 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.209
 between huge maps but at the same time a 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.430
 call of duty where it ends with the 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.780
 enemies too easily something to 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.800
 what we do not find him 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.800
 too much sense 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.610
 regarding the dates of casualties 2 follows 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.920
 the wake of modern warfare 3 and divide 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.650
 different streaks in three classes assault 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.510
 Specialist help is obtained if a 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.640
 more adhesive nachos with the kind of 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.260
 Assault a few gusts of support for all 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.030
 team with the help class in the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.860
 possibility of linking advantages and 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.080
 become a superman with the 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.790
 specialist class one of the 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.860
 possible gusts of casualties felt 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.019
 known in campaign mode riley a 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.700
 very powerful streak that will allow you to have 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.260
 a little companion along the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.970
 game you have to destroy the enemies 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.970
 that cross our path 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.109
 in our opinion this losing streak 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.239
 it's a bit over powered as it can 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.190
 apply for it just by getting five 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.930
 low and the dog's health will be three 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.830
 times higher than our 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.560
 own character 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.510
 the other bouts of casualties will not be 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.610
 what is already known in past titles such as 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.410
 drones or drone helicopters that 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.030
 we can manage at our whim to 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.900
 take down our enemies from a 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.900
 different way 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.580
 to conclude we would like to ask you 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.560
 Game developers why 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.120
 have decided to remove many things that 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.020
 previous ones worked 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.020
 perfectly 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.380
 yes it is true that things have been added 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
 as we have named 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.040
 previously we do not know where he has 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.960
 stayed in movie mode or game modes 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.030
 as funny as land war or 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.280
 the mythical search and destroy that have given 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.889
 I went to find and rescue that we did not 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.289
 just convinced 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.120
 no doubt he knew dibos that is a bit 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.860
 but well on television we thought 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.569
 a little step back in the saga between 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.099
 missed opportunity for 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.349
 developers that in our opinion 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.029
 they needed to take advantage of the power of 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.930
 the new consoles to do something 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.930
 really different
