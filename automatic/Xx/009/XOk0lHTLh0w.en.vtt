guilty to a lesser charge some of those
drivers<00:04:12.020> never<00:04:12.650> lose<00:04:12.920> their<00:04:13.160> licenses<00:04:13.730> at<00:04:13.880> all

drivers never lose their licenses at all

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.080 
drivers never lose their licenses at all
so<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.870> question<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.560> are<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.280> laws<00:04:16.489> tough

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.080 
so the question is are the laws tough
enough<00:04:17.390> I<00:04:17.720> believe<00:04:18.410> it's<00:04:18.590> not<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:19.370> mean<00:04:19.640> I<00:04:19.880> think

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
enough I believe it's not I mean I think

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.759 
enough I believe it's not I mean I think
it<00:04:20.209> should<00:04:20.390> be<00:04:20.420> you<00:04:20.540> know<00:04:20.989> immediate<00:04:21.380> license

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769
