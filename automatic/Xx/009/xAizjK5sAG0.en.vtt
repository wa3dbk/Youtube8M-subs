 the towers took a new momentum 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.820

 podium points 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.710

 just pass the goal 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.449
 the Normans seem more inspired with 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.309
 duhamel 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.289
 the house scorer who hit it was 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.000
 framed and balloons saved by the keeper 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.079
 Touraine 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.969
 it is the visitors who make the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.039
 better impression but trick reaches 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.660
 finally to react with this center to 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.610

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.090
 first action to build confidence 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.150
 in attack free kick extremely 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.970
 far away for the tfc and yet that 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.860
 pass the free kick and the deflected ball 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.110
 by fousseni diawara the former defender 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.460
 Saint-Etienne scores his second goal of the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.680
 season in the 42nd minute round leads 1 0 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.570
 but when we react with this news 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.070
 interesting head on this center of jeans 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.320

 pass right next to a deflected ball 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.140
 by the keeper at half time it's fine 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.759
 tour that leads 1-0 of the towers that 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.810

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 well started to make a good result 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.899
 the Caenais on their side are too 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.210

 but tours went very well from 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.910
 cloakroom to hope to mark the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.910

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.040
 with this amazing shot full of 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.750
 spontaneity the Caen defense 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.250

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.959
 part 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.190
 and who are counter-attacked 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.200
 new ball in the focus for the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.590
 final victory of the tfc fled 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.670
 narrowly by Caen's defense and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.890
 especially by damien always searched for 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.440
 zero for turn in his near the end of 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.390

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.920
 when we are only led 2 goals to 1 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.720
 but they stay too little time and 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.880
 it's turns that makes the excellent 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 operation in this match with a 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.560
