00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.799

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.299
 of the appointment of the eco is today 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.550
 vincent joly is with us hello 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello then you are the co-manager of 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 the modeling agency a perfect model 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 based in Lille already to present us a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 little bit still this company you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 have created the perfect model when then will 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.420
 to be 18 years old this year is actually 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.980
 I was going to say she created herself following 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.480
 a common passion between my wife 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 laeticia who is co managing and who was 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 mannequin and myself therefore from 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.970
 human resources so here and then 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.890
 today this society relies on 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.969
 a team of nine permanent the same 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 very involved in the project 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.550
 business 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.809
 and then with a nice evolution that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 match a type to the challenge we have 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.450
 denounced ie to show that they 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 had anyway 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 I was going to say a life outside Paris 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.340
 at the level of fashion and so here 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 today the Lille metropolis 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.100
 show that we are a very beautiful 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 metropolis at the fashion level also 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.579
 so in two words perfect model it's 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.020
 a modeling agency but we 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.430
 more still for the concept your 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.949
 job is what is it 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 then the job of an agency like the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.480
 ours is good it's their treatment 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.859
 first know how to recruit know how to train and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.180
 it is a peculiarity of the arranged 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.580
 we have a whole training pole 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
 so you're getting models and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.670
 then make them available to our 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.159
 different customers that is to say at 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 photo level of fashion shows 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.369
 and then of all that is advertising 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 obviously videos etc then you the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.909
 said in preamble we are not obliged 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.350
 to be in paris in milan in new york at 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.570
 london to do modeling 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.890
 what are your customers precisely in the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 large metropolis Lille region 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.240
 I imagine then yes so it's true that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 there are two answers I was going to say to 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.090
 your question first is good 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 sure our vocation is the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.450
 metropolis Lille since our vision 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.770
 corporate is becoming the agency 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.060
 favorite of all arms buyers and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.520
 metropolis of Lille because we are here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 region we believe very strongly then our 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 clients it is especially the vod the great 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.189
 distribution advertising agencies 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.149
 who have very nice budget also 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.439
 and so also you talked about milan on 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.240
 is still obliged to be on the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.409
 international territory simply 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.030
 to retain our models 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.250
 so today we have agencies 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.590
 partners who represents us on 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.229
 London / Milan on Barcelona Madrid 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.479
 cape town south africa asia too 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.579
 is also just an example of our 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.570
 fashion models parading and also / / new 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.310
 york fashion week 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.020
 so always through the same way of a 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.709
 network so here we have a whole network 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.420
 international 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.190
 but it's mostly to retain 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.360
 our mannequins like that she travels and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.800
 after they come back so stronger 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 to serve our customers even better 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.660
 the Lille metropolis 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.310
 the customers he asks you what it is 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.780
 especially for photos of goats 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 catalogs not necessarily for 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.290
 parades actually so here in the in 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.050
 the Lille metropolis 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.910
 there are fewer designer parades though 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.500
 that we have two creators of creators 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.880
 who are really very talented with 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 different schools as in smad 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.150
 the occurrence but it's true 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.120
 that today yes no the fashion weeks 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.319
 and especially / paris / milan on new york 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.360
 we talked about it just now 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.280
 so that's why we also 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.290
 agencies that presents us on paris 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.120
 especially for editorials and fashion 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.250
 week by cons all the rest the photos 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.750
 catalog all that is web also 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.950
 advertising we have everything we need 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.390
 in the Lille metropolis at the level of 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.440
 customers then in the arranged also one 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.299
 all you need are only 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.200
 women but there is also something else 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.750
 children's men 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.519
 yes yes so in fact we have the license 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.620
 to work obviously we 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.549
 same as an adult and amenity so 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.780
 to make mannequins work at 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.540
 background so it starts as a baby 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.340
 at 3 to 4 months and so after that we can 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.060
 ensure a career I was going to just say 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.130
 that women who have about 30 35 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.410
 years since the advantage of the vod like 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.540
 you know it's a rendering 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.010
 of age that can go up to 30 35 40 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.590
 years in some catalogs 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.100
 of course and is actually for the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.780
 modeling 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.850
 once you're at home 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.530
 after we dream to go higher but 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.480
 say the 24 end up apart 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.230
 leave your models stars it's a very 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.730
 good question 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.170
 that's why you 're so I 'm going 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.459
 talk about loyalty because that's true 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.560
 that the particularity of our agency 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.579
 is that first in the north we have the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.989
 most beautiful girls in the world 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.370
 I'm a bit chauvinistic no but it's 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.600
 true we are girls who are not 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.140
 mannequins who are who are really 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.299
 beautiful 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.130
 so we recruit them we form and 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.260
 after obviously the big agencies 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.209
 try to take them from us so here we go 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.500
 that's why we decided to go up 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.810
 a whole network of agents this partner 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.340
 Renowned excavators and big agencies 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.709
 which allow us today to 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.840
 propel these high potentials 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.280
 so I confirm to you that today the 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.600
 High potentials are entrusted to our 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.420
 Partner agencies in Paris 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.829
 abroad and then we remain agencies but 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.019
 reims we call agency dies on and 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.500
 their agents the girls we see them from 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.610
 less and less but good 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.320
 we are always their agency mehr so ​​we 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.880
 is capable today of the Island 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.410
 propel on the international scene 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.940
 is very very quickly this is the case 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.940
 in fact, we currently have three or 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.890
 queues that are extraordinary and so 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.580
 in fact we do people 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.990
 anglicisms 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.430
 that's just integrating the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.510
 agencies that have a huge potential 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.040
 they are very young 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.180
 and here we are immediately 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.660
 propel them through our agencies 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.660
 partners 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.160
 so precisely the recruitment he gets 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.080
 does how do you do like that 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.340
 scouts what we all call for 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.260
 recruiters a little bit everywhere in the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.510
 region and to find like that the 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.500
 talents yes then the recruitment is 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.270
 quite special we have two 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.760
 policies have to sony politics and 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.020
 apple i was going to say sony where we hold 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.740
 constantly on the needs of our 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.090
 customers 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.650
 so obviously we work obviously 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.230
 and that a big sports group well 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.000
 known remains jean the oxylane group or there 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.830
 we really have specific recruitment by 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.530
 to their needs that's the 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.210
 first thing the same for the vod and the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.530
 large distribution and then the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.510
 politics a little bit more apple it's 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.980
 concrete the need so with today 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.600
 I was going to say we are very attentive 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.160
 standby compared precisely to 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.650
 new talents at the level of 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.300
 models and here we try to propose to 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.340
 our customers these new mannequins for 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.720
 just created a little bit the need 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.010
 at home whose recruitment is 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.710
 something very complex 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.930
 we do it via our website we have 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.600
 a lot of requests we do it 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.979
 same while traveling looking even though 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.729
 in Lille 1 as I 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.870
 said 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.160
 and then we also have what are called 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.229
 saoud who are agents who 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.669
 work with us and who know 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.070
 the profiles we are looking for 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.930
 and that's when they are the profiles they 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.430
 tell us we're going there and it's mount 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.320
 then recruited in terms of 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.669
 clientele to finish if he had to 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.229
 should in any case maybe not 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.940
 disappear but really have more 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.340
 in addition to struggling to survive is what 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.810
 you too would be touched by 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.200
 precisely this important customer who you 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.000
 leave then lavea will remain and I 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.740
 will be from the bottom of the heart since I 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.870
 say loudly it's also thanks to them 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.100
 today we arrived here because 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.430
 that they believed in us and continue to
