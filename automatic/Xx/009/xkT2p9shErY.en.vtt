00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi people thanks a day only 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.170
 welcome to the performance test of the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.700
 small huawei s and mail we want 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 now look like the games too 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.900
 we have the trigger and function 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.780
 real racing 3 d those are pretty much the ones 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 most elaborate then for example graphic 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.260
 and then test performance 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 Let's look at it for a moment 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.470
 Benchmark results are as if they were 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.119
 do not go through I can show you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.380
 just the results and we 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.570
 want to look like we are so with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 lavish pages come clearly we go 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.630
 But we do with the games I have 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 summoned here before so when I 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 See these funny ugly introns 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 have to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.770
 we just keep going yes that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.379
 we know that we are here at the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 Trigger a 3d game with really nice ones 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.300
 graphic what can we test this one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 can a bit hissed through the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 move and so what here jerky 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.690
 nothing the graphic is wonderful already 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.820
 what are these ugly little ones 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.050
 I'm okay 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.809
 destroyed so everything fits shoot what 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.120
 We'll go over everything and look over it 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.830
 something the next level makes so 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
 rather, everything looks right here 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.450
 liquid here is not great what 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 to complain 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.380
 Well, the next level would be loading 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 Let's just go over to real racing 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 I have played the first time now 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.689
 I have to admit I do not know if that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.250
 always so is the graphics somehow 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.220
 does not bother what so I find it 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.439
 not that it's really fluid, though 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 maybe it always works like that you know 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.610
 that maybe better I try 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.140
 not driving like a woman now yes 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.210
 I know women do better is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.290
 that's clear and what I want anyway 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.710
 be cool and make such a claim so 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.729
 Well that does not give you something 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.560
 great to test 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 Maybe we have to gesture the camera 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.780
 through the different camera techniques 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.110
 Let's see how it works backwards 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.540
 also do not drive so brake well 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.310
 that was great testing that's on 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.250
 every case the performance of real 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.630
 racing 3 Let's go look like this 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:09.660
 short the results on the day 59.75 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.869
 the second 1657 then we have no 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.180
 default 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.110
 how do I see here with browser 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.690
 probably no system information 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.940
 There is no clue what is here 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.430
 our result was i can give you up 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.599
 every sign and tudou 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.489
 we see that here 15 1660 yes we 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.209
 still wanted to enter the browser like that 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.549
 looks 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.349
 I do not know about things like that 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.560
 world so that we nothing before 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.150
 loaded or something in the cafÃ© or something 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.720
 We want to know how 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.040
 are correct loading times and that is 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.569
 the performance i dont know if i am 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.730
 be happy with it or if I'm there 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.730
 it already takes time to bother 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.659
 that lays on my wlan although the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.549
 page is so elaborate 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.909
 I can not tell you how can 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.579
 we for comparison short lg optimus no 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.140
 but lg optimus g lay next to it and 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.239
 look if this is just as long 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.950
 needs browser 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.359
 Of course, I was not here, either 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.160
 on the world.com 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:22.180
 Let's take a look here too 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.090
 long good you can see it was here 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.069
 could be a lot faster now 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.319
 at the huawei essential avoidance 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:36.489
 Let's take a mirror online 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:38.139
 next to it spiegel.de of course it is yes 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.989
 also a much bigger display where much 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.910
 more must be loaded or adapted 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:53.519
 if it could be because I know it 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:53.519
 we do not do spiegel.de and go 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.590
 good though that was actually that 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.450
 was not bad was probably right 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.200
 similar to the time when we have one 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.200
 select article 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.239
 the lg optimus ui is always there 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.200
 little bit before I would there 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.720
 claim now 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.519
 Let's go back to the world well 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.870
 we have the mobile on it 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.419
 could it lie here we have the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.150
 desktop view that would of course already 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:29.680
 a reason why we want to view 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.430
 here, too, if they are at the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.630
 users 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.700
 Let's take a look at the brain and catch it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.350
 but now works relatively fluently 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.750
 I just thought it's a bit 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.919
 Incidentally, this is also the lg optimus knee 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.070
 not so fast grandeur turns 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:53.370
 you're high so you do not say oh that is 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.370
 but not so fast or not so bright 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.870
 yes I can show you here big 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:08.740
 no problem 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:11.410
 let's learn this article 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.440
 both now a bit the lg 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.450
 but much faster 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.340
 I think here you still sleep no there 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.930
 once arrived came back again 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.300
 and look like that with the video 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.160
 play goes because we just have one 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.510
 video also seen in de burgh and 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.789
 After that we are already finished 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.930
 think about it now you could already 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.930
 See how the performance is 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.930
 world.com 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:49.280
 the worldcom is exactly the search I like 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.750
 By the way, this display rotation even works 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.180
 do not go up and look like that 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.050
 first person shooter on buddy police 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.600
 camps link video description detail 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:07.400
 youngest works from the loading times 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:10.160
 good yes that webber food mate is huge 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.850
 the browser performance just not so 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.500
 then in my review you will be 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.100
 probably see more clearly 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:25.150
 that's just a little between 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.150
 test because it is only romantic in the evening 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:37.960
 then you can do what I think 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.530
 journalist film maker now has one 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.030
 took a little something I think you 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.860
 but know what I am 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.360
 what I was going for was the performance 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.360
 of the huawei eat away
