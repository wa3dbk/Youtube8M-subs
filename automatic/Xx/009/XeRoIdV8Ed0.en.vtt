00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.240 
pretty crazy spot but i wanted to talk
about<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.690> idea<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.020> bluffing<00:00:19.529> over<00:00:19.800> bets<00:00:19.980> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
about the idea of bluffing over bets in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.679 
about the idea of bluffing over bets in
general<00:00:20.670> because<00:00:20.970> i<00:00:21.210> don't<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.449> it's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
general because i don't think it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.660 
general because i don't think it's
really<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> topic<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.769> many<00:00:23.160> people<00:00:23.519> have

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
really a topic that many people have

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.179 
really a topic that many people have
looked<00:00:23.850> into<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.869> i<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:26.010> fun

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
looked into and i think it would be fun

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.060 
looked into and i think it would be fun
end<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> guys<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.090> check<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.859> are

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
end for you guys to check out so we are

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.959 
end for you guys to check out so we are
six<00:00:29.820> handed<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:31.650> three<00:00:31.980> bet<00:00:32.160> after<00:00:32.850> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
six handed we get three bet after we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.729 
six handed we get three bet after we
raised<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> screen<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.230> small<00:00:34.559> one

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
raised with a screen in the small one

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.650 
raised with a screen in the small one
and<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.460> decide<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> call<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.450> we're

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and we decide to call because we're

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389 
and we decide to call because we're
against<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.050> tough<00:00:37.200> aggressive<00:00:37.530> regulate<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
against a tough aggressive regulate and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.240 
against a tough aggressive regulate and
we<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.360> 150<00:00:40.230> big<00:00:40.410> blinds<00:00:40.800> deep<00:00:41.010> before

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
we are about 150 big blinds deep before

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.779 
we are about 150 big blinds deep before
the<00:00:41.489> end<00:00:41.640> starts<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.160> calling<00:00:44.160> i<00:00:44.340> think<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the end starts so calling i think is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.110 
the end starts so calling i think is
fine<00:00:45.059> re<00:00:45.989> raising<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.860> fine<00:00:47.190> too<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.910> could

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
fine re raising is fine too but we could

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
fine re raising is fine too but we could
get<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> tough<00:00:48.660> spot<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.230> he<00:00:49.739> comes<00:00:49.890> over<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
get in a tough spot if he comes over the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.729 
get in a tough spot if he comes over the
top<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.520> our<00:00:50.789> four<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.300> given<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.350> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
top of our four but given that we are so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.069 
top of our four but given that we are so
deep<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.730> pretty<00:00:54.660> unlikely

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
deep it's going to be pretty unlikely

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
deep it's going to be pretty unlikely
that<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> best<00:00:56.370> hand<00:00:56.460> in

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that we get in with the best hand in

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.650 
that we get in with the best hand in
that<00:00:56.910> situation<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> flop<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.270> decided

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that situation so on the flop we decided

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.260 
that situation so on the flop we decided
to<00:01:00.719> check<00:01:00.899> call<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.379> i<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.829> fine

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
to check call which i think is fine

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.570 
to check call which i think is fine
we'll<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.840> facing<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.350> lot<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.500> mist<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:04.979> cards

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
we'll be facing a lot of mist over cards

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
we'll be facing a lot of mist over cards
or<00:01:05.760> maybe<00:01:06.000> even<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.600> sex<00:01:07.020> hens<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.650> beat<00:01:08.960> so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
or maybe even a sex hens that we beat so

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.630 
or maybe even a sex hens that we beat so
just<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> intention<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
just that have the intention of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
just that have the intention of
barreling<00:01:12.060> us<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.420> turns<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.930> rivers<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
barreling us on turns and rivers the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.840 
barreling us on turns and rivers the
turn<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.820> five<00:01:15.299> which<00:01:16.290> i<00:01:16.740> guess<00:01:17.220> probably

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
turn is a five which i guess probably

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
turn is a five which i guess probably
makes<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> people<00:01:18.990> shut<00:01:19.259> down<00:01:19.470> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
makes a lot of people shut down just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
makes a lot of people shut down just
because<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.909> unlikely<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
because it's going to be unlikely that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.320 
because it's going to be unlikely that
it<00:01:22.290> appears<00:01:23.159> unlikely<00:01:23.340> i<00:01:23.670> should<00:01:23.909> say<00:01:24.119> that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it appears unlikely i should say that

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.730 
it appears unlikely i should say that
we're<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.869> checked<00:01:25.170> folding<00:01:25.560> any

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
we're going to be checked folding any

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
we're going to be checked folding any
end<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.729> wouldn't<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.150> check<00:01:27.750> folding

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
end like we wouldn't be check folding

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.130 
end like we wouldn't be check folding
tens<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.979> opponent's<00:01:29.430> mind<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.869> like

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
tens in this opponent's mind or and like

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
tens in this opponent's mind or and like
you<00:01:31.439> know<00:01:31.470> six<00:01:31.860> seven<00:01:32.250> suited<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.210> have

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you know six seven suited if we have

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.609 
you know six seven suited if we have
that<00:01:33.420> somehow<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.119> river<00:01:36.479> ace<00:01:36.900> we

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that somehow so on the river ace we

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
that somehow so on the river ace we
decide<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> check<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.909> our<00:01:39.030> opponent<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> let

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
decide to check to our opponent to let

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.289 
decide to check to our opponent to let
him<00:01:39.810> represent<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.439> which<00:01:40.829> i<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
him represent it which i think is

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.660 
him represent it which i think is
probably<00:01:42.299> pretty<00:01:42.509> standard<00:01:43.189> to<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.280> checking

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
probably pretty standard to be checking

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
probably pretty standard to be checking
a<00:01:44.759> lot<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.000> our<00:01:45.149> range<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.689> heads<00:01:45.990> like

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
a lot of our range here heads like

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.410 
a lot of our range here heads like
pocket<00:01:46.860> eights<00:01:47.040> or<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:48.270> flush<00:01:49.399> or<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.460> set<00:01:51.090> really

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
pocket eights or a flush or a set really

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.749 
pocket eights or a flush or a set really
like<00:01:51.600> anything<00:01:52.049> because<00:01:52.950> reader<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.430> scared

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
like anything because reader is scared

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.520 
like anything because reader is scared
of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.270> Ace<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.899> want<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> check<00:01:55.320> raise

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
of the Ace or you want to check raise

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.060 
of the Ace or you want to check raise
and<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.829> value<00:01:56.250> from<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.579> nice<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.829> check

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and get value from a nice so we check

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.719 
and get value from a nice so we check
and<00:01:59.340> our<00:01:59.640> opponent<00:02:00.060> bets<00:02:01.250> twice<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.549> pot

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and our opponent bets twice the pot

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.020 
and our opponent bets twice the pot
almost<00:02:03.030> about<00:02:03.509> 1.8<00:02:04.079> times<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> pot<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.520> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
almost about 1.8 times the pot and I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.589 
almost about 1.8 times the pot and I
think<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:07.489> pretty<00:02:08.489> interesting<00:02:08.819> spot<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
think it's a pretty interesting spot and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
think it's a pretty interesting spot and

be sweet if you guys could just take a

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.980 
be sweet if you guys could just take a
second<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.460> anyway<00:02:24.820> I'm<00:02:25.270> sorry

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
second to do that but anyway I'm sorry

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.200 
second to do that but anyway I'm sorry
to<00:02:26.080> get<00:02:26.140> off<00:02:26.260> track<00:02:26.500> there<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:27.010> an<00:02:27.340> over<00:02:28.060> bet

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
to get off track there it's an over bet

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.770 
to get off track there it's an over bet
to<00:02:28.360> us<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> river<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.970> have<00:02:31.090> ace<00:02:31.390> Queen

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
to us on the river and we have ace Queen

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.310 
to us on the river and we have ace Queen
so<00:02:32.170> first<00:02:33.100> off<00:02:33.400> I'm<00:02:33.670> thinking<00:02:34.150> does<00:02:34.990> he<00:02:35.200> ever

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
so first off I'm thinking does he ever

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.400 
so first off I'm thinking does he ever
do<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.740> with<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> worst<00:02:36.370> hand<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.880> value

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
do this with a worst hand for value

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.430 
do this with a worst hand for value
pretty<00:02:38.410> sure<00:02:38.650> that's<00:02:38.950> not<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> case<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.440> for

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
pretty sure that's not the case so for

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.650 
pretty sure that's not the case so for
value<00:02:41.770> i<00:02:41.800> think<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.220> representing<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.450> a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
value i think is representing and like a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.270 
value i think is representing and like a
skiing<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.650> would<00:02:44.740> be<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.890> most<00:02:45.130> likely

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
skiing and that would be the most likely

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.440 
skiing and that would be the most likely
or<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.750> hand<00:02:47.110> like<00:02:47.500> east<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:48.070> suited<00:02:48.640> or<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:49.120> six

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
or a hand like east to suited or a six

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
or a hand like east to suited or a six
maybe<00:02:49.720> eight<00:02:49.990> nine<00:02:50.290> maybe<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.130> s5<00:02:51.490> suited

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
maybe eight nine maybe a s5 suited

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.440 
maybe eight nine maybe a s5 suited
although<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.950> lot<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.550> headstone<00:02:54.970> do<00:02:55.270> too

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
although a lot of this headstone do too

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.000 
although a lot of this headstone do too
well<00:02:55.630> by<00:02:55.810> betting<00:02:56.020> launch<00:02:56.320> street<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.890> then

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
well by betting launch street and then

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.670 
well by betting launch street and then
checking<00:02:57.400> back<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:58.270> not<00:02:58.390> like<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.650> know

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
checking back it's not like a you know

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.199 
checking back it's not like a you know
you<00:02:59.830> can<00:03:00.040> induce<00:03:00.310> us<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.760> float<00:03:01.000> out<00:03:01.150> a

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
you can induce us to float out a

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.820 
you can induce us to float out a
position<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.870> bluff<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.320> river<00:03:02.530> very

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
position in the bluff the river very

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.710 
position in the bluff the river very
often<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.120> doesn't<00:03:04.390> really<00:03:04.480> make<00:03:04.660> sense

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
often so it doesn't really make sense

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.480 
often so it doesn't really make sense
for<00:03:05.110> him<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.290> check<00:03:05.530> back<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.770> weekend<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
for him to check back a weekend on the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.430 
for him to check back a weekend on the
turn<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:07.930> thinking<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.890> he<00:03:10.440> has

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
turn so really thinking that he has

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.410 
turn so really thinking that he has
either<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:12.100> given<00:03:12.459> up<00:03:12.580> on<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.820> turn<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.300> is

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
either just given up on the turn and is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.230 
either just given up on the turn and is
now<00:03:13.570> bluffing<00:03:14.170> or<00:03:14.350> he's<00:03:15.130> betting<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.940> better

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
now bluffing or he's betting a better

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.570 
now bluffing or he's betting a better
hand<00:03:16.510> than<00:03:16.750> what<00:03:17.020> we<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.800> since<00:03:18.400> that's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
hand than what we have and since that's

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.810 
hand than what we have and since that's
the<00:03:18.790> case<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:20.590> also<00:03:20.769> think<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.370> he<00:03:21.670> would

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
the case and we also think that he would

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.640 
the case and we also think that he would
be<00:03:22.000> barreling<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.600> turn<00:03:22.810> with<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.170> better<00:03:23.410> end

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
be barreling the turn with a better end

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.490 
be barreling the turn with a better end
than<00:03:23.860> one<00:03:24.040> pair<00:03:24.250> anyway<00:03:25.230> should've<00:03:26.230> had<00:03:26.470> that

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
than one pair anyway should've had that

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.520 
than one pair anyway should've had that
hand<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.160> turn<00:03:27.370> i<00:03:27.660> think<00:03:28.660> i<00:03:28.810> play<00:03:29.050> here<00:03:29.290> is

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
hand on the turn i think i play here is

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.340 
hand on the turn i think i play here is
to<00:03:29.709> go<00:03:29.830> all<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.280> as<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.610> bluff<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:32.140> cool

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
to go all and as a bluff and the cool

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.979 
to go all and as a bluff and the cool
thing<00:03:32.380> about<00:03:32.850> bluffing<00:03:33.850> over<00:03:34.180> bets<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.600> you

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
thing about bluffing over bets is you

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.720 
thing about bluffing over bets is you
actually<00:03:35.170> get<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.500> pretty<00:03:35.739> good<00:03:36.160> price<00:03:36.370> on<00:03:36.670> it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
actually get a pretty good price on it

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.580 
actually get a pretty good price on it
is<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.060> bluff<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.780> mean<00:03:37.930> here<00:03:38.170> we're<00:03:38.320> going<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.500> be

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
is a bluff I mean here we're going to be

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.520 
is a bluff I mean here we're going to be
risking<00:03:39.040> just<00:03:39.940> under<00:03:40.150> 14<00:03:40.540> hundred<00:03:40.720> dollars<00:03:41.170> to

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
risking just under 14 hundred dollars to

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.280 
risking just under 14 hundred dollars to
win<00:03:41.739> about<00:03:42.390> nearly<00:03:43.390> twelve<00:03:43.750> hundred<00:03:43.840> dollars

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
win about nearly twelve hundred dollars

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.340 
win about nearly twelve hundred dollars
so<00:03:44.799> as<00:03:45.190> long<00:03:45.400> as<00:03:45.459> about<00:03:46.330> half<00:03:46.570> his<00:03:46.780> range<00:03:47.049> is

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
so as long as about half his range is

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.729 
so as long as about half his range is
folding<00:03:48.000> then<00:03:49.000> we<00:03:49.209> have<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:50.410> know<00:03:50.530> i<00:03:50.560> guess

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
folding then we have a you know i guess

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.620 
folding then we have a you know i guess
i<00:03:50.830> do<00:03:50.890> about<00:03:51.160> sixty<00:03:51.820> percent<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.239> syringe<00:03:52.480> is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
i do about sixty percent of a syringe is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.090 
i do about sixty percent of a syringe is
folding<00:03:52.989> then<00:03:53.140> we<00:03:53.200> have<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.320> profitable<00:03:53.560> bluff

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
folding then we have a profitable bluff

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.900 
folding then we have a profitable bluff
here<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.900> it's<00:03:56.680> something<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.190> consider<00:03:57.310> and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
here so I it's something to consider and

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.660 
here so I it's something to consider and
I<00:03:58.480> don't<00:03:58.750> think<00:03:59.110> many<00:03:59.560> people<00:03:59.680> do<00:04:00.160> especially

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
I don't think many people do especially

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.850 
I don't think many people do especially
with<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.090> hand<00:04:01.299> like<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.600> screen<00:04:01.959> here<00:04:02.230> where<00:04:02.560> it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
with a hand like a screen here where it

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.050 
with a hand like a screen here where it
just<00:04:03.040> looks<00:04:03.250> like<00:04:03.340> we<00:04:03.580> have<00:04:03.640> such<00:04:03.850> a<00:04:03.880> good

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
just looks like we have such a good

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.880 
just looks like we have such a good
bluff<00:04:04.269> catcher<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:04.870> very<00:04:05.049> tempting<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.560> call

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
bluff catcher it's very tempting to call

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.740
