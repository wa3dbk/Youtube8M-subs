we're using it so accurately and to show
you<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:16.560> easy<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.340> apply<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.880> yourself

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
you how easy it is to apply it yourself

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.230 
you how easy it is to apply it yourself
so<00:00:19.050> I've<00:00:19.169> just<00:00:19.199> had<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.580> scalp<00:00:20.580> cleansed<00:00:21.029> with

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
so I've just had my scalp cleansed with

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
so I've just had my scalp cleansed with
our<00:00:21.509> scalp<00:00:21.839> cleanser<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.800> I've<00:00:22.980> also<00:00:23.130> heard

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
our scalp cleanser and I've also heard

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.939 
our scalp cleanser and I've also heard
these<00:00:23.609> Scout<00:00:23.880> tonic<00:00:24.329> on<00:00:25.199> my<00:00:25.349> scalp<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.829> my

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
these Scout tonic on my scalp so my

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.710 
these Scout tonic on my scalp so my
scarf<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.339> actually<00:00:26.640> cold<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.210> moment<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
scarf is actually cold at the moment and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.950 
scarf is actually cold at the moment and
my<00:00:27.839> volleyball<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.859> open<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.329> most<00:00:30.599> cases

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
my volleyball is open so in most cases

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
my volleyball is open so in most cases
our<00:00:31.650> treatment<00:00:32.130> area<00:00:32.400> is<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.820> front<00:00:33.060> area

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
our treatment area is this front area

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.599 
our treatment area is this front area
that's<00:00:33.750> where<00:00:33.900> we<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> focus<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.949> so<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
that's where we want to focus on so I

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.670 
that's where we want to focus on so I
suggest<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.449> start<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.170> central

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
suggest that we start from a central

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.819 
suggest that we start from a central
point<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.989> center<00:00:40.289> part<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
point so we just do the center part and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
point so we just do the center part and
we<00:00:41.309> generally<00:00:41.699> go<00:00:41.789> back<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.300> far<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.629> our

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
we generally go back as far as our

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.650 
we generally go back as far as our
fingers<00:00:43.289> Fannie's<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:43.949> 10<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.699> 15<00:00:45.059> centimeters

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
fingers Fannie's or 10 to 15 centimeters

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
fingers Fannie's or 10 to 15 centimeters
now<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.680> our<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:47.010> micro<00:00:47.340> needle<00:00:47.609> we<00:00:47.910> want

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
now with our little micro needle we want

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.080 
now with our little micro needle we want
to<00:00:48.179> do<00:00:48.329> small<00:00:48.660> quick<00:00:49.410> easy<00:00:49.949> movements<00:00:50.609> along

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
to do small quick easy movements along

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.619 
to do small quick easy movements along
that<00:00:51.329> line<00:00:51.570> backwards<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.920> forwards<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:54.239> my

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that line backwards and forwards now my

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.459 
that line backwards and forwards now my
scalp<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:56.579> still<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> bit<00:00:57.210> damp<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.230> have

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
scalp is still a bit damp because I have

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.060 
scalp is still a bit damp because I have
used<00:00:58.679> a<00:00:59.600> towel<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.109> towel<00:01:01.410> dry<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.859> hair

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
used a towel just to towel dry my hair

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.450 
used a towel just to towel dry my hair
so<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.059> certainly<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.739> dripping<00:01:04.739> wet<00:01:04.949> but

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so it's certainly not dripping wet but

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
so it's certainly not dripping wet but
it's<00:01:05.580> also<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> makes<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.079> much<00:01:10.229> easier

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it's also not so it makes it much easier

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.670 
it's also not so it makes it much easier
to<00:01:10.860> maneuver<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.270> hair<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:13.380> use<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
to maneuver the hair will use that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160 
to maneuver the hair will use that
little<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.009> damp<00:01:14.450> probably<00:01:15.450> easier<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.049> me

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
little bit damp probably easier for me

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
little bit damp probably easier for me
with<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.500> fingernails<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.430> Chung<00:01:17.700> will

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
with my fingernails but Chung will

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.410 
with my fingernails but Chung will
manage<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.079> by<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.070> fast<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.240> easy

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
manage to get by so fast for easy

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
manage to get by so fast for easy
movements<00:01:21.990> backwards<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> forwards<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
movements backwards and forwards with a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
movements backwards and forwards with a
little<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.299> pressure<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> feel

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
little bit of pressure you need to feel

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.749 
little bit of pressure you need to feel
the<00:01:27.479> micro<00:01:27.840> needle<00:01:28.399> certainly<00:01:29.399> doesn't<00:01:29.579> need

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the micro needle certainly doesn't need

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.819 
the micro needle certainly doesn't need
to<00:01:29.970> hurt<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.399> your<00:01:32.549> eyes<00:01:33.619> as<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
to hurt but it can make your eyes as you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.130 
to hurt but it can make your eyes as you
get<00:01:34.979> close<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> temple<00:01:35.969> this<00:01:36.570> scheme<00:01:37.020> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
get close to the temple this scheme is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.500 
get close to the temple this scheme is
really<00:01:37.380> stretched<00:01:37.770> around

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.490 

it's<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.630> little<00:01:47.110> bit<00:01:47.430> you've<00:01:48.430> been<00:01:49.500> moving

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
it's a little bit you've been moving

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.340 
it's a little bit you've been moving
around<00:01:51.450> obviously<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.600> left<00:01:52.840> hand<00:01:53.140> there<00:01:53.320> is

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
around obviously the left hand there is

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.240 
around obviously the left hand there is
the<00:01:53.680> easier<00:01:54.070> you're<00:01:54.520> going<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:56.010> feel<00:01:57.010> it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
the easier you're going to feel it

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.450 
the easier you're going to feel it
through<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:58.060> as<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.360> get<00:01:58.510> into<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.870> sides<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.680> go

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
through and as I get into the sides I go

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
through and as I get into the sides I go
up<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.910> bit<00:02:01.120> of<00:02:01.150> a<00:02:01.300> triangular<00:02:01.980> direction

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
up in a bit of a triangular direction

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.630 
up in a bit of a triangular direction
okay<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.440> probably<00:02:05.560> see<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:05.980> my<00:02:06.310> scalp

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
okay you can probably see that my scalp

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.430 
okay you can probably see that my scalp
is<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.850> little<00:02:06.910> bit<00:02:07.120> flushed<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:08.290> that's

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
is a little bit flushed so that's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.230 
is a little bit flushed so that's
telling<00:02:08.680> us<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.040> we<00:02:09.220> have<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.700> stimulation

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
telling us that we have the stimulation

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.870 
telling us that we have the stimulation
it's<00:02:11.140> getting<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> blood<00:02:11.680> flow<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.280> creating

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
it's getting the blood flow and creating
