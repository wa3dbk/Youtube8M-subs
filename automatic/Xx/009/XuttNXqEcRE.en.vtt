should<00:00:50.879> drop<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> title<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.800> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
should drop the title just like there is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
should drop the title just like there is
for<00:00:52.920> John<00:00:53.219> Cena<00:00:53.250> whether<00:00:53.760> he<00:00:53.940> should<00:00:54.000> drop<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
for John Cena whether he should drop the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.990 
for John Cena whether he should drop the
title<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> injury<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.320> real<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.850> my

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
title if the injury was real and in my

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.580 
title if the injury was real and in my
honest<00:00:57.210> opinion<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.690> think<00:00:57.870> he<00:00:58.109> should<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
honest opinion I don't think he should I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.020 
honest opinion I don't think he should I
think<00:00:58.859> even<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.280> Dolph<00:00:59.489> Ziggler's<00:00:59.820> got<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
think even if Dolph Ziggler's got a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.490 
think even if Dolph Ziggler's got a
concussion<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.660> he<00:01:00.780> can't<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
concussion and he can't go out there a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.189 
concussion and he can't go out there a
wrestle<00:01:01.949> full<00:01:02.219> match<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.960> think<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.080> could

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
wrestle full match I think he could

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.250 
wrestle full match I think he could
still<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.559> part<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.260> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
still be a part of it in a way that you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
still be a part of it in a way that you
know<00:01:07.409> jack<00:01:07.890> swagger<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.820> ultra<00:01:09.060> Del<00:01:09.210> Rio<00:01:09.360> can

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
