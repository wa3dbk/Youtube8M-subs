00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.749
 and michu cds and today's tutorial is 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.509
 this spring tutorial in shades 

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:10.210
 green the first step is to camouflage 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.809
 our dark circles and imperfections with a 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 corrector 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.820
 Y 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.980
 after applying it must crime already 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.480
 you know that I like to apply it with 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.520
 the hands as if from a cream 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.849
 treat yourself so apply it by giving small 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.849
 little touches 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.270
 next I'm going to apply my powders 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.910
 translucent so that the mp is sealed 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.949
 cream and the concealer and to last me 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.590
 much more time on your site and for 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.809
 avoid those unsightly glitters and 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.909
 then I will choose this dark color 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.930
 of bronze and I'm going to apply it right 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.930
 below the cheekbone 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.610
 I have chosen this baby in l'oréal virus 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.620
 because it is something super natural that 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.690
 What it does is spread it in the manzanitas 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.080
 like those from a lot to little touches 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.150
 and then in circles 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.370
 next I'm going to take a brown 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.360
 medium this is the shadow nones of the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.940
 pallet of get free and I'm going to fill in my 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 eyebrows with honey and then with the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.920
 same the same color and a brush in 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.170
 round big one I'm going to apply 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.350
 right in the eye socket to create 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.290
 A definition 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.810
 then I will apply this nice green 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.810
 yellow on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.520
 then I'm going to take this beautiful green 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.100
 grass and I'll extend it from the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.100
 half of the mobile eyelid to the end 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.969
 and finally I'm going to take a color 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:09.970
 little dark green but a little bit with a 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.660
 touch of blue and I will extend it just 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.540
 at the end of our eye in a small 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.030
 v shape and mixing it very well both 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 with the brown of our basin both 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.860
 like in the bottom part of our eye 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.810
 I finally like to return 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.720
 with the clearest case shadows the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.660
 brown grass and go back to blur in the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.640
 dark green and I also like to go back 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.349
 again to brown and blend well 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.410
 basin so there are no edges 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.569
 then picked a nice color 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.840
 chocolate brown and I'm going to apply it 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.180
 both right at the end of the eye as a 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.340
 little bit in the basin let's say more or less 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.349
 towards the middle and then as I have been 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.269
 eaten the color a little bit given to the 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.160
 brown intensity I will come back with 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.410
 the dark green and I'll go over it 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.080
 mixing not everything very well so that 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.690
 there are no edges 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.730
 with the brown color we are going to apply it 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.610
 all over the bottom line of the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.240
 eyelashes mixing very well the green that 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.640
 we had before and it reaches the 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.330
 Tear free without fear and we will extend it 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.330
 very well 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.000
 can host this eyeliner is the base 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.730
 de l'oréal with which I'm not anything 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.580
 Nothing happy but it is the only liquid 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.040
 that I have on hand so in the end I'm going to 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.620
 delineate from the middle of the eye to the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.310
 final and I'm going to make a small 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.290
 ascending alignment that goes towards the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.000
 end of my date and you know that 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.079
 I always like to review the delineation 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.360
 with black shadow and in passing the 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.690
 delineation with the brown shadow of 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.690
 down 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.770
 today I do not know why I pissed to put myself 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.240
 the false eyelashes first so it's 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.760
 what I'm going to do first we support the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.670
 false eyelash in the center and then 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.010
 with a lot of patience and we support first 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.450
 one end and then we support the other and 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.220
 we give little touches to 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.940
 make sure that it is indeed 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.940
 well attached 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.389
 and so if after the mask comes 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.400
 tabs apply it when they're already 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.680
 sure that the lashes are not going to 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.550
 falling this is going to make the eyelashes 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.040
 integrate 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.410
 well with the false eyelashes and we do not 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.770
 let's forget especially about the part of 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.770
 tabs 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:21.119
 and to finish the suicide this maxi 

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:22.919
 Jumbo de l'Oréal which is a beautiful 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:26.249
 pink color and the first thing I do is 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.379
 delineate my lips and then what 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:32.209
 filling with the same color the truth is 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.209
 that is absolutely beautiful 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.989
 and this is the look of today I hope 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.529
 that you liked it and see you in the 

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:45.529
