00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.969
 johann hearty further video of me 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.200
 is going on again with weapons 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.089
 and with bf 4 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.730
 yes, today's weapon is closer to us 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.170
 the jsg 90 is the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.939
 Today's 90's think I want it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.730
 Although already by bf3 there was yes 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.869
 already four there is this also 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910
 otherwise I would have this for me 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.710
 arms do not make money 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 and yes struckmann the weapon in the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 just makes a few points as many 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.020
 exactly I have no idea because I 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.070
 I have already freed myself 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.510
 no idea where I can read 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550
 how many points I needed for this 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.350
 that's why you just need a few 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.300
 Points for it just means a few 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 play important is not with the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.840
 the first game will consequently off the sniper 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.480
 really after each shot quasi one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.449
 refill ball do not have to start this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 up boom boom papers without even 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.949
 best known something jubi luca okay it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.510
 lets go 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.239
 yes I would drive there then directly 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.129
 on with the statistics or jan 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 statistics we start with the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 The fire department had this weapon 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.189
 contribute and 221 41 mediated with us 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.960
 and is thus in the average 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.250
 there are guns so sniper the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.590
 so now it really only on the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.909
 In other words, there are only the natural ones 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.140
 have worse and a higher one 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.700
 that is why she is just right in the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.970
 middle quasi the golden middle 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.900
 yes the magazine ripped the weapon amounts to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.820
 eleven balls that is simply world globes 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.770
 the times hardly ever in one 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 very high before when you really all 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.939
 ball had improved that 's just 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
 these eleven balls origo it eleven balls 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.960
 You do not really have to be bad 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.790
 say because there are things that I do 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 the stiffer the less and less 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.979
 most of them were eleven balls and yes one 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.229
 but not , for example, has moved 338 m 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.850
 unfortunately only six balls lobby sex me 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.079
 I only get six balls 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 would be a pity because that is real 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.890
 horny I think at least in any case 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 as said reverberation times is empty here 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.490
 come two seconds sounds high 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.290
 again a pretty good one after a long one 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.820
 time most snipers have when they are 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.860
 completely empty everything 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 as well as after a run in here 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.549
 the reverberation time is still a ball 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.229
 in the running or in the magazine yet 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.729
 which 27 seconds 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.220
 he is by and large the posterity 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.460
 time really good for the sniper 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.990
 it does not exist 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.030
 although now a very high view 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.880
 occurs much longer after loading 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.460
 need the ball speed of the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.050
 is 560 meters per second and about it 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.550
 you realize that this weapon is not synonymous 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.400
 the weapon is perfect for the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.930
 Distance is 560 meters a few 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.070
 hours even faster and for 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.240
 the sniper is of course the balls 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.860
 speed is also pretty important 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.060
 because the cow should also quickly behind 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.350
 arrive at the opponents in the reason 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.220
 taken as one shoots for example 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.650
 Furthermore, it knows how long it takes 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.280
 i like to kill that was weird that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.530
 means almost 4 milliseconds to 1624 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.170
 milliseconds is virtually gone as well 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.380
 fast so the ball is flying and up 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.820
 of course, the distance still hunting related 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.910
 not the sheet for me like this or 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.610
 next picture the pressure on the weapon 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.680
 is 12.5 meters to 100 meters the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.570
 means from 12 5 meters makes this so 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.090
 the damage falls over in advance or 100 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.440
 meter has got a stop on then 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.350
 to fall off my god what already has more 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 go and Chernobyl only has 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.510
 more many betriebsrat 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.190
 different ones to come 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.350
 but at least from 100 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.720
 meters makes a minimal damage and 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.930
 before 12 5 meters always the maximum damage 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.420
 Luckily, that too is very short 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.220
 a little worse 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.650
 So the 12 5 in the beginning is quite normal 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.030
 again at the end of the 100 meters 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.230
 not quite normal that 's sniper 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.060
 which in turn better than on 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.940
 distances are having the most impressive 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.650
 up to 150 150 meters leaves the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.480
 Minimal standard one also in it 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.030
 that this sorry is not the best for the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.490
 Distance is how you should be 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.110
 of course now the torso concern that 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.160
 means upper body and of course the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.840
 arms counted 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.290
 After all, this weapon will hurt from 100 to 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.390
 59 that means 100 percent in close combat in 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.580
 a distance also from 12 from 0 to 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.850
 12 05 meters and at a distance of 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.920
 100 to what do I know what to 28 believe 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.870
 up to 2800 meters 28 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.030
 how far is the company this weapon 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.560
 creates after that the ball is almost gone 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.770
 So they just do more harm 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.670
 that means you also notice it there 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.020
 weapons in much higher 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.489
 reach is also a reason again 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.380
 that this weapon is simple or one 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.669
 easy again you can tell it 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.110
 Again, that weapon just stops 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.790
 not the best sniper for removal 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.900
 is 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.780
 but he really for the melee 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.520
 more is yes as I should have said 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.370
 the torso shoots makes interjected 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.980
 damage of at least 100 to 1 1 from 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.750
 maximum 100 to at least 59 percent 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.550
 is a very normal hurt 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.570
 many sniper or even all i know 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.660
 now not 100 is completely 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.830
 Normally you should get that 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.389
 head meet what, of course I know 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.889
 actually always very well on the head 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.590
 trying to aim makes this weapon in the 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.389
 nahkauf a loss of 235 percent 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.580
 you could even have two opponents at times 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.180
 even had twice as much to live up to 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.830
 138 65 percent and that is basically 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.290
 Taken this weapon is also on 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.580
 Distances from 100 meters still institute 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.260
 that means you should really bite but 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.520
 always nice to see what but actually 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.040
 It is already known that the machine 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.000
 head meets 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.070
 yes we should of course the two 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.479
 meeting makes the females less 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.919
 harm and that does not mean that 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.479
 more ordered in not in close combat 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.850
 Fernkampf there she does him a harm 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:24.700
 from 93 to 450 87 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.640
 yes so then again very briefly 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.470
 well as its own setup again 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.880
 you have to think your own sniper 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.320
 which distance and really go 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.580
 but first of all, what is it? 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.030
 quite clear that you can not on the 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.140
 still wants to go further distances 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.780
 but I would now probably I just 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.060
 Plucked shit no matter 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.289
 Nevertheless, I would recommend already 8 times 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.910
 zoom in on the eightfold zoom 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.200
 simply most of the video you can too 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.510
 A 6 growth in addition to the is not synonymous 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.150
 he still bad this rome 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.050
 the first has it from the beginning on 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.639
 he is also very good 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.000
 either as I said the six 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.930
 try to wrap it up 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.700
 I never have anything for that 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.020
 variables around patients like you 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.280
 at least on distance a bit 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.510
 can do more useful that is up 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.560
 it is also a bit more usable 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.910
 not bad at removal on everyone 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.200
 if you're a little bit stronger 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.880
 can go on distance 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.870
 to the run with just leave 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.889
 Of course you can not do anything 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.570
 bit never wanted to see it 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.010
 silencers make video market in the 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.000
 reach of course much worse 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.380
 and sometimes you just halve it 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.570
 as an adjunct I would just do it 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.950
 an almost closure you can indeed 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.479
 accept it just find the circuit 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.310
 simply best just beautiful in the scope 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.750
 can stay and then you lose 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.409
 the opponent just not easy then 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.249
 much more pleasant 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.659
 otherwise 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.299
 whatever it difficult to go with the monkey 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.219
 Basically today I find the 

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:40.719
 mediocre as I said that I mean 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.829
 favorite after or are there others though 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.449
 you can even just playing in front 

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:46.119
 everything and really in close combat more 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.679
 I would like to give water as I said 

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:49.209
 but again too many weapons from today 

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:50.589
 money if you have a certain weapon 

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.869
 Want to write writes the comments 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.989
 otherwise I say yes loud rhine and 

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:54.989
 show
