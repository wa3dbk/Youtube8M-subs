 and today we will do this 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.259
 here is a wonderful 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.539
 fighter done he is not very difficult 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.359
 and any of you will do fine 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:25.050
 near tom like a real plane 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.689
 model airplane and I think you will find him 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.109
 worthy use 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:36.390
 let's take a piece of paper 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.940
 A4 and folded in half with him 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.390
 two opposite sides of each 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.390
 a friend 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.829
 we set 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:03.270
 now the upper has opened 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.270
 side in front side 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.930
 reveal 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:29.420
 now remove the top side and the other 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.420
 side corner and flowers to him. 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.320
 we open we turn the workpiece on 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.100
 the other side and removed these little corners here 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.100
 here with these points 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.130
 ironed 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.140
 uncover flip click on 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:27.520
 the middle is clearer mtouch the middle 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.520
 sides of satiety lines rely on top 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:35.740
 got such a billet then 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 turn down that side 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.570
 This gunner and connect with this line 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.570
 under this 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.310
 lay 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.450
 bend 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.160
 I bend down this little corner of the systems back 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.160
 this side of this line 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.710
 bend back 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.990
 then bend this little corner and with it 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.990
 this side here with this line 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.840
 do it carefully 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.720
 and then this edge with him here with this 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.720
 line 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:58.660
 here we turn down this little corner 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.660
 along the line passing here 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.160
 with him that side and weatherization 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.720
 either im back from this side doing that 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.080
 same thing with him this side and here 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.080
 this line 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.400
 bend back the blue of this side and here 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.400
 this line 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.850
 and then bend the corner of the stage aside and 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.850
 this line 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:07.430
 Here we drove got here such 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.520
 we will proceed further or either 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:16.850
 corner and with a little indentation from 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:19.310
 the corner from here is a centimeter payable 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.740
 from here and spend so in pliny 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.740
 and not gepai 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.900
 therefore the tern line turned out 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:41.610
 proper 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:45.289
 It happened on the heart of the country 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.289
 bend symmetrically 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.430
 here is also not a big mouth under the lid 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.449
 Here is such a template for 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.569
 aircraft 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:07.960
 we are ready then bend the tip 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.960
 a couple of centimeters 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:23.240
 bent and fold in here is the tip 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:24.740
 so do our billet here this 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:32.499
 corner bend 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.499
 out and then 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.710
 straightens ears 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.550
 driven holidaymakers 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.320
 and about can 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.389
 it was like a booth 

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:17.610
 and now it remains only to make him 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:19.459
 tail for this we beat the type 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:26.189
 corner 

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:27.979
 adjustable and ironed here again 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:32.149
 I repeat 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:34.579
 just takes and teaches we lift up and 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:38.869
 along this line 

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:41.009
 correct and iron 

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.909
 now we just have to straighten 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:48.559
 our board 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:48.559
 and here is our fighter ready 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.550
 on this our lesson is over i am again 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:01.240
