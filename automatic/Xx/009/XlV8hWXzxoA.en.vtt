00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.680
 hello in the next video we want 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.940
 demonstrate good as we do the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.940
 checks on network consoles of the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.820
 screens 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.199
 we have for sale iphone 4 iphone 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.550
 4s as well as in 3g and 3gs when 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.470
 first thing we do is a test 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.240
 visual a check that 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.300
 effectively what is the screen that 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.700
 let's put on sale came 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.620
 correctly we see that outwardly 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.559
 well this is all good that the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.210
 cheap connectors that are all 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.390
 all right there's none broken in 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.570
 structure and they 're fine then we had it 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.970
 to our iphone that we have modified 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.400
 For this end 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:53.250
 to check the screen that was 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.250
 correctly the lc of judas 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.110
 we connect lcd connect the touch 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 and we put it current and verify 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.180
 because indeed it begins to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.180
 Going on takes a little 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.750
 it is very important to have knowledge 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.070
 prior to the time of assembling this product 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.070
 given that good is complex can be 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.140
 perform shorts can break sashes and 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.710
 it is manipulated badly it can spoil the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 lcd if we squeeze too much 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.659
 it is necessary because to be a little 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.850
 used to this type of assembly given 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.850
 which is a product that comes out of our 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.050
 part 100% tested and logically not 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.050
 has guarantee 2 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.590
 once we get the menu we can 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.840
 check the touch that works 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.810
 correctly we verify that 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.070
 effectively the lcd does not have any 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.550
 type of dead pixel 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.210
 that the backlighting is correct that 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.040
 the touch is right voucher and once 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.340
 verified these tests we present by 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.140
 concluded what is the test and already what 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.140
 we will prepare for shipment
