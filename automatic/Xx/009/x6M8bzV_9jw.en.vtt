00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.580 

and<00:01:30.229> let's<00:01:30.530> put<00:01:30.859> a<00:01:30.920> half<00:01:31.490> cup<00:01:31.909> of<00:01:32.570> salt<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.350> cup

three<00:01:34.179> stir<00:01:36.009> in<00:01:37.009> cup<00:01:37.310> or<00:01:37.640> we<00:01:37.939> don't<00:01:38.240> need<00:01:38.539> any

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
three stir in cup or we don't need any

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.319 
three stir in cup or we don't need any
salt<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.700> next<00:01:41.420> what<00:01:41.840> we<00:01:42.020> have<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.439> do<00:01:42.619> is<00:01:46.329> put

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
salt so next what we have to do is put

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.940 
salt so next what we have to do is put
one<00:01:47.360> egg<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.469> cup<00:01:48.860> one<00:01:49.719> put<00:01:50.719> another<00:01:51.200> egg<00:01:51.500> in

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
one egg in cup one put another egg in

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.289 
one egg in cup one put another egg in
cup<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:53.409> put<00:01:54.409> another<00:01:54.740> head<00:01:55.039> in<00:01:55.250> cup<00:01:55.490> three<00:01:55.880> and

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
cup to put another head in cup three and

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.080 
cup to put another head in cup three and
put<00:01:57.259> an<00:01:57.380> egg<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:57.829> cup<00:01:58.209> in<00:01:59.209> tap<00:01:59.539> water<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:01.090> let's

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
put an egg in cup in tap water and let's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.550 
put an egg in cup in tap water and let's
see<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.390> results<00:02:03.189> in<00:02:04.189> in<00:02:04.880> cup<00:02:05.179> one<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:06.409> egg

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
see the results in in cup one the egg

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.720 
see the results in in cup one the egg
floated<00:02:09.560> in<00:02:10.429> cup<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.930> eggs<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.470> float<00:02:12.860> in

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
floated in cup to the eggs in float in

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.800 
floated in cup to the eggs in float in
cup<00:02:14.329> 3<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:16.069> advent<00:02:16.700> flood<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.299> cup<00:02:17.480> or<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
cup 3 the advent flood and cup or the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.009 
cup 3 the advent flood and cup or the
egg<00:02:18.230> template<00:02:18.799> so<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.819> reason<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:20.569> egg<00:02:20.750> did

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
egg template so the reason the egg did

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.520 
egg template so the reason the egg did
they<00:02:21.230> floated<00:02:21.799> in<00:02:22.040> cup<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:23.120> because<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
they floated in cup one is because the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.809 
they floated in cup one is because the
egg<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.459> salt<00:02:25.760> makes<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.569> water<00:02:26.810> more<00:02:27.019> dense

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
egg the salt makes the water more dense

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.869 
egg the salt makes the water more dense
so<00:02:28.819> now<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.739> thank<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:31.069> watching<00:02:31.400> my<00:02:31.489> video
