00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 the printers are always next to the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 micro right and their functioning 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.920
 may seem simple, it is a result of 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.730
 more pure technology 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.730
 see how it works 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.529
 when you are at home or at work? 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 office and writes a text in the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.980
 computer often ends up printing 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.960
 result is not 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.329
 just click the button and then the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.450
 paper with your work comes out in the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.700
 Printer seems very simple but which 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.280
 way until the ink sticks to the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.379
 paper has already tried to decipher this process 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.750
 so take a look to learn how 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.440
 a printer operates in this case a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.000
 Inkjet 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 as soon as you click the print button 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.379
 the information contained in the word file 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.329
 the powerpoint for example are sent 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.550
 printer software is the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.379
 the printer processor that completes the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.090
 process of transforming what 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.159
 is on the computer in a code 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.380
 understood by the chip of the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.780
 without this conversation between the two 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 impossible to print anything 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.869
 but there the doubt is how the figures are 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.130
 reproduced without any error exactly 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.240
 the way it is in the file that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.580
 I sent first 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.080
 This is the task of small and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.080
 precise motors 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 there is an algorithm that does the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.610
 accurate positioning for each of the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 drop in the right position then when you 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.250
 compose a letter a photo then exists 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.950
 a specific positioning for each 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.619
 drop then ink placement in the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.710
 role is critical to the quality of 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.710
 print 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.119
 the stored ink comes out of micro-holes 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.640
 almost invisible to the naked eye in the cartridges 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.710
 For example blacks are 600 small 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.350
 points where the ink is dumped with 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.170
 millimeter precision every drop of ink 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.479
 sent to the paper has only 5 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 liter as it is technically called 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.020
 for you to have an idea of ​​how this 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.810
 amount of paint is small 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.209
 need a trillion liters peak 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.250
 to fill a 1-liter bottle and 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.470
 also in our printer that the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.620
 ink is still heated 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.930
 it's like boiling even then 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.450
 it warms up that region in bed 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.170
 and then it starts to boil 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.880
 Even if she creates steam, she spends the rest of the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.709
 bed ink with only 5 ml of ink 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.709
 it is possible to print more or less 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.440
 200 pages of text but the price of 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.540
 cartridges still hurt in the pocket so it's 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.549
 good to always keep some care with 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.060
 your printer 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.769
 are three aspects that we give yes 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.739
 considers it important for the good 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.620
 first paper print quality at 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.200
 paper has to be such a paper one day 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.049
 special but he has to be supportive 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.780
 to not spreading the paint, then 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.819
 appearance the other ink quality paper 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.709
 of ink matters a lot in the quality of 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.540
 printing and other positioning and there 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.730
 It seems easy, right? 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.650

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.609
 that uncover the functioning of other
