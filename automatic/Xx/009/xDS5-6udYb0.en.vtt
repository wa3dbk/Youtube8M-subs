00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You breathe all the lies I can imagine

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You take everything that makes us human

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Making me a rebel, a turncoat

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Making me look the other way around

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Telling me that I can never be

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What I always wanted to be

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That I believe in the literal

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Not the subliminal

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Minimal function of a mind in fear

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Will we lose our selves to this

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Or will we lose control...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Will we lose our selves to this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Or will we lose control...

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Raise you hands up pick yourself up

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is a coup d'etat

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Light the fire up go fuck'em up

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is our coup d'etat

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Avoid my resistance

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Ignore my existance

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
'Cause all you can do is fucking run

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Fucking run

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We're marching up march up

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is our coup d'etat

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
They can never stop this

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We won't let you take everything away from us

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You think you'll just turn the other cheek

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We will not ignore this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You crossed the line motherfucker

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Raise you hands up pick yourself up

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is a coup d'etat

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Light the fire up go fuck'em up

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This is our coup d'etat

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Break the walls

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Destroy the gates

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Burn 'em all

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Break the walls

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Destroy the gates

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Burn 'em all

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I don't care

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You think you're better than the rest of us

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Fuck you
