backcountry<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:38.190> random<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.610> renegade

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
backcountry so random a renegade

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.270 
backcountry so random a renegade
backcountry<00:02:39.330> same<00:02:40.230> feature<00:02:40.500> has<00:02:40.830> last<00:02:41.130> year

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
backcountry same feature has last year

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.300 
backcountry same feature has last year
but<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:42.630> year<00:02:42.690> consumer<00:02:43.620> again<00:02:43.920> will<00:02:44.130> have

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
but this year consumer again will have

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.730 
but this year consumer again will have
to<00:02:45.030> choose<00:02:45.240> between<00:02:45.360> two<00:02:45.810> tracks<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
to choose between two tracks the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.070 
to choose between two tracks the
internet<00:02:47.400> recorder<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.480> inch<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.050> half

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
internet recorder or the inch and a half

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.890 
internet recorder or the inch and a half
track<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> are<00:02:50.220> more<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.970> trail<00:02:51.630> rider

track so if you are more on trail rider
the<00:02:52.440> inch<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.920> half<00:02:52.950> would<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.430> probably

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
the inch and a half would be probably

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.540 
the inch and a half would be probably
the<00:02:54.090> best<00:02:54.569> choice<00:02:54.920> otherwise<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.220> inch<00:02:56.370> of

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
the best choice otherwise the inch of

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.760 
the best choice otherwise the inch of
the<00:02:56.610> three<00:02:56.819> water<00:02:57.060> written<00:02:57.959> again<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.410> deep

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
best of both worlds good ride in the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.580 
best of both worlds good ride in the
small<00:04:05.610> bumps<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.450> very<00:04:06.690> capable<00:04:06.960> ride<00:04:07.350> in

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.760 

the<00:04:13.930> reason<00:04:14.170> we<00:04:14.230> went<00:04:14.410> with<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.590> arm<00:04:14.709> motion

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
the reason we went with the arm motion

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.229 
the reason we went with the arm motion
was<00:04:15.160> really<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.459> try<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:15.700> deliver<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:16.090> ride

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
was really to try and deliver the ride

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.270 
was really to try and deliver the ride
that<00:04:16.840> everyone's<00:04:17.169> looking<00:04:17.410> for<00:04:17.440> not<00:04:18.010> having

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
that everyone's looking for not having

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.680 
that everyone's looking for not having
to<00:04:18.340> get<00:04:18.430> off<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.790> snow<00:04:18.970> level<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.269> adjust<00:04:19.570> the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
to get off the snow level and adjust the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.670 
to get off the snow level and adjust the
suspension<00:04:19.810> for<00:04:20.320> different<00:04:20.590> conditions

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
suspension for different conditions

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.960 
suspension for different conditions
throughout<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.310> day<00:04:21.430> or<00:04:21.579> even<00:04:21.700> throughout

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
throughout the day or even throughout

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.300 
throughout the day or even throughout
the<00:04:22.060> year<00:04:22.330> in<00:04:22.840> many<00:04:23.020> cases<00:04:23.230> you<00:04:23.440> can<00:04:23.530> just<00:04:23.800> set

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the year in many cases you can just set

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.220 
the year in many cases you can just set
the<00:04:24.430> snow<00:04:24.580> but<00:04:24.790> one<00:04:24.970> time<00:04:25.180> be<00:04:25.840> done<00:04:26.050> with<00:04:26.200> it

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
the snow but one time be done with it

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.870 
the snow but one time be done with it
right<00:04:26.980> it<00:04:27.130> from<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.340> year<00:04:27.490> that<00:04:27.639> way<00:04:27.790> and

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
right it from the year that way and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
right it from the year that way and
you're<00:04:28.000> probably<00:04:28.120> not<00:04:28.419> going<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.570> adjust<00:04:28.750> it

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
you're probably not going to adjust it

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.170 
you're probably not going to adjust it
again<00:04:29.110> but<00:04:29.860> at<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.370> same<00:04:30.580> time<00:04:30.760> if<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:30.970> want

to<00:04:31.270> be<00:04:31.360> able<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.570> adjust<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.990> we're<00:04:32.110> going<00:04:32.200> to

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
to be able to adjust it we're going to

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.720 
to be able to adjust it we're going to
give<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.470> all<00:04:32.620> those<00:04:32.770> options<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.610> can
