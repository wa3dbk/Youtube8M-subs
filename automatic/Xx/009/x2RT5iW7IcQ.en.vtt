eight kilometers to the summit the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.360 
eight kilometers to the summit the
gradients<00:03:43.750> barely<00:03:44.050> drop<00:03:44.290> below<00:03:44.440> 10%<00:03:44.770> all<00:03:45.280> the

these<00:04:13.750> kilometers<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.560> summit<00:04:14.940> we<00:04:15.940> almost

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
these kilometers to the summit we almost

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.960 
these kilometers to the summit we almost
got<00:04:16.330> this<00:04:16.510> slight<00:04:16.750> plateau<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.830> say<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.700> plateau

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
got this slight plateau I say a plateau

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.300 
got this slight plateau I say a plateau
it<00:04:19.180> feels<00:04:19.450> like<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:19.989> maybe<00:04:20.950> it's<00:04:21.160> because

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
it feels like that maybe it's because

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.190 
it feels like that maybe it's because
the<00:04:21.550> gradients<00:04:22.090> been<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:22.510> hard<00:04:22.780> up<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:22.990> this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the gradients been so hard up to this

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.850 
the gradients been so hard up to this
point<00:04:23.470> down<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.520> 6%<00:04:24.910> of<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.330> moment<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:26.680> whole

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.820 
point down to 6% of the moment the whole
area<00:04:27.310> here<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.700> just<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.970> vast<00:04:28.210> expanse<00:04:28.870> you

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
area here it's just a vast expanse you

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.530 
area here it's just a vast expanse you

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
distance it doesn't look like you're

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.170 
distance it doesn't look like you're
climbing<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.840> much<00:04:35.050> elevation<00:04:35.320> now<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.180> good

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.600 

making<00:04:56.300> progress<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:57.230> little<00:04:58.070> bit<00:04:58.280> slower<00:04:58.580> than

hear<00:05:02.360> this<00:05:02.710> solid<00:05:03.710> headwind<00:05:04.160> so<00:05:04.690> just<00:05:05.690> about

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
hear this solid headwind so just about

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.630 
hear this solid headwind so just about
see<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.410> summit<00:05:06.770> in<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:06.980> distance<00:05:07.430> where

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
see the summit in the distance where

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.270 
see the summit in the distance where
those<00:05:07.850> buildings<00:05:08.360> are<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:09.560> it's<00:05:09.710> completely

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
those buildings are so it's completely

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:29.379 
those buildings are so it's completely
open<00:05:10.430> no<00:05:11.180> shelter<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:12.470> is<00:05:12.650> a<00:05:12.680> good<00:05:12.920> day

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.110 

it's<00:05:29.900> quite<00:05:30.139> spooky<00:05:30.610> some<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:31.729> buildings

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
it's quite spooky some of the buildings

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.420 
it's quite spooky some of the buildings
back<00:05:32.300> there<00:05:32.539> look<00:05:32.750> almost<00:05:32.930> derelict<00:05:33.560> it's<00:05:34.340> at

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
back there look almost derelict it's at

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.980 
back there look almost derelict it's at
that<00:05:34.610> point<00:05:34.849> you<00:05:34.940> could<00:05:35.090> take<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> left-hander

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
that point you could take a left-hander

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.510 
that point you could take a left-hander
and<00:05:36.110> actually<00:05:36.349> cross<00:05:36.500> over<00:05:36.800> into<00:05:36.919> Switzerland

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
and actually cross over into Switzerland

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
same time is an utter beast still

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.939 
same time is an utter beast still
climbing<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.729> kilometer<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.180> go<00:05:57.500> ten<00:05:58.500> percent

it's<00:05:59.099> just<00:05:59.310> no<00:05:59.520> less<00:05:59.759> up<00:06:00.000> we<00:06:00.870> know<00:06:01.020> are<00:06:01.139> nearly

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
it's just no less up we know are nearly

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.010 
it's just no less up we know are nearly
there<00:06:01.590> so<00:06:02.120> keep<00:06:03.120> your<00:06:03.210> head<00:06:03.300> down<00:06:03.539> and<00:06:03.599> go<00:06:03.840> go

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
there so keep your head down and go go
