like them keeps the rest bike clean a
pretty<00:02:09.310> cool<00:02:09.519> paint<00:02:09.789> scheme<00:02:10.149> I've<00:02:10.899> added<00:02:11.200> a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
pretty cool paint scheme I've added a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.120 
pretty cool paint scheme I've added a
couple<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.970> extra<00:02:12.970> touches<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
couple little extra touches like the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.600 
couple little extra touches like the
little<00:02:15.340> strip<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.840> went<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.890> six<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.579> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
little strip I went with the six and a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.400 
little strip I went with the six and a
half<00:02:18.640> inch<00:02:19.709> dark<00:02:20.709> tinted<00:02:21.540> windshield<00:02:22.540> which<00:02:23.079> i

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
half inch dark tinted windshield which i

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.589 
half inch dark tinted windshield which i
think<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:24.010> pretty<00:02:24.430> nice<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.150> don't<00:02:25.299> catch<00:02:25.510> a

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
think is pretty nice you don't catch a

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.770 
think is pretty nice you don't catch a
whole<00:02:25.750> lot<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.049> bugs<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.209> low<00:02:31.329> profile

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
whole lot of bugs but it's a low profile

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.350 
whole lot of bugs but it's a low profile
so<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.290> looks<00:02:32.519> looks<00:02:33.519> pretty<00:02:33.730> cool<00:02:33.910> going<00:02:34.209> down

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
so it looks looks pretty cool going down

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.539 
so it looks looks pretty cool going down
the<00:02:34.510> road<00:02:34.660> too

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
the road too

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.640 
the road too
I<00:02:36.579> also<00:02:37.150> put<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:39.569> heat<00:02:40.569> deflectors<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
I also put the heat deflectors on the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.240 
I also put the heat deflectors on the
engine<00:02:42.069> so<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.970> helps<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.750> little<00:02:43.900> bit

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
engine so that helps a little bit

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.470 
engine so that helps a little bit
obviously<00:02:45.250> when<00:02:45.519> you're<00:02:45.639> moving<00:02:45.819> it'll<00:02:46.269> push

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
obviously when you're moving it'll push

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.110 
obviously when you're moving it'll push
the<00:02:46.510> air<00:02:46.750> down<00:02:46.989> through<00:02:49.139> storage<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.940> got

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
the air down through storage it's got

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.280 
the air down through storage it's got
the<00:02:52.980> saddlebags<00:02:53.980> which<00:02:54.370> are<00:02:54.609> nice<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.510> little

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
the saddlebags which are nice a little

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.860 
the saddlebags which are nice a little
cumbersome<00:02:57.099> too<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:59.019> get<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.470> but<00:02:59.889> I<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:01.630> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
cumbersome too to get in but I like the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.740 
cumbersome too to get in but I like the
the<00:03:04.500> big<00:03:05.500> storage<00:03:05.889> here

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.410 

so<00:03:09.750> gives<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.380> kinds<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.920> room<00:03:11.420> full

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
so gives you all kinds of room full

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.070 
so gives you all kinds of room full
helmet<00:03:13.170> will<00:03:13.290> fit<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:15.080> anyway

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
helmet will fit in there so anyway

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.880 
helmet will fit in there so anyway
