00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the parliament intervenes to change the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 bill that reforms the school is 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.880
 the request of the uil that together with the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.620
 other school unions addressed 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.900
 an appeal to the political forces for 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.170
 eliminate all the critical issues contained 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.300
 in the text prepared by the government, yes 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 can support whose school define 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.230
 important aspects of the relationship of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.600
 work as a pay schedule 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.390
 economic progression through a 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.039
 unilateral decision by law we are 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 satisfied with the maintenance of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.940
 seniority clicks commented on 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.090
 general secretary of the school 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.460
 maximum of menna is an important one 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.190
 result obtained also thanks to the uil 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.020
 school that defended the shots in 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.170
 absence of government commitment a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.910
 renew the national contract 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.000
 positive judgment also on card 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.710
 for updating teachers 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.250
 recognition that the uil had proposed 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.190
 for years, but this is not enough the question 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 precariousness is not solved positively 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.579
 entry plan but the timing of the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.589
 bill are absolutely 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.780
 incompatible with the certainty that to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.060
 first of September this year there are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.000
 all the teachers in the chair serve 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 a law decree on temporary employment 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 the school indicates one of the others 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.270
 strong injustice 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.909
 there are teachers who have all the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.040
 requirements have made the training are 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.170
 in possession of qualification are in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.909
 second-rank ranking 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.340
 are used in schools e 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.460
 despite this they are kept with 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.229
 fixed-term contracts have been 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.619
 excluded from the input plan in 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.829
 role 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.470
 before the competition announcement, the uil 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.210
 school also strongly disputes the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.850
 government proposal to be the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.159
 school manager alone to choose 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.990
 among teachers placed in the role 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.729
 those most suited to the educational offer 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.500
 of his school 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.899
 thus intervening not only on 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.540
 evaluation but also deciding to whom 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.250
 give salary increases 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.710
 the text states that teachers 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 of the functional staff are in fact 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.270
 used primarily for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.619
 substitutes thus weakening the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.509
 possibility of an extension 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.299
 of the training offer 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.549
 one cannot think supports the uil 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.700
 school to a business type system 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.310
 where the boss decides everything even i 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.560
 educational projects is a system that does not 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.689
 can hold and does not take into account the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.480
 collegiate bodies of the school and 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:30.230
 freedom of teaching that is established 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.230
 from our constitution
