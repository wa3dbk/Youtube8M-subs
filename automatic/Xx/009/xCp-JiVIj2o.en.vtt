what they would do now the witch queen
would<00:00:37.690> definitely<00:00:38.260> be<00:00:38.410> interesting<00:00:38.920> because

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
would definitely be interesting because

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.389 
would definitely be interesting because
she'd<00:00:39.760> be<00:00:39.880> really<00:00:40.090> Opie<00:00:40.510> if<00:00:40.770> she<00:00:41.770> brought<00:00:42.250> our

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
she'd be really Opie if she brought our

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.540 
she'd be really Opie if she brought our
own<00:00:42.520> skeletons<00:00:43.210> so<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:44.860> person<00:00:45.160> had<00:00:45.460> the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
own skeletons so this person had the

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.130 
own skeletons so this person had the
idea<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:45.910> actually<00:00:46.329> having<00:00:46.570> them<00:00:46.660> revive<00:00:46.960> your

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
idea of actually having them revive your

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.990 
idea of actually having them revive your
dead<00:00:47.350> troops<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.890> bring<00:00:47.920> them<00:00:48.640> back<00:00:48.670> with

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
dead troops and bring them back with

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.580 
dead troops and bring them back with
less<00:00:49.210> health<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:50.020> that'd<00:00:50.170> be<00:00:50.290> really

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
less health so that'd be really

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.020 
less health so that'd be really
interesting<00:00:51.219> guys<00:00:51.370> if<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:51.730> could<00:00:51.820> have<00:00:51.940> a

also let me know if they should come

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.940 
also let me know if they should come
back<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.310> half<00:01:18.610> health<00:01:18.909> less<00:01:19.330> than<00:01:19.510> half<00:01:19.659> health

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
back a half health less than half health

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.260 
back a half health less than half health
etc<00:01:20.950> because<00:01:21.549> I<00:01:21.580> think<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:21.939> actually<00:01:22.060> be<00:01:22.240> a

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
etc because I think that actually be a

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.609 
etc because I think that actually be a
really<00:01:22.479> cool<00:01:22.720> idea<00:01:22.780> but<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.260> think<00:01:23.500> it's

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
really cool idea but I think it's

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.140 
really cool idea but I think it's
something<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.070> will<00:01:24.189> never<00:01:24.460> be<00:01:24.580> implemented

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
something that will never be implemented

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.020 
something that will never be implemented
into<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.360> game<00:01:25.479> however<00:01:26.380> who<00:01:27.310> knows<00:01:27.610> with

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
into the game however who knows with

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.030 
into the game however who knows with
this<00:01:28.240> game<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.479> do<00:01:28.720> not<00:01:29.020> think<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.799> will

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
this game I do not think that that will

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.310 
this game I do not think that that will
be<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.220> next<00:01:30.820> hero<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.330> think<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.720> goblin<00:01:32.110> Prince

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
be the next hero I think a goblin Prince

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.230 
be the next hero I think a goblin Prince

enough<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.450> be<00:01:55.570> helpful<00:01:55.960> because<00:01:56.470> he<00:01:56.710> just

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
enough to be helpful because he just

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.319 
enough to be helpful because he just
destroyed<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.189> whole<00:01:57.369> bunch<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.610> defenses<00:01:58.119> and

destroyed a whole bunch of defenses and

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.780 
destroyed a whole bunch of defenses and
then<00:01:58.420> go<00:01:58.630> maybe<00:01:59.619> he<00:01:59.829> just<00:01:59.979> be<00:02:00.100> stronger<00:02:00.549> but<00:02:00.700> he

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
then go maybe he just be stronger but he

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.950 
then go maybe he just be stronger but he
attacked<00:02:00.880> everything<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.750> not<00:02:01.899> just

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
attacked everything and not just

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960 
attacked everything and not just
defenses<00:02:02.649> but<00:02:02.890> he<00:02:02.979> would<00:02:03.130> ignore<00:02:03.250> walls<00:02:03.670> still

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970
