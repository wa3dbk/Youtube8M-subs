00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.819
 everyone watches the fabs the cops of this 

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:09.090
 way with sandpaper 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.309
 let's go handle occupy the thousand daughter for 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.309
 work with this one 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.070
 fixed 1200 1500 and the last 2000 what 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 we are going to do is apply it from the mine 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.630
 sand with water about two minutes and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.950
 passed at 1200 the same 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.890
 procedure finish in finishing 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.720
 each league is mine removes all 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.540
 what is being the yellow of the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.970
 headlights while hundreds removed the 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.949
 scratches from the mine and so they go up 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.520
 get to the grade of Miss Na-2000 that 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.620
 it is the finest you are to leave the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.210
 last finish to leave the headlights 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.360
 totally 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.920
 be clean and this and the last thing would be 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.260
 polish it 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.100
 I have here is wax that is the purchase 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.100
 from here in the city 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.520
 polish about 10 minutes for each bale 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.610
 and they are as we see ourselves here now 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.400
 is applied to wax and 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.220
 procedure is already to give it a polish I'll 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 to try to record so they can see how it is 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 that are staying 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.090
 and how can you see the first hand 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.239
 the headlights are already much cleaner 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.959
 he appreciates them and right now what can be done 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.749
 do is apply another layer of wax and 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.299
 this and that are more shiny this one 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:28.380
 it's a bit opaque because the moment of 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.120
 I painted the headlights 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.860
 it was a bit open I have to open it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.580
 and cleaning it inside is not a little 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.580
 opaque but 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.100
 well here are the finished games 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.060
 I recommend it to finish 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.959
 final this 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.120
 the arm just a suggestion at the moment 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.800
 to apply this at the same time as 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.540
 aplicas do not let it dry because if not 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.940
 they will stain the lighthouse at the same 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.740
 moment they remove or but look they give them a 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.190
 finished super god 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.190
 ah
