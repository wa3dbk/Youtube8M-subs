00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.550
 hello to all these crises 32.6 m 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.080
 and we end up today for the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.470
 unpacking the wonderful of the gigantic 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.779
 gta 5 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 and yes as I promised you it 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.480
 is going to have the unpacking of gta 5 the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.800
 most anticipated game of the year 2013 even 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.410
 of the current generation 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.859
 it's pretty amazing sorry it's my 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.329
 portable 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.520
 So here it is here is the game so much 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.750
 waited for a 5 gta and frankly I can 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.059
 tell you that I have not waited for this game 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.399
 I have pre-ordered we will say there are two 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 month but it's about east to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.030
 at least two years as the first trailer 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.460
 appeared and frankly frankly 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.420
 it's the game of the generation 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.780
 so I'm really happy to have it 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.280
 in my hands and now the whole thing 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.789
 it's unpacking it and being able to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.979
 try 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.689
 so here's behind think you 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.500
 do not have too much behind it's like 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.049
 these one could see a little the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.509
 characteristics 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:20.310
 so here we go put it next to gta 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.520
 iv wishes to see it do well 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.060
 gta iv on the right and gta 5 on the left it's 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.040
 super nice so 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 so we're going to unpack it here 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.409
 the water 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.409
 excuse me I'm going to put like this 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:52.780
 it's really the game tent in tangier and 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.790
 here it is 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.259
 he is really very beautiful and small 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.770
 also note on the jacket is that 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.320
 you see the v there it's a little bit like 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.869
 to say a little in 3d a bit like you have 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.539
 on gta4 the book is actually it's a 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.509
 little in 3d too so here it's still 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.780
 better done it's super well done 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.030
 no frankly it's great so we 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.670
 we're going to brooms them to open it sooner 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.130
 but that there is no conan it's good 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.230
 here it is 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:31.060
 gta 5 so here we have the record with the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.810
 rather pretty girl here we have the map 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.000
 also the map by fumbling with the game the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.780
 really waited for this card 1 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 seven map rather cc I wanted to go back 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.540
 later and also we have the instructions for use 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.870
 also against 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.820
 yeah that's it then I see there so I 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.620
 the airship at tony parliament buildings 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.600
 debate because I pre-ordered the game 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.240
 and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.430
 So that's so cool so here we go 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.240
 atomic airship 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.600
 then I have the social user manual 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.450
 club is all there is in it's to 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920
 tell the orders pretty much everything 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.030
 has almost nothing it's just readers 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.970
 here and so the game then just before 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.850
 I just wanted to show you the map 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.450
 until then because it is very important 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.400
 here it is gc wait I expected it I 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.150
 will try to unfold it because she 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.020
 is where she really is I years old 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.750
 mark wahaha yeah anyway 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.490
 oula a well and I hear I do not know if 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.490
 you can see well but wow 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.250
 she takes all my office 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.710
 she and I am ashamed 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.890
 the amap of gta 5 and I really have but 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.850
 gigantic there are of course all the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.460
 activities and all and behind we have a 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.730
 zoom in on the city at lof could see a 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.660
 psy here plays on on how this 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.880
 bitch i'm going back like this so here's the 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.100
 112 so that's where he's from los santos 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.480
 if I think you all know so 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.130
 this is the map I think I'm going 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.790
 to hang it not far and for you 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.180
 differentiate 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.290
 here is the map of gta iv that was 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.120
 really small 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.550
 and here is the one of gta 5 you see gta 5 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.090
 she is really huge gta iv she 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.840
 is really small so that's it 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.540
 it was the hand 2nd j 1 5 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.090
 then we will be able to put the cd in 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.289
 the ps3 and we'll see what it's like 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.309
 much cost 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.309
 Let's go 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.350
