about<00:00:37.559> ten<00:00:38.280> skins<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.969> far<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.300> we've

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
about ten skins so far that we've

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.170 
about ten skins so far that we've
actually<00:00:39.660> seen<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.379> believe<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.070> also<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
actually seen I believe and also it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
actually seen I believe and also it
seems<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.540> there's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> jungle<00:00:43.170> biomes<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
seems like there's a jungle biomes in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
seems like there's a jungle biomes in
the<00:00:43.800> back<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.370> these<00:00:44.430> skins<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.020> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the back of some of these skins so it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
the back of some of these skins so it
could<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> possibility<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.129> may<00:00:47.460> get

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
