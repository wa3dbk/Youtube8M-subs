I keep thinking about gain is the bench
made<00:03:07.560> areas<00:03:08.130> with<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.840> m390<00:03:10.590> steel<00:03:11.000> came<00:03:12.000> out

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
made areas with the m390 steel came out

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.800 
made areas with the m390 steel came out
this<00:03:12.360> year<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.040> limited<00:03:14.400> run<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:15.060> 400

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
this year it's a limited run of like 400

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.350 
this year it's a limited run of like 400
uses<00:03:16.380> m390<00:03:17.250> black<00:03:18.090> g10<00:03:19.160> but<00:03:20.160> it's<00:03:20.310> um<00:03:20.640> satin

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
uses m390 black g10 but it's um satin

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.920 
uses m390 black g10 but it's um satin
finish

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
finish

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.310 
finish
I<00:03:21.959> thought<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.799> would<00:03:22.860> be<00:03:22.920> really<00:03:23.220> neat<00:03:24.320> and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
I thought that would be really neat and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.280 
I thought that would be really neat and
that's<00:03:25.769> from<00:03:26.220> knife<00:03:26.519> works<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.840> also<00:03:27.989> have

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
that's from knife works they also have

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.190 
that's from knife works they also have
one<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.940> in<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.920> 710<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:33.209> m390<00:03:33.930> steel

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
one like that in the 710 with m390 steel

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.870 
one like that in the 710 with m390 steel
I<00:03:34.549> don't<00:03:35.549> know

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
I don't know

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.000 
I don't know
so<00:03:38.269> it'd<00:03:39.269> be<00:03:39.299> expensive<00:03:40.049> but<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.590> might<00:03:40.860> be<00:03:40.980> a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
so it'd be expensive but it might be a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.270 
so it'd be expensive but it might be a
nice<00:03:41.250> addition<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.600> my<00:03:42.690> collection<00:03:42.950> also<00:03:43.950> be

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
nice addition to my collection also be

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.620 
nice addition to my collection also be

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
going to a couple more knife shows

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.949

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
see it might pick up some more bench

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:58.460 
see it might pick up some more bench
