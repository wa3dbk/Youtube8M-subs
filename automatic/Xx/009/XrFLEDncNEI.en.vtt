00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.509
 The digestive system is formed by the different organs that perform the 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.859
 digestion process these 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.410
 form a circuit of about 11 meters in length that are covered by the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.460
 food at each meal digestion consists of food discrimination 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.980
 in substances easily assimilated by the body 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.860
 Digestion begins in the mouth with the mechanical process of chewing 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 this process is complemented by the chemical action of saliva every day 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.510
 occurs in our mouth between a liter and a liter and a half of saliva 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
 it also depends on the individual min 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.900
 I was left the food and it starts with chemical digestion by a 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.030
 enzyme yamada and limia responsible for breaking carbohydrates the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.110
 crushed and blended food known as bolus goes on its way and 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.190
 going through the booklets reaches the stomach there food 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.200
 will remain for a couple of hours the gastric juices continue with the 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.590
 chemical digestion these contain hydrochloric acid he is a ph 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.930
 acid the current state of our lithium epoch is called 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.960
 and crossing the first reaches the intestine that its long duct narrower to the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640
 beginning form the small intestine 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.280
 and more that's why in the end forming the large intestine the small intestine is 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 where most of the digestion process takes place 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.270
 It is divided into three areas duhalde no 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.300
 dell 1 edition 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.210
 and has its walls covered with millions of tiny tentacles that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.510
 make a tube of about six and a half meters multiply its surface 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.030
 absorption reaching the surface of a tennis court 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.880
 here the secretions coming from league of the pancreas are poured 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.590
 pancreatic amylase to break down carbohydrates and the lipase that 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.350
 breaks 99% of the houses the next area is the large intestine where 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.620
 fundamentally water is absorbed by the bacteria that live in the colon 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.870
 continue with the digestion of materials that have withstood the phases 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:06.710
 previous 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.680
 like the tour 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.850
 whose importance is that they retain part of the water, preventing the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.360
 depositions are too recipes 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.350
 and certain problems appear in the final part of the digestion 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.250
 the challenge and the anus are the end of the digestive tract
