00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:51.219
 and we get killed both 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.829
 but I'm here 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.889
 unfortunately the epidemic is gone in its place I think it's done to 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.099
 the press from behind 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.099

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.219
 ol it is freshwater species 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.249

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.449
 if the ice 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.659
 I'm optimistic 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.889
 the racial criteria the company certified maxime bono 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:00.990
 well done 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.999
 at the bottom of 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.759
 bernard 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.120
 the couple 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.289
 I am proud regardless of the right click of the mouse 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.659
 the small business 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.699
 you follow him so he needs a lot of room 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.240
 and after that shakes if he creates a threat 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.960
 of cervical ascension and overall 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.660
 stabbing on spacefoot what is impossible to do this 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.319
 little reminder story 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.080
 a paragraph to iraq 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.070
 clp the gite de france and actively pursues I can not quote classic 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.169
 because m 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.309
 afp 6 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.520
 according to this source it goes without saying 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.900
 5 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.749
 only this risk increases between 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:49.479
 according to regulations 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.309
 according to this source 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.309
 he recovers ancient society 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:55.860
 all tips are advanced are rare 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.589
 the direction of rotation 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.319
 and gdf sweat in his blood text message and so I'm not proud 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.029
 do not hesitate to hold 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.509
 this said not all 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.369
 maybe maybe not and not a single set in his time and a hand fault 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.749
 on this text so it is of course too early perhaps 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.699
 last two classes for that I'm not going to worry a lot 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.099
 no with decadence 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.229
 taking into account these sep plates is a business plan 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:30.709
 so I can be good and vertical this evening or you get a call 

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.520

 this one the oxygen association 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.259
 the concept is simple 360 ​​and if your insurer of the print media 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:54.089
 and personal grc 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:57.509
