00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.819
 we will also show you the points of 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:12.219
 reference of the time band of a 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:15.519
 2.4 pt cross engine in 2002 with a 2002 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.650
 piti cross of 2.4 these are the points of 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.180
 reference 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.800
 these two points have to be the 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.060
 liquidated here on the crankshaft this is 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.669
 the crankshaft this at the point of that 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.770
 the terminal is up the piston forgiveness 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.230
 that is number one is up then 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.550
 these are the marks of time now 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.580
 let's see if we can visualize 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.620
 those in the high round this one ends the 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.120
 court the massage part all the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.120
 equipment are the reference points 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.670
 let's try to show jealous that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.570
 is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.560
 to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.560
 this sum 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.530
 and this is the note both when you're 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.530
 waiting 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.780
 so he can give us a band 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.210
 to try to see it up 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.470
 we can see, let's see a little 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.880
 engine 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.100
 we are going to access so that that license 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 time 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.579
 of the trees on the fence of the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.579
 camshafts that we bring 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:36.650
 we'll see all of them below 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.650
 but we will try to see above 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.320
 we wrote disorders 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:11.030
 one of the reference points that 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.560
 we have to stay like this everything will be 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.690
 all right 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.080
 the important thing is that we letters 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.080
 have here 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.799
 since here it has other brands but these 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.769
 they are not the ones who point you up 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.700
 of the pains 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 also here has its point of 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.800
 reference up then name 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.000
 being these up 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.000
 and the mosquitoes are eliminated 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:50.520
 they put their band 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:52.360
 we have to have the band with one color 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.430
 blue and pto 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.890
 we have on the side this is the one that 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.080
 gives the necessary adjustment the band so that 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.080
 do not stand and also 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.170
 this is the bomb that we have promoted 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.600
 also by the time band then 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.900
 bring 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.150
 he is great the lord 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.480
 from the water pump 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.099
 the adjuster of kindness the greater or 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.129
 crazy that is the one that is estimated in the hand 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.040
 soft and we have a tree grenade 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.079
 of cams and lotus in large 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.860
 this is all for the moment if we are going to 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.860
 keep doing miracles
