00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.210
 well the facts it's true so it's done 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.140

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.209
 compared to candles 10 balls can 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.190
 see the normal size n no photo 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.800

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.060
 take the affairs of the sacred effect 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.459

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.540
 banzai package 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.030
 we see the number 1 by the way 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.489
 support cheaper because last year 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.090
 she was at 7 euros 95 to 105 euros 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.060
 other open that's it 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.100
 effects came out better than the reflection 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.810
 here we have papers so the mountains of 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.670
 moringue bought me 3 it's the same 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.860
 for fun 30 tackles in total Walloon 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.209
 trompe pack here supers of the monges 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.190
 we bought only two young people and the sacred 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.519
 fien to balance the kids here 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.769
 decrypts in front of 85 cents of demons 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:04.709
 giant of the super mate demons change book 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:09.780
 and dealing here with the denials of these 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:13.560
 young people born 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.700
 afif packet or i 6 the fir crackers so 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.709
 to buy two packages I had tested 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.750
 local hervÃ© ryfflart 6000 his dolphin ma 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.480
 dear than on the fire magicians so 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.030
 they are at 40 while it is 104 5 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.250
 movies that's it frankly way i voice 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.570
 see demons machine gun 40 shots at 69 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 centimes so I guess it must not 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.049
 be expensive like firecrackers xx target 1 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.060
 50 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.850
 so that's equivalent in fact I imagine 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.519
 insinue fire at the fir petard sim here is four 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.840
 bundles of big demons unfortunately he 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.010
 is not that she has bigger so the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.810
 bigger than they had it was stupid 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.820
 demons but actually the biggest they 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.040
 arrive towards the wine feel me so I 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.260
 can go there maybe so buy yeah 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.650
 it is not that there are mountains of wadis 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.670
 and houses 5 then that's what so 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.850
 so as you can see he 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.010
 went more firecrackers in fact so had to 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.830
 not that it was me who had ordered 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.720
 in 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.600
 lee then if we had it for 45 euros 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.870
 65 exactly whose 45 at the store and then 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.780
 came on the easter fire 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.100
 this is having a good because its 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.100
 sister united here exactly
