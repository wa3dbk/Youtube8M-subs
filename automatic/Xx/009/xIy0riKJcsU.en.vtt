look<00:01:34.970> at<00:01:35.090> my<00:01:35.270> small<00:01:35.690> part<00:01:36.050> in<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:36.890> project

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
look at my small part in this project

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.090 
look at my small part in this project
when<00:01:38.630> these<00:01:38.810> products<00:01:39.200> were<00:01:39.320> all<00:01:39.380> out<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
when these products were all out in the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.070 
when these products were all out in the
years<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:40.490> come<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.930> was<00:01:42.050> very

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
years to come and that was very

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.650 
years to come and that was very
rewarding<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.890> me<00:01:42.920> personally<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:43.940> I'd<00:01:44.420> say

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
rewarding to me personally so I'd say

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.390 
rewarding to me personally so I'd say
professionally<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.530> was<00:01:45.710> probably<00:01:46.190> the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
professionally that was probably the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.370 
professionally that was probably the
biggest<00:01:46.640> part<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:47.180> me<00:01:47.270> living<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.170> foreign

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
biggest part for me living in a foreign

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.630 
biggest part for me living in a foreign
