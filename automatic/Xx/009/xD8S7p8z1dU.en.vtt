00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.730
 Hello dear gardeners 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.250
 visitors of our site garden world we 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.740
 Today 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.920
 about pests of our plants and about 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.820
 diseases 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.130
 Here we are now about to apple 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.130
 which in general is many years but you 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.039
 You see in what a pitiable condition she is and 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.640
 every year on it more and more more 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.750
 dry up the branches the hosts here here are pruned 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 these dry branches 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.699
 now almost from the trunk from the trunk 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.809
 you have nothing left 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:48.110
 and here here is the characteristic lesion 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:51.550
 Here we had such on our site 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.500
 questions from what dry apple trees 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.660
 a definitive answer of course can not be given 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.850
 it may be different reasons even 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.879
 happens that gnawing the roots 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.600
 some kind of mouse gutter suits there 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.369
 their nest apartments that is they 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.350
 there and pantries and all that is gnawing 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.830
 just the roots the tree starts 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.750
 there may still be some dry 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.680
 fungal diseases of nature 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:24.049
 here in particular black cancer look here 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.460
 this here is the blackening of the bark here it is 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.590
 Here is such a characteristic with cracks 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.759
 you will see deep here 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:39.080
 crack along the border healthy and affected 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.810
 tissue and if you start treating it derri 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.049
 tree as in some sources 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.979
 Some authors recommend this 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.479
 all you need to remove the affected tissue 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.549
 trim up to healthy tissue 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.250
 that's all and then process 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.740
 certain means certain 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.810
 I have cleaned up the drugs here 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.869
 even with your hand it feels like everything without 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.240
 any tools 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.220
 and if with tools knife or 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.959
 some kind of spatula here to clean you 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.620
 see that it's completely dead here 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.769
 wood and this one is black cancer 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.110
 spreads no longer inland there 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.620
 here that is, if you touch and no 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.550
 moist tissue that's not here it comes 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.330
 dry necrosis 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.430
 here is this black rax covers like this 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.210
 every year more and more 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.280
 the widest part here here began 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.620
 Apparently this infection 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.960
 it has spread now and this 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.200
 escape also see darkening and here 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.050
 farther farther further it goes and here these 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.210
 Here you can with great confidence 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.860
 say that they will exist well 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.190
 maximum one more season 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.890
 what's wrong with this disease she 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.170
 fungal nature and spores of it 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.530
 extend to other trees 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.590
 that is, if there are plants in your gardens 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.020
 patients with black and black cancer 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.360
 need to take serious and 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.050
 immediate action ie here 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.260
 these are all the affected branches that are best 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.780
 just simply cut down and naturally 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.570
 put their bonfire on this 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.000
 running and the tree and it happens that these 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.610
 amazed twigs they appear in 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.860
 crown in some places and here are their 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.030
 regrets because you see them 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.440
 flowers ovary 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.810
 and then the disease 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.320
 spreads and leads like this 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.050
 Here are the fatal results of the opinion on 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.770
 about black cancers are shared in 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.860
 literature 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.700
 some authors write that supposedly wood can 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.800
 save 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.000
 if to carry out treatment and even when 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.820
 vast areas 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.459
 affected that is this serious serious 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.030
 serious cleaning should be done here 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.780
 Here are these places all cleaned up to healthy 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.090
 tissues are where the borders go 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.940
 infected and healthy fabric chisel 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.060
 right this is not so sorry as simply 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.549
 normal piece of wood and continue to smear 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:21.570
 there is such and there are special preparations 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:25.520
 to protect here are trees of various pics 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.510
 such lesions either take 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.650
 one-percent Bordeaux mixture or 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.400
 three percent iron vitriol she 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.389
 there is an opinion that even these drugs 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.509
 weak sex 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.180
 help and it is better not to engage in any 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.610
 treatment and just get rid of these 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.410
 affected branches but in this case 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.280
 even from the whole tree and plant near 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.639
 somewhere 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.300
 but nearby or elsewhere young 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.520
 tree 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.460
 here in this garden already done this then 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.960
 there is a new tree planted but this 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.289
 tree of course you need to immediately 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.370
 clean up how black cancers spread 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.860
 where does he come from black cancer here it is 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.740
 these spores of this fungus pathogen they 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.960
 settle in cracks dwarf in frost 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.090
 warriors in different or were they 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.740
 mechanical some kind of damage then 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.210
 there are the usual even the floor and 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.120
 or is it damage 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.820
 insect pests under in forks 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.220
 branches right here maybe if you know 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.740
 you need to clean these trash here 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.449
 which accumulates here to clear 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.599
 old bark here then your tree will 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:43.449
 more resistant to this disease yet 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:47.410
 Of course annually spend pro whitewashing a 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.280
 canopy of trees added to the solution 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.289
 the lime 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:56.349
 copper sulphate and these are all 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:59.740
 of course they can protect 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.960
 your plant for black cancer but the most 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.909
 the main thing is to keep track of your 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.270
 trees and clean up on time 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:10.419
 Well, that's only if there were small 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.880
 twigs immediately clean them with shears and 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.479
 immediately into the fire like that 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:21.520
 disease if she is somewhere 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:22.300
 appears in the garden plots then dry 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.240
 apple trees 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.780
 one after another if gardeners are not 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.870
 take no action and it turns out that 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.090
 shrink entire gardens so here keep 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.110
 in view please inform 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.919
 their neighbors 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.919
 look at your trees and take action
