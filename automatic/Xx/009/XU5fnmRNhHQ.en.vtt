with the stories heading from here
because<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:17.980> assume<00:03:18.310> after<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:19.060> it's<00:03:19.269> going

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
because I assume after this it's going

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.599 
because I assume after this it's going
to<00:03:19.630> jump<00:03:19.870> five<00:03:20.170> years<00:03:20.440> back<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.220> present

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
to jump five years back to the present

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.960 
to jump five years back to the present
that<00:03:21.880> was<00:03:22.090> set<00:03:22.329> in<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.600> first<00:03:22.870> chapter<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
that was set in the first chapter the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.520 
that was set in the first chapter the
only<00:03:25.150> thing<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.420> really<00:03:25.540> bars<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.109> chapter

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
only thing that really bars this chapter

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.020 
only thing that really bars this chapter
down<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.010> felt<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.280> little<00:03:27.430> short<00:03:27.850> but

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
down is it felt a little short but

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.819 
down is it felt a little short but
because<00:03:28.329> it's<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.600> chapter<00:03:29.109> in<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.350> longer

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
because it's a chapter in a longer

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.990 
because it's a chapter in a longer
series<00:03:30.389> I'm<00:03:31.389> kind<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.989> okay<00:03:32.139> with<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:33.000> so

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
series I'm kind of okay with that so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.759 
series I'm kind of okay with that so
