people<00:00:01.170> have<00:00:01.350> been<00:00:01.560> saying<00:00:01.860> they<00:00:02.100> don't<00:00:02.250> know

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
people have been saying they don't know

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.130 
people have been saying they don't know
how<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.490> dispose<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.480> waste<00:00:03.510> from<00:00:04.110> a

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
how to dispose of the waste from a

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.930 
how to dispose of the waste from a
reactor<00:00:04.650> craft<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:05.160> I'm<00:00:05.339> gonna<00:00:05.460> make<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> quick

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
reactor craft so I'm gonna make a quick

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.880 
reactor craft so I'm gonna make a quick
video<00:00:06.299> showing<00:00:06.540> what<00:00:07.259> you're<00:00:07.379> supposed<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.770> do

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
video showing what you're supposed to do

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.440 
video showing what you're supposed to do
with<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> purpose<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.269> two

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
with it and what the purpose of two

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.259 
with it and what the purpose of two
machines<00:00:09.809> from<00:00:09.990> ranch<00:00:10.170> craft<00:00:10.410> are<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.639> you'll

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
machines from ranch craft are so you'll

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.539 
machines from ranch craft are so you'll
notice<00:00:12.660> if<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.259> try<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> run<00:00:14.130> an<00:00:14.250> efficient

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
notice if you try to run an efficient

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.770 
notice if you try to run an efficient
reactor<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.089> includes<00:00:15.450> breeder

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
reactor and this includes breeder

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.870 
reactor and this includes breeder
reactors<00:00:16.350> you'll<00:00:17.010> end<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.670> well

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
reactors you'll end up with as well

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.630 
reactors you'll end up with as well
spent<00:00:18.270> feel<00:00:18.680> nuclear<00:00:19.680> waste<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.130> looks

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
spent feel nuclear waste which looks

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.800 
spent feel nuclear waste which looks
like<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.210> there's<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> whole<00:00:21.600> bunch<00:00:21.689> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
like this and there's a whole bunch of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.420 
like this and there's a whole bunch of
different<00:00:22.109> types<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.980> don't<00:00:23.160> need<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> worry

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
different types we don't need to worry

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
different types we don't need to worry
about<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> different<00:00:23.850> types<00:00:24.060> right<00:00:24.359> now<00:00:24.570> not

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
about the different types right now not

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.089 
about the different types right now not
yet<00:00:25.619> anyway

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
yet anyway

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
yet anyway
but<00:00:26.760> basically<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> nuclear<00:00:27.539> waste<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
but basically a nuclear waste is a

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.380 
but basically a nuclear waste is a
rather<00:00:28.949> dangerous<00:00:29.160> material<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.849> leave

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
rather dangerous material if you leave

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.640 
rather dangerous material if you leave
it<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:30.689> nuclear<00:00:31.019> reactor<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> will

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it in there nuclear reactor it will

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
it in there nuclear reactor it will
eventually<00:00:32.130> poison<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.820> reaction<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
eventually poison the reaction and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.270 
eventually poison the reaction and
reduce<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> efficiency<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> reactor<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
reduce the efficiency of the reactor and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.680 
reduce the efficiency of the reactor and
you<00:00:35.520> try<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> carry<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.059> around<00:00:36.120> you'll<00:00:36.510> end<00:00:36.660> up

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you try to carry it around you'll end up

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.450 
you try to carry it around you'll end up
with<00:00:36.809> nuclear<00:00:37.140> radiation<00:00:37.440> poisoning<00:00:37.800> which

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
with nuclear radiation poisoning which

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.880 
with nuclear radiation poisoning which
will<00:00:38.700> ultimately<00:00:39.180> kill<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.469> you're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
will ultimately kill you so you're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
will ultimately kill you so you're
supposed<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.460> dispose<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> same

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
supposed to do is dispose of it the same

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.790 
supposed to do is dispose of it the same
way<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.870> disposed<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> real<00:00:43.559> world

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
way they disposed it in the real world

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
way they disposed it in the real world
which<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.789> put<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.090> spent<00:00:45.329> fuel

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
which is first you put it and spent fuel

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
which is first you put it and spent fuel
pool<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.590> most<00:00:46.950> destructive<00:00:47.280> stuff

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
pool with it the most destructive stuff

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
pool with it the most destructive stuff
decay<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.570> eventually<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.960> bury<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
decay and then eventually just bury the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.869 
decay and then eventually just bury the
long-lived<00:00:49.950> stuff<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> ground<00:00:50.610> I'll<00:00:50.760> show

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
long-lived stuff on the ground I'll show

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.250 
long-lived stuff on the ground I'll show
you<00:00:50.940> how<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> through<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:51.899> reactor

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you how to do that through with reactor

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.750 
you how to do that through with reactor
craft<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> first<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> do

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
craft so the first thing you want to do

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
craft so the first thing you want to do
is<00:00:53.879> won't<00:00:54.239> build<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.600> spent<00:00:54.809> fuel<00:00:55.020> pool<00:00:55.230> it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
is won't build your spent fuel pool it's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.900 
is won't build your spent fuel pool it's
time<00:00:56.399> today<00:00:57.350> let's<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.500> cut<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> hole<00:00:58.910> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
time today let's just cut a hole this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
time today let's just cut a hole this
should<00:01:00.239> work<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.660> fine<00:01:02.870> now<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.930> got<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> hole

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
should work just fine now we got a hole

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.289 
should work just fine now we got a hole
this<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.610> fine<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> spent<00:01:06.180> fuel

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this will do just fine as the spent fuel

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
this will do just fine as the spent fuel
pool<00:01:06.540> fill<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.560> water<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.280> might

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
pool fill with water as you might

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.530 
pool fill with water as you might
imagine<00:01:08.520> first<00:01:09.000> thing<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.360> I'm<00:01:09.450> gonna

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
imagine first thing what to do I'm gonna

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.960 
imagine first thing what to do I'm gonna
line<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.260> concrete<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.159> strictly

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
line up concrete this is not strictly

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.630 
line up concrete this is not strictly
necessary<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.710> mmm

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
necessary but it's mmm

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.740 
necessary but it's mmm
it's<00:01:14.880> probably<00:01:15.119> good<00:01:15.240> thing<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> do

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.200 

it's<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.470> stereo

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.020 

-<00:01:30.880> okay

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
- okay

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.520 
- okay
and<00:01:33.430> four<00:01:34.430> out<00:01:34.580> of<00:01:34.700> concrete<00:01:35.060> as<00:01:35.180> well<00:01:35.530> okay

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
and four out of concrete as well okay

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.460 
and four out of concrete as well okay
now<00:01:37.130> we'll<00:01:37.250> fill<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.550> with<00:01:37.640> water<00:01:38.200> do<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.350> any

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
now we'll fill it with water do that any

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.690 
now we'll fill it with water do that any
way<00:01:39.650> you<00:01:39.710> see<00:01:39.890> fit<00:01:39.920> I'll<00:01:40.160> just<00:01:40.340> do<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.520> with

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
way you see fit I'll just do it with

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.470 
way you see fit I'll just do it with
that<00:01:42.040> magic<00:01:43.040> girl<00:01:43.280> wall<00:01:44.060> didn't<00:01:44.330> want

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
that magic girl wall didn't want

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.000 
that magic girl wall didn't want
obviously<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.200> can't<00:01:45.380> do<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:45.740> part<00:01:45.950> in

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
obviously you can't do that that part in

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.310 
obviously you can't do that that part in
survival<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.460> no<00:01:47.000> juice<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:47.780> see<00:01:47.930> fit

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
survival but no juice you see fit

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.210 
survival but no juice you see fit
okay<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:49.280> there<00:01:49.430> we<00:01:49.520> go<00:01:49.610> tub<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.300> water<00:01:51.220> anyway

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
okay so there we go tub of water anyway

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.100 
okay so there we go tub of water anyway
it's<00:01:52.310> what<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.460> do<00:01:52.580> is<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:53.480> take<00:01:53.750> your<00:01:53.870> spent

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
it's what you do is you take your spent

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.420 
it's what you do is you take your spent
fuel<00:01:54.260> container<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.800> can<00:01:54.890> has<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.370> be

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
fuel container you can has to be

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.460 
fuel container you can has to be
somewhere<00:01:55.640> submerged<00:01:56.630> under<00:01:56.810> water<00:01:56.930> if<00:01:57.170> you

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
somewhere submerged under water if you

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.660 
somewhere submerged under water if you
don't<00:01:57.710> do<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.070> you'll<00:01:58.370> either<00:01:58.460> get

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
don't do this you'll either get

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.950 
don't do this you'll either get
radiation<00:01:59.060> leaking<00:01:59.330> out<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.630> you'll<00:01:59.720> see<00:01:59.870> the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
radiation leaking out and you'll see the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.090 
radiation leaking out and you'll see the
new<00:02:00.080> transferring<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:00.650> in<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> minute

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
new transferring out in a minute

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.280 
new transferring out in a minute
or<00:02:01.610> you'll<00:02:02.060> just<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.720> thing<00:02:02.870> will<00:02:02.960> overheat

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
or you'll just the thing will overheat

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.600 
or you'll just the thing will overheat
and<00:02:03.380> explode<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.770> spill<00:02:04.190> radiation

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
and explode and spill radiation

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.160 
and explode and spill radiation
everywhere

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
everywhere

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.990 
everywhere
anyways<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:07.310> you've<00:02:07.460> got<00:02:07.550> your<00:02:07.610> spent<00:02:07.820> fuel

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
anyways so you've got your spent fuel

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.940 
anyways so you've got your spent fuel
container<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.540> had<00:02:09.020> 40<00:02:09.290> degrees<00:02:09.500> it's<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
container I had 40 degrees it's the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.170 
container I had 40 degrees it's the
desert<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.460> ambient<00:02:10.729> temperature<00:02:10.970> 40

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
desert so it's ambient temperature 40

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.850 
desert so it's ambient temperature 40
degrees<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.960> just<00:02:12.110> load<00:02:12.320> up

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
degrees and you just load up

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.130 
degrees and you just load up
well<00:02:13.820> nuclear<00:02:14.270> waste<00:02:14.450> into<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:14.810> we'll<00:02:14.960> pick

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
well nuclear waste into it so we'll pick

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.680 
well nuclear waste into it so we'll pick
season<00:02:15.860> 134<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.060> know<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.330> C<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:17.570> got

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
season 134 so I know it's C and it's got

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.890 
season 134 so I know it's C and it's got
a<00:02:17.720> half-life<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.140> two<00:02:18.380> years<00:02:18.680> roughly<00:02:19.660> yeah

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
a half-life of two years roughly yeah

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.420 
a half-life of two years roughly yeah
nuclear<00:02:21.320> waste<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.590> not<00:02:21.740> stacking<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.310> so

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
nuclear waste is not stacking here so

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.590 
nuclear waste is not stacking here so
it's<00:02:22.550> going<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> change<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> little<00:02:23.480> bit

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
it's going to change that a little bit

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.800 
it's going to change that a little bit
I'm<00:02:24.260> gonna<00:02:24.470> put<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.740> one<00:02:25.220> item<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.820> cesium<00:02:26.420> 134

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
I'm gonna put in one item of cesium 134

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.810 
I'm gonna put in one item of cesium 134
and<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:29.150> we'll<00:02:29.240> put<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.860> know<00:02:30.890> 135<00:02:31.400> 6

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
and then we'll put in you know 135 6

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.580 
and then we'll put in you know 135 6
hours<00:02:32.209> half-life<00:02:32.720> which<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> lot<00:02:33.320> shorter

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
hours half-life which is a lot shorter

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.220 
hours half-life which is a lot shorter

kind of notorious in the real world for
that<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:48.230> know<00:02:48.350> it's<00:02:48.500> if<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.769> look<00:02:49.370> carefully

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
that you know it's if you look carefully

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.190 
that you know it's if you look carefully
water<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.480> kind<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:50.660> good<00:02:50.810> at<00:02:50.900> stopping

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
water is kind of good at stopping

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.720 
water is kind of good at stopping
neutrons<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.800> might<00:02:51.920> actually<00:02:52.070> make<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.640> out

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
neutrons you might actually make it out

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.190 
neutrons you might actually make it out
which<00:02:52.880> as<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.120> reason<00:02:53.300> you're<00:02:53.570> supposed<00:02:54.140> to

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
which as one reason you're supposed to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.110 
which as one reason you're supposed to
put<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.440> under<00:02:54.590> water<00:02:54.760> but<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.000> other

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
put it under water but you the other

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.280 
put it under water but you the other
thing<00:02:56.330> you'll<00:02:56.450> notice<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.780> don't<00:02:57.050> cool

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
thing you'll notice if you don't cool

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.130 
thing you'll notice if you don't cool
this<00:02:57.440> properly<00:02:57.860> for<00:02:58.010> example<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.430> put

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
this properly for example and put

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.509 
this properly for example and put
concrete<00:03:00.140> adjacent<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.920> on<00:03:01.040> both<00:03:01.160> sides

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
concrete adjacent to it on both sides

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.690 
concrete adjacent to it on both sides
even<00:03:04.519> go<00:03:04.760> one<00:03:05.150> step<00:03:05.360> further<00:03:05.600> than<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.700> so

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
even go one step further than that so

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.850 
even go one step further than that so
it's<00:03:07.850> got<00:03:08.000> no<00:03:08.120> water<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:08.690> any<00:03:09.170> sign<00:03:09.620> unless

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
it's got no water on any sign unless

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.570 
it's got no water on any sign unless
like<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.720> it'll<00:03:11.720> start<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.989> heat<00:03:12.170> up<00:03:12.580> 88

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
like that it'll start to heat up 88

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.530 
like that it'll start to heat up 88
degrees<00:03:13.820> under<00:03:14.000> four<00:03:14.269> degrees<00:03:14.510> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
degrees under four degrees and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.080 
degrees under four degrees and
eventually<00:03:15.320> it'll<00:03:15.440> explode<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:16.880> instead

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
eventually it'll explode so instead

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.650 
eventually it'll explode so instead
we'll<00:03:17.269> just<00:03:17.590> let<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.680> cool<00:03:18.860> down<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:20.180> it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
we'll just let it cool down and it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.509 
we'll just let it cool down and it
actually<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.050> eating<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.560> water<00:03:21.769> blocks<00:03:22.040> like

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
actually is eating the water blocks like

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.949 
actually is eating the water blocks like
there<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.180> notice<00:03:23.450> I'm<00:03:23.510> getting<00:03:23.600> sucked

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
there you notice I'm getting sucked

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.570 
there you notice I'm getting sucked
closer<00:03:24.200> every<00:03:24.560> now<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.769> then<00:03:24.830> that's<00:03:25.280> because

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
closer every now and then that's because

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.949 
closer every now and then that's because
water<00:03:26.030> block<00:03:26.239> here<00:03:26.420> gets<00:03:26.570> completely

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
water block here gets completely

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.050 
water block here gets completely
consumed<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:28.160> gets<00:03:28.310> replenished<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.850> course

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
consumed it gets replenished of course

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.259 
consumed it gets replenished of course
but<00:03:29.380> anyways<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.730> point<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.150> leave

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
but anyways so the point is you leave

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.120 
but anyways so the point is you leave
the<00:03:32.420> nuclear<00:03:32.690> waste<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.019> here<00:03:33.200> the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
the nuclear waste in here the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.400 
the nuclear waste in here the
short-lived<00:03:34.639> ones<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:35.630> for<00:03:35.780> example<00:03:36.139> of<00:03:36.200> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
short-lived ones so for example of the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.760 
short-lived ones so for example of the
season<00:03:37.010> 134<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.639> the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
season 134 and the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.770 
season 134 and the
as<00:03:39.770> you<00:03:39.920> know<00:03:39.980> 135<00:03:40.490> will<00:03:40.820> disappear<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.570> little

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
as you know 135 will disappear a little

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.660 
as you know 135 will disappear a little
decay<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.290> you'll<00:03:42.980> be<00:03:43.070> left<00:03:43.220> with<00:03:43.340> empty

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
decay and you'll be left with empty

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.730 
decay and you'll be left with empty
space<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.030> load<00:03:44.150> in<00:03:44.300> new<00:03:44.480> nuclear<00:03:44.960> waste<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
space to load in new nuclear waste the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.100 
space to load in new nuclear waste the
long-lived<00:03:46.220> stuff<00:03:46.460> won't<00:03:47.270> you'll<00:03:47.750> have<00:03:47.930> to

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
long-lived stuff won't you'll have to

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.050 
long-lived stuff won't you'll have to
take<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> second<00:03:49.550> stage<00:03:49.700> which<00:03:49.910> is

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
take it to the second stage which is

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.090 
take it to the second stage which is
what<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.420> nuclear<00:03:51.110> waste<00:03:51.350> disposal<00:03:51.470> dramas

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
what the nuclear waste disposal dramas

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.340 
what the nuclear waste disposal dramas
for<00:03:52.250> I'd<00:03:53.030> like<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.270> show<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.540> some<00:03:53.810> ways<00:03:53.990> to<00:03:54.020> K

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
for I'd like to show you some ways to K

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.990 
for I'd like to show you some ways to K
but<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.800> seems<00:03:55.160> we're<00:03:55.280> not<00:03:55.400> gonna<00:03:55.520> get<00:03:55.700> quite

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
but it seems we're not gonna get quite

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.350 
but it seems we're not gonna get quite
that<00:03:56.150> lucky<00:03:56.510> maybe<00:03:57.290> if<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:57.770> pick<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.360> stack

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
that lucky maybe if I just pick a stack

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.260 
that lucky maybe if I just pick a stack
of<00:03:59.540> this<00:03:59.630> stuff<00:04:00.430> well<00:04:01.430> we'll<00:04:01.700> leave<00:04:01.820> that<00:04:02.030> for

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
of this stuff well we'll leave that for

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.810 
of this stuff well we'll leave that for
now<00:04:02.660> anyways<00:04:03.500> nuclear<00:04:04.040> waste<00:04:04.190> disposal<00:04:04.280> drama

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
now anyways nuclear waste disposal drama

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.430 
now anyways nuclear waste disposal drama
mall<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.600> got<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.780> little<00:04:05.900> bit<00:04:06.020> less<00:04:06.170> storage

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
mall it's got a little bit less storage

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.590 
mall it's got a little bit less storage
it<00:04:06.620> can<00:04:06.770> stack<00:04:07.070> some<00:04:07.460> waste<00:04:07.700> now<00:04:08.210> can't<00:04:08.480> take

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
it can stack some waste now can't take

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
it can stack some waste now can't take
the<00:04:08.720> short-lived<00:04:09.050> waste<00:04:09.230> which<00:04:09.380> is<00:04:09.410> why<00:04:09.560> you

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
the short-lived waste which is why you

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.350 
the short-lived waste which is why you
have<00:04:09.740> to<00:04:09.770> decay<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.220> in<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.790> spent

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
have to decay it in the in the spent

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.510 
have to decay it in the in the spent
fuel<00:04:14.450> container<00:04:14.860> but<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.920> long<00:04:16.070> lift<00:04:16.340> stop

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
fuel container but the long lift stop

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.190 
fuel container but the long lift stop
for<00:04:16.670> example<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.950> 10<00:04:18.950> 126<00:04:19.610> put<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:20.660> stacks

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
for example the 10 126 put it in stacks

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.650 
for example the 10 126 put it in stacks
of<00:04:21.350> 16<00:04:21.770> in<00:04:21.860> here<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.250> while<00:04:23.000> it's<00:04:23.150> in<00:04:23.240> here<00:04:23.510> I

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
of 16 in here and while it's in here I

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.570 
of 16 in here and while it's in here I
was<00:04:24.410> in<00:04:24.530> survival<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.160> would<00:04:25.310> be<00:04:25.430> getting

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
was in survival I would be getting

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.890 
was in survival I would be getting
radiation<00:04:25.850> poisoning<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.540> this<00:04:26.660> is<00:04:26.750> something

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
radiation poisoning so this is something

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.360 
radiation poisoning so this is something
you<00:04:26.990> do<00:04:27.140> want<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.380> very<00:04:27.560> underground<00:04:27.830> deep

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
you do want to very underground deep

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.890 
you do want to very underground deep
underground<00:04:28.610> likely<00:04:29.060> do<00:04:29.120> in<00:04:29.210> real<00:04:29.360> life<00:04:29.540> you

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
underground likely do in real life you

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.410 
underground likely do in real life you
know<00:04:29.990> some<00:04:30.200> containment<00:04:30.830> area<00:04:31.160> but<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:32.270> is

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
know some containment area but this is

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.030 
know some containment area but this is
basically<00:04:32.660> how<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.870> disturb<00:04:33.140> equip<00:04:33.470> dispose

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
basically how you disturb equip dispose

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.800 
basically how you disturb equip dispose
of<00:04:34.070> nuclear<00:04:34.430> waste<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:35.060> will<00:04:35.240> very<00:04:35.660> slowly

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
of nuclear waste it will very slowly

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.800 
of nuclear waste it will very slowly
eventually<00:04:36.410> decay<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.970> takes<00:04:38.390> rather

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
eventually decay but that takes rather

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.710 
eventually decay but that takes rather
longer<00:04:39.140> than<00:04:39.560> is<00:04:39.980> really<00:04:40.430> feasible<00:04:41.300> to

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
longer than is really feasible to

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.080 
longer than is really feasible to
actually<00:04:42.500> rely<00:04:42.800> on<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:43.700> don't<00:04:43.910> want<00:04:44.030> to

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
actually rely on and you don't want to

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.010 
actually rely on and you don't want to
leave<00:04:44.180> nuclear<00:04:44.450> waste<00:04:44.600> on<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.750> ground<00:04:44.960> it

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
leave nuclear waste on the ground it

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.180 
leave nuclear waste on the ground it
will<00:04:45.110> never<00:04:45.260> t<00:04:45.440> spawn<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.890> will<00:04:46.010> just<00:04:46.130> a

nothing<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.400> here<00:04:49.550> -<00:04:49.670> Kade<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.530> I'll<00:04:51.650> show<00:04:51.950> you

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
nothing in here - Kade so I'll show you

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.960 
nothing in here - Kade so I'll show you
for<00:04:52.160> example<00:04:52.190> what<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.640> mean

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
for example what I mean

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.700 
for example what I mean
we'll<00:04:53.180> put<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.720> down<00:04:53.990> load<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:54.830> up<00:04:54.980> with<00:04:55.100> 10

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
we'll put this down load it up with 10

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.750 
we'll put this down load it up with 10
survival<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.890> I've<00:04:58.280> got<00:04:58.490> radiation

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
survival and I've got radiation

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.910 
survival and I've got radiation
poisoning<00:04:59.030> as<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.720> can<00:04:59.840> see<00:05:00.020> it's<00:05:00.710> supposed

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
poisoning as you can see it's supposed

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.590 
poisoning as you can see it's supposed
to<00:05:00.980> be<00:05:01.100> 30<00:05:01.340> minutes<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.850> doesn't<00:05:02.090> show<00:05:02.420> that

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
to be 30 minutes it doesn't show that

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.230 
to be 30 minutes it doesn't show that
for<00:05:02.750> some<00:05:02.870> reason<00:05:02.900> oh<00:05:03.320> well<00:05:04.900> nice<00:05:07.060> yeah<00:05:08.060> it's

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
for some reason oh well nice yeah it's

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.120 
for some reason oh well nice yeah it's
something<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:09.320> don't<00:05:09.470> want<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.650> mess<00:05:09.920> with

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
something you don't want to mess with

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.270 
something you don't want to mess with
still<00:05:10.910> in<00:05:11.030> here<00:05:11.270> we've<00:05:11.480> got<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:12.200> think<00:05:12.980> -<00:05:13.100> King

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
still in here we've got I think - King

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.700 
still in here we've got I think - King
that's<00:05:13.550> ok<00:05:13.880> done<00:05:14.870> some<00:05:15.080> more<00:05:16.900> that's<00:05:17.900> more<00:05:18.470> of

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
that's ok done some more that's more of

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.870 
that's ok done some more that's more of
that<00:05:20.590> well<00:05:21.590> I'll<00:05:22.250> tell<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.430> what<00:05:22.520> happens<00:05:22.790> if

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
that well I'll tell you what happens if

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.590 
that well I'll tell you what happens if
you<00:05:22.910> don't<00:05:23.060> cool<00:05:23.330> it<00:05:23.360> put<00:05:23.780> one<00:05:23.900> over<00:05:23.930> here<00:05:25.600> so

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
you don't cool it put one over here so

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.210 
you don't cool it put one over here so
I'll<00:05:26.720> put<00:05:26.870> some<00:05:26.990> goggles<00:05:27.260> on<00:05:27.620> first<00:05:27.920> so<00:05:28.130> you

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
I'll put some goggles on first so you

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.290 
I'll put some goggles on first so you
can<00:05:28.250> see<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.610> radiation<00:05:28.880> radiation<00:05:29.510> goggles

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
can see the radiation radiation goggles

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.050 
can see the radiation radiation goggles
just<00:05:32.300> wear<00:05:32.600> those<00:05:32.840> ok<00:05:33.740> blood<00:05:34.670> that<00:05:34.820> up<00:05:34.940> with

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
just wear those ok blood that up with

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.050 
just wear those ok blood that up with
nuclear<00:05:35.360> waste<00:05:35.480> get<00:05:36.200> hotter<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:37.100> hotter<00:05:37.370> and

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
nuclear waste get hotter and hotter and

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.010 
nuclear waste get hotter and hotter and
hotter<00:05:38.300> until<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:42.680> there<00:05:43.010> we<00:05:43.100> go

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
hotter until and there we go

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.469 
hotter until and there we go
minor<00:05:44.830> radiation<00:05:45.430> will<00:05:45.550> more<00:05:45.910> than<00:05:46.030> minor<00:05:46.240> but

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
minor radiation will more than minor but

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.900 
minor radiation will more than minor but
noticeable<00:05:47.350> radiation<00:05:47.770> spill<00:05:48.039> and<00:05:48.310> now

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
noticeable radiation spill and now

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.850 
noticeable radiation spill and now
you've<00:05:49.030> got<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.210> crater<00:05:49.539> too<00:05:49.720> and<00:05:49.930> that

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
you've got a crater too and that

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.330 
you've got a crater too and that
radiation

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
radiation

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.589 
radiation
nuclear<00:05:51.639> waste<00:05:51.759> will<00:05:51.940> eventually<00:05:52.240> dump<00:05:52.419> more

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
nuclear waste will eventually dump more

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:53.850 
nuclear waste will eventually dump more
radiation<00:05:52.840> if<00:05:53.080> you<00:05:53.169> just<00:05:53.319> leave<00:05:53.470> it<00:05:53.500> there<00:05:53.710> so

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
radiation if you just leave it there so

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.430 
radiation if you just leave it there so
that's<00:05:54.759> why<00:05:55.060> you<00:05:55.120> don't<00:05:55.509> just<00:05:55.870> leave<00:05:56.110> nuclear

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
that's why you don't just leave nuclear

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.009 
that's why you don't just leave nuclear
waste<00:05:56.650> lying<00:05:56.919> around
