parsley and all all the seed heads now
the<00:00:27.029> best<00:00:27.630> way<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.900> collect<00:00:28.890> past<00:00:29.189> Lucy's<00:00:29.519> is

the best way to collect past Lucy's is

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
the best way to collect past Lucy's is
if<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.029> hang<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.390> upside<00:00:30.630> down<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.800> like

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
if you hang it upside down and have like

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
if you hang it upside down and have like
a<00:00:32.009> plastic<00:00:32.640> sheet<00:00:32.940> underneath<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.750> then

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a plastic sheet underneath and then

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.470 
a plastic sheet underneath and then
shake<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.860> every<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.460> often<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.059> then<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
shake it every so often and then the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.450 
shake it every so often and then the
past<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.930> gonna<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.920> seeds<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.280> just

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
past is just gonna the seeds are just

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.400 
past is just gonna the seeds are just
gonna<00:00:38.579> fall<00:00:38.820> down<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.329> that's<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:40.050> great<00:00:40.230> way

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
gonna fall down and that's one great way

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.340 
gonna fall down and that's one great way
to<00:00:40.440> collect<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:41.480> but<00:00:42.480> today<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.079> going

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
to collect them but today I'm just going

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.190 
to collect them but today I'm just going
to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.500> using<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> seed<00:00:44.789> heads

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
to be using that one of the seed heads

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
to be using that one of the seed heads
so<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.410> cut<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.860> off<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.300> probably

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
so just cut one off now this is probably

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.680 
so just cut one off now this is probably
the<00:00:49.050> simplest<00:00:49.680> way<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:51.050> grow<00:00:52.050> parsley<00:00:52.860> seeds

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
the simplest way to grow parsley seeds

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
the simplest way to grow parsley seeds
what<00:00:54.690> we've<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:56.100> nice<00:00:56.449> tray<00:00:57.449> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
what we've got here it's a nice tray of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.099 
what we've got here it's a nice tray of
some<00:00:58.050> soft<00:00:58.739> compost<00:00:59.250> organic<00:01:00.239> compost<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
some soft compost organic compost that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.979 
some soft compost organic compost that
we've<00:01:01.260> made<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.969> it's<00:01:02.969> really<00:01:03.300> simple<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.899> just

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
we've made and it's really simple I just

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
we've made and it's really simple I just
need<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> heads<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
need to get one of the heads of the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.000 
need to get one of the heads of the
parsley<00:01:05.939> seeds<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:06.960> basically<00:01:07.350> pinch

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
parsley seeds and then basically pinch

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.289 
parsley seeds and then basically pinch
it<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.520> let<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.010> like<00:01:11.010> keep<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.670> pinching<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it and let go I like keep on pinching it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.230 
it and let go I like keep on pinching it
a<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.320> making<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
a bit like when you're making the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
a bit like when you're making the
breadcrumbs<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.810> pinching<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
breadcrumbs you like pinching it and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.030 
breadcrumbs you like pinching it and
letting<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> easiest

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
letting go and that's just the easiest

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.240 
letting go and that's just the easiest
way<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:21.450> plant<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:22.020> seeds<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
way to plant some seeds I do want to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
way to plant some seeds I do want to
plant<00:01:23.490> too<00:01:23.700> many<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.240> remember<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:24.780> will

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
plant too many but remember these will

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
plant too many but remember these will
be<00:01:25.200> thinned<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.009> doesn't<00:01:26.280> really<00:01:26.460> have

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
be thinned out so it doesn't really have

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
be thinned out so it doesn't really have
that<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> difference<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.360> want

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that much of a difference but you want

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.590 
that much of a difference but you want
an<00:01:31.409> equally<00:01:31.950> spaced<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.210> most

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
an equally spaced out then that's most

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.569 
an equally spaced out then that's most
of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> seeds<00:01:34.110> I'll<00:01:34.530> try<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.070> compare<00:01:35.400> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
of the seeds I'll try and compare it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
of the seeds I'll try and compare it
with<00:01:35.610> another<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.140> choose<00:01:37.500> another

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
with another one and just choose another

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.819 
with another one and just choose another
one<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.280> guys<00:01:39.320> get<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> go

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
one for you guys get it now there you go

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.520 
one for you guys get it now there you go
right<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.549> tell<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.420> difference<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
right you can tell the difference of the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
right you can tell the difference of the
seeds<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.399> live<00:01:47.790> how<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.479> pinch<00:01:48.869> them

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
seeds there I live how you pinch them

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.429 
seeds there I live how you pinch them
and<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.530> them<00:01:49.649> off<00:01:49.829> okay<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:51.930> that's

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and get them off okay so now that's

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.710 
and get them off okay so now that's
basically<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.310> need<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.450> want

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
basically all you need to do if you want

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.100 
basically all you need to do if you want
to<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.740> put<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.460> sift<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> bit<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
to you can just put a sift over a bit of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
to you can just put a sift over a bit of
a<00:01:58.140> compost<00:01:58.829> only<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.460> quarter<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.329> an<00:02:00.420> inch

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
a compost only about quarter of an inch

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you can just put this away for about two

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.880 
you can just put this away for about two
weeks

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
weeks

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.130 
weeks
and<00:02:13.980> all<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> parties<00:02:15.180> most<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.870> parsley

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
seeds will grow and they'll turn to be

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.220 
seeds will grow and they'll turn to be
about<00:02:19.020> an<00:02:19.410> inch<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> two<00:02:20.940> inches<00:02:21.300> tall<00:02:21.600> then

about an inch to two inches tall then

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.970 
about an inch to two inches tall then
when<00:02:22.680> they're<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.100> tool

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
when they're that tool

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.770 
when they're that tool
they'll<00:02:25.980> look<00:02:27.290> look<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:29.660> okay

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
they'll look look a bit like that okay

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.350 
they'll look look a bit like that okay
and<00:02:30.870> when<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.740> are<00:02:32.040> transplanting<00:02:33.000> it's<00:02:33.150> best

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and when you are transplanting it's best

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.780 
and when you are transplanting it's best
to<00:02:33.450> grab<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.020> by<00:02:34.470> one<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> leaves<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.520> know

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
to grab it by one of the leaves I know

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.610 
to grab it by one of the leaves I know
they<00:02:36.060> could<00:02:36.300> break<00:02:36.510> off<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:37.020> it's<00:02:37.200> always<00:02:37.350> got

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
they could break off but it's always got

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.440 
they could break off but it's always got
a<00:02:37.650> second<00:02:38.100> leaf<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.400> live<00:02:38.580> off<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.330> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
a second leaf to live off and if you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.600 
a second leaf to live off and if you
grab<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.810> by<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> stem<00:02:40.350> what<00:02:40.830> does<00:02:41.070> happen<00:02:41.310> is

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
grab it by the stem what does happen is

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.490 
grab it by the stem what does happen is
that<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.750> squeeze<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.319> by

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
that you can right squeeze it by

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.640 
that you can right squeeze it by
accident<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.910> popped<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
accident and that is popped it and it

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.600 
accident and that is popped it and it
damages<00:02:47.280> it

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
damages it

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.870 
damages it
you<00:02:48.090> see<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> shape<00:02:48.690> there<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.950> um<00:02:50.160> yeah

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880

you see the shape there so um yeah
always<00:02:51.060> grab<00:02:51.450> them<00:02:51.720> by<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.170> leaves<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:54.239> when

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
always grab them by the leaves so when

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.140 
always grab them by the leaves so when
you<00:02:55.110> are<00:02:55.290> transplanting<00:02:56.010> them<00:02:56.160> about<00:02:56.670> three

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
you are transplanting them about three

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.380 
you are transplanting them about three
weeks<00:02:57.360> later<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:58.080> want<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.620> pan<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.390> nicely

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
weeks later I want to get pan and nicely

hoping to get a camera better come a
later<00:03:15.330> on<00:03:15.570> but<00:03:16.290> what<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:17.959> if<00:03:18.959> it's

soft and after you can't just lift it
out<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.769> soil<00:03:25.769> like<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.750> if<00:03:27.870> it

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
out to the soil like that but if it

either to use a dipper or get a get a
well<00:03:36.560> planting<00:03:37.560> label<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.130> twice<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.579> from

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
well planting label and twice it from

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.670 
well planting label and twice it from
underneath<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.360> it'll<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:39.600> come<00:03:39.840> straight

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
underneath and it'll just come straight

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.800 
underneath and it'll just come straight
away<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:46.640> okay<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:47.670> here's<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.269> seed<00:03:48.570> in

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
away like that okay so here's a seed in

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.009 
away like that okay so here's a seed in
the<00:03:49.019> pot<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:50.209> we've<00:03:51.209> got<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.540> by<00:03:51.660> one<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
the pot and we've got it by one of the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.830 
the pot and we've got it by one of the
leaves<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.820> because<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.970> roots<00:03:54.209> its<00:03:54.540> curved

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
leaves and because the roots its curved

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.050 
leaves and because the roots its curved
you<00:03:55.049> might<00:03:55.230> need<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:56.340> give<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.760> bit<00:03:57.030> of

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
you might need a to give it a bit of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.600 
you might need a to give it a bit of
help<00:03:57.480> directing<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.820> into<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:01.579> hole<00:04:02.579> like

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
help directing it into the hole like

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.120 
help directing it into the hole like
that<00:04:04.280> okay<00:04:06.170> then<00:04:07.170> firmly<00:04:07.470> around<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.950> base

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
that okay then firmly around the base

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.840 
that okay then firmly around the base
now<00:04:08.790> what<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.000> would<00:04:09.150> do<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.690> about<00:04:10.700> three<00:04:11.700> of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
now what I would do is about three of

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.449 
now what I would do is about three of
these<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.540> pot<00:04:12.840> three<00:04:13.350> seedlings<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.280> pot

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
these in a pot three seedlings in a pot

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.120 
these in a pot three seedlings in a pot
and<00:04:14.730> then<00:04:15.299> in<00:04:15.600> about<00:04:15.720> two<00:04:16.109> weeks<00:04:16.140> I'll<00:04:16.709> pick

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
and then in about two weeks I'll pick
