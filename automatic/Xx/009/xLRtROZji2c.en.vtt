unlocking effects as you can tell from
the<00:00:16.260> title<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.850> let's<00:00:18.060> check<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.420> out

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the title of it so let's check this out

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.960 
the title of it so let's check this out
really<00:00:18.869> quick<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.949> see<00:00:20.100> there<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.550> does

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
really quick as you see there it does

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.300 
really quick as you see there it does
have<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> different<00:00:22.320> effect<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.160> can

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
have a different effect so we can

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.040 
have a different effect so we can
actually<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.850> settings<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> change<00:00:24.720> up

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
actually go to settings and change up

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.070 
actually go to settings and change up
the<00:00:25.529> effects<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.090> let's<00:00:27.359> scroll<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:27.990> way

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the effects so let's scroll all the way

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
the effects so let's scroll all the way
down<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.500> unlock<00:00:28.980> effects<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:30.210> of

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
down to unlock effects and then of

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.970 
down to unlock effects and then of
course<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.830> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
course here you will have to have this

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
course here you will have to have this
enabled<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> work<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:34.050> we'll

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
enabled for it to work and then we'll

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.620 
enabled for it to work and then we'll
just<00:00:34.230> go<00:00:34.380> down<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> animation<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.450> does

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
just go down to animation and it does

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.590 
just go down to animation and it does
have<00:00:36.660> simple<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.559> complex<00:00:38.070> effects<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.270> we'll

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
have simple and complex effects so we'll

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
have simple and complex effects so we'll
go<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> simple<00:00:40.350> real<00:00:40.500> quick<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:40.950> we'll

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
go to simple real quick and then we'll

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.209 
go to simple real quick and then we'll
just<00:00:42.270> choose<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> random<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.620> rotate

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
just choose a random one this rotate

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.529 
just choose a random one this rotate
half<00:00:44.520> counterclockwise<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:47.329> there<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.480> go

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
half counterclockwise so there you go

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
half counterclockwise so there you go
that's<00:00:48.840> pretty<00:00:49.200> cool<00:00:49.469> let's<00:00:50.129> check<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.430> flip

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that's pretty cool let's check out flip

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.639 
that's pretty cool let's check out flip
from<00:00:50.940> left<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:54.000> quickly<00:00:54.390> does<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
from left so it quickly does it and the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.439 
from left so it quickly does it and the
reason<00:00:55.800> why<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.940> animation

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
reason why is because this animation

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.290 
reason why is because this animation
duration<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> way<00:00:59.010> down<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.149> can

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
duration is all the way down so we can

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.310 
duration is all the way down so we can
simply<00:01:01.940> let's<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> way<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.229> will

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
simply let's do all the way so it will

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050 
simply let's do all the way so it will
take<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> while<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
take a while to actually do the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.950 
take a while to actually do the
animation<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.890> as<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.960> that's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
animation so as you see there that's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980 
animation so as you see there that's
pretty<00:01:10.260> cool<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> let's<00:01:12.479> check<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.780> another

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
pretty cool so let's check out another

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.609 
pretty cool so let's check out another
one<00:01:14.600> look<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.850> don't<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.450> funny<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
one look I don't know that was funny and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.149 
one look I don't know that was funny and
he's<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.150> that's<00:01:21.360> pretty<00:01:21.630> awesome

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
he's there go that's pretty awesome

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.469 
he's there go that's pretty awesome
pretty<00:01:23.159> cool<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.640> add<00:01:23.850> different<00:01:24.090> little

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
pretty cool you can add different little

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
pretty cool you can add different little
effects<00:01:24.750> make<00:01:25.380> sure<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.799> makes<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:26.100> phone<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
effects make sure it makes your phone a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.420 
effects make sure it makes your phone a
little<00:01:26.700> cooler<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.509> guess<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.619> could<00:01:28.650> say<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
little cooler I guess you could say and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.940 
little cooler I guess you could say and
you<00:01:29.549> see<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.030> camera<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.990> lens

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you see that little camera kind of lens

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370 
you see that little camera kind of lens
thing<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.540> let's<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.200> one

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
thing going there and then let's do one

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.219 
thing going there and then let's do one
more<00:01:34.409> cross<00:01:35.400> black<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
more cross black so that's it for the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
more cross black so that's it for the
simple<00:01:40.650> ones<00:01:40.770> let's<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.460> ahead<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
simple ones let's go ahead and go to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.960 
simple ones let's go ahead and go to
complex<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.899> check<00:01:43.229> those<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.850> do<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
complex and check those out do the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.020 
complex and check those out do the
wiggling<00:01:48.320> well<00:01:49.320> huh<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.520> pretty<00:01:50.640> trippy

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
wiggling well huh that's pretty trippy

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.289 
wiggling well huh that's pretty trippy
and<00:01:51.860> let's<00:01:52.860> check<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.220> another<00:01:53.369> Red<00:01:54.090> Lion

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and let's check out another Red Lion

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.230 
and let's check out another Red Lion
scanner<00:01:54.570> check<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.590> out<00:01:55.649> earlier<00:01:56.240> it's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
scanner check this one out earlier it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.889 
scanner check this one out earlier it's
pretty<00:01:57.420> cool<00:01:58.159> scans<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.310> device<00:01:59.780> gives<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
pretty cool scans your device gives a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.010 
pretty cool scans your device gives a
little<00:02:01.170> cool<00:02:01.409> effect<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.850> let's<00:02:03.479> check

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
little cool effect there and let's check

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.430 
little cool effect there and let's check
out<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:07.099> pretty<00:02:08.099> cool<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.319> then<00:02:10.319> you

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
out this one is pretty cool and then you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.710 
out this one is pretty cool and then you
can<00:02:10.530> all

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
can all
