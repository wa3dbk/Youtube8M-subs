paper by its edge in this direction it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.770 
paper by its edge in this direction it
doesn't<00:01:36.350> dip<00:01:36.590> down<00:01:36.770> very<00:01:37.490> far<00:01:37.729> if<00:01:38.179> I<00:01:38.390> rotate

paper dips a lot here not so much of
ávila<00:01:44.479> from<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:44.990> other<00:01:45.140> angle<00:01:45.700> okay<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:46.759> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
will end up with three more five and a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.770 
will end up with three more five and a
half<00:03:17.400> by<00:03:17.580> eight<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.000> half<00:03:18.060> pieces<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.570> paper

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
half by eight and a half pieces of paper

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.490 
half by eight and a half pieces of paper
and<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.200> really<00:03:19.650> do<00:03:19.830> like<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.940> pre<00:03:21.810> score<00:03:22.230> before

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
and I really do like to pre score before

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.830 
and I really do like to pre score before
I<00:03:22.740> fold<00:03:23.070> them<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.370> half<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.760> two<00:03:23.850> parts<00:03:24.270> now

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
I fold them in half in two parts now

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.300 
I fold them in half in two parts now
remember<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:25.320> were<00:03:25.530> talking<00:03:25.560> about<00:03:25.950> grain

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
remember we were talking about grain

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.580 
remember we were talking about grain
direction<00:03:26.940> there's<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.540> reason<00:03:27.959> for<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.320> and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
direction there's a reason for that and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.290 
direction there's a reason for that and
that's<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.459> when<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.640> do<00:03:29.730> fold<00:03:30.150> these

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
that's so that when I do fold these

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.930 
that's so that when I do fold these
cards<00:03:30.810> I'm<00:03:30.990> folding<00:03:31.350> them<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:31.800> half<00:03:31.830> with<00:03:32.610> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
cards I'm folding them in half with the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.830 
cards I'm folding them in half with the
grain<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:34.670> they'll<00:03:35.670> fold<00:03:35.970> easily<00:03:36.300> and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
grain and they'll fold easily and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.490 
grain and they'll fold easily and
perfectly<00:03:37.350> when<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.880> time<00:03:39.120> comes<00:03:39.660> now

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
perfectly when the time comes now

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.229 
perfectly when the time comes now
essentially<00:03:40.980> what<00:03:41.100> we<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.850> point<00:03:42.120> our

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
essentially what we have this point our

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.780 
essentially what we have this point our
whole<00:03:42.750> bunch<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.500> little<00:03:44.070> pieces<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.580> paper

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
whole bunch of little pieces of paper

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.150 
whole bunch of little pieces of paper
and<00:03:45.300> it's<00:03:45.810> kind<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:46.410> assembling<00:03:47.040> a

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
and it's kind of like assembling a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.979 
and it's kind of like assembling a
puzzle<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.910> I'm<00:03:48.060> gonna<00:03:48.180> do<00:03:48.300> some<00:03:48.540> arranging

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
puzzle so I'm gonna do some arranging

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.460 
puzzle so I'm gonna do some arranging
and<00:03:49.170> let's<00:03:49.320> see<00:03:49.470> how<00:03:49.560> these<00:03:49.709> cards<00:03:50.040> turn<00:03:50.280> out

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
and let's see how these cards turn out

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.770 
and let's see how these cards turn out
all<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.620> I've<00:03:52.950> taken<00:03:53.340> my<00:03:53.570> puzzle<00:03:54.570> pieces

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
all right I've taken my puzzle pieces

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.080 
all right I've taken my puzzle pieces
and<00:03:55.440> kind<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.100> rearranged<00:03:56.550> things<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.970> way

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
and kind of a rearranged things the way

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.449 
and kind of a rearranged things the way
I<00:03:57.330> like<00:03:57.660> them<00:03:57.840> but<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.200> course<00:03:58.459> that's

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
I like them but of course that's

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.940 
I like them but of course that's
entirely<00:03:59.880> up<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.989> original<00:04:01.470> sketch

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
entirely up to you the original sketch

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.070 
entirely up to you the original sketch
of<00:04:02.100> inspiration<00:04:02.760> was<00:04:02.910> actually<00:04:03.450> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
of inspiration was actually the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.199 
of inspiration was actually the
operation<00:04:04.620> right<00:04:04.770> home<00:04:05.040> sketch<00:04:05.370> number<00:04:05.670> 24

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
operation right home sketch number 24

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.840 
operation right home sketch number 24
and<00:04:06.450> that's<00:04:07.050> what<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.290> used<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.860> design<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
and that's what I used to design the

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.850 
and that's what I used to design the
initial<00:04:09.300> pattern<00:04:09.720> but<00:04:10.320> then<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.470> ended<00:04:10.739> up

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
initial pattern but then I ended up

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.620 
initial pattern but then I ended up
getting<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.340> total<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.910> nine<00:04:12.060> cards<00:04:12.360> out<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
getting a total of nine cards out of the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.650 
getting a total of nine cards out of the
mix<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.340> it's<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.610> fun<00:04:14.850> great<00:04:15.420> way<00:04:15.630> to

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
mix so it's just a fun great way to

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.500 
mix so it's just a fun great way to
crank<00:04:16.169> out

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
crank out

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.500

choosing the Serengeti stamp collection

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.100 
choosing the Serengeti stamp collection
because<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.760> sizes<00:04:28.270> of<00:04:28.420> all<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.660> images

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720 
and their ability to fit onto the pieces
that<00:04:31.930> I've<00:04:32.080> I've<00:04:32.620> pre-cut<00:04:32.980> here<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.430> think<00:04:33.610> it's

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
that I've I've pre-cut here I think it's

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.250 
that I've I've pre-cut here I think it's
going<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:33.940> be<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> good<00:04:34.300> match<00:04:34.450> for<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.810> project

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
going to be a good match for the project

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.990 
going to be a good match for the project
so<00:04:35.770> take<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.040> look<00:04:36.190> at<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.400> blog<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.790> find<00:04:36.820> out
