glow stick and this just provides a
permanent<00:01:46.649> glow<00:01:46.799> stick<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.250> actually<00:01:47.700> also

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
permanent glow stick I actually also

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.069 
permanent glow stick I actually also
ordered<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.049> gopro<00:01:49.590> hero4<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.630> black<00:01:51.840> edition

for<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.799> guys<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.100> looking

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
for that so you guys will be looking

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.620 
for that so you guys will be looking
forward<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> seeing<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> soon<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.479> my

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
forward to seeing that soon so my

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.340 
forward to seeing that soon so my
contour<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.200> will<00:01:58.560> probably<00:01:59.310> use<00:01:59.340> on<00:02:00.329> my<00:02:01.079> gun

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
contour I will probably use on my gun

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
contour I will probably use on my gun
maybe<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.829> some<00:02:02.009> zoom<00:02:02.219> up<00:02:02.369> footage<00:02:02.670> i

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
maybe to get some zoom up footage i

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.969 
maybe to get some zoom up footage i
don't<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.149> how<00:02:03.270> great<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> does<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
don't know how great it does at that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
don't know how great it does at that
range<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.579> i'm<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> switch<00:02:06.030> eventually

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
in 60 frames a second at 1080p so it'll

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.390 
in 60 frames a second at 1080p so it'll
hop<00:02:12.909> the<00:02:13.150> quality<00:02:13.569> up<00:02:13.659> as<00:02:13.810> well<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:15.010> third<00:02:15.220> and
