with brain computer interfaces or that
is<00:00:44.489> thoughts<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
is thoughts so what I have here is a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.459 
is thoughts so what I have here is a
mind<00:00:47.760> wave<00:00:47.910> mobile<00:00:48.239> headset<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.079> produced

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
mind wave mobile headset it's produced

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.459 
mind wave mobile headset it's produced
by<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> company<00:00:49.800> called<00:00:50.010> neuro<00:00:50.370> sky<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.320> it's<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
by a company called neuro sky and it's a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.200 
by a company called neuro sky and it's a
wireless<00:00:52.680> Bluetooth<00:00:53.309> headset<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> basically

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
wireless Bluetooth headset and basically

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
wireless Bluetooth headset and basically
what<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.510> lets<00:00:54.750> me<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.320> lets<00:00:55.469> me

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
what it lets me do is it lets me

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
what it lets me do is it lets me
communicate<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> computer<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.809> mobile

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
communicate with a computer or a mobile

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
communicate with a computer or a mobile
phone<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.710> case<00:00:58.920> using<00:00:59.850> my<00:00:59.940> brain<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
phone in this case using my brain it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
phone in this case using my brain it
converts<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.530> brain<00:01:01.770> waves<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.460> electrical

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
converts my brain waves into electrical

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
converts my brain waves into electrical
signals<00:01:03.000> which<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.629> sends<00:01:03.960> wirelessly<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> my

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
signals which it sends wirelessly to my

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.859 
signals which it sends wirelessly to my
phone<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> lets<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.760> play<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> game<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.810> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
phone and lets me play a game like this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.160 
phone and lets me play a game like this
this<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.590> cake<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.610> produced<00:01:09.000> by<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:09.960> us

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this is up cake it's produced by by us

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.140 
this is up cake it's produced by by us
at<00:01:10.409> personal<00:01:10.950> neuro<00:01:11.100> devices<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
at personal neuro devices and this is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.289 
at personal neuro devices and this is
the<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:12.330> neuro<00:01:13.260> game<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.830> girls<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> up

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the first neuro game for girls so up

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.789 
the first neuro game for girls so up
cake<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:15.810> simple<00:01:16.140> basically<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
cake is really simple basically you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
cake is really simple basically you
select<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.189> level<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> level<00:01:17.610> determines<00:01:18.270> how

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
select a level the level determines how

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
select a level the level determines how
difficult<00:01:19.439> how<00:01:19.560> much<00:01:19.710> focus<00:01:20.100> or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
difficult how much focus or

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.560 
difficult how much focus or
concentration<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> player<00:01:21.299> has<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
concentration that the player has to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.870 
concentration that the player has to
give<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> play<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.340> idea<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
give and then you play the idea is that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
give and then you play the idea is that
by<00:01:24.420> increasing<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.680> concentration<00:01:26.130> level

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
by increasing your concentration level

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
by increasing your concentration level
you<00:01:26.909> try<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> lift<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.630> cupcake<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> top<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you try to lift a cupcake to the top of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.850 
you try to lift a cupcake to the top of
a<00:01:28.860> screen<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.930> win<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> hits<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
a screen and you win when it hits that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
a screen and you win when it hits that
and<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.430> scored<00:01:32.790> based<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.329> how<00:01:33.479> rapidly

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and you're scored based on how rapidly

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.020 
and you're scored based on how rapidly
did<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.740> sustained<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.610> concentration

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
did it how sustained your concentration

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
did it how sustained your concentration

allows<00:01:46.409> us<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.829> shift<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.850> too

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
allows us to shift that a little bit too

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
allows us to shift that a little bit too
perhaps<00:01:48.869> move<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.290> products<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> appeal

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
perhaps move these products to appeal

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.020 
perhaps move these products to appeal
more<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> women<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.270> girls<00:01:51.570> our<00:01:52.140> hope<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
more to women and girls our hope is that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
more to women and girls our hope is that
