00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.170
 hello to all carnal like esteban derby 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.290
 commenting and well today I 'm going to 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.019
 show how to get a trophy racing 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.009
 level 6 the trophy is called point-blank 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.529
 and we look for it in chapter 4 of jake 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.529
 then he mentioned that he helps us chris and 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.000
 pierce to knock down a helicopter we 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.490
 a second helicopter will come out 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.170
 so what we have to do is 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.900
 get on the next roof 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.810
 and wait for the helicopter under a 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.450
 rope to be able to climb the damn 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.840
 rope and give it a shot of the magnum 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.880
 the damn helicopter pilot there 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.040
 to keep in mind that we should at least 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.350
 have a magnum bullet to do this 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.600
 trophy if not you will not be able to do so 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.820
 that if they do not have any bullets from the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.260
 magnum try to look for some 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.690
 and I thought from before to be able to perform 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.330
 the trophy here as well as they can 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.280
 observe there is the helicopter but in 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.400
 Sometimes it will take a long time 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.530
 lower the rope now yes that varies 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.140
 a lot depends on 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.500
 of the moment and the game can be launched 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.880
 the rope then you can throw yourself 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 the rope then 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.170
 you can spend quite a lot of the pack 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.610
 throw as here and here called the spear 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.659
 then the only thing we have to do 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.270
 is to crush the button to upload and a 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.840
 Once we are up to give him the shot of 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.850
 grace to the damn pilot of the helicopter 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.030
 here as in this one since it's pretty 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.159
 slow to see pobra lake you're all a 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.670
 turtle I think it has super powers 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.390
 the son of the blackened and as almost 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.390
 he came to see 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.680
 go that is slow and once up 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.860
 it is enough that we focus a little on the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.520
 pilot and we squeeze r1 this one is not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.770
 necessary that we point directly 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.720
 at the top you do not have to be that exact 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 in the shot and well here they see 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.580
 that the helicopter falls down and they give us the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.070
 trophy at point-blank range 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.960
 it's a pretty simple group and so 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.790
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.850
 video and that has served you already know 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.580

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.520
 greeting 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.840
