character cards I saw ever had that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.580 
character cards I saw ever had that
which<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.799> kind<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.250> weird<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.930> early<00:03:46.379> down

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
which is kind of weird the early down

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.000 
which is kind of weird the early down
psychic<00:03:47.040> Ike<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.639> can<00:03:47.879> see<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.389> model

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
psychic Ike that I can see of this model

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.949 
psychic Ike that I can see of this model
isn't<00:03:50.010> really<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.519> in<00:03:50.729> the<00:03:51.269> models<00:03:51.659> fault

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
isn't really that in the models fault

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.789 
isn't really that in the models fault
but<00:03:52.470> um<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:54.030> fact<00:03:54.329> that<00:03:54.659> it's<00:03:55.229> a<00:03:55.349> take<00:03:55.560> along

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
but um the fact that it's a take along

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.530 
but um the fact that it's a take along
means<00:03:56.129> that<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.459> will<00:03:56.639> be<00:03:56.699> slightly<00:03:57.060> smaller

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
means that it will be slightly smaller

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.839 
means that it will be slightly smaller
but<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.019> wish<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.949> model<00:03:59.220> was<00:03:59.459> bigger

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
but I wish that this model was bigger

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.319 
but I wish that this model was bigger
because<00:04:00.659> in<00:04:01.139> the<00:04:01.319> television<00:04:01.769> show<00:04:02.099> Ned<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:02.909> a

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
because in the television show Ned is a

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.689 
because in the television show Ned is a
really<00:04:03.900> biggest<00:04:04.260> evil<00:04:04.440> like<00:04:04.949> he's<00:04:05.459> bigger

whatever this is definitely one of the

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.970 
whatever this is definitely one of the
more<00:05:08.640> rare<00:05:08.970> ones<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:10.170> probably<00:05:10.650> up<00:05:10.770> there

more rare ones it's probably up there

with like take along Mike and you know
maybe<00:05:15.000> D<00:05:15.300> $1.99<00:05:15.930> but<00:05:16.340> this<00:05:17.340> character<00:05:17.640> is<00:05:18.060> very

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
maybe D $1.99 but this character is very

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.630 
maybe D $1.99 but this character is very
rare<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.960> very<00:05:19.170> hard<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.620> find<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:20.160> actually

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
rare and very hard to find I actually

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.540 
rare and very hard to find I actually
got<00:05:21.000> him<00:05:21.180> for<00:05:21.480> a<00:05:21.510> very<00:05:21.750> decent<00:05:22.020> price<00:05:22.410> with<00:05:23.310> his

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
got him for a very decent price with his

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.280 
got him for a very decent price with his
character<00:05:24.030> card<00:05:24.330> a<00:05:24.420> few<00:05:24.600> months<00:05:24.870> ago<00:05:25.080> for

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
character card a few months ago for

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.610 
character card a few months ago for
about<00:05:25.410> ten<00:05:25.830> dollars<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:27.150> was<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.390> UK<00:05:27.630> seller<00:05:28.200> so

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
about ten dollars it was a UK seller so

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.040 
about ten dollars it was a UK seller so
I<00:05:28.890> think<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.850> was<00:05:29.910> about<00:05:30.060> two<00:05:30.360> laws<00:05:30.540> but<00:05:30.780> I'm

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
I think it was about two laws but I'm

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.710 
I think it was about two laws but I'm
not<00:05:31.380> sure<00:05:31.770> about<00:05:33.710> United<00:05:34.710> Kingdom<00:05:35.100> money<00:05:35.280> so

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
not sure about United Kingdom money so

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.380 
not sure about United Kingdom money so
but<00:05:36.720> still<00:05:37.020> it's<00:05:37.440> nice<00:05:37.650> model<00:05:38.100> and<00:05:38.310> he's<00:05:39.180> not

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
but still it's nice model and he's not

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.840 
but still it's nice model and he's not
the<00:05:39.570> most<00:05:39.750> important<00:05:40.230> of<00:05:40.350> characters<00:05:40.830> as<00:05:41.040> he

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
the most important of characters as he

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.100 
the most important of characters as he
only<00:05:41.940> appeared<00:05:42.510> in<00:05:42.630> like<00:05:44.000> four<00:05:45.000> or<00:05:45.390> five<00:05:45.450> ish

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
only appeared in like four or five ish

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.310 
only appeared in like four or five ish
episodes<00:05:46.880> but<00:05:47.880> aside<00:05:48.150> from<00:05:48.210> that<00:05:48.390> you<00:05:48.690> know<00:05:48.720> if

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
episodes but aside from that you know if

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.910 
episodes but aside from that you know if
you<00:05:49.500> have<00:05:49.770> them<00:05:50.010> that's<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:51.030> good<00:05:51.210> thing<00:05:51.540> but<00:05:52.470> if

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
you have them that's a good thing but if

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.590 
you have them that's a good thing but if
you<00:05:53.190> don't<00:05:53.430> you<00:05:53.850> know<00:05:53.970> you<00:05:54.060> don't<00:05:54.390> need<00:05:54.540> to

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
you don't you know you don't need to

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.810 
you don't you know you don't need to
rush<00:05:54.930> out<00:05:55.140> to<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.470> eBay<00:05:56.340> to<00:05:56.400> get<00:05:56.670> him

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
rush out to the eBay to get him

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.020 
rush out to the eBay to get him
immediately<00:05:57.420> and<00:05:58.040> of<00:05:59.040> course<00:05:59.400> compared<00:05:59.940> to

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
immediately and of course compared to

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.940 
immediately and of course compared to
the<00:06:00.300> Trackmaster<00:06:01.050> model<00:06:01.320> I<00:06:01.410> think<00:06:01.440> this<00:06:01.800> is

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
the Trackmaster model I think this is

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.580 
the Trackmaster model I think this is
the<00:06:02.100> better<00:06:02.250> of<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.550> two<00:06:03.320> although<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.560> course

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
the better of the two although of course

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.880 
the better of the two although of course
that<00:06:05.130> one<00:06:05.280> gets<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.670> sizes<00:06:06.270> right<00:06:06.890> however

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
that one gets the sizes right however

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.790 
that one gets the sizes right however
this<00:06:08.370> is<00:06:08.520> still<00:06:08.700> a<00:06:08.730> very<00:06:08.940> nice<00:06:09.180> model<00:06:09.480> and<00:06:09.840> I

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
this is still a very nice model and I

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.910 
this is still a very nice model and I
guess<00:06:11.160> I<00:06:11.370> would<00:06:11.430> recommend<00:06:12.060> it

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
guess I would recommend it

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.120 
guess I would recommend it
so<00:06:13.920> in<00:06:14.550> conclusion<00:06:15.090> nice<00:06:16.080> model<00:06:16.590> not<00:06:17.070> a

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
so in conclusion nice model not a

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.480 
so in conclusion nice model not a
central<00:06:17.670> he<00:06:18.510> also<00:06:18.630> has<00:06:18.870> this<00:06:19.080> little<00:06:19.490> scooper

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
central he also has this little scooper

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
central he also has this little scooper
