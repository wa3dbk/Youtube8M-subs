00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.220
 a nice good day today, it is 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.080
 not in this review to a new one 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.570
 TV but what's up 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.280
 behind it is the tv 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.049
 is like you see without a stand because 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.330
 behind a tactic wall mount 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.490
 was attached 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.000
 the wall bracket itself is very 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.720
 robust very sturdy holder 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.330
 really all the screws you need 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 and co in the only thing you stop 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 Need is tooling otherwise 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 is there really everything with it 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.690
 matching screws for the rear of the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
 tv everything is really there 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.000
 it is even 10 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
 dowel with ten so screw it because 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.680
 you really do not do anything at all 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.270
 not correct 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.059
 this wall mount does not try that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.949
 catch a little bit more now 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.590
 She should be six in total here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.660
 points on the band bracket 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 is fixed once right above and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.150
 bottom 2 middle up and russians two and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.369
 screw two screws on top left and bottom 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.580
 as I said ten screw the thing that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.170
 looks so bomb- solid bridge really 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.390
 nothing more so i have to say i have 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.189
 at the beginning I was very scared because of me 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.979
 ever had a wall mount and 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.780
 they had been very shaky and there 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 I already had quite a bit 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.310
 fear that the whole thing again 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.689
 but it could be a bit crazy 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.960
 really stable you can really see 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.820
 even on those on the brackets 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.619
 that the whole is really of quality 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.560
 So they are really thick 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.720
 Massively the thing weighs a lot too 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.970
 that pigs difficult therefore needs 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.530
 at least two people around 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.299
 the whole thing to install because one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.220
 must hold the other must stop 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.070
 really to draw the hole 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.810
 then screw in the screws 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.210
 ideally, you even do it with three 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.200
 people would definitely be 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.390
 recommendable 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.310
 So as I said the bracket here one 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.470
 wall this point firmer pulp bull 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.220
 off hanging and that will not 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.170
 tear off 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.960
 then you can see the two closets here 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.870
 Amelie go over to the main one 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.200
 bracket where the television was received 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.630
 is 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.430
 here in front and very well there is one 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.900
 small spirit level with integrated man 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.740
 So can watch and the whole straight 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.750
 is or not 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.400
 otherwise even if it is in hindsight 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.870
 should not be straight and the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.150
 spirit level as a bit here 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.890
 then it is not to the left 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.270
 problem because you can this lower part 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.080
 Here you can see that now relatively 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.640
 bad but where this this this 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.050
 chromium plating received 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.330
 You can do that again in addition 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.830
 so do not pretend it is not a topic one 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.840
 can it now in retrospect 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.580
 correct so that you can not 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.200
 you have to lose weight again 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 just loosen two screws and thus has 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.459
 that already eaten 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.560
 these two strive behind 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.040
 they will be as usual on the back 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.690
 TV attached the appropriate 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.340
 screw the lie all with it as 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.180
 you really do not have to do anything anymore 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.400
 to get 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.560
 there is really a huge package here 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.110
 put with all sorts of screws 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.000
 and i've never seen this before 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.459
 trying her but because I was really 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.120
 Baff was also very difficult 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.110
 that's why the package has masons to say 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.550
 yes and if you do that someday 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.190
 have set everything back here 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.330
 have brought and co pursue the two 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.530
 then the tv is in the reason 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.350
 taken received only here 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.090
 once down here 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.570
 and down there and on the other side 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.420
 also again one thinks safe 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.739
 surely only a hang there you can 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.450
 be times quite dangerous if you 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.190
 maybe it's time to go there 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.900
 but not because they have something 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.900
 come up with a simple one here 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900
 the front is a small screw for 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.350
 screw that solves easy and then 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.940
 you can use these retaining clips for it 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.250
 then you can push up 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.140
 as soon as you push the whole thing 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.000
 has hinged works just the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.770
 Press down the screw 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.520
 stuck and the thing is not moving 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.430
 piecemeal 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.140
 so there can herkules turn there 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.290
 nothing would be great 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.810
 Although primarily a small child running 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.210
 not yet but will soon be determined 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.940
 come and of course you have to double 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.430
 be careful 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.140
 yes and the thing that that depends 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.360
 simply bombastic you can also do that 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.430
 Tilt the tv if you like 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.560
 i would like to have that for example 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.210
 you go a little bit the corner when you are 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.370
 the whole time is looking at my 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.820
 tilted slightly down so that with 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.290
 the position of the couch fits together 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.120
 just because the couch is around it, of course 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:43.070
 some lower than the tv 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.960
 and you can also change the bracket 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.610
 let it swing left and right 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.680
 no topic at all i have now 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.440
 with me just in the middle made slightly 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.050
 put down the tv and is 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.440
 just wonderful should be there is also 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.590
 nothing vibration from the text 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.630
 sound will was not to the wall 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.580
 passed a wall so you can 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.070
 any problems with the 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.570
 neighbors or so can get so synonymous 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.090
 ever be the case and otherwise 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.940
 a top thing so I have to say for the 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.380
 price you really get there 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.550
 high quality thing 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.950
 I already have many wall mounts 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.630
 just seen at saturn and media 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.780
 market and co yes yes, sometimes like one 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.990
 bit the customer also fidget the 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.530
 also much more expensive and not this 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.490
 quality offered 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.350
 So I'm definitely excited 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.000
 you can also watch the tv 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.770
 then turn completely on the wall ram 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.660
 So, that's about here 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.640
 ten centimeters he stands then so away 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.470
 is definitely a top thing though 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.340
 which are fully extended then 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.990
 I believe it 50 cm 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.550
 you can fix that here you can 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.900
 really let it fully extend like that 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.190
 that it is really straight 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.900
 Here you can see that it is now a 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.840
 a little bit crooked because I'm not 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.960
 all that was standing forward 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.780
 but i'm totally crazy 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.620
 excited about the thing because you have it 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.740
 so many setting options and 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.930
 yes i can only really help you 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.520
 recommend you can decide 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.710
 should wish for the wall mount 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.660
 you definitely have fun and think 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.210
 that you are in any case 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.910
 several people like to pick this up best 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.380
 said two or three pieces because alone 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.030
 you can not do that under any circumstances 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.830
 and not come up with the idea their 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.130
 Woman or something to ask so please 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:40.310
 This will definitely be too hard for you 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:43.220
 for her I wish you then on everyone 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.120
 a lot of fun and hope we see 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.990
 us next time 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.990
 thank you for watching
