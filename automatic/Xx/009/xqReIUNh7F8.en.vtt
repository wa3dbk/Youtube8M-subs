00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.480 
review for the Nike CTI
nice<00:00:15.120> tree<00:00:15.390> -<00:00:16.610> well<00:00:17.610> a<00:00:18.770> lot<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> questions<00:00:20.369> were

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
nice tree - well a lot of questions were

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.190 
nice tree - well a lot of questions were
asked<00:00:20.940> what<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:21.930> main<00:00:22.170> difference

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
asked what is the main difference

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.660 
asked what is the main difference
between<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.550> original<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.450> new<00:00:25.080> one

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
between the original one and the new one

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.740 
between the original one and the new one
honestly<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.300> much<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
honestly there's not much of a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.269 
honestly there's not much of a
difference<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.349> would<00:00:28.619> say<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> biggest

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
difference I would say the biggest

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.890 
difference I would say the biggest
difference<00:00:29.520> would<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.570> fit

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
difference would have to be fit

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.530 
difference would have to be fit
basically<00:00:31.940> this<00:00:32.940> shoe<00:00:33.800> overall<00:00:34.800> fits<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.310> lot

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
basically this shoe overall fits a lot

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.790 
basically this shoe overall fits a lot
tighter<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.079> bulky<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:37.560> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
tighter it's not as bulky as the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.370 
tighter it's not as bulky as the
original<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.840> lacing<00:00:39.840> system<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
original one and the lacing system is

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.990 
original one and the lacing system is
fixed<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> little<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.430> made<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> lacing

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
fixed a little bit they made the lacing

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.110 
fixed a little bit they made the lacing
system<00:00:42.180> ever<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.320> slightly<00:00:43.680> deeper<00:00:44.520> into<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
system ever so slightly deeper into the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.870 
system ever so slightly deeper into the
foot<00:00:45.380> so<00:00:46.380> you<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> more<00:00:46.890> secure<00:00:47.310> tight<00:00:47.610> fit

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
foot so you get a more secure tight fit

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.210 
foot so you get a more secure tight fit
with<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.240> boot<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.560> one<00:00:49.710> wanted

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
with the boot which is the one wanted

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.530 
with the boot which is the one wanted
one<00:00:50.490> of<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.610> main<00:00:50.820> complaints<00:00:51.330> with<00:00:51.450> the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
one of my main complaints with the

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.640 
one of my main complaints with the
original<00:00:52.790> other<00:00:53.790> than<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.330> all<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.290> changes

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
original other than that all the changes

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.940 
original other than that all the changes
have<00:00:55.830> been<00:00:55.980> pretty<00:00:56.730> minor<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.650> was<00:00:58.650> in<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
have been pretty minor I was in the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.980 
have been pretty minor I was in the
kangalite<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.610> still<00:01:00.240> really<00:01:00.600> nice<00:01:00.720> it's

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
kangalite is still really nice it's

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.160 
kangalite is still really nice it's
really<00:01:01.050> soft<00:01:01.590> softens<00:01:02.310> up<00:01:02.430> after<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:03.170> couple

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
really soft softens up after a couple

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.060 
really soft softens up after a couple
hours<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.559> use<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.720> it's<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.079> would<00:01:07.650> say<00:01:07.770> it's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
hours of use and it's I would say it's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.510 
hours of use and it's I would say it's
slightly<00:01:08.939> thinner<00:01:09.420> than<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> original<00:01:09.930> one

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
slightly thinner than the original one

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
slightly thinner than the original one
which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> bad<00:01:12.479> thing<00:01:12.689> at<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.280> feels

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
which is not a bad thing at all it feels

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
which is not a bad thing at all it feels
just<00:01:14.689> just<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.900> good<00:01:16.079> as<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> original<00:01:16.409> one

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
just just as good as the original one

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.239 
just just as good as the original one
did<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:18.030> pads<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.540> still<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.350> same<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.950> I

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
did the pads are still the same there I

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.450 
did the pads are still the same there I
think<00:01:20.729> maybe<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.999> little<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.450> smaller<00:01:21.780> but

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
think maybe a little bit smaller but

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
think maybe a little bit smaller but
honestly<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.609> makes<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:23.939> difference<00:01:23.969> in<00:01:24.780> terms

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
honestly it makes no difference in terms

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.450 
honestly it makes no difference in terms
of<00:01:25.350> how<00:01:25.649> they<00:01:25.799> work<00:01:27.679> another<00:01:28.679> comfort<00:01:29.219> change

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
of how they work another comfort change

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
of how they work another comfort change
that<00:01:29.609> they<00:01:29.729> made<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.149> be<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:31.259> little<00:01:31.619> bit

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that they made would be the a little bit

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.940 
that they made would be the a little bit
of<00:01:31.920> suede<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.460> put<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.819> a<00:01:32.850> heel<00:01:33.799> which<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
of suede they put in a heel which is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.289 
of suede they put in a heel which is
only<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:35.639> it<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.969> really

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
only a good thing because it is really

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.719 
only a good thing because it is really
soft<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:37.310> really<00:01:38.310> comfortable

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
soft and really comfortable

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
soft and really comfortable
they<00:01:41.729> also<00:01:41.880> made<00:01:42.149> these<00:01:42.539> little<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.170> don't<00:01:43.709> know

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
they also made these little I don't know

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.010 
they also made these little I don't know
if<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> guys<00:01:44.039> can<00:01:44.249> see<00:01:44.429> them<00:01:44.869> these<00:01:45.920> little

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
if you guys can see them these little

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.449 
if you guys can see them these little
cutouts<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.469> tongue<00:01:49.709> so<00:01:50.039> when<00:01:50.219> you<00:01:50.280> put

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
cutouts in the tongue so when you put

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.760 
cutouts in the tongue so when you put
the<00:01:50.549> shoe<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.229> tongue<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.499> wraps

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the shoe on the tongue kind of wraps

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.459 
the shoe on the tongue kind of wraps
around<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.249> leg<00:01:53.459> instead<00:01:53.969> of<00:01:54.229> kind<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> like

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
around your leg instead of kind of like

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.980 
around your leg instead of kind of like
fitting<00:01:56.399> uncomfortably<00:01:57.090> which<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> really

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
fitting uncomfortably which is really

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.709 
fitting uncomfortably which is really
nice<00:01:58.109> I<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.969> like<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> part<00:02:00.420> about<00:02:00.569> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
nice I really like that part about the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.459 
nice I really like that part about the
shoe<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.429> added<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.840> original<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.319> had

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
shoe and they added the original one had

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.459 
shoe and they added the original one had
just<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.979> plain<00:02:05.459> flat<00:02:05.850> rubber<00:02:06.179> pad<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:07.409> here

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
just a plain flat rubber pad right here

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.460 
just a plain flat rubber pad right here
this<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.039> has<00:02:08.539> kind<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.600> like<00:02:09.780> these<00:02:10.259> little

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
this one has kind of like these little

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.830 
this one has kind of like these little
dimples<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> someone<00:02:12.030> went<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840

dimples on it someone went to like the
laser<00:02:13.530> threes<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:15.120> honestly<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.709> really

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
laser threes but honestly I really

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.610 
laser threes but honestly I really
didn't<00:02:16.920> find<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.550> anything<00:02:17.730> at<00:02:18.150> all

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
didn't find it to do anything at all

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.320 
didn't find it to do anything at all
actually<00:02:19.620> kind<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.280> didn't<00:02:20.550> really<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:20.970> it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
actually kind of didn't really like it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.690 
actually kind of didn't really like it
because<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.860> didn't<00:02:23.130> feel<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.460> ball

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
because you didn't feel the ball

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.310 
because you didn't feel the ball
touching<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.300> foot<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.660> just<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.110> felt

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
touching your foot you just kind of felt

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.140 
touching your foot you just kind of felt
a<00:02:25.380> rubber

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.289 

but<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.230> terms<00:02:29.409> of<00:02:29.560> comfort<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.159> a

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
but in terms of comfort this is a

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.100 
but in terms of comfort this is a
extremely<00:02:31.299> comfortable<00:02:31.750> shoe<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.810> thing

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
extremely comfortable shoe one thing

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.589 
extremely comfortable shoe one thing
some<00:02:35.980> place<00:02:36.159> it<00:02:36.400> exactly<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.000> same<00:02:37.209> but<00:02:37.450> one

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
some place it exactly the same but one

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.690 
some place it exactly the same but one
thing<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.870> would<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.290> say<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.489> if<00:02:39.640> you

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
thing I would like to say is that if you

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.460 
thing I would like to say is that if you
are<00:02:39.790> planning<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.329> using<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:40.810> shoe<00:02:40.959> for<00:02:41.140> turf

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
are planning on using this shoe for turf

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.069 
are planning on using this shoe for turf
I<00:02:41.680> would<00:02:42.040> definitely<00:02:42.610> stay<00:02:43.120> away<00:02:43.150> or<00:02:43.659> go<00:02:43.870> for

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
I would definitely stay away or go for

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.849 
I would definitely stay away or go for
the<00:02:44.170> elite<00:02:44.609> because<00:02:45.810> I'm<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:47.079> sure<00:02:47.319> why<00:02:47.530> but

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
the elite because I'm not sure why but

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.259 
the elite because I'm not sure why but
this<00:02:48.069> shoe<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.310> very<00:02:48.370> clingy<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.879> think<00:02:49.180> it

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
this shoe is very clingy I think it

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.410 
this shoe is very clingy I think it
might<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.659> to<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:49.959> with<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:51.420> circle

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
might have to do with this circle

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.479 
might have to do with this circle
pattern<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.989> studs<00:02:53.260> because<00:02:53.489> when

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
pattern and the studs because when

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.949 
pattern and the studs because when
you're<00:02:54.609> playing<00:02:54.640> your<00:02:54.970> foot<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.329> grips<00:02:55.569> at<00:02:55.780> all

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
you're playing your foot it grips at all

you're playing your foot it grips at all
directions<00:02:56.319> giving<00:02:57.069> your<00:02:57.220> foot<00:02:57.459> really<00:02:58.329> no
