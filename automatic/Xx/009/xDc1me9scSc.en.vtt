the arms and legs just come right out so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.060 
the arms and legs just come right out so
that's<00:02:30.310> why<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:30.910> didn't<00:02:31.270> take<00:02:31.360> pictures<00:02:32.070> also

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
that's why I didn't take pictures also

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.370 
that's why I didn't take pictures also
from<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.610> bigger<00:02:33.850> standpoint<00:02:34.480> isn't<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.140> kind

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
from a bigger standpoint isn't it kind

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.800 
from a bigger standpoint isn't it kind

I<00:02:41.440> mean<00:02:42.280> who<00:02:42.580> makes<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.000> toy<00:02:43.270> like<00:02:43.300> that

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
I mean who makes a toy like that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.490 
I mean who makes a toy like that
whatever<00:02:45.190> um<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> here's<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.320> final

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
whatever um so here's the final

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.710 
whatever um so here's the final
breakdown<00:02:47.830> as<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.700> see<00:02:48.970> he<00:02:49.330> didn't<00:02:49.630> go

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
breakdown as you can see he didn't go

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420 
breakdown as you can see he didn't go
completely<00:02:49.900> without<00:02:50.530> any<00:02:50.710> fabrication<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
completely without any fabrication I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.050 
completely without any fabrication I
made<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.930> collar<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.860> imply<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.430> he's<00:02:54.730> wearing

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
made a collar to imply that he's wearing

made a collar to imply that he's wearing
an<00:02:55.180> outer<00:02:55.360> jacket<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.230> not<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.370> two-tone

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
an outer jacket and not just a two-tone

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.990 
an outer jacket and not just a two-tone
t-shirt<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.860> gave<00:03:00.130> his<00:03:00.340> hair<00:03:00.580> some<00:03:00.820> more

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
t-shirt and I gave his hair some more

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.350 
t-shirt and I gave his hair some more
points<00:03:01.240> for<00:03:01.740> some<00:03:02.740> this<00:03:03.610> kind<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:03.970> hair<00:03:04.210> is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
points for some this kind of hair is

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
points for some this kind of hair is
easiest<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.990> draw<00:03:05.380> but<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:07.240> almost<00:03:07.720> no

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
easiest to draw but I have almost no

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.050 
easiest to draw but I have almost no
idea<00:03:08.770> how<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:08.980> represent<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:09.790> three

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
idea how to represent it in three

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.750 
idea how to represent it in three
dimensions<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.840> mean<00:03:11.050> I'm<00:03:11.260> working<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.520> fly

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
dimensions I mean I'm working on the fly

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.490 
dimensions I mean I'm working on the fly
here<00:03:13.090> i<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.210> took<00:03:13.660> my<00:03:13.720> best<00:03:14.050> guess<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.470> to

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
here i just took my best guess as to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.520 
here i just took my best guess as to
what<00:03:15.190> would<00:03:15.490> spiky<00:03:16.150> hair<00:03:16.450> swept<00:03:16.900> over<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.350> one

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
what would spiky hair swept over to one

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.010 
what would spiky hair swept over to one
side<00:03:17.560> like<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.670> was<00:03:18.790> vaguely<00:03:19.060> comb<00:03:19.510> look<00:03:19.780> like

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
side like it was vaguely comb look like

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.070 
side like it was vaguely comb look like
and<00:03:20.709> i<00:03:20.770> came<00:03:20.830> up<00:03:21.130> with<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.970> i'm<00:03:22.270> pretty

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
and i came up with this and i'm pretty

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.850 
and i came up with this and i'm pretty
sure<00:03:23.590> that's<00:03:23.830> accurate<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.550> don't<00:03:25.420> know<00:03:25.860> okay

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
sure that's accurate I don't know okay

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.800 
sure that's accurate I don't know okay
my<00:03:27.340> next<00:03:27.700> custom<00:03:28.120> will<00:03:28.690> be<00:03:28.990> a<00:03:29.380> sonic<00:03:30.010> figure

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
my next custom will be a sonic figure

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.320 
my next custom will be a sonic figure
look<00:03:31.810> forward<00:03:32.020> to<00:03:32.170> that
