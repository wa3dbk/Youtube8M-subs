00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to be even more defined you can twist it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.950 
to be even more defined you can twist it
like<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.859> then<00:02:02.850> clip<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.240> hair<00:02:03.689> and

fullness now if you feel like there's

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.380 
fullness now if you feel like there's
too<00:03:22.590> much<00:03:22.710> phase<00:03:23.010> which<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.730> personally

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
too much phase which I like personally

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.840 
too much phase which I like personally
for<00:03:24.420> me<00:03:24.720> sexier<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.770> younger<00:03:26.040> if<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.700> look

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850

know<00:03:56.610> feeling<00:03:56.970> again<00:03:57.330> I'm<00:03:57.510> using<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.930> same

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
know feeling again I'm using the same

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.690 
know feeling again I'm using the same
amount<00:03:58.320> for<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.740> whole<00:03:58.950> head<00:03:59.250> because<00:03:59.550> the

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
amount for the whole head because the

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.630 
amount for the whole head because the
hair<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.720> know<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.990> moose<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.100> bear<00:04:02.400> polish

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
hair you know the moose the bear polish

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.420 
hair you know the moose the bear polish
expands<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.690> helps<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.230> define<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.160> so

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
expands and it helps you define it so

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.430 
expands and it helps you define it so
you<00:04:05.490> still<00:04:05.820> have<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.030> feeling<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
you still have that feeling but that

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.200 
you still have that feeling but that
roughness<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.220> know<00:04:08.310> kind<00:04:08.610> of<00:04:08.640> like<00:04:08.700> soft

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
roughness you know kind of like soft

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.110 
roughness you know kind of like soft
subtle<00:04:09.660> wave<00:04:10.020> now<00:04:10.620> for<00:04:10.890> this<00:04:11.070> side<00:04:11.340> again<00:04:11.880> just

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
subtle wave now for this side again just

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.120 
subtle wave now for this side again just
little<00:04:12.600> amount<00:04:12.900> or<00:04:13.140> some<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.590> still<00:04:13.920> have<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.100> lot

little amount or some I still have a lot
on<00:04:14.370> there<00:04:14.850> but<00:04:15.510> what<00:04:15.660> happens<00:04:15.990> it<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.140> expands

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
on there but what happens it is expands

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.550 
on there but what happens it is expands
in<00:04:17.190> your<00:04:17.340> hand<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:18.299> hair<00:04:18.570> grabs<00:04:18.870> onto<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.440> and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
hair versus making weighing the hair

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.650 
hair versus making weighing the hair
down<00:04:36.420> so<00:04:37.320> again<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.830> small<00:04:38.130> amount<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.730> again

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
down so again a small amount and again

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.680 
down so again a small amount and again
run<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:40.470> through<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:41.040> like<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:42.090> shake<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.570> like

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
run it through I like to shake it like

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.780 
run it through I like to shake it like
this<00:04:42.890> kind<00:04:43.890> of<00:04:43.950> gets<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.340> through<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.640> whole

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
this kind of gets it through the whole

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.170 
this kind of gets it through the whole
thing

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
thing

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.950 
thing
and<00:04:45.270> do<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.199> ends<00:04:46.470> like<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.479> still

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
and do the ends like that so you still

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.740 
and do the ends like that so you still
have<00:04:49.139> your<00:04:49.350> wave<00:04:49.590> but<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.699> becomes<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.539> little

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
have your wave but it becomes a little

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.020 
have your wave but it becomes a little
bit<00:04:52.169> more<00:04:52.350> teams<00:04:52.740> not<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.310> like<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.759> but

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
bit more teams not that I like that but

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.680 
bit more teams not that I like that but
you<00:04:54.240> know<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:55.139> see<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:56.150> it<00:04:57.150> gives<00:04:57.389> you<00:04:57.539> that

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
you know so see that it gives you that

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.749 
you know so see that it gives you that
finish<00:04:58.470> kind<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.919> Bounce<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.460> really

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
finish kind of Bounce so it's really

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.610 
finish kind of Bounce so it's really
really<00:05:00.180> natural<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.750> doesn't<00:05:01.139> feel<00:05:01.410> like

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
really natural it doesn't feel like

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.219 
really natural it doesn't feel like
you've<00:05:01.889> spent<00:05:02.759> too<00:05:02.970> much<00:05:03.120> time<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.750> it's

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
you've spent too much time and it's

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.810 
you've spent too much time and it's
almost<00:05:04.380> like<00:05:04.680> when<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:04.919> were<00:05:05.070> kids<00:05:05.400> how<00:05:05.639> our

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
almost like when we were kids how our

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.520 
almost like when we were kids how our
hair<00:05:06.030> used<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.330> be<00:05:06.389> after<00:05:06.840> we<00:05:06.960> get<00:05:07.139> out<00:05:07.289> of<00:05:07.440> the

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
hair used to be after we get out of the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.040 
hair used to be after we get out of the
beach<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:08.100> know<00:05:08.130> really<00:05:08.639> really<00:05:09.090> kind<00:05:09.930> of
