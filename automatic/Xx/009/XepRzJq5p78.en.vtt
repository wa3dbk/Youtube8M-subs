00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
okay welcome back everybody when

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay welcome back everybody when
fiddling<00:00:03.750> around<00:00:03.810> with<00:00:03.990> fraps<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:05.730> game

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
fiddling around with fraps and the game

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.390 
fiddling around with fraps and the game
itself<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.540> figured<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.830> frame<00:00:08.040> really

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
itself I figured that the frame really

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.890 
itself I figured that the frame really
wasn't<00:00:08.580> gonna<00:00:08.730> be<00:00:08.880> changed<00:00:09.240> much<00:00:09.480> when<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.750> was

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
wasn't gonna be changed much when I was

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.330 
wasn't gonna be changed much when I was
recording<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:11.120> sorry<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.480> you'll<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
recording so I sorry but you'll have to

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.090 
recording so I sorry but you'll have to
unfortunately<00:00:14.340> deal<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.830> 22<00:00:16.830> frames

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
unfortunately deal with the 22 frames

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.710 
unfortunately deal with the 22 frames
per<00:00:17.369> second<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.270> online<00:00:18.420> play

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
per second but with online play

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.450 
per second but with online play
hopefully<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> shouldn't<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.619> slowed<00:00:20.430> down

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
hopefully it shouldn't be slowed down

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.250 
hopefully it shouldn't be slowed down
like<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.359> story<00:00:21.720> mode<00:00:21.869> because

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
like it is in the story mode because

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
like it is in the story mode because
obviously<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.400> would<00:00:23.550> mean<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> other

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
obviously that would mean that the other

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.839 
obviously that would mean that the other
person<00:00:24.869> whose<00:00:24.990> video<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:26.039> being<00:00:26.550> slowed<00:00:26.820> down

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
person whose video was being slowed down

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.480 
person whose video was being slowed down
as<00:00:27.090> well<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.980> it's<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> little

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
team match and I definitely prefer

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.810 
team match and I definitely prefer
single<00:02:37.610> matches<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.210> team<00:02:38.390> matches<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:40.760> I

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
there's a lot going on in this screen

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.800 
there's a lot going on in this screen
and<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:55.940> definitely<00:02:56.120> don't<00:02:56.420> like<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.690> so

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
hopefully I don't have to cut this

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.540 
hopefully I don't have to cut this
footage<00:03:05.530> because<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.800> potentially<00:03:07.430> might

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
footage because it potentially might

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.180 
footage because it potentially might
take<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.760> very<00:03:07.970> long<00:03:08.060> time<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:08.980> let's<00:03:09.980> see<00:03:10.100> what

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
take a very long time but let's see what

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.980 
take a very long time but let's see what
happens<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:13.250> there<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:13.790> go<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.120> did<00:03:14.810> not

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
happens and there we go that did not

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.320 
happens and there we go that did not
take<00:03:15.380> longer<00:03:15.650> than<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.250> minute<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:16.850> that's<00:03:17.150> cool

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
take longer than a minute so that's cool
