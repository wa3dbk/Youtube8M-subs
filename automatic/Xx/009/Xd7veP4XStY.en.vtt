00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.589
 yes hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.210
 another small unboxing from me 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.950
 it came from you the suggestion that I 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.500
 but not always write directly 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.300
 the video description what it is with it 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.410
 the surprise is greater even though 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.630
 this should be at the date 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.010
 probably not that big 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.150
 I'll surprise you now 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.770
 that means i carry the name 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
 then only after a few days 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.840
 and it had more who would have that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.640
 thought the legend of zelda the wind 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.140
 waker hd rage but always yes me 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.279
 I am glad that finally there are many 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.250
 have already come into the enjoyment 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.750
 and could already play from Wednesday 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.780
 did not see saturn has probably already 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.399
 previously issued and amazon already 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 Unfortunately , Mainz unfortunately does not ship quite early 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.410
 that means I would have eyes and ears 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.090
 not allowed to keep me is myself 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.710
 nothing to be satisfied with even if it is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.170
 Really hard because I need a part 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.390
 are when people finally see the first zelda 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.829
 for the wii u wonderful even if it only 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.989
 a remake is complete for me 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.770
 new game because I also have a game 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.609
 cube did not play at that time and me 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.870
 am very excited 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.640
 I could with the cel 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.130
 shading graphic does not make friends 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.010
 but that should probably mean now 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.150
 has become so much better now I can 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.030
 make friends with me, I'm glad 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.580
 much on what I call the right times 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.119
 then for the view but until then 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.689
 a nice wait time to bridge and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.490
 rage hd wonderful beautiful ok in you 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.810
 could also be advised with the pro 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.009
 controllers control a lot for me 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:38.009
 nice thing okay just inside looks 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.829
 as usual, if that's ok, coach normal 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.509
 defects and yes yes software 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.950
 instructions okay whatever 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.890
 drinsteht probably does not look 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.570
 he stretches awards that also barely 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.240
 and of course the most important is the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.619
 description liter from the special 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 edition it did not become with me 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.890
 because I think the figure of gendorf 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.570
 not very pretty but some 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.159
 this cheese bell somehow but that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.659
 the bundle is cool so I would like 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.149
 the ornament had on the gamepad 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.630
 But I've already review but that 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.270
 leading 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.920
 the game is there so oh yes 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.740
 of course I would have thought so 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 Adjust the underground 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.000
 yes I would say you look around 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.000
 plays so far new character
