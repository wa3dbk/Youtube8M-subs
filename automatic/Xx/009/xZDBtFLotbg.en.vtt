another<00:00:05.100> quick<00:00:05.370> example<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:06.120> can<00:00:06.660> just<00:00:06.839> do<00:00:06.960> this

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
another quick example I can just do this

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.160 
another quick example I can just do this
all<00:00:07.350> day<00:00:07.379> long<00:00:07.790> I'm<00:00:08.790> running<00:00:09.599> again<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
all day long I'm running again on the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.189 
all day long I'm running again on the
mains<00:00:10.580> River<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:12.330> drawing<00:00:12.799> 191<00:00:13.799> watts<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:15.199> I'm

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
mains River is drawing 191 watts and I'm

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.779 
mains River is drawing 191 watts and I'm
at<00:00:16.440> twenty<00:00:16.890> four<00:00:17.100> point<00:00:17.670> nine<00:00:18.000> two<00:00:18.270> bolts<00:00:18.840> on

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
at twenty four point nine two bolts on

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.269 
at twenty four point nine two bolts on
these<00:00:20.789> two<00:00:21.180> batteries<00:00:21.960> down<00:00:22.410> here<00:00:22.800> connected

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
these two batteries down here connected

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.630 
these two batteries down here connected
in<00:00:23.400> series<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.439> I've<00:00:25.439> disconnected<00:00:26.010> this

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
in series and I've disconnected this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.410 
in series and I've disconnected this
lead<00:00:26.939> right<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.900> which<00:00:28.820> goes<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> rotor

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
lead right here which goes to the rotor

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.780 
lead right here which goes to the rotor
ver<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> generator<00:00:32.340> coming

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
ver and I just have the generator coming

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
ver and I just have the generator coming
in<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> power<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.079> coming<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.530> very<00:00:34.860> slowly

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
in so the power is coming up very slowly

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
in so the power is coming up very slowly
but<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> mix<00:00:36.780> those<00:00:37.079> two<00:00:37.410> energies

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
but when I mix those two energies

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.069 
but when I mix those two energies
together<00:00:38.300> that's<00:00:39.300> when<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> magic<00:00:40.050> happens

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
together that's when the magic happens

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.240 
together that's when the magic happens
and<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> show<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.469> again<00:00:43.530> 191

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and I want to show you that again 191

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.139 
and I want to show you that again 191

made
now<00:01:02.469> look<00:01:02.949> what<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.250> drawers<00:01:03.489> down<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.180> a

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
now look what the drawers down to a

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.100 
now look what the drawers down to a
hundred<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.530> forty-four<00:01:06.280> watts<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.110> what's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
hundred and forty-four watts and what's

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.670 
hundred and forty-four watts and what's
our<00:01:08.290> power<00:01:08.500> doing<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:10.600> all<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.930> way<00:01:11.110> it's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
our power doing it's all the way it's

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
our power doing it's all the way it's
already<00:01:12.159> up<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.670> 25<00:01:13.630> volts<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.520> climbing

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
already up to 25 volts and climbing

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.940 
already up to 25 volts and climbing
between<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.840> two<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.140> course<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.530> series<00:01:17.920> you

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
between the two of course in series you

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.260 
between the two of course in series you
know<00:01:18.190> so<00:01:18.399> it's<00:01:18.550> like<00:01:18.610> twelve<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> half

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
know so it's like twelve and a half

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.800 
know so it's like twelve and a half
volts

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.230 

steady<00:01:26.290> climbing<00:01:27.090> 143<00:01:28.090> watts<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:30.000> input<00:01:31.000> now

show you it's pretty fascinating I've

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.859 
show you it's pretty fascinating I've
got<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.490> quanta<00:01:57.940> converter<00:01:58.270> running<00:01:58.690> right

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
got the quanta converter running right

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.410 
got the quanta converter running right
now<00:01:59.080> but<00:02:00.009> as<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:00.399> can<00:02:00.520> see<00:02:00.789> up<00:02:01.030> here<00:02:01.060> I've

quantity arter itself so all we've got

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.380 
quantity arter itself so all we've got
is<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.960> third<00:02:08.709> phase<00:02:09.009> radiant<00:02:09.759> coming<00:02:10.149> out<00:02:10.300> of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
is the third phase radiant coming out of

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.960 
is the third phase radiant coming out of
the<00:02:10.479> road<00:02:10.630> over<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.989> coming<00:02:11.950> into<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.610> bridge

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
battery is really low it's 1111 point oh

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.240 
battery is really low it's 1111 point oh
eight<00:02:28.600> volts<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:31.060> road<00:02:31.269> overturned

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.720 

163<00:02:36.250> volt<00:02:36.760> amps<00:02:37.329> which<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.980> point<00:02:42.340> three

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
163 volt amps which is one point three

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.990 
163 volt amps which is one point three
two<00:02:43.090> amps<00:02:44.040> let's<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.220> there<00:02:45.400> one<00:02:45.609> point<00:02:45.850> three

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
two amps let's go there one point three

two amps let's go there one point three
two<00:02:46.269> one<00:02:46.660> point<00:02:46.900> three<00:02:47.019> three<00:02:47.230> amps<00:02:47.739> at<00:02:48.359> 121

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
two one point three three amps at 121

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.720 
two one point three three amps at 121
point<00:02:49.989> 7<00:02:50.500> volts<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:52.209> really<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.280> 164<00:02:54.280> bulled

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
point 7 volts so it really is 164 bulled

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.780 
point 7 volts so it really is 164 bulled
amps<00:02:55.120> volts<00:02:55.620> time<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.890> LA<00:02:56.950> amps<00:02:57.730> watts<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:59.790> now

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
amps volts time to LA amps watts and now

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.690 
amps volts time to LA amps watts and now
watch<00:03:01.030> what<00:03:01.239> happens<00:03:01.799> when<00:03:02.799> I<00:03:02.890> connect<00:03:03.310> this

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
watch what happens when I connect this

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.460 
watch what happens when I connect this
to<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> positive<00:03:05.410> watch<00:03:06.280> what<00:03:06.549> happens<00:03:07.030> on

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
to the positive watch what happens on

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:17.470 
to the positive watch what happens on
the<00:03:08.489> power<00:03:09.840> going<00:03:10.840> into<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.440> row<00:03:11.980> diverter

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.330 

and<00:03:17.750> look<00:03:18.260> at<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:18.440> power<00:03:18.590> increase<00:03:19.069> on<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
and look at the power increase on the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.309 
and look at the power increase on the
battery<00:03:19.640> now<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:20.120> course<00:03:20.360> it'll<00:03:20.840> do<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.140> with

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
battery now of course it'll do this with

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.809 
battery now of course it'll do this with
any<00:03:21.470> battery<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.950> just<00:03:22.190> put<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.400> little<00:03:22.610> one

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
any battery I just put this little one

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.330 
any battery I just put this little one
on<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.030> table<00:03:23.330> because<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.569> was<00:03:23.629> convenient

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
on the table because it was convenient

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.259 
on the table because it was convenient
you<00:03:25.340> know<00:03:25.370> I'm<00:03:25.580> gonna<00:03:25.700> I'm<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.209> to

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
you know I'm gonna I'm going to

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.770 
you know I'm gonna I'm going to
overcharge<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:27.550> 16:45<00:03:28.550> but<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.540> real

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
overcharge it 16:45 but it's just real

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.809 
overcharge it 16:45 but it's just real
high<00:03:29.930> voltage<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:30.620> look<00:03:30.830> what<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:30.980> did<00:03:31.220> it

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
high voltage but look what it did it

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.920 
high voltage but look what it did it
dropped<00:03:32.180> down<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.530> input<00:03:33.830> power<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
dropped down the the input power to the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.770 
dropped down the the input power to the
road<00:03:36.110> over<00:03:37.150> 298<00:03:38.150> watts<00:03:38.980> take<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.069> off

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.020 

back<00:03:44.780> up<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.580> 161<00:03:46.580> watts<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:48.580> when<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.700> put<00:03:49.940> it

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
back up to 161 watts so when you put it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.430 
back up to 161 watts so when you put it
under<00:03:50.239> load<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:52.130> actually<00:03:52.940> causes<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:54.140> ro

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
under load it actually causes the ro

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.690 
under load it actually causes the ro
diverter<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:55.489> draw<00:03:55.900> less<00:03:56.900> power<00:03:57.700> pretty

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
diverter to draw less power pretty

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.030 
diverter to draw less power pretty
interesting<00:03:59.209> right

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.110 

you
