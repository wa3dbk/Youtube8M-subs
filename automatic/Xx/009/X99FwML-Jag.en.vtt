00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.780
 they like the thickness rent because 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.980
 look at their relationship they offended 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.309
 but they suffered see disappointment many are 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.750
 they laughed at their commission the real one is alone 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.750
 It is a character that has a little bit 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.750
 luggage 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.140
 now it's normal 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.500
 then I look at it in the mornings when 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.500
 I can get up 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.470
 and in a matter of seconds I'm already 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.470
 firm as a military 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.200
 and that's why I'm surprised that doing that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.200
 noble labor 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.090
 there is someone suppose the lariat 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.090
 instills fear 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.309
 I guess they got confused 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.100
 I imagine another rat saw them or not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.200
 like the reality of brook because 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.200
 look at their accomplishment offended 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.289
 but its ugly sky of exception many 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.799
 they laughed at their commission the real one is alone 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.189
 in his character that takes a bit of 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.189
 tdt 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.550
