00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
posed problem the three P's as I like to

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.399 
posed problem the three P's as I like to
call<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.890> or<00:03:10.250> make<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.480> video<00:03:12.049> here

but<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.489> pre<00:03:13.730> posed<00:03:14.060> problem<00:03:14.629> I<00:03:14.840> don't<00:03:15.410> know

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
but the pre posed problem I don't know

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.170 
but the pre posed problem I don't know
why<00:03:15.799> they<00:03:16.040> always<00:03:16.069> have<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.459> give<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> figure<00:03:17.150> a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
why they always have to give a figure a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.720 
why they always have to give a figure a
certain<00:03:17.569> pose<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.140> no<00:03:18.560> matter<00:03:18.769> how<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.280> have

certain pose that no matter how you have

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.520 
certain pose that no matter how you have
it<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.180> figure<00:03:20.450> has<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.720> stay<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.410> that

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
it the figure has to stay in that

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.809 
it the figure has to stay in that
position

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
position

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.809

the downside those because of that the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.280 
the downside those because of that the
figure<00:03:26.060> doesn't<00:03:26.299> want<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.629> stand<00:03:26.959> all<00:03:27.260> that

well<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.799> his<00:03:27.950> own<00:03:28.420> luckily<00:03:29.420> though<00:03:29.569> he<00:03:29.720> does

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
well on his own luckily though he does

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.740 
well on his own luckily though he does
come<00:03:30.079> with<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.290> base<00:03:31.209> before<00:03:32.209> we<00:03:32.450> get<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.659> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
come with a base before we get to the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.880 
come with a base before we get to the
base<00:03:32.930> though<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.799> just<00:03:34.099> want<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.549> go<00:03:34.670> back<00:03:34.879> and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
base though I just want to go back and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.530 
base though I just want to go back and
mention<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.310> alternate<00:03:37.849> head<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.209> he<00:03:38.299> comes

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
mention the alternate head that he comes

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.110 
mention the alternate head that he comes
with<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.560> now<00:03:39.680> he's<00:03:39.799> got<00:03:39.950> two<00:03:40.670> different<00:03:41.000> heads

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
with so now he's got two different heads

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.720 
with so now he's got two different heads
that<00:03:41.299> you<00:03:41.390> can<00:03:41.510> pick<00:03:42.010> fairly<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.310> change

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
that you can pick fairly is it a change

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.330 
that you can pick fairly is it a change
whoops<00:03:44.629> fairly<00:03:45.290> easy<00:03:45.409> to<00:03:45.500> change<00:03:46.690> um<00:03:48.340> just

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
whoops fairly easy to change um just

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.280 
whoops fairly easy to change um just
snap<00:03:49.669> it<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:49.910> top<00:03:50.150> here<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:53.120> make<00:03:53.810> sure<00:03:53.959> we<00:03:54.109> get

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
snap it on top here and make sure we get

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.849 
snap it on top here and make sure we get
it<00:03:54.380> in<00:03:54.500> there<00:03:54.680> right<00:03:56.319> there<00:03:57.319> we<00:03:57.410> go<00:03:59.530> it<00:04:00.530> almost

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
it in there right there we go it almost

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.849 
it in there right there we go it almost
seems<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.280> me<00:04:01.400> like<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.819> head<00:04:02.239> here<00:04:02.859> suits

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
seems to me like this head here suits

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.619 
seems to me like this head here suits
his<00:04:04.099> Fodor<00:04:04.549> I<00:04:04.579> think<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.000> little<00:04:05.090> bit<00:04:05.209> more<00:04:05.299> than

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
his Fodor I think a little bit more than

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.119 
his Fodor I think a little bit more than
the<00:04:05.750> other<00:04:05.870> one<00:04:06.019> this<00:04:06.379> one<00:04:06.560> I<00:04:06.590> think<00:04:06.709> looks

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
the other one this one I think looks

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.400 
the other one this one I think looks
better<00:04:07.310> off<00:04:07.579> with<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.180> with<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:09.049> Fedora

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
better off with the with the Fedora

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.229 
better off with the with the Fedora
being<00:04:09.769> off<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.220> he<00:04:10.310> just<00:04:10.519> have<00:04:10.669> his<00:04:10.849> his

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239

regular<00:04:11.660> head<00:04:12.310> but<00:04:13.310> he<00:04:13.430> also<00:04:13.579> does<00:04:13.819> come<00:04:13.910> with

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
regular head but he also does come with

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.529 
regular head but he also does come with
a<00:04:14.180> fedora<00:04:14.510> which<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.769> a<00:04:16.310> little<00:04:16.849> smaller<00:04:17.209> rim

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
a fedora which is a little smaller rim
