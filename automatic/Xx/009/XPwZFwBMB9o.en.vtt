00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 hello friends I want to share how 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.450
 We can diagnose faults in the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.629
 gasoline filter 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.190
 based on some symptoms that we 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.510
 we could identify in a way 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.610
 simple 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.130
 with fuel filter is necessary 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.990
 to prevent dirt and the others 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.630
 waste clogs the system 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.700
 fuel of a vehicle a condition 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.160
 that severely decreases performance 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.129
 of the engine the fuel filters 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.290
 they can get to clog and when that 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.000
 happens the engine power and the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.910
 performance are affected 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.489
 negatively 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.040
 starting with the first cent can not 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.770
 be that the method starts without filter 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.050
 fuel is totally blocked or 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.660
 obstructed to the point of blocking the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.980
 fuel flow to the engine of a 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.380
 vehicle 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.620
 the vehicle dragged 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.720
 the fuel combined with air is what 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.440
 that lights inside the engine 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.989
 of the vehicle to start it 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.770
 and then that these two elements are not 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.619
 it will not turn on 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 according to the symptoms conditions of 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.240
 difficult start a filter 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.689
 partially blocked fuel a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 obstructed will often result in a 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.549
 vehicle that is difficult to start the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.679
 adequate fuel flow for the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.530
 motor of a vehicle is necessary for 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.270
 produce in the pharynx of the engine the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.799
 reduced fuel flow or 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.450
 restricted will prevent a normal start 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.299
 other symptoms 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.099
 the engine is preconceived for 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.890
 that the engine of the vehicle works 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.289
 efficient and adequate way is necessary 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.679
 a constant flow of fuel both 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.580
 and removes any vehicle 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.920
 interruption of this combustion flow 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.140
 What is it 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.930
 I know that when fuel is always 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.780
 clogged can cause the motor to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.960
 stop frequently 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.400
 there may also be engine failures 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.030
 engine failures are a symptom 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.649
 common has a filter 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.950
 because of the abnormal flow of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.040
 fuel towards the engine of a 20 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.590
 a condition that results in an abnormal 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.349
 engine operation and reduction of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.239
 the power of it a filter 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.209
 fuel or stress can cause 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.630
 discontinuous faults in an engine or between 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.120
 cut during acceleration too 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.110
 there may be an increase in consumption 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.180
 gasoline a fuel filter 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.400
 spent obstructing your readers and will 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.560
 that work harder to burn the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 fuel that is delivered from the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.650
 fuel pump 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590
 once the fuel filter 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.260
 dirt starts to work and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.810
 the food will accumulate in the engine 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.360
 and in the injectors making the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.650
 engine work more than necessary with the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.750
 weather 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.120
 also if you notice an acceleration 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.010
 slow the fuel filter too 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.470
 worn obstructed 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.500
 that the necessary amount of fuel 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.050
 pass through the line to him 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.720
 slow acceleration can be a factor 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.630
 and the problem becomes evident when you 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.640
 press the accelerator the particles of 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.280
 society can enter the line of 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.280
 fuel and prevent the amount 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.740
 necessary fuel is injected into 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.380
 the motor 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.720
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.810
 small tutorial please comment 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.110
 anything here could show them 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.830
 plus 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.160
 and tips about mechanics many 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.160
 Thank you
