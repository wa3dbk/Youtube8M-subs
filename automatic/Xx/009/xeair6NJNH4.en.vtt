00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.710
 when you breathe in a clarinet a 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.069
 hip lodged in the beak vibrates and emits a 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.069
 his 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.200
 to transform the sound into different 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.850
 notes the musician changes the length of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 the column of air vibrating in the 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.029
 body of the instrument by opening and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.029
 obstructing various holes 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.880
 so let 's see that more closely 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 wu 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.070
 yeah 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.940
 an ordinary clarinet breakthroughs 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.500
 24 hole the musician obstructs some 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.370
 with his fingers and the others in 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.370
 pressing keys 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.510
 these keys are in nickel silver or sometimes 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.490
 in yellow copper we inject wax 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 hot in a plaster mold 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.000
 corresponding to a key 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.450
 am still using hot wax one 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.290
 sets several copies of the same 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.290
 key on a rod 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.009
 in place then this tree as well as 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.329
 call him in a cylinder and then in a 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.399
 machine to produce the molds that 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.040
 fills the free space of a material 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.350
 ceramic based on silica 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.030
 once the hardened ceramics have done 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.040
 melt the wax to evacuate it by a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.840
 hole practiced at the bottom which leaves a 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.840
 cavity marrying the shape of the tree 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.100
 in place then the mold in a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.360
 casting machine which one fills the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.360
 miniature oven of mysore 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.860
 the metal melts and fills all 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.860
 qualities 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.700
 to cool and solidify the mill 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.799
 the mold is immersed in lukewarm water 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.149
 by cooling the metal shrink 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.149
 and gets rid of the mold 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.800
 the tree is extracted from the water and one 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.800
 detach the keys 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.930
 then in and beard all the keys 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.340
 we then immerse the keys in an advertisement 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.590
 rotating filled with synthetic stones 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.060
 these last police the keys in order to 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.510
 prepare their surface for plating 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.460
 money money does not adhere 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.050
 directly in nickel silver plates 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.050
 so first the copper keys 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.180
 for each layer we dip the keys 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.950
 in a chemical solution and then we 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.050
 sends a negative electric charge 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.460
 while a positive charge crosses 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.700
 the metal plates of which they are 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.700
 plates 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.680
 as under the effect of a magnet the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.270
 cover metal particles are 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.020
 attracted to the keys and forms a 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.020
 plating layer 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.890
 usually the body in two parts 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.470
 of a clarinet and made of wood or 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.200
 like here in plastic resin a 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.209
 computer driven drill perceived 24 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.980
 tone openings gap other 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.880
 small holes to fix the mechanisms 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.010
 keys a welding machine by 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.930
 ultrasound sinks all and not in their 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.270
 too respective by bombarding them wave 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 high frequency sound that amalgamates the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.700
 plastic at their base in order to there 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.700
 anchor firmly 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.999
 the next machine drill holes 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.620
 in the head hold in order to receive 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.620
 the rods driving the keys 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.320
 natural cork is wrapped around 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.860
 ends of the body and then we check 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.860
 interior 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.450
 finally in 1 seems the instrument 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.640
 we shine girl all the pieces 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.540
 mobile fillon sets the seventeen keys 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.540
 about their mechanisms 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.950
 each key has a pad 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.610
 ensuring its tightness when it 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.610
 obstructs the hole 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.900
 this seal is tested with a 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.250
 aluminum strip 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.959
 once the different parts of 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.910
 the instrument completed a musician 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.959
 the assembly checks that all the keys 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.959
 works smoothly 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.900
 then after joining the beak and the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.030
 flag it performs a quality test 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.030
 sound by performing a series of arpeggios 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.689
 the clarinet is then sent to 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.729
 conditioning services or a 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.159
 worker face carefully every 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.489
 footprints hold the stuffed animals and any 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.839
 trace of lubricants before storing 

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:44.449
 different pieces in a briefcase 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:45.589
 doubled velvet it's a final that 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.509
 suitable for the manufacture of a 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:50.379
 instrument as beautiful to see as to 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.369
 finally hear as long as I do not play it 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.999
 with it's still better 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:57.449
 no you know stranger zone of 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:05:01.249
 Holocaust 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.249
 or the swing of benny goodman maybe
