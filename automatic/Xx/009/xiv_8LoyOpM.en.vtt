00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 and now see how are we going to do today 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.260
 a better summer sale is 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.730
 pretty good wave makes a couple of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.469
 weeks is a video showing them how 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.599
 be a champion when buying in 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.640
 the sales with tips and tricks and all 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.830
 my strategies but there was still no 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.619
 gone then I finally went to the sales and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 I think I got pretty good things 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 so I want to show you everything 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.039
 I bought we are going to live in three stores 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 I went to pull and bear I went to an emmy and I went 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.610
 to Sara then I hope this video 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.040
 like it and let's start 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.079
 we started with sara sara is a store 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.270
 good for sales at the end I think or 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.100
 be when many many 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.930
 cuts unfortunately I had wants 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.190
 a little bit earlier because he had a wedding and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.079
 as I mentioned in the video 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.329
 previous I needed to buy some 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.579
 black pants and a shirt and such 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.870
 so I liked the first thing that goes 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.170
 to teach were the black pants 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.960
 I bought for the wedding 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.230
 I had 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.370
 and it was pretty cool because they are 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.649
 they are formal but they are 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.790
 intubated and I can not not use killing is 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.580
 tried I feel that I do not look good 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.350
 then these were very proud 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.450
 for that doing that I can follow 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.460
 using with many other garments that is not 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.070
 it has to be always formal 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.390
 these cost me 300 pesos that I 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.060
 It does pretty good for some pants 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.670
 and if I thought I like to buy t-shirts 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.500
 when they cost more or less like 139 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.770
 weights because they really are very 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.289
 faces at the beginning cost like 400 or 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.690
 450 and I say is a property we do not 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.119
 we can pay so much then it meets three 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.149
 t-shirts of 139 pesos the first beach 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.490
 It was 139 pesos that I bought is this blue 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.820
 which is like sailor because of the colors and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.410
 the stripes and I like it because it's universal 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.050
 It's almost everything you buy, you open overs 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.000
 has seen the online and I like the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.740
 asymmetry not between the stripes 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.659
 I think it looks pretty cool and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.380
 the second one is also quite stable 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.000
 t-shirt 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.659
 very good denies do not feel that of 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.549
 truth screams summer and it is this that is a 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.549
 I like it because it has a combination of 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.490
 two fabrics in blue and white lines 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.789
 and those of the sleeves and we return it mourning 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.260
 more liquid and the other is like much more 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.630
 I feel like I'm going to be giving 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.970
 Many do not arrive during the summer and do not 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.980
 I know a lot that being pretty good and the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.830
 Last shirt that I bought is the weirdest 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.040
 of all but you did not have something that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.640
 he said take me with you please please is 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.349
 this since it is super the online really 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.490
 I made a dress but I did not 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.340
 he imported and he has the detail 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.970
 the rapping in the side that also 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.890
 you see very father put and I do not know I do not know 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.580
 he made a very rare piece very original and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.230
 I said for 139 pesos let's go 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.760
 the second store which I was popular view 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.410
 in pull and bear I bought nothing else two 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.850
 things not because they were not parents or 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.120
 because it does not lower it was not good 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.590
 if it was but were far many 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.010
 clothes that already had similar 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.290
 many put that many little things 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.600
 graphic t-shirts and the truth I feel that 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.850
 The two things I bought were purchases 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.700
 very cheap smart the first thing was 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.790
 this polka dot shirt that is oversize 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.640
 it's jana like it's like a fit box that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.020
 is father and I like it or I like it 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.670
 much the stripes and everything but also me 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.590
 They like polka dots so much, so I think 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.380
 that this was a very good purchase because 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.480
 also cost me 99 pesos wonder and the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.770
 another thing that comprise pull and bear and 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.420
 that the truth would not be me if not 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.300
 I was buying the are our 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.590
 version and blue jeans as with details 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 of acid and 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.700
 breaks here that I think are very 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.099
 parents and I really like the super skinny 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.230
 of pula mere because if it is very very very 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.720
 very very intubated and that makes me very happy 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.340
 there are 300 pesos for them that I do 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.790
 also a very good price for 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.379
 pants I think they are if they are more 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.120
 cheap to 300 for more down or 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.760
 less price for pants the part 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.140
 end of the young extensions and cast in 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.180
 It's one of my favorite stores because 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.799
 I always find many things very 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.959
 good prices and the truth is what it 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.790
 a little bit on the channel but the good 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.239
 is that everything almost everything cost me less than 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.950
 100 pesos then yes super well the 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.290
 first thing that comprise chanel with 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.610
 a black brake sweatshirt and had 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.739
 really want something like that for a while 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.150
 while this is father by the detail of 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.299
 close back and because it 's like 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.270
 slightly oversight and I do not know what I feel 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.979
 that it was a garment that I wanted for 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.530
 much that he had to have and then finally 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.470
 I found and that made me very happy pay 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.689
 200 pesos for her and also in addition to 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.789
 a reasonable price for a sweatshirt 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.099
 now we go with the things that cost 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.299
 100 pesos everything that follows here cost 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.059
 without weights and it's a wonder 

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:43.459
 the first thing is this shirt that is super 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:45.439
 long line is also very long and I 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:47.929
 like to use it with sweatshirts so that 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.699
 the back part that I like 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:52.699
 you can see this is cool with this 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.709
 graphic here, I do not love 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.869
 sides the truth I do not know about these things not 

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:58.969
 I'm not so fan but honestly 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:01.219
 how I plan to use it they will not see each other 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.409
 yes yes yes it started is a shirt is a 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.389
 Gandia I had to keep going 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.129
 with my list of things I wanted 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.649
 get in the sales wanted 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:12.229
 sweatshirts then I looked for it and 

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:14.089
 I found in addition to long brake other two 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.249
 that are with good vibes 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.160
 the first one is this one that is from the 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:23.740
 breitner collection of experiences 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:29.680
 and it 's pretty simple it's basic gray 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.680
 good gray gray color plus 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.640
 100 pesos 100 pesos has an end as 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.860
 more we tell him that he makes me see more 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.380
 gallant that that also this kindness I'm not going 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.960
 to tell him that the 100 pesos 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.220
 the next sweatshirt I bought it because 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.010
 it was a graphic sweatshirt and because I 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.620
 I really like the color and it is this that says 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.530
 jim bunning and it also cost me 100 pesos 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.450
 and the truth is that I feel that if 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.770
 you need more little red things in me in my 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.360
 wardrobe because I have some tennis 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.690
 reds that I love that I can hardly 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.520
 use and then if for 100 pesos 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.950
 this is a wonder and the last piece 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.790
 also the printed costs and it's a 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.470
 basic striped sweater as a sailor 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.840
 has even so on the labels a 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.030
 boat and on the buttons has anchors and 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.980
 so and this pussy is a pretty sweater 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.300
 simple that is not something you say 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.180
 wast amazing 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.360
 I want 100 but but I think it looks very 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.950
 ok with a blue blazer or with a 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.380
 top denim jacket or something like that 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.790
 I do not know I made a purchase a purchase 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.740
 smart basic 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.170
