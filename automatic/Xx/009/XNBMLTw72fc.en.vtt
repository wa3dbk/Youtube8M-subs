00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:14.280 
picture it kind of starts from about
down<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:07.120> eye<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.799> then<00:04:08.799> ends<00:04:09.340> up<00:04:12.569> here<00:04:13.569> so

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
down the eye and then ends up here so

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.719 
down the eye and then ends up here so
I'm<00:04:14.590> just<00:04:14.680> going<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.859> put<00:04:14.919> those<00:04:15.159> lines<00:04:15.459> down

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:15.729 
I'm just going to put those lines down

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.580 
I'm just going to put those lines down
first<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.359> then<00:04:16.479> I'm<00:04:16.630> just<00:04:16.780> going<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.109> connect

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
first and then I'm just going to connect

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.009 
first and then I'm just going to connect
it<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.209> somewhat<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.299> same<00:04:19.329> shape<00:04:19.750> as<00:04:19.900> this

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it and somewhat the same shape as this

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.730 
it and somewhat the same shape as this
one<00:04:20.229> let's<00:04:20.620> hope

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.300 

from<00:04:25.740> Mac<00:04:25.950> I'm<00:04:26.220> just<00:04:26.430> going<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.610> use<00:04:26.820> carbon

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
from Mac I'm just going to use carbon

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.470 
from Mac I'm just going to use carbon
and<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.490> if<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.610> can<00:04:29.790> find<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:36.090> get<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.240> little

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
and so if I can find it you get a little

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.120 
and so if I can find it you get a little
bit<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.600> carbon<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.200> brush<00:04:37.470> on<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.770> pencil

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
bit of carbon on a brush on a pencil

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.129 
bit of carbon on a brush on a pencil
brush<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.550> then<00:04:38.580> I'm<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.330> going<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.750> use

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
brush and then I'm just going to use

00:04:40.139 --> 00:05:04.240 
brush and then I'm just going to use
that<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.710> kind<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:41.010> blend<00:04:41.250> out<00:04:41.639> the<00:04:43.610> liner

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.770 

and<00:05:05.250> again<00:05:05.760> once<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.120> have<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.360> line<00:05:06.540> done

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
and again once you have to line done

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.810 
and again once you have to line done
then<00:05:06.960> I'm<00:05:07.080> just<00:05:07.200> going<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.530> try<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.950> blend<00:05:08.520> out

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
then I'm just going to try to blend out

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.510 
then I'm just going to try to blend out
that<00:05:09.240> color<00:05:09.510> evenly<00:05:10.080> on<00:05:10.380> both<00:05:10.410> sides<00:05:10.830> with<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
that color evenly on both sides with a

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:20.030 
that color evenly on both sides with a
black<00:05:12.330> eye<00:05:12.570> shadow<00:05:18.470> okay<00:05:19.470> so<00:05:19.530> once<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:19.920> get

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
black eye shadow okay so once you get

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.650 
black eye shadow okay so once you get
that<00:05:20.190> done<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.610> should<00:05:20.730> look<00:05:20.790> like<00:05:20.910> this<00:05:21.270> again

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
that done it should look like this again

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.480 
that done it should look like this again
the<00:05:22.050> whole<00:05:22.200> point<00:05:22.380> is<00:05:22.590> just<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:23.040> make<00:05:23.340> them

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
the whole point is just to make them

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.840 
the whole point is just to make them
even<00:05:23.990> I'm<00:05:24.990> going<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.380> go<00:05:25.560> in<00:05:25.740> with<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:26.220> black

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
eyeliner I'm using feline for mac and

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.000
