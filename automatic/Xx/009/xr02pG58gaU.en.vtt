00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
either a lighter or a heat gun so let's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
either a lighter or a heat gun so let's
get<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.610> we'll<00:00:57.329> start<00:00:57.600> out<00:00:57.690> with

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
get to it we'll start out with

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.740 
get to it we'll start out with
assembling<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> metal<00:00:58.890> parts<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
assembling the metal parts so take the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299 
assembling the metal parts so take the
heat<00:01:00.870> break<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.350> screw<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> heat

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
heat break and screw it into the heat

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
heat break and screw it into the heat
sink<00:01:02.579> until<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.359> finger<00:01:03.690> tight<00:01:03.899> keep

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
sink until it's just finger tight keep

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.780 
sink until it's just finger tight keep
in<00:01:04.799> mind<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> heat<00:01:05.400> break<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
in mind that the heat break is a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
in mind that the heat break is a
somewhat<00:01:06.270> fragile<00:01:06.510> piece<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.200> should<00:01:07.380> be

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
somewhat fragile piece and should be

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.399 
somewhat fragile piece and should be
treated<00:01:07.770> carefully<00:01:08.570> then<00:01:09.570> screw<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> nozzle

we'll<00:03:41.910> install<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.450> heater<00:03:42.900> cartridge<00:03:43.140> which

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
we'll install the heater cartridge which

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.650 
we'll install the heater cartridge which
simply<00:03:44.310> slides<00:03:44.610> into<00:03:44.850> its<00:03:45.090> hole<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.330> the

so<00:03:55.080> all<00:03:55.320> we<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.620> left<00:03:55.770> now<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.520> fan<00:03:56.790> screw

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
