 Welcome to another minecraft map 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.740
 soto map created by a sub and was 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.840
 called attention because it's called 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.760
 sauber if I say but what is this I'm going to 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.869
 make play a game of shout then 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.160
 well here we are therefore what 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.320

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.770
 this brilliant that everyone see it 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.780
 which is how I bought it original 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.510
 and little one knows that I see myself a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.300
 little bit strange to see you I start with a hello 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.019

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.670

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.600
 I do not think I have to touch any 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.040

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.470

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.820
 it did not happen 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.970

 Okay, you want to tell me that over here, if I 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.500
 I'm silly, I'm the typical one who stumbles 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.960
 twice in the same stone 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.759
 it's worth that it does not even go well 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.320

 in this world that is my partner and my 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.830

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.660

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.430

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.530

 good to see your fighting points so 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.230
 I need many but this I say from 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.820
 since this is this question never 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.800
 I never knew I also chose a shot and 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.770
 here in front I could not choose where is 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.430
 They would choose 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.660
 just take this and it's free safe insurance 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.900
 How little do I think this is always 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.930
 parkour of this bus this is chus but 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.909
 I like to see if I have a jump to get there 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.250
 sure a block is going to fall or something 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.159

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.480

 We're going over there 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.950
 descending frames maldito de las huevos 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.720
 matter my time in matter people I 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.910
 weigh right now would teach us because 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.180
 I'm listening to things other than a 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.180
 piano 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.050
 I would like to put minecraft more 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.700
 music in the videos because it's 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.210
 clear that it is a very little and simply 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.910
 we feel accompanied by members and 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.250
 It's going to be a tremendous voice but I do not know if 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.489
 of my small and sensual voice and I turn 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.280
 to stay I shit on the 'b' 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.630
 and I shit in everything seriously in everything 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.819
 that speaks everything that this world is 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.590
 I can defecate because I would raise my ass 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:30.980
 and fill it with poop 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.449
 in the poop so let's see if I can already 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.060
 because before I do it well because it hit me 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.449
 a defenseless downhill and no sense I do not know 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.219
 why ostias 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.420

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:45.770
 I can and I stick it 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:48.370
 let's see is calmly with calm 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.370
 do not 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.980

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.930

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:03.130
 then I will not throw myself out of game boat 1 no 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.930
 no I'm not like that I do not know if that's the same 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.930
 for not choosing let's see 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.420
 and that's it 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.110
 calmly count calmly what 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.150
 We are doing very well 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.500
 if you turned out before uncle of one by 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.500

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.270
 three of those strangers who plays a map 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.830
 of these dragon because it happened to me in 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.629

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.009
 with the almond beds I have that 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.809
 because if I in the queue is more minimal 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.230
 very well, it turns out that they do not let me 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:41.320
 sleeping in them is because the team 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.650
 understand this once we feel a lot 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.660
 but do not skip this look at your house 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.170
