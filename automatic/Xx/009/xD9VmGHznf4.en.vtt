00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.660
 today we have rice and we have gods 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.670
 look at this beautiful tomatoes 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.250
 eggplant you got the tomato right 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.260
 stuffed with rice so go with the 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.390
 graphics of tomatoes with rice ci 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.220
 6 tomatoes will be needed 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.200
 if the fists of rice a clove of garlic 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.770
 glass of white wine 100 g of 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.870
 grated parmesan 4 basil potatoes 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.490
 leaf and queens salt and pepper then 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.520
 we said rice tomatoes because 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.890
 they are called so because they are tender and 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.039
 we get a no problem 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.289
 tomato completely emptied 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.600
 so at this point what they were doing 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.390
 our grandmothers put salt 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.100
 inside the tomato and then it 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.649
 they turned inside one 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.649
 baking dish or piero fillets so as to 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.839
 make him lose vegetation water 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.460
 the filling always knows as an ingredient 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.710
 rice as we want it 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.409
 cook this rice I would like to try it 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.930
 make a kind of risotto then a 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.420
 two non-stick pan with high handles 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 wide enough large that it weighs 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.960
 a potato a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 olive put in the saucepan and yes 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:27.100
 start toasting the rice then face 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.020
 I toast it is fine then toast 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.880
 I put a pinch of salt at the beginning 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.980
 because then it is difficult for me 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.750
 salt unpeeled a clove of garlic 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.390
 it helps me to give a little taste 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.850
 then we take the potato and the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.370
 let's do regular pieces 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.620
 then add the potatoes they will take 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.950
 the flavor then I remove laglio fades with 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.950
 white wine 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:06.310
 he made the wine pay so that I didn't 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:09.860
 traces of acidity remain agree 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.720
 in the meantime he pressed us with rice 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.080
 see we got boiling water 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.360
 salted we boil the rice and have 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.540
 also harassed the potatoes separately 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.690
 here they are, let's see how it could be 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.240
 a cold preparation instead of pm 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.850
 what do I use as a broth because now the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.980
 my risotto with potatoes I use the pulp 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.980
 of chopped tomato 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.180
 who brought out all her beauty 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.490
 in a hurry pepper will cook everything in 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.470
 this sort of infusion obviously the 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.530
 taste will be a different story 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:03:02.290
 if you give me the pre-boiled potatoes 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:06.450
 are put in the already cooked rice and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.060
 then we add an egg voila 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.790
 the mocked water was salt of only two 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.380
 things or we go up abundantly rice 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.490
 so as to be calm as and when 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:24.970
 add the Parmesan and the potato 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:27.550
 boiled in the padana then that 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.110
 we abound with salting rice 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.670
 we have no problems if instead 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.050
 we make the island just right 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.150
 right because we are afraid and want 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.980
 rest assured we must remember 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.070
 however that every added ingredient 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.620
 we must certify as they say 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.420
 season with salt then parsley e 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.800
 basil are the ingredients that me 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.650
 will give the touch of fresh herbaceous and 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.060
 then add the mixture to 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:03.220
 I then agreed with a pan 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:06.040
 nonstick garlic poached oil in 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.200
 jacket this point ours 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.510
 composed of rice already precooked potatoes 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.540
 parsley parmesan salt pepper and ha 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.730
 place the risotto which will also be a 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.500
 filling see how quiet it goes with 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.090
 the water of tomatoes in garlic in 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.250
 shirt with oil if we go to put 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.270
 an aubergine cut into cubes v 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.860
 the oil is hot garlic to flavored as 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.290
 you have to go and put my cubes 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.410
 eggplant nothing salt no water 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.410
 pure fat heat then olive oil 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.259
 I was striped then now that he was dressed 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.400
 I can add salt 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:46.250
 I take a risotto is beautiful and good only 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.190
 to see the chopped herbs a beautiful one 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.810
 generous handful of Parmesan and then 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.729
 to whisk up what it always takes 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.530
 fat necessarily butter no when 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.479
 you make seafood giggles 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.100
 symantec has collodion so here's it e 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.630
 therefore inevitably also here 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.180
 being a stuffed dish there 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.590
 wants place for the last races because 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.639
 if you put it in the beginning when the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.960
 too hot 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:18.440
 I'd make an omelette instead so I have way 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:20.900
 to dissolve the sauteed aubergine one 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:27.139
 gluttony to put at the base of the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.669
 baking dish where we will inform the 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.599
 tomato that can go 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.660
 quietly to implement on the bed 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.599
 of aubergines purposely sautÃ©ed exceeding 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.669
 I exceed because it is beautiful and also four 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.490
 instead the risotto a little more 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.389
 creamy same stuffed ingredient of the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:54.880
 tomato recovered taste a little bit 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:58.150
 more decided here too deliberately exceed 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.820
 so that we then have space of mine 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.729
 head chetta oven at 200 degrees 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.099
 10 minutes see rice a little more 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.590
 clear the boiled one and the rice a 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.130
 a little darker than that made tasty 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.130
 to risotto
