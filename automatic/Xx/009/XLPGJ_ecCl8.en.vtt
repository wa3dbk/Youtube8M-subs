00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.070
 good day welcome 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.840
 a small special program with 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.490
 matthias and yes something happened in the 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.820
 net super sail has some details 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.650
 rausgehauen to the next update what 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.910
 now we should really come there 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.480
 Get first-hand information 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.130
 and who immediately immediately time to 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.300
 no one will come clear 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.160
 that was immediately denied but what me 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.170
 you can say it will be a leprechaun king 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.400
 come door town hall level 9 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.870
 super predator with super special ability 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.330
 or what is exactly again and again 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.460
 of course I do not know then 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.580
 was speculated yes we see goal 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.299
 my a dark barracks soon 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.790
 available 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.080
 but five slots are still 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.390
 I did not fill up 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.040
 some may still speculate 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.839
 normal troops then so in the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.250
 dark form come the dark healer 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.879
 maybe or sauce or the dark one 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.890
 magician do not take it 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.289
 instead we see each other here we have 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.840
 Here are ten troops to choose from 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:16.000
 there will be a third slot and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:23.060
 while this slot will involve barbar 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.100
 archer pinch magic and healer though 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.460
 we will probably ask why 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.439
 but not the normal form but yes 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.899
 I would say general 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.520
 you can say it will be yes 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.130
 so special form so be improvements 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.329
 similar in appearance but that was 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.469
 for example, this will be a mixture 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.929
 between always why can you do that 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.979
 normal barbar archer and such 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.880
 all are going to be a little bit wider as well 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.319
 to be taller 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.670
 especially the giant one becomes that 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.840
 It is important to have a bigger one 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.909
 is also kept a little darker 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.670
 of course, then rather alex cost here 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.280
 currently he costs me 2500 then 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 is speculated so from 10,000 upwards 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.409
 he will cost then in any case 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.639
 also something that will come, yes 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.869
 then the course has already 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.869
 Seen here the achievements the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.540
 will be extended by a few 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.540
 right now we have 60 achievements 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.640
 this will be increased to 120 and 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.680
 is walking too 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.360
 the right side over and the village 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.200
 edit mode migrates to the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.430
 left side 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.810
 yes that's the stuff then the then 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.830
 we will be happy to come 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.020
 matthias roos are also allowed to 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.640
 thereon 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.540
 In any case, you have to wait if there 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.670

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.340

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.400
 thing not present 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.400
