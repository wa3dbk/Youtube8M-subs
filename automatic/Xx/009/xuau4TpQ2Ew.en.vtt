00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
picture on the device that it's going to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
picture on the device that it's going to
going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> look<00:00:39.989> quite<00:00:40.200> better<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.649> let's<00:00:41.160> do

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
going to look quite better so let's do

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.770 
going to look quite better so let's do
that<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.610> something<00:00:41.940> first<00:00:42.239> let's<00:00:42.540> let's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that this is something first let's let's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.240 
that this is something first let's let's
check<00:00:42.930> out<00:00:43.020> speed<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> big

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
check out speed so one of the big

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
check out speed so one of the big
focuses<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.850> speed<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.960> had

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
focuses with speed right we we had

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.420 
focuses with speed right we we had
issues<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.530> focusing<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.340> then

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
issues with it focusing and then

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.979 
issues with it focusing and then
obviously<00:00:47.789> there<00:00:47.879> was<00:00:48.000> some<00:00:48.090> shutter<00:00:48.390> lag<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
obviously there was some shutter lag and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
obviously there was some shutter lag and
then<00:00:49.079> even<00:00:49.350> opening<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> app<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.399> slow<00:00:50.789> so

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
then even opening the app was slow so

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
then even opening the app was slow so

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
this you see it kind of freezes and then

nothing<00:03:34.250> you're<00:03:34.489> kind<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.760> wondering<00:03:35.000> what's

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
nothing you're kind of wondering what's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.650 
nothing you're kind of wondering what's
going<00:03:35.570> on<00:03:35.720> there<00:03:36.549> so<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.880> know<00:03:38.000> it's<00:03:38.120> it's<00:03:38.570> a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
going on there so you know it's it's a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.330 
going on there so you know it's it's a
subtle<00:03:38.959> change<00:03:39.410> but<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.739> lets<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.040> know<00:03:40.130> that

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
subtle change but it lets you know that

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.930 
subtle change but it lets you know that
when<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.120> take<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.299> picture<00:03:42.610> your<00:03:43.610> camera<00:03:43.880> is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
when you take a picture your camera is

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.550 
when you take a picture your camera is
doing<00:03:44.030> something<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.600> it's<00:03:44.780> not<00:03:44.840> broken<00:03:45.140> or

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
doing something and it's not broken or

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.020 
doing something and it's not broken or
frozen<00:03:45.860> or<00:03:46.040> anything<00:03:46.220> like<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.790> kind<00:03:46.940> of

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
frozen or anything like that so kind of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.910 
frozen or anything like that so kind of
a<00:03:47.120> nice<00:03:47.239> little<00:03:47.390> change<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.590> other<00:03:48.709> thing<00:03:48.860> I

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
a nice little change the other thing I

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.890 
a nice little change the other thing I
want<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.160> do<00:03:49.310> then<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.700> just<00:03:49.730> show<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.180> that<00:03:50.630> at

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
want to do then is just show you that at

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.949 
want to do then is just show you that at
least<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.230> believe<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.180> camera<00:03:53.600> is<00:03:53.750> now

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
least I believe that the camera is now

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.210 
least I believe that the camera is now
just<00:03:54.350> faster<00:03:54.860> in<00:03:55.040> general<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:56.239> so<00:03:56.950> we<00:03:57.950> turn

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
just faster in general and so we turn

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.509 
just faster in general and so we turn
off<00:03:58.400> each<00:03:58.730> their<00:03:59.030> day<00:03:59.290> so<00:04:00.290> if<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.650> sit<00:04:01.010> here<00:04:01.040> and

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
off each their day so if I sit here and

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.370 
off each their day so if I sit here and
you<00:04:01.730> know<00:04:01.760> let<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.120> focus<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.660> I<00:04:02.690> snap<00:04:02.959> photo

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
you know let it focus and I snap photo

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.920 
you know let it focus and I snap photo
when<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.190> snap<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.459> photo<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.269> I<00:04:05.390> snap<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.660> photo

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
when I snap a photo and I snap a photo

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.020 
when I snap a photo and I snap a photo
and<00:04:06.320> I<00:04:06.380> snap<00:04:06.590> photo<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.489> know<00:04:07.579> that's<00:04:07.730> pretty

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
and I snap photo you know that's pretty

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.729 
and I snap photo you know that's pretty
fast<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.570> wouldn't<00:04:08.810> say<00:04:08.959> it's<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.170> fastest

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
fast I wouldn't say it's the fastest

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.289 
fast I wouldn't say it's the fastest
camera<00:04:10.040> on<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.340> market<00:04:10.549> by<00:04:10.790> any<00:04:10.970> means<00:04:11.209> but

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
camera on the market by any means but

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.750 
camera on the market by any means but
it's<00:04:11.570> fairly<00:04:11.989> fast<00:04:12.230> ok<00:04:12.829> so<00:04:12.890> if<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.100> grab<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.489> the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
it's fairly fast ok so if I grab the the

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.159 
it's fairly fast ok so if I grab the the
camera<00:04:13.970> with<00:04:14.180> 4.4<00:04:15.049> and<00:04:16.039> I<00:04:16.100> snap<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.370> photo<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:17.510> I

of<00:04:32.610> pause<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:32.970> now<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:33.960> don't<00:04:34.140> believe<00:04:34.650> that

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
of pause and now I don't believe that

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.130 
of pause and now I don't believe that
pause<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.130> there<00:04:35.760> on<00:04:36.000> 4.4.1

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
pause is there on 4.4.1

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.830 
pause is there on 4.4.1
so<00:04:37.440> if<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.590> take<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.070> if<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:39.360> ever<00:04:39.570> so

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
so if I take that if it is it's ever so

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.420 
so if I take that if it is it's ever so
slightly<00:04:40.200> like<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.650> just<00:04:40.860> kind<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.250> take

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
slightly like it just kind of you take

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.220 
slightly like it just kind of you take
the<00:04:41.550> picture<00:04:41.850> sits<00:04:42.390> there<00:04:42.540> for<00:04:42.570> barely<00:04:43.200> a

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
the picture sits there for barely a

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.990 
the picture sits there for barely a
split<00:04:43.560> second<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.070> then<00:04:44.160> zooms<00:04:44.520> up<00:04:44.700> in<00:04:44.850> your

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
split second and then zooms up in your

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.620 
split second and then zooms up in your
gallery

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
gallery

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.150 
gallery
I'll<00:04:45.870> show<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.110> one<00:04:46.260> more<00:04:46.290> time<00:04:46.710> so<00:04:46.980> here's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
I'll show you one more time so here's

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.940 
I'll show you one more time so here's
four<00:04:47.400> point<00:04:47.640> four<00:04:47.910> with<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.810> focus<00:04:49.290> it's<00:04:49.680> nap

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
four point four with that focus it's nap

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.410 
four point four with that focus it's nap
and<00:04:50.250> there's<00:04:50.370> just<00:04:50.490> kind<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:50.850> delay<00:04:51.180> before

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
and there's just kind of a delay before

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.140 
and there's just kind of a delay before
it<00:04:51.690> goes<00:04:51.900> up<00:04:51.960> there

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
it goes up there

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.670 
it goes up there
so<00:04:54.150> not<00:04:54.660> huge<00:04:55.080> difference<00:04:55.470> but<00:04:55.620> you

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
so not huge difference but you

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.590 
so not huge difference but you
definitely<00:04:55.860> all<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.370> hiccups<00:04:56.730> seem<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.420> be

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
definitely all the hiccups seem to be

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.020 
definitely all the hiccups seem to be
seem<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.440> be<00:04:58.590> gone<00:04:58.950> which<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.310> which<00:04:59.670> is<00:04:59.790> really

this rainbow guy since he's got nice
bright<00:05:04.530> colors<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.240> we'll<00:05:06.240> load<00:05:06.390> that<00:05:06.600> up<00:05:06.630> on

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
bright colors and we'll load that up on

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.350 
bright colors and we'll load that up on
4.4<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.010> my<00:05:08.340> camera<00:05:08.700> is<00:05:08.760> about<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:09.120> turn<00:05:09.270> my

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
4.4 and my camera is about to turn my

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.470 
4.4 and my camera is about to turn my
phone's<00:05:09.570> about<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.840> die<00:05:09.960> here<00:05:10.350> on<00:05:10.380> 4.4.1<00:05:11.220> so<00:05:11.730> we

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
phone's about to die here on 4.4.1 so we

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.900 
phone's about to die here on 4.4.1 so we
will<00:05:12.660> also<00:05:12.840> take<00:05:13.320> this<00:05:13.680> picture<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.490> I'm

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
will also take this picture and I'm

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.790 
will also take this picture and I'm
gonna<00:05:15.030> swipe<00:05:15.390> over<00:05:15.660> before<00:05:16.260> my<00:05:16.350> battery<00:05:16.470> dies

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
gonna swipe over before my battery dies

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.380 
gonna swipe over before my battery dies
show<00:05:17.100> you<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.640> differences<00:05:18.090> in<00:05:18.270> these

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
show you the differences in these

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.830 
show you the differences in these
pictures<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:19.500> I<00:05:19.800> would<00:05:20.520> argue<00:05:20.670> that<00:05:20.910> the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
pictures so I would argue that the

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.530 
pictures so I would argue that the
bottom<00:05:22.290> camera<00:05:22.920> which<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.220> 4.4.1<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.330> can<00:05:24.420> see

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
bottom camera which is 4.4.1 you can see

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.000 
bottom camera which is 4.4.1 you can see
it's<00:05:24.690> much<00:05:24.900> whiter<00:05:25.230> white<00:05:25.590> balance<00:05:25.950> is

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
it's much whiter white balance is

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.160 
it's much whiter white balance is
definitely<00:05:26.310> adjusted<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:27.540> colors<00:05:27.960> are<00:05:28.140> a

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
definitely adjusted the colors are a

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.840 
definitely adjusted the colors are a
little<00:05:28.230> bit<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.770> would<00:05:28.920> say<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.160> little<00:05:29.340> more

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
little bit I would say a little more

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.400 
little bit I would say a little more
vibrant<00:05:30.090> they<00:05:30.390> definitely<00:05:30.690> added<00:05:30.960> some<00:05:31.110> pop

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
vibrant they definitely added some pop

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.310 
vibrant they definitely added some pop
google<00:05:32.040> said<00:05:32.310> they<00:05:32.940> also<00:05:33.150> up<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.420> contrast<00:05:34.050> so

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
google said they also up the contrast so

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.200 
google said they also up the contrast so
you're<00:05:34.470> definitely<00:05:34.560> gonna<00:05:34.920> get<00:05:35.190> what<00:05:36.000> I<00:05:36.030> would

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
you're definitely gonna get what I would

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.700 
you're definitely gonna get what I would
consider<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.570> be<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.720> better<00:05:36.990> picture<00:05:37.230> now<00:05:37.620> if

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
consider to be a better picture now if

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.490 
consider to be a better picture now if
you<00:05:37.770> look<00:05:37.920> up<00:05:38.070> top<00:05:38.190> there<00:05:38.640> that's<00:05:38.820> 4.4<00:05:39.630> and<00:05:39.870> you

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
you look up top there that's 4.4 and you

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.230 
you look up top there that's 4.4 and you
know<00:05:40.590> I'd<00:05:40.710> argue<00:05:40.890> that's<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.280> little<00:05:41.460> warm<00:05:41.820> it's

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
know I'd argue that's a little warm it's

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.000 
know I'd argue that's a little warm it's
not<00:05:42.420> sort<00:05:42.780> of<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.020> pure<00:05:43.380> white<00:05:43.650> or<00:05:43.980> even

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
not sort of that pure white or even

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.130 
not sort of that pure white or even
leaning<00:05:44.580> towards<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:44.940> cooler<00:05:45.270> side<00:05:45.480> the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
leaning towards the cooler side the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.230 
leaning towards the cooler side the
colors<00:05:46.530> look<00:05:46.740> okay<00:05:47.520> but<00:05:47.550> they're<00:05:47.850> not<00:05:47.940> quite

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
colors look okay but they're not quite

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.960 
colors look okay but they're not quite
as<00:05:48.630> sort<00:05:49.140> of<00:05:49.260> vibrant<00:05:49.830> as<00:05:50.010> I<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.340> would<00:05:50.640> see<00:05:50.820> them

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
as sort of vibrant as I I would see them

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.460 
as sort of vibrant as I I would see them
down<00:05:51.120> here<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.630> then<00:05:51.720> again<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:52.080> contrast

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
down here and then again the contrast

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.800 
down here and then again the contrast
definitely<00:05:53.190> definitely<00:05:54.000> down<00:05:54.180> on<00:05:54.390> that<00:05:54.510> top

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
definitely definitely down on that top

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.380 
definitely definitely down on that top
image<00:05:55.470> so<00:05:55.740> even<00:05:56.550> on<00:05:56.640> a<00:05:56.670> device<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:57.120> think<00:05:57.300> you

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
image so even on a device I think you

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.610 
image so even on a device I think you
can<00:05:57.510> see<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.660> difference<00:05:58.110> and<00:05:58.230> again<00:05:58.380> we'll<00:05:58.500> try

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
can see a difference and again we'll try

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.750 
can see a difference and again we'll try
to<00:05:58.680> take<00:05:58.830> some<00:05:58.980> more<00:05:59.040> pictures<00:05:59.280> once<00:05:59.610> we

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
to take some more pictures once we

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.180 
to take some more pictures once we
charged<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.480> southern<00:06:00.720> Nexus<00:06:01.020> 5<00:06:01.200> here<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:01.620> so

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
charged the southern Nexus 5 here and so

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.470 
charged the southern Nexus 5 here and so
you<00:06:02.250> guys<00:06:02.370> can<00:06:02.550> see<00:06:02.700> some<00:06:02.910> comparisons<00:06:03.390> but
