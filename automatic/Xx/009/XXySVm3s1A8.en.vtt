all<00:00:27.119> we're<00:00:27.269> trying<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.109> players<00:00:28.500> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
all we're trying to do is get players to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.669 
all we're trying to do is get players to
learn<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.939> ending<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> closing<00:00:31.019> step<00:00:31.470> on

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
learn the ending or the closing step on

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.520 
learn the ending or the closing step on
a<00:00:31.710> layup<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.579> familiar<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.530> if

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a layup so they get familiar with it if

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.310 
a layup so they get familiar with it if
we<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:34.980> them<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.640> successfully

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
we can get them to do that successfully

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.139 
we can get them to do that successfully
then<00:00:37.320> it'll<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.620> easier<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> lay<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
move if they need to do that now we can

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
move if they need to do that now we can
do<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> same<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.430> once<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:51.030> our

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
do the same thing once we get our

players try it one more time players
will<00:01:44.020> learn<00:01:44.350> what<00:01:45.340> feels<00:01:45.670> correct<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.420> what

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
will learn what feels correct and what

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.510 
will learn what feels correct and what
doesn't<00:01:47.080> just<00:01:47.560> like<00:01:47.740> what<00:01:47.950> happened<00:01:48.400> and

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
doesn't just like what happened and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.270 
doesn't just like what happened and
they'll<00:01:48.610> learn<00:01:48.730> to<00:01:49.630> catch<00:01:49.870> themselves<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.860> to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
they'll learn to catch themselves and to

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:02.190 
they'll learn to catch themselves and to
do<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.550> properly<00:02:00.510> once<00:02:01.510> we<00:02:01.660> get<00:02:01.750> our<00:02:01.900> players

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200

simple thing for them to remember and it

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.140 
simple thing for them to remember and it
just<00:03:10.450> takes<00:03:10.630> repetition<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:12.459> get<00:03:12.640> better<00:03:12.850> at

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
just takes repetition to get better at

first hold up right there here's the
rule<00:03:33.500> we<00:03:34.129> like<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.430> teach<00:03:34.580> our<00:03:34.760> players<00:03:35.090> this

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
rule we like to teach our players this

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.990 
rule we like to teach our players this
when<00:03:35.930> we<00:03:36.019> make<00:03:36.049> a<00:03:36.260> move<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.340> we<00:03:37.400> do<00:03:37.849> it

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
when we make a move and we do it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.150 
when we make a move and we do it
incorrectly<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:39.200> want<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.500> go<00:03:39.590> back<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.010> do<00:03:40.129> it

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
incorrectly we want to go back and do it

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.890 
incorrectly we want to go back and do it
right<00:03:40.430> away<00:03:40.549> again<00:03:40.819> if<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.330> footwork<00:03:41.720> is

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
right away again if the footwork is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.119 
right away again if the footwork is
wrong<00:03:42.140> that's<00:03:42.440> incorrect

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
wrong that's incorrect

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.430 
wrong that's incorrect
we<00:03:43.640> want<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:43.910> do<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.590> slower<00:03:45.819> at<00:03:46.819> half<00:03:47.150> speed<00:03:47.440> so

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
we want to do it slower at half speed so

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.729 
we want to do it slower at half speed so
we<00:03:48.590> can<00:03:48.620> get<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:49.010> properly<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:51.290> half<00:03:51.470> speed

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
we can get it properly so half speed

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.349 
we can get it properly so half speed
right<00:03:52.190> foot<00:03:52.430> first<00:03:55.120> good

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359
