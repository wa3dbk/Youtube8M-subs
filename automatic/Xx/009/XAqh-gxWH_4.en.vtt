00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.300 

you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.720> interesting<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.710> we

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
you know it's interesting when we

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.500 
you know it's interesting when we
started<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.880> season

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
started the season

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
started the season
we<00:00:42.660> weren't<00:00:42.840> even<00:00:42.989> ranked<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.680> top<00:00:43.950> 25<00:00:44.370> we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we weren't even ranked in the top 25 we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.320 
we weren't even ranked in the top 25 we
literally<00:00:45.360> were<00:00:45.630> on<00:00:45.809> nobody's<00:00:46.380> radar<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.400> I

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
literally were on nobody's radar and I

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.060 
literally were on nobody's radar and I
think<00:00:48.750> our<00:00:48.870> kids<00:00:49.080> took<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.680> offense<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
think our kids took a little offense of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400 
think our kids took a little offense of
that<00:00:50.220> when<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.850> lost<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> Bob<00:00:52.140> Berman

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that when we lost the Bob Berman

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.860 
that when we lost the Bob Berman

scoring<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.399> like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> forty<00:01:12.000> point<00:01:12.210> went

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
scoring that's like a forty point went

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.969 
scoring that's like a forty point went
in<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.570> basketball<00:01:13.050> game<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.740> just

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
in the basketball game like it's just

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.520 
in the basketball game like it's just
it's<00:01:14.160> not<00:01:14.310> even<00:01:14.610> close<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.690> that<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.380> real

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's not even close and that was real

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's not even close and that was real
gut-check<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.430> middle<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.910> season<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
gut-check the middle of the season is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.859 
gut-check the middle of the season is
always<00:01:19.140> gonna<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> rough<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.580> us

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
always gonna be kind of rough for us

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.440 
always gonna be kind of rough for us
because<00:01:22.160> we're<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.190> team<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.759> trains<00:01:24.090> hard

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
because we're the team that trains hard

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
because we're the team that trains hard
in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> middle<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.289> year<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.710> then

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
in the middle of the year and then

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
in the middle of the year and then
scales<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.940> back<00:01:27.119> towards<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> endless<00:01:27.960> we

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
scales it back towards the endless we

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.580 
scales it back towards the endless we
lost<00:01:28.380> five<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.399> our<00:01:29.759> top<00:01:29.970> seven<00:01:30.420> runners<00:01:30.630> from

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
lost five of our top seven runners from

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
lost five of our top seven runners from
that<00:01:31.740> 2010<00:01:32.610> national<00:01:33.060> championship<00:01:33.509> team<00:01:33.690> we

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that 2010 national championship team we

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
that 2010 national championship team we
lost<00:01:34.020> five<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.740> top<00:01:34.890> seven<00:01:35.160> last

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
lost five more of the top seven last

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
lost five more of the top seven last
year<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.660> why<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.170> were<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.470> nobody's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
year so that's why we were on nobody's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.410 
year so that's why we were on nobody's
radar<00:01:38.190> nobody<00:01:38.550> expected<00:01:38.910> us<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.240> able<00:01:39.300> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
radar nobody expected us to be able to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
radar nobody expected us to be able to
reload<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.140> quickly<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.070> looking<00:01:41.399> back<00:01:41.550> at

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:29.700 

I<00:02:27.210> didn't<00:02:28.210> realize<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.900> we'd<00:02:29.020> won<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.500> fact

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.170 
I didn't realize that we'd won in fact
if<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.980> if<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.370> look<00:02:30.580> at<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> tape<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.150> have

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
if you if you look at the tape I have

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.060 
if you if you look at the tape I have
like<00:02:31.480> about<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> second<00:02:32.170> delay<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.770> the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
like about a second delay on the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.330 
like about a second delay on the
reaction<00:02:33.580> because<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:35.260> thought<00:02:35.710> that<00:02:35.980> when

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
reaction because I I thought that when

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.220 
reaction because I I thought that when
the<00:02:36.370> race<00:02:36.700> had<00:02:36.940> finished<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.780> we<00:02:37.900> had<00:02:38.020> been

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the race had finished that we had been

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.110 
the race had finished that we had been
able<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.500> catch<00:02:38.620> American<00:02:39.100> Fork<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:40.000> they

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
quite a bit throughout the season we've

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.330 
quite a bit throughout the season we've
had<00:03:38.080> some<00:03:38.410> injuries<00:03:38.710> we've<00:03:38.890> had<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.160> deal<00:03:39.310> with

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
had some injuries we've had to deal with

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.170 
had some injuries we've had to deal with
and<00:03:40.020> all<00:03:41.020> things<00:03:41.410> considered<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
and all things considered this is the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.630 
and all things considered this is the
perfect<00:03:43.480> ending<00:03:43.840> for<00:03:44.050> season<00:03:44.410> they've<00:03:45.400> been

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
perfect ending for season they've been

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.100 
perfect ending for season they've been
to<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.850> top<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.180> mountain<00:03:46.480> it's<00:03:46.990> a

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
to the top of mountain it's a

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.690 
to the top of mountain it's a
fundamentally<00:03:47.800> different<00:03:47.830> thing<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.250> defend

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
fundamentally different thing to defend

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.910 
fundamentally different thing to defend
than<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.970> chase<00:03:49.240> but<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.990> think<00:03:50.260> these<00:03:50.410> boys<00:03:50.650> are

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
than to chase but I think these boys are

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710 
than to chase but I think these boys are
chasing<00:03:51.160> something<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.390> think<00:03:52.510> they're

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
chasing something I think they're

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.650 
chasing something I think they're
chasing<00:03:53.140> history<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.420> hopefully<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.570> a<00:03:55.630> good

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
chasing history so hopefully it's a good

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:11.820 
chasing history so hopefully it's a good
chance

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.890
