throw up or something happens of that

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.500 
throw up or something happens of that
nature<00:00:41.799> then<00:00:42.159> perhaps<00:00:42.489> you<00:00:42.879> should<00:00:42.909> just<00:00:43.299> end

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
nature then perhaps you should just end

the<00:00:44.170> work<00:00:44.320> out<00:00:44.500> like<00:00:44.680> right<00:00:45.220> there<00:00:45.540> but<00:00:46.540> if<00:00:46.629> you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
the work out like right there but if you

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.270 
the work out like right there but if you
have<00:00:46.809> more<00:00:46.960> on<00:00:47.049> the<00:00:47.140> take<00:00:47.350> i<00:00:47.589> recommend

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
have more on the take i recommend

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.759 
have more on the take i recommend
finishing<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.059> required<00:00:49.420> reps<00:00:49.659> so<00:00:49.960> i'm<00:00:50.409> going

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
finishing the required reps so i'm going

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.660 
finishing the required reps so i'm going
for<00:00:50.979> five<00:00:51.190> reps<00:00:51.489> i<00:00:51.699> hit<00:00:51.940> for<00:00:52.299> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.680> wait<00:00:53.920> as

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
for five reps i hit for and I wait as

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.490 
for five reps i hit for and I wait as
long<00:00:54.699> as<00:00:55.089> necessary<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:55.720> hit<00:00:55.960> one<00:00:56.110> more<00:00:56.320> and

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
long as necessary to hit one more and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.380 
long as necessary to hit one more and
that's<00:00:56.559> exactly<00:00:56.799> what<00:00:57.159> I<00:00:57.190> did<00:00:57.250> for<00:00:58.059> something

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
that's exactly what I did for something

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.600 
that's exactly what I did for something
like<00:00:58.510> squats<00:00:58.930> or<00:00:59.110> deadlifts<00:00:59.680> I'd<00:01:00.129> recommend

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
like squats or deadlifts I'd recommend

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.180 
like squats or deadlifts I'd recommend
waiting<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.720> little<00:01:02.199> bit<00:01:02.379> longer<00:01:02.650> than<00:01:03.040> when

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
waiting a little bit longer than when

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.469 
waiting a little bit longer than when
you're<00:01:03.339> doing<00:01:03.580> military<00:01:03.760> press<00:01:04.210> since

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
you're doing military press since

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.300 
you're doing military press since
deadlifts<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:04.960> squats<00:01:05.049> are<00:01:05.770> much<00:01:06.040> more

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
deadlifts and squats are much more

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.750 
deadlifts and squats are much more
demanding<00:01:06.659> much<00:01:07.659> more<00:01:08.220> energy<00:01:09.220> consuming

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
demanding much more energy consuming

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.250 
demanding much more energy consuming
than<00:01:09.939> something<00:01:10.180> like<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.390> military<00:01:10.720> press<00:01:11.080> so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
than something like a military press so

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.750 
than something like a military press so
give<00:01:11.409> yourself<00:01:11.710> more<00:01:11.860> time<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.340> then<00:01:12.580> maybe

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
give yourself more time and then maybe

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.970 
give yourself more time and then maybe
finish<00:01:13.210> those<00:01:13.390> reps<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.900> few<00:01:14.530> minutes<00:01:14.680> down<00:01:14.950> the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
finish those reps a few minutes down the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
finish those reps a few minutes down the
