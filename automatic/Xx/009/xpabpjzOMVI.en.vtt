00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.660 

so<00:00:03.030> we've<00:00:03.300> got<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:04.250> wall<00:00:05.250> sconce<00:00:05.670> up<00:00:06.000> finally

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
so we've got the wall sconce up finally

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.370 
so we've got the wall sconce up finally
it<00:00:08.670> seemed<00:00:09.090> at<00:00:09.360> first<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.840> there<00:00:09.960> were<00:00:10.110> some

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
it seemed at first that there were some

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.910 
it seemed at first that there were some
strange<00:00:10.620> electrical<00:00:11.190> problems<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:12.710> most<00:00:13.710> of

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
strange electrical problems but most of

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.519 
strange electrical problems but most of
it<00:00:14.040> had<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.240> fact<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
it had to do with the fact that on that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.480 
it had to do with the fact that on that
gang<00:00:19.529> box<00:00:19.830> over<00:00:20.189> there<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:21.570> left<00:00:21.840> switch<00:00:22.740> has

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
gang box over there the left switch has

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.700 
gang box over there the left switch has
three<00:00:24.029> toggles<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> heat<00:00:27.410> vent<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
three toggles for the heat vent and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.200 
three toggles for the heat vent and
light<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:29.970> has

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
light and then the one on the right has

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.630 
light and then the one on the right has
the<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.929> toggle<00:00:32.329> for<00:00:33.329> these<00:00:33.480> wall<00:00:33.750> lights<00:00:34.640> but

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the one toggle for these wall lights but

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.840 
the one toggle for these wall lights but
that<00:00:36.050> one<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:39.500> lighted

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
that one on the right was a lighted

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
that one on the right was a lighted
switch<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.020> had<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.379> diode<00:00:43.860> inside

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
switch so it had a little diode inside

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.869 
switch so it had a little diode inside
for<00:00:44.940> when<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.480> light<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.840> off<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
for when the light was off but that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.680 
for when the light was off but that
lighted<00:00:49.610> switch<00:00:50.629> was<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> 15<00:00:52.739> amp<00:00:52.770> circuit

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
lighted switch was for a 15 amp circuit

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.799 
lighted switch was for a 15 amp circuit
instead<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> 20<00:00:55.230> amp<00:00:55.379> circuit<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.660> there

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
instead of a 20 amp circuit and so there

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
instead of a 20 amp circuit and so there
was<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.620> since<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.820> 20<00:01:00.210> amp

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
was and so since it was on a 20 amp

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.590 
was and so since it was on a 20 amp
circuit<00:01:01.460> even<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.030> off<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.570> was

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
circuit even when it was off it was

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
circuit even when it was off it was
letting<00:01:03.930> through<00:01:04.439> 60<00:01:05.309> watts<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
letting through 60 watts and so that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.300 
letting through 60 watts and so that
caused<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:09.659> strange<00:01:10.020> results<00:01:10.560> when<00:01:10.740> we

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
caused some strange results when we

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
caused some strange results when we
would<00:01:11.460> turn<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> light<00:01:12.150> switch<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
would turn the light switch off and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
would turn the light switch off and
everything<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:14.490> seemingly<00:01:14.850> still<00:01:15.210> hot<00:01:15.680> at<00:01:16.680> 60

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
everything was seemingly still hot at 60

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.050 
everything was seemingly still hot at 60
watts<00:01:17.820> versus<00:01:18.420> 120<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.380> once<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> one

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
watts versus 120 so once I got the one

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660 
watts versus 120 so once I got the one
once<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> 20<00:01:22.259> amp<00:01:22.619> light<00:01:23.189> switch<00:01:23.460> in

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
once I got the 20 amp light switch in

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.520 
once I got the 20 amp light switch in
there<00:01:24.830> there<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.860> light<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:30.140> have<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.350> do

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
there there is light so I have to do

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.330 
there there is light so I have to do
that<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.930> also<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:37.759> it's<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:38.939> wired<00:01:40.340> behind

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that one also but it's all wired behind

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
that one also but it's all wired behind
in<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.500> romex<00:01:43.500> coming

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
in there you can see the romex coming

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.300 
in there you can see the romex coming
out

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.480 

so<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.270> less<00:01:47.649> things<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:48.979> need<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.280> do

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
so the less things that we need to do

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.760 
so the less things that we need to do
our<00:01:50.210> block<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.170> off<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.990> provide<00:01:54.290> support

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
our block this off to provide support

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.200 
our block this off to provide support
for<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.009> medicine<00:01:55.399> cabinet<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.000> there<00:01:56.119> will

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
for the medicine cabinet so there will

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.480 
for the medicine cabinet so there will
be<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.329> two-by-four<00:01:56.899> going<00:01:57.470> up<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:57.829> down<00:01:57.890> here

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
be a two-by-four going up and down here

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.139 
be a two-by-four going up and down here
and<00:01:59.060> another<00:01:59.539> one<00:01:59.659> going<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.289> down<00:02:00.380> here

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
and another one going up and down here

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.179 
and another one going up and down here
so<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.360> when<00:02:02.659> we<00:02:02.840> put<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.380> medicine<00:02:03.920> cabinet

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
so that when we put the medicine cabinet

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.680 
so that when we put the medicine cabinet
in<00:02:04.610> then<00:02:05.299> we<00:02:05.509> drill<00:02:06.909> screws<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.209> way<00:02:08.420> into

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
in then we drill screws this way into

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.979 
in then we drill screws this way into
the<00:02:08.810> two-by-four<00:02:10.000> but<00:02:11.000> once<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.390> blocking<00:02:11.870> is

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
the two-by-four but once the blocking is

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.330 
the two-by-four but once the blocking is
done<00:02:13.780> then<00:02:14.780> I'm<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.410> take<00:02:15.920> off<00:02:16.130> this

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
done then I'm going to take off this

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.309 
done then I'm going to take off this
fixture<00:02:16.760> again<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.799> plastering<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.130 

then<00:02:24.319> this<00:02:24.980> long<00:02:25.489> thing<00:02:25.519> will<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.239> over<00:02:26.269> look

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
then this long thing will be over look

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.740 
then this long thing will be over look
at<00:02:27.230> all<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.440> tools<00:02:31.450> didn't<00:02:32.450> think<00:02:32.599> it<00:02:32.660> would

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
at all the tools didn't think it would

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.400 
at all the tools didn't think it would
take<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:32.959> long<00:02:35.049> ok<00:02:36.049> that's<00:02:36.950> about<00:02:37.340> it
