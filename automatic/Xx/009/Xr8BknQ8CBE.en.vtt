00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
little bit of trouble and eventually I

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.899 
little bit of trouble and eventually I
found<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.260> bit<00:00:44.379> of<00:00:44.469> water<00:00:44.649> leaking<00:00:45.039> down<00:00:45.219> the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
found a bit of water leaking down the

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.939 
found a bit of water leaking down the
side<00:00:46.149> I<00:00:46.449> put<00:00:46.809> my<00:00:46.960> hand<00:00:47.230> in<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.530> top<00:00:47.769> and

side I put my hand in the top and

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.819 
side I put my hand in the top and
feeling<00:00:48.460> down<00:00:48.609> this<00:00:48.730> side<00:00:48.999> panel<00:00:49.239> here<00:00:49.829> so

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
feeling down this side panel here so

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.189 
feeling down this side panel here so
then<00:00:51.010> I<00:00:51.159> took<00:00:51.729> the<00:00:51.940> side<00:00:52.120> panel<00:00:52.479> off<00:00:52.539> which

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
then I took the side panel off which

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.700 
then I took the side panel off which
involves<00:00:53.739> about<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:55.780> ten<00:00:56.079> screws<00:00:57.690> top

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
involves about about ten screws top

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.430 
involves about about ten screws top
front<00:00:59.710> rear<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.690> once<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.899> remove<00:01:02.229> those

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
front rear and once you remove those

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.070

screws<00:01:02.710> side<00:01:03.280> panel<00:01:03.609> just<00:01:03.760> unclips<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.600> found

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
screws side panel just unclips I found

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.170 
screws side panel just unclips I found
this<00:01:05.229> hose<00:01:05.500> here<00:01:05.530> has<00:01:06.280> come<00:01:06.520> off<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.760> it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
this hose here has come off and it's

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.750 
this hose here has come off and it's
actually<00:01:10.630> just<00:01:10.870> an<00:01:11.050> air<00:01:11.200> vent<00:01:11.380> hose<00:01:11.760> which

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
actually just an air vent hose which

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.350 
actually just an air vent hose which
comes<00:01:13.330> from<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:15.960> air<00:01:16.960> vent<00:01:16.990> here<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.360> from

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
comes from this air vent here and from

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.970 
comes from this air vent here and from
the<00:01:19.780> dispenser<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:21.060> from<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.510> drain<00:01:22.780> pump<00:01:23.050> so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
the dispenser and from the drain pump so

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.260 
the dispenser and from the drain pump so
it's<00:01:24.160> all<00:01:24.370> air<00:01:24.760> venting<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:26.880> whereas<00:01:27.880> why<00:01:28.210> it

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
it's all air venting and whereas why it

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.440 
it's all air venting and whereas why it
was<00:01:28.540> probably<00:01:29.020> leaking<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.950> as<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:31.000> water<00:01:31.210> is

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
was probably leaking is as the water is

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.270 
was probably leaking is as the water is
going<00:01:32.140> through<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.560> detergent<00:01:33.130> dispenser

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
going through the detergent dispenser

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.260 
going through the detergent dispenser
and<00:01:33.940> flowing<00:01:34.660> down<00:01:35.020> through<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.640> hose<00:01:36.910> which

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
and flowing down through this hose which

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.350 
and flowing down through this hose which
goes<00:01:37.510> into<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.080> bowl<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:39.490> might<00:01:39.790> be<00:01:39.940> getting<00:01:40.090> a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
goes into the bowl we might be getting a

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.540 
goes into the bowl we might be getting a
certain<00:01:40.690> amount<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.050> overflow<00:01:41.620> which<00:01:42.370> is

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
certain amount of overflow which is

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.820 
certain amount of overflow which is
coming<00:01:42.910> back<00:01:43.060> out<00:01:43.300> over<00:01:43.780> here<00:01:44.020> because<00:01:44.710> this

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
coming back out over here because this

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.780 
coming back out over here because this
hose<00:01:45.040> was<00:01:45.280> just<00:01:45.520> sitting<00:01:45.820> like<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
hose was just sitting like this to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.510 
hose was just sitting like this to
repair<00:01:49.240> this<00:01:49.480> it's<00:01:49.870> quite<00:01:50.350> simple

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
repair this it's quite simple

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.400 
repair this it's quite simple
I'll<00:01:51.760> just<00:01:52.030> refit<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> hose<00:01:52.720> back<00:01:52.990> into<00:01:53.230> there

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
I'll just refit the hose back into there

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.560 
I'll just refit the hose back into there
and<00:01:53.710> put<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> cable<00:01:54.160> tie<00:01:54.460> around<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:55.000> which<00:01:55.450> you

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
and put a cable tie around it which you

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.150 
and put a cable tie around it which you
probably<00:01:55.780> didn't<00:01:56.350> have<00:01:56.530> before

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
probably didn't have before

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.010 
probably didn't have before
but<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.940> make<00:01:58.090> sure<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.540> doesn't<00:01:58.750> come

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
but just to make sure that doesn't come

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.810 
but just to make sure that doesn't come
back<00:01:59.200> out<00:01:59.440> again<00:01:59.590> I'll<00:01:59.860> put<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.100> cable<00:02:00.310> tie<00:02:00.610> on

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
back out again I'll put a cable tie on

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.850 
back out again I'll put a cable tie on
it
