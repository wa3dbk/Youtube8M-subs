00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
what's interesting how that went that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.120 
what's interesting how that went that
way<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:20.660> maybe<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:21.470> give<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.680> some<00:01:21.979> things

way so maybe it can give you some things

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.950 
way so maybe it can give you some things
to<00:01:22.280> think<00:01:22.369> about<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:23.330> my<00:01:23.450> opinion<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.840> best

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
to think about in my opinion the best

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.660 
to think about in my opinion the best
part<00:01:24.200> was<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.500> opening<00:01:24.890> when<00:01:25.100> they<00:01:25.220> play<00:01:25.400> all

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
part was the opening when they play all

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.670 
part was the opening when they play all
the<00:01:25.850> themes<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.360> top<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.690> each<00:01:26.810> other<00:01:26.930> yeah<00:01:27.320> and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
the themes on top of each other yeah and

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.859 
the themes on top of each other yeah and
they're<00:01:27.830> close<00:01:28.190> but<00:01:28.700> not<00:01:28.880> exactly<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.660> same

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
they're close but not exactly the same

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.600 
they're close but not exactly the same
in<00:01:30.020> each<00:01:30.110> one<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:30.890> sounds<00:01:31.130> like<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:31.250> terrible

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
in each one so it sounds like a terrible

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.030 
in each one so it sounds like a terrible
middle<00:01:32.119> school<00:01:32.330> orchestra<00:01:32.650> trying<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.890> get

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
middle school orchestra trying to get

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.850 
middle school orchestra trying to get
all<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.310> notes<00:01:34.460> right<00:01:34.820> but<00:01:35.030> they<00:01:35.150> can't<00:01:35.479> and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
all the notes right but they can't and

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.530 
all the notes right but they can't and
then<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.950> see<00:01:37.100> all<00:01:37.250> like<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.880> also<00:01:38.180> see<00:01:38.330> all

the beats that George Lucas is stuck in

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.190 
the beats that George Lucas is stuck in
I<00:01:41.240> mean<00:01:41.420> not<00:01:41.570> stuck<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:41.810> he's<00:01:42.050> obviously

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the ships come in it roughly the same

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.800 
the ships come in it roughly the same
time<00:01:46.340> okay<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.850> do<00:01:47.120> understand<00:01:47.660> his

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
time okay you do understand his

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.320 
time okay you do understand his
directing<00:01:48.260> style<00:01:48.560> pretty<00:01:48.950> immediately<00:01:49.880> yeah

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
and I mean the another interesting thing

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.160 
and I mean the another interesting thing
is<00:01:52.700> like<00:01:52.940> when<00:01:53.120> you<00:01:53.240> if<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.600> were<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.780> sit<00:01:54.020> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
is like when you if you were to sit and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.630 
is like when you if you were to sit and
watch<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.350> whole<00:01:54.650> thing<00:01:54.710> basically<00:01:55.460> wherever

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
watch the whole thing basically wherever

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.050 
watch the whole thing basically wherever
you<00:01:55.880> scan<00:01:56.030> through<00:01:56.500> artoo<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.800> c3po<00:01:58.430> are<00:01:58.700> just

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
you scan through artoo and c3po are just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.430 
you scan through artoo and c3po are just
in<00:01:59.480> one<00:01:59.900> of<00:02:00.080> them

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
in one of them

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.710 
in one of them
yeah<00:02:00.770> always<00:02:01.460> somewhere<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.180> like<00:02:02.450> they're

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
yeah always somewhere I like they're

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.660 
yeah always somewhere I like they're
never<00:02:02.930> there<00:02:03.470> never<00:02:03.530> completely<00:02:04.159> absent<00:02:04.520> from

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
never there never completely absent from

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.030 
never there never completely absent from
any<00:02:04.790> film<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:05.180> any<00:02:05.300> particular<00:02:05.810> time<00:02:06.040> frames

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
any film at any particular time frames

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.620 
any film at any particular time frames

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.600 

would<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.380> ever<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.920> sit<00:02:28.070> down<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.490> watch

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
would you ever just sit down and watch

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.280 
would you ever just sit down and watch
the<00:02:28.790> whole<00:02:28.910> thing<00:02:28.970> all<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.720> way<00:02:29.750> through<00:02:30.050> it

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the whole thing all the way through it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.110 
the whole thing all the way through it
would<00:02:30.440> have<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.830> be<00:02:30.860> with<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> large<00:02:31.760> group<00:02:31.940> of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
would have to be with a large group of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.450 
would have to be with a large group of
people<00:02:32.270> sort<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.380> way<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:33.740> would<00:02:33.920> watch

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
people sort of the way we would watch

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.410 
people sort of the way we would watch
mst3k<00:02:35.350> episodes<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.650> like<00:02:37.220> laugh<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.910> point

mst3k episodes and like laugh and point
things<00:02:38.660> out<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.140> but<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.590> think<00:02:39.650> people<00:02:40.160> would

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
things out and but I think people would

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.580 
things out and but I think people would
get<00:02:40.460> tired<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.060> Peru<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:41.570> more<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:42.020> party

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
get tired of a Peru it's more of a party

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.320 
get tired of a Peru it's more of a party
thing<00:02:42.770> yeah<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.370> then<00:02:43.490> you<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.030> had<00:02:44.180> on

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
thing yeah and then you just you had on

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.000 
thing yeah and then you just you had on
in<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.540> background<00:02:44.990> you're<00:02:45.440> like<00:02:45.560> oh<00:02:45.710> that's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
know if my brain can handle this it's

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.260 
know if my brain can handle this it's
not<00:02:57.140> for<00:02:57.350> absorption<00:02:57.650> no<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.640> sensory<00:02:59.060> oh<00:02:59.120> I

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270
