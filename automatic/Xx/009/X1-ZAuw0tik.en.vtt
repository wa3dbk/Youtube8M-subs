of yarn so there's my Slipknot and if I
pull<00:00:30.990> another<00:00:31.859> chain<00:00:32.340> through<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:34.219> look

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
pull another chain through that and look

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.600 
pull another chain through that and look
at<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.550> closely<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:37.500> points<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.579> are

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
at this closely at all points there are

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.360 
at this closely at all points there are
three<00:00:39.000> strands<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.629> yarn<00:00:39.860> held<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.129> thumb

yes<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.420> linky<00:00:48.960> thing

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
yes we have this little linky thing

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
yes we have this little linky thing
there<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.039> won't<00:00:50.219> worry<00:00:50.309> about<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.910> at

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
there but we won't worry about that at

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
there but we won't worry about that at
all<00:00:51.449> times<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.230> three<00:00:52.500> thicknesses<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> yarn

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
all times as three thicknesses of yarn

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.580 
all times as three thicknesses of yarn
so<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.170> Navajo

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so this is what you do with Navajo

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.029 
so this is what you do with Navajo
plying<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> single<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.660> tie<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
plying you take a single and you tie it

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.479 
plying you take a single and you tie it
into<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.219> series<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.440> giant<00:01:01.440> slip<00:01:01.890> knots<00:01:02.129> now

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
into a series of giant slip knots now

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.050 
into a series of giant slip knots now
I'm<00:01:02.550> doing<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.940> fairly<00:01:03.210> small<00:01:03.949> but<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.189> this

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'm doing these fairly small but in this

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.820 
I'm doing these fairly small but in this
way<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.659> yarn<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.350> tripled<00:01:07.710> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
way your yarn can be tripled in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.789 
way your yarn can be tripled in
thickness<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.600> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.780> happen<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
thickness so if you happen to have in

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
thickness so if you happen to have in
your<00:01:10.830> stash<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.790> those<00:01:11.909> irresistible

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your stash one of those irresistible

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.890 
your stash one of those irresistible
cones<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.920> silk<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.700> use<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:14.970> far<00:01:15.479> too<00:01:15.750> good

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
cones of silk that use just far too good

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
cones of silk that use just far too good
to<00:01:16.049> pass<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.770> couldn't<00:01:17.189> possibly

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to pass up and you couldn't possibly

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
to pass up and you couldn't possibly
leave<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.150> languishing<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> shelf<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> the

to use that beautiful silk you can
triple<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.400> yarn<00:01:32.610> from<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.030> single<00:01:33.420> source<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
triple up a yarn from a single source so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.050 
triple up a yarn from a single source so
it<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.650> come<00:01:34.829> from<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.070> cone<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.820> come<00:01:36.030> from

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it can come from a cone it can come from

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
it can come from a cone it can come from
a<00:01:36.299> ball<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.439> too<00:01:37.650> fine<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a ball it can be too fine for you to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069 
a ball it can be too fine for you to
comfortably<00:01:38.759> use<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.299> you'll<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.450> fine<00:01:39.869> with

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
comfortably use but you'll be fine with

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.859 
comfortably use but you'll be fine with
it<00:01:40.200> tripled<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> begin<00:01:42.030> by<00:01:42.060> making<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.659> slip

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it tripled so begin by making a slip

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.210 
it tripled so begin by making a slip
knot<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.380> doesn't<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.950> attached<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
knot it doesn't have to be attached to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.560 
knot it doesn't have to be attached to
your<00:01:44.399> knitting<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.149> begin<00:01:45.270> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
your knitting you can just begin with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.980 
your knitting you can just begin with
the<00:01:45.659> slip<00:01:45.869> knot<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> pull<00:01:48.509> your<00:01:48.630> fingers

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the slip knot and then pull your fingers

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
the slip knot and then pull your fingers
through<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.920> you're<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.340> make<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
through and so you're going to make a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.749 
through and so you're going to make a
giant<00:01:51.149> crochet<00:01:51.810> chain<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
giant crochet chain and I'm going to

knitting<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.469> new<00:02:01.770> triple<00:02:02.189> thickness<00:02:02.729> yarn

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
knitting your new triple thickness yarn

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.790 
knitting your new triple thickness yarn
there's<00:02:05.920> my<00:02:06.130> first<00:02:06.369> triple<00:02:06.850> thickness<00:02:07.180> stitch

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
there's my first triple thickness stitch

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.640 
there's my first triple thickness stitch
and<00:02:08.800> there's<00:02:09.130> my<00:02:09.369> second<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:11.080> don't<00:02:11.319> have<00:02:11.500> to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
and there's my second you don't have to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.380 
and there's my second you don't have to
sit<00:02:11.860> there<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.220> trail<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:13.000> all<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.330> way

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
sit there and trail this all the way

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.390 
sit there and trail this all the way
down<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.720> hallway<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.200> your<00:02:14.349> house<00:02:14.590> tripling

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
down the hallway of your house tripling

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.580 
down the hallway of your house tripling
the<00:02:15.520> whole<00:02:15.700> lot<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:16.900> triple<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:17.319> as<00:02:17.440> much

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the whole lot you just triple up as much

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.300 
the whole lot you just triple up as much
as<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.890> need

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
as you need

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.550 
as you need
and<00:02:18.400> then<00:02:19.060> every<00:02:19.390> time<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.750> come<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.200> short

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
and then every time you come to a short

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.820 
and then every time you come to a short
end<00:02:20.860> with<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.340> loop<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.760> sticking<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.800> put<00:02:23.800> your

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
end with a loop of sticking out put your

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.339 
end with a loop of sticking out put your
fingers<00:02:24.250> through<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.550> loop<00:02:24.760> pull<00:02:25.050> through<00:02:26.050> a

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
fingers through the loop pull through a

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.229 
fingers through the loop pull through a
new<00:02:26.680> Slipknot<00:02:27.190> again<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.849> could<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.060> an

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
new Slipknot again that could be an

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.390 
new Slipknot again that could be an
arm's<00:02:28.569> length<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:30.099> want<00:02:30.250> to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
arm's length because you want to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.949 
arm's length because you want to
minimize<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.940> number<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.420> these<00:02:31.599> little

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
minimize the number of these little

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.440 
minimize the number of these little
linky<00:02:32.470> bits<00:02:32.680> but<00:02:33.370> they<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:34.000> won't<00:02:34.120> show

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
linky bits but they really won't show

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.660 
linky bits but they really won't show
very<00:02:34.750> much<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.260> then<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:35.890> carry<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.400> knitting

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
very much and then you carry on knitting

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.830 
very much and then you carry on knitting
with<00:02:36.910> your<00:02:37.030> triple<00:02:37.360> thickness<00:02:37.750> yarn<00:02:39.840> anytime

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
with your triple thickness yarn anytime

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.490 
with your triple thickness yarn anytime
you<00:02:40.989> want<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:42.420> make<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> yarn<00:02:43.750> three<00:02:44.019> times<00:02:44.290> as

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
you want to make a yarn three times as

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.039 
you want to make a yarn three times as
thick<00:02:44.739> from<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.160> single<00:02:45.519> yarn<00:02:45.760> source<00:02:46.120> then

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
thick from a single yarn source then

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.550 
thick from a single yarn source then
think<00:02:47.860> about<00:02:47.980> Navajo<00:02:48.910> knitting<00:02:52.200> we<00:02:53.200> just<00:02:53.410> make

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
think about Navajo knitting we just make

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.850 
think about Navajo knitting we just make
a<00:02:53.590> bit<00:02:53.830> more<00:02:53.860> yard<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.430> off<00:02:54.970> we<00:02:55.180> go<00:02:55.209> again

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
a bit more yard and off we go again

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.809 
a bit more yard and off we go again
very<00:02:56.860> versatile<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.730> amazingly<00:02:58.420> useful<00:03:02.819> at

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
very versatile and amazingly useful at

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.190 
very versatile and amazingly useful at
that<00:03:04.030> point<00:03:04.299> I'd<00:03:04.510> be<00:03:04.630> ready<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.019> make<00:03:05.140> some

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
that point I'd be ready to make some

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.470 
that point I'd be ready to make some
more<00:03:05.590> links<00:03:05.799> so<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.549> just<00:03:06.760> make<00:03:06.940> them<00:03:07.090> as<00:03:07.299> you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
more links so you just make them as you

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.510 
more links so you just make them as you
go
