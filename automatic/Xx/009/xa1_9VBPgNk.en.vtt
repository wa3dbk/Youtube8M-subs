simple<00:00:11.160> question<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.550> me<00:00:11.759> because<00:00:12.210> I've<00:00:12.690> had

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650

capped<00:01:03.170> ones<00:01:04.939> my<00:01:05.939> mom<00:01:06.150> has<00:01:06.450> those<00:01:06.720> though<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
capped ones my mom has those though I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.590 
capped ones my mom has those though I
didn't<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.610> could<00:01:08.790> even<00:01:08.970> get<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
didn't know you could even get the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.570 
didn't know you could even get the
silver<00:01:09.930> ones<00:01:10.140> anymore<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> thought<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
silver ones anymore I thought I kind of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
silver ones anymore I thought I kind of
thought<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:12.630> those<00:01:13.049> were<00:01:13.229> outdated

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
thought there those were outdated

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.249 
thought there those were outdated
because<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.760> mom<00:01:15.000> had<00:01:15.330> them<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:17.900> ever<00:01:18.900> since<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
because my mom had them and ever since I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.990 
because my mom had them and ever since I
was<00:01:19.409> little<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.250> only<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
was little like the only kind that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.670 
was little like the only kind that
they'd<00:01:21.240> ever<00:01:21.479> give<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:21.930> were<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> clear

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
they'd ever give me were like the clear

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.170 
they'd ever give me were like the clear
ones<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.400> thought<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
ones actually I thought I was going to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
ones actually I thought I was going to
get<00:01:24.299> silver<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> checked<00:01:25.830> after<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
get silver and then I checked after I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
get silver and then I checked after I
looked<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> mirror<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.390> huh

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
looked in the mirror and I was like huh

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.219 
looked in the mirror and I was like huh
they're<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.920> silver<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> heck<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.930> just

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
they're not silver what the heck it just

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.929 
they're not silver what the heck it just
makes<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.770> obvious<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
makes it more obvious if you have the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.390 
makes it more obvious if you have the
silver<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.560> recommend<00:01:34.619> them

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
silver one so I would not recommend them

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.569 
silver one so I would not recommend them
I<00:01:35.930> don't<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.799> cost<00:01:38.310> less

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
I don't really know if they do cost less

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.399 
I don't really know if they do cost less
to<00:01:38.759> get<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> silver<00:01:39.479> ones<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.869> don't<00:01:39.930> know

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to get the silver ones and I don't know

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.090 
to get the silver ones and I don't know
if<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.799> last<00:01:41.250> longer<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.450> I've<00:01:43.100> I've

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
if they do last longer but I've I've

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
if they do last longer but I've I've
gotten<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.670> many<00:01:44.790> fillings<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.140> feel<00:01:46.380> like

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
gotten so many fillings that I feel like

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.370 
gotten so many fillings that I feel like
it<00:01:47.840> what<00:01:48.840> I've<00:01:48.990> gotten<00:01:49.409> works<00:01:49.710> fine<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.759> me

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
it what I've gotten works fine for me

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.090 
it what I've gotten works fine for me
but<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:53.869> don't<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.259> guess<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.680> haven't<00:01:55.950> lived

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
but I don't know I guess I haven't lived

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
but I don't know I guess I haven't lived
a<00:01:56.250> very<00:01:56.280> long<00:01:56.549> life<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.390> whether<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.930> not

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
a very long life to know whether or not

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.700 
a very long life to know whether or not
they<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.380> last<00:01:58.770> longer<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.200> maybe<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
they do last longer so maybe I'm not the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.010 
they do last longer so maybe I'm not the
best<00:02:01.920> person<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.310> ask<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> would<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.420> think

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
best person to ask but I would do think

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
best person to ask but I would do think
that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.710> clear<00:02:05.009> ones<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> best<00:02:05.939> ones

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
that the clear ones are the best ones

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.529 
that the clear ones are the best ones
and<00:02:06.829> they<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.009> shaved<00:02:08.340> them<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.209> stuff

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and they like shaved them down and stuff

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.780 
and they like shaved them down and stuff
and<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.619> cement

squishy<00:02:53.360> pink<00:02:54.360> things<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.110> they<00:02:55.200> do<00:02:55.260> bleed

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
squishy pink things and they do bleed

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.800 
squishy pink things and they do bleed
and<00:02:56.070> it's<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.430> dentist<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.120> forget<00:02:57.570> that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
and it's like dentist just forget that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.730 
and it's like dentist just forget that
so<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:59.210> would<00:03:00.210> say<00:03:00.420> getting<00:03:00.780> your<00:03:01.260> teeth<00:03:01.500> filled

is a lot quicker and more pleasant than

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390 
is a lot quicker and more pleasant than
