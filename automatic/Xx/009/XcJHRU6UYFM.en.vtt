00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
should note though there's actually two

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.220 
should note though there's actually two
versions<00:00:29.699> there's<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.510> version<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> bud

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
versions there's this version of the bud

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
versions there's this version of the bud
which<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> long<00:00:32.219> version<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.640> brands

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
which is the long version of brands

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.160 
which is the long version of brands
hatch<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.149> believe<00:00:33.420> they<00:00:33.570> used<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> use<00:00:33.870> this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
hatch I believe they used to use this

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
hatch I believe they used to use this
version<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.460> old<00:00:35.610> f1<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.210> back<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> day

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
version for the old f1 and back in a day

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.560 
version for the old f1 and back in a day
and<00:00:37.350> there's<00:00:37.590> also<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.850> version<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and there's also this version which is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
and there's also this version which is
the<00:00:39.660> short<00:00:39.899> version<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.680> you've<00:00:40.829> gone<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the short version so if you've gone to a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.830 
the short version so if you've gone to a
track<00:00:41.430> day<00:00:41.610> recently<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:42.300> brands<00:00:42.750> hatch

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
track day recently at brands hatch

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
track day recently at brands hatch
they're<00:00:43.200> most<00:00:43.410> likely<00:00:43.500> using<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.430> version

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
they're most likely using this version

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
they're most likely using this version
in<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.510> game<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.870> called<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> indie

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
in this game it's called the indie

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
in this game it's called the indie
circuit<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.910> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
circuit I don't really know what that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
circuit I don't really know what that
means<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.570> accurate<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.410> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
means or if it's accurate but it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950 
means or if it's accurate but it's
really<00:00:50.160> fun<00:00:50.340> regardless<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.360> can't<00:00:51.719> comment

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
really fun regardless so I can't comment

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.240 
really fun regardless so I can't comment
on<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> accuracy<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.800> track<00:00:53.010> I've<00:00:53.129> never

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
on the accuracy of this track I've never

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.619 
on the accuracy of this track I've never
been<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.730> I've<00:00:53.820> never<00:00:53.910> driven<00:00:54.090> around<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
been to it I've never driven around it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
been to it I've never driven around it
but<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.980> fun<00:00:56.190> track<00:00:56.430> regardless<00:00:56.940> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
but it's really fun track regardless of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.369 
but it's really fun track regardless of
whether<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.329> accurate<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.719> not<00:00:57.780> got<00:00:58.260> some

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
whether it's accurate or not got some

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.630 
whether it's accurate or not got some
really<00:00:58.559> nice<00:00:58.739> corners<00:00:59.070> makes<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> very

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
really nice corners makes for a very

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
really nice corners makes for a very
good<00:01:00.239> drift<00:01:00.539> circuit<00:01:00.870> which<00:01:01.289> you'll<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.559> me

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
good drift circuit which you'll see me

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.830 
good drift circuit which you'll see me
doing<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.030> today<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.420> didn't

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
actually want to talk about the track so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.920 
actually want to talk about the track so
much<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.909> review<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.600> can't

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
much and review it because I can't

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.969 
much and review it because I can't
really<00:01:07.080> reveal<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.470> I've<00:01:07.530> ever<00:01:07.650> been<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> it

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
actually use our automatic but you have

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.650 
actually use our automatic but you have
to<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.110> use<00:02:07.829> your<00:02:08.039> left<00:02:08.369> hand<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> gears

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to like use your left hand for the gears

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360 
to like use your left hand for the gears
up<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.959> down<00:02:10.050> which<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.259> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> weird<00:02:11.129> but

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
