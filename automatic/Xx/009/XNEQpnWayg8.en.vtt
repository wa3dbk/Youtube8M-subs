00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.390 
magnetic pencil trick to do this trick
you<00:00:06.330> will<00:00:06.810> need<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.290> pencil<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.400> two<00:00:09.240> hands<00:00:10.400> if

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
you will need a pencil and two hands if

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.280 
you will need a pencil and two hands if
I<00:00:11.580> hold<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.000> pencil<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.480> my<00:00:12.660> fist<00:00:13.019> like<00:00:13.230> this

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
I hold the pencil in my fist like this

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.490

and<00:00:13.710> then<00:00:14.160> open<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.639> fingers<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:16.080> pencil

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and then open my fingers the pencil

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.400 
and then open my fingers the pencil
Falls<00:00:16.910> that's<00:00:17.910> because<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.920> gravity<00:00:19.939> but<00:00:20.939> if<00:00:21.840> I

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
Falls that's because of gravity but if I

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.009 
Falls that's because of gravity but if I
hold<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> pencil<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.029> wrap<00:00:24.750> my

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
fingers around my wrist and hold it very

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.689 
fingers around my wrist and hold it very
tightly<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.560> build<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.220> magnetic

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
tightly I can build up some magnetic

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.870 
tightly I can build up some magnetic
energy<00:00:30.359> from<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:30.720> body<00:00:31.099> into<00:00:32.099> my<00:00:32.250> wrist<00:00:32.610> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
energy from my body into my wrist and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.610 
energy from my body into my wrist and
into<00:00:33.600> my<00:00:33.750> fingers<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> open<00:00:35.550> my<00:00:35.670> hand

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
into my fingers then when I open my hand

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.950 
into my fingers then when I open my hand
the<00:00:37.620> pencil<00:00:38.070> will<00:00:38.190> actually<00:00:38.700> stick<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the pencil will actually stick like a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
the pencil will actually stick like a
magnet<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.430> hand

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
magnet to my hand

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.610 
magnet to my hand
it's<00:00:42.870> very<00:00:43.440> stuck<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.660> but<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.170> take<00:00:46.350> away

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it's very stuck there but if I take away

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's very stuck there but if I take away
my<00:00:46.800> fingers<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.340> let<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> magnetic<00:00:48.329> energy

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
my fingers and let the magnetic energy

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
my fingers and let the magnetic energy
flow<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> my<00:00:49.469> hand<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.550> pencil<00:00:51.059> will

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
flow out of my hand then the pencil will

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.290 
flow out of my hand then the pencil will
fall<00:00:51.390> again<00:00:52.520> I'll<00:00:53.520> give<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> moment<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
fall again I'll give you a moment to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.880 
fall again I'll give you a moment to
stop<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> video<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> try<00:00:55.829> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
stop the video if you like and try this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.970 
stop the video if you like and try this
yourself<00:00:56.930> now<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> tried<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
yourself now if you tried this you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.160 
yourself now if you tried this you
probably<00:00:59.340> found<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> didn't<00:01:00.899> work

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
probably found that it didn't work

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.670 
probably found that it didn't work
that's<00:01:02.039> because<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> trick

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
that's because there is a trick

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.399 
that's because there is a trick
all<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.979> doing<00:01:05.060> when<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> wrap<00:01:06.450> my<00:01:06.659> hand<00:01:06.990> around

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
all I'm doing when I wrap my hand around

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
all I'm doing when I wrap my hand around
I'm<00:01:08.689> pointing<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.720> index<00:01:10.409> finger<00:01:10.820> under<00:01:11.820> my

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I'm pointing my index finger under my

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.750 
I'm pointing my index finger under my
hand<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.960> holding<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> pencil<00:01:14.130> against<00:01:14.640> my

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
hand and holding the pencil against my

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
hand it looks like this but I do it in a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.020 
hand it looks like this but I do it in a
way<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.270> can't<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:19.400> my<00:01:20.400> finger<00:01:20.820> going

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
way that you can't see my finger going

way that you can't see my finger going
under<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> hand<00:01:22.159> nobody<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.369> notice<00:01:23.520> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
under the hand nobody will notice that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.280 
under the hand nobody will notice that
there<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.119> only<00:01:24.210> three<00:01:24.630> fingers<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.170> this
