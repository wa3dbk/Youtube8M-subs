00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.660
 well if we look at it from the outside what 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.910
 first that will get us attention 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 It is a screen of 57 inches 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.080
 diagonal with super amoled technology 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.029
 whose main advantages are a greater 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.160
 contrast ratio and representation of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 more vivid colors and lower consumption of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.490
 energy this screen has a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 resolution of 2560 pixels x 1440 is what 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.710
 that we know as resolution 2k or 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.200
 resolution qhd guatache d is like oh 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.559
 it would mean playing four screens 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.890
 hd stacked forming the screen 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.320
 our galaxy mate 4 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.070
 outside we find some finishes 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.310
 metallic 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.350
 with a diamond cut bevel 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.670
 Available colors are white on black 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 pink and gold and the sides come 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.680
 good painted or set with color 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 general product one of the things 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.869
 which more practicality contributes to the use of 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.790
 this device is that the housing 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.619
 back still having a metallic finish 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.240
 remains removable which we 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.220
 provides on the one hand the possibility 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.479
 to use a microsd card to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 storage increase the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.729
 storage that in itself is 32 GB 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 or it allows us to exchange the battery if 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 At any given time, we need it not 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 we can forget that logically 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.009
 when it is a product of the family 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.100
 note at the bottom is where we 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.810
 let's find our esp and the s &amp; p 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.880
 will allow us an interaction with the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.229
 a little bit more advanced device 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.190
 what we were used to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.600
 previous models 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.850
 Well, it should be noted that now 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
 when we extract it , they leave us 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.369
 related interfaces we already know it 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.830
 call command but now the s &amp; p is 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.740
 detectable by the galaxy screen 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.080
 note 4 when we bring it to only 17 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.580
 centimeters 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.680
 a little bit before we go to 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.230
 touching it is able to know that we are going to 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.640
 perform some action the number 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.160
 of functionalities has been reduced 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.740
 from 5 to 4 and these are the note that we 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.110
 allows you to take quick notes selection 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.090
 smart one of the novelties we are going to 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 see now how the clip works 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.460
 image that what allows us is good 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.690
 then cut out or if it silhouettes the content 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.880
 that we had found on a page 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.260
 web in a photograph and capture 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.420
 screen that will allow us then 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.010
 capture and edit write about a 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.770
 screenshot the most striking 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.620
 as I said is smart selection 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.300
 when we use it or when the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.640
 we activate what allows us to select 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.260
 inside the screen everything that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.760
 we are interested I am going to put a case 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.099
 practical we go to the internet 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.099
 we are going to introduce a web page 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.570
 for example one of cars kilometer 77 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.570
 dot com 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.470
 I agree to imagine that we are 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.920
 looking for a car search 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.510
 and that we are interested in off-road vehicles 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.780
 we launched the functionality of air command 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.709
 touching the central button of the s &amp; p 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.560
 and we use multiple selection like 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.770
 intelligent selection there we would have a 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.880
 we keep it we tell you that 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.080
 we want to make a new selection 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.080
 second off-road 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.420
 we keep the third bull the ops ground 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.130
 we want to make another third one 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.810
 all terrain 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.150
 and we save it quickly we're going to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.890
 our multitasking option and we have 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.240
 over here email that we have 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.600
 been using recently 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.680
 we compose an email 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.710
 we would introduce the address to who is going 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.900
 that mail to myself and to do it 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.600
 fast affair good we would write the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.450
 matter and once we've written the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.260
 content of it we can add the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.580
 pictures then there I was wrong and 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.220
 the photographs that we have been 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.610
 trimming simply by touching on the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.660
 photo and dragging it to the body of the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.460
 mail and this could be what is a 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.020
 request of budget for different 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.020
 car models
