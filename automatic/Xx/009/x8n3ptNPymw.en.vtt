and that gives you the final install and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.950 
and that gives you the final install and
then<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.000> around<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.450> make<00:02:00.540> sure<00:02:00.570> like

make sure you get good feedback and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.779 
make sure you get good feedback and
there<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.110> finished<00:02:07.649> installation<00:02:08.550> so

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
there is the finished installation so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.400 
there is the finished installation so
what<00:02:09.390> we'll<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.660> we'll<00:02:09.869> start<00:02:10.140> from<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
what we'll do is we'll start from the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.869 
what we'll do is we'll start from the
front<00:02:10.560> which<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.160> do<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.459> lay<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> table

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
front which you do get lay on the table

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.730 
front which you do get lay on the table
with<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.720> silicone<00:02:13.200> piece<00:02:13.470> I

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
with this the silicone piece I

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.410 
with this the silicone piece I
actually<00:02:13.950> comes<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.820> gives<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.240> nice

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
actually comes out and gives you a nice

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.180 
actually comes out and gives you a nice
amount<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.870> lay<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> table<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:17.160> a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
amount of lay on the table I have a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
amount of lay on the table I have a
glass<00:02:17.580> tea<00:02:17.940> style<00:02:18.390> screen<00:02:18.720> shield<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.170> right

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
glass tea style screen shield on right

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.810 
glass tea style screen shield on right
now<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.860> works<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.160> fine<00:02:20.460> with<00:02:20.700> this

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
now and it works just fine with this

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.720 
now and it works just fine with this
case<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.350> back<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.770> also<00:02:23.100> get<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.490> lay

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
case on the back you also get that lay

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.280 
case on the back you also get that lay
on<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> back<00:02:24.120> protection<00:02:24.720> because<00:02:24.930> that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
on the back protection because that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.740 
on the back protection because that
silicone<00:02:25.770> rubber<00:02:26.010> extends<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.540> back

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
silicone rubber extends on to the back

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.020 
silicone rubber extends on to the back
as<00:02:27.990> well<00:02:28.160> again<00:02:29.160> there's<00:02:29.340> no<00:02:29.400> issues<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.850> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
as well again there's no issues with the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.240 
as well again there's no issues with the
screen<00:02:30.420> shields<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:30.870> there<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:31.770> it's<00:02:31.980> just

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
screen shields on there so if it's just

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
screen shields on there so if it's just
fine<00:02:32.520> as<00:02:33.090> far<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.900> ports<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
fine as far as all the ports and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.650 
fine as far as all the ports and
controls<00:02:34.530> there's<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.520> look<00:02:35.760> at<00:02:35.910> one<00:02:36.120> side<00:02:36.390> with

overall<00:03:00.240> design<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.080> case<00:03:01.290> yeah<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.620> can

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
overall design of the case yeah you can

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.550 
overall design of the case yeah you can
see<00:03:02.010> hopefully<00:03:02.280> how<00:03:02.930> quote-unquote<00:03:03.930> slim<00:03:04.380> it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
see hopefully how quote-unquote slim it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.430 
see hopefully how quote-unquote slim it
is<00:03:04.710> in<00:03:05.130> comparison<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.060> original<00:03:06.720> neo

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
is in comparison to the original neo

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.350 
is in comparison to the original neo
hybrid<00:03:07.530> IX<00:03:08.250> which<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.520> already<00:03:08.820> reviewed<00:03:09.270> if

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
hybrid IX which I already reviewed if

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.520 
hybrid IX which I already reviewed if
you<00:03:09.450> missed<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.690> review<00:03:10.080> i'll<00:03:10.290> put<00:03:10.440> an

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
you missed that review i'll put an

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.830 
you missed that review i'll put an
annotation<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.550> right<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:12.810> you

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
annotation for that up right now so you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.910 
annotation for that up right now so you
can<00:03:12.990> check<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.260> out<00:03:13.350> but<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:13.710> definitely

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
can check it out but it's definitely

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.770 
can check it out but it's definitely
thinner<00:03:14.400> I'm<00:03:15.030> not<00:03:15.150> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.390> say<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.660> like

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
thinner I'm not going to say it's like

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.960 
thinner I'm not going to say it's like
half<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.230> size<00:03:16.440> maybe<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:17.520> know<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.700> lose

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
half the size maybe you know you lose

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.180 
half the size maybe you know you lose
about<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:18.300> third<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.320> overall<00:03:19.650> like

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
about a third of the overall like

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.910 
about a third of the overall like
