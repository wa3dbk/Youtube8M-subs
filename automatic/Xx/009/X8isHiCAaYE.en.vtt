00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.670
 video as you see I'm back on 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.980
 call of duty ghost in the new map of 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.349
 dlc instead this Mexican map which a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.139
 I really like it very much too 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.539
 this one here and it was the first time 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.150
 I played in practice on this map here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.550
 so I knew absolutely nothing 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.529
 and I must say that it is a map that you like 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 I just said n liked it right away 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.000
 immediately I propose to you 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 this gameplay because here too for the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 first time as on the map of egypt 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.129
 I got the special reward where it was 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.379
 become Mexican gunslingers 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.890
 completely freaked out with delle 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.899
 abominable magnums and you will see gods here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 camperoni started here immediately with a 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 nice triple because in this match 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.800
 you will see those three people those three 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.050
 enemies that I just killed there 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.420
 I will continue to kill throughout 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.000
 the entire duration of the gameplay boys or 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.420
 however these three people will turn 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.240
 always together around the map if 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.580
 please note also at the end of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 video I will die because these three people 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 you were campers to you like a thing 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.390
 hallucinating guys in this video 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 you will really see the worst camper that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 I've never really seen one thing 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.900
 hallucinating however passing to 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.049
 gameplay as you see using them for 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.360
 this weapon here is really over power but 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.530
 i really harassed everyone i am 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.680
 arrived at 11 killings and one death 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 then I made some mail errors then 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.229
 I ruined a little bit I still had 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.899
 started really very well a 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 my opinion this here guys then is one 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.960
 map that really lends itself very well 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 to shoot as you are seeing in practice 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.479
 in this game I never am 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.729
 been still I kept turning to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.710
 the whole map and I must say that also in 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.619
 this map there are a couple of 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.990
 places where as you will see the campers yes 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.210
 they can put and indeed camperare 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.719
 cut yourself a slice of speck Farsi 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.810
 A sandwich 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.610
 however , I really like it a lot 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.370
 as you can see I changed the settings 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.610
 of call of duty 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.830
 because in the past videos some of you 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.069
 they had told me precisely that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.620
 I had put colors on colorblinds 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.870
 but I'm not absolutely color-blind 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.810
 the one I put there to see 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.420
 better the enemies on some maps was a 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.670
 little trick that I had done 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.970
 because in some places putting the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.159
 visual the sea the color blind view yes 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.019
 they saw their enemies better than the shadow and things 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.239
 I don't know if you knew it long now 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.120
 but you know it as you gave it 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.280
 annoyance and I am not even myself 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.829
 colorblind I changed the settings 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.660
 here as you have seen I took the 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.750
 special reward for this map 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.109
 Mexican where you go around with the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.620
 really crazy magnum but I have to say 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.150
 that I didn't fully exploit this 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.420
 reward because it really lasted me 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.459
 little and when I died it was 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.680
 really a death a death is strange 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.079
 because it's like my shots don't 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.260
 they had really hit the enemy 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.900
 what a little bit strange I repeat I will have a 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.299
 just train me on this reward 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.480
 and it's really powerful because every 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.879
 Enemy you kill, one of yours appears 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.829
 ally here you see I die I had you 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.810
 shot three or four shots and it wasn't 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.239
 death but the blows had gone I don't know in 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.340
 around the air however here begin 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.829
 all my deaths from the game here 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.030
 I really die so many times without it 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.060
 kill anyone 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.400
 But guys, and this call of duty too 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.620
 we start well and then we don't know why 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.230
 no killer can be done 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.900
 this map here unlike the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.970
 desert map has many more colors 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.199
 so enemies maybe at the beginning of 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.379
 they can escape and here you can really 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.930
 enter the houses this package 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.120
 In my opinion, invasion is the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.190
 best of all because they are there 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.349
 really nice call of maps 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.209
 duty made on purpose for call of duty no 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:18.760
 ships bridges various things absurd maps 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.609
 of the city so we need alleys where 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.490
 you can see the person where you aim 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.980
 before we know that the enemy can arrive 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.350
 only 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.500
 front or yes in case of right and no 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.680
 instead from below from above to back vi 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.840
 make a 360 in front there is this here are 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.180
 the maps a little clean so to speak to me 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.330
 really liked it very much 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.430
 right at the beginning even here I don't know 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.710
 why do I make a couple of hit markers e 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.620
 I do not die that was precisely there 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.050
 cutting a slice of speck and here 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.300
 as you see, that is, it was the first 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.910
 day guys I repeat this here 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.280
 that these maps had just come out 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.950
 how do people stand still but turn around 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.120
 the maps I don't know what fun there 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.160
 find 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.350
 anyway I recommend you on this map 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.000
 or the reaper that I'm using in 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.290
 this moment or the vector of the 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.570
 machine gun guys because there 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.660
 you will really have a great time 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.540
 however now there will be my death 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.210
 really crazy guys watch 321 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.540
 boom dead down because you look at this 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.230
 camper that is lousy that one was there 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.510
 stop there to look with mer 28 col 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.320
 thermal sight if I remember correctly 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.090
 there really is something hallucinating 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.310
 I was there to kill the enemies 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.260
 that the enemy had also taken the 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.750
 special reward and had become a 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.850
 crazy mexican with magnums and is 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.000
 really hard to pull down e 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.290
 look it's still there i killed it not 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.480
 he doesn't even know why he was 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.700
 looking only in one direction ie me 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.460
 I really have no words on call of duty 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.340
 what's really going on 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.890
 these new maps especially are there 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.470
 really camper everywhere the map just 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.930
 exit but turn it play here I'm dead 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.210
 because there was the crazy Mexican with the 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.550
 double magnum really guys anyway 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.540
 if they like and camp that fields of 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.430
 night 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.470
 I like it better to shoot around 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.270
 maps there is angel for the map though 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.240
 I die 18 times I really enjoy myself 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.460
 very much I die here again because i 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.490
 guys there was he again 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.310
 camperone with lr 28 on the porch 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.500
 that an orange was blossoming 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.910
 really hallucinating 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.969
 here are these things that really make you 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.439
 boys to pick up in the blood 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.509
 the head here I thought of throwing one 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:40.899
 grenade but yarn because the grenade is 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:44.169
 gone under the gate we say del 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:46.029
 shop and look here I see 12 enemies 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.699
 I go there to stab him to do it 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:50.649
 a humiliation, however, there was another 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.299
 that really took me behind 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:55.059
 a hallucinatory thing as I told you 

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:57.639
 that trio was always attacked three 

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:59.379
 hallucinating campers, however, the gameplay 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.479
 girl is finished I won the game 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.129
