two<00:00:09.719> years<00:00:09.929> old<00:00:10.200> they're<00:00:10.800> established<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
two years old they're established and

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.629 
two years old they're established and
thriving<00:00:11.929> and<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.500> want<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> plant<00:00:13.980> about<00:00:14.309> 50

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
thriving and I want to plant about 50

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.359 
thriving and I want to plant about 50
more<00:00:14.820> around<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> border<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.809> my<00:00:15.929> garden<00:00:16.369> so

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
more around the border of my garden so

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.700 
more around the border of my garden so
I'm<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:18.869> propagation<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.529> new

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
I'm going to do some propagation of new

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.700 
I'm going to do some propagation of new
bushes<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> ways<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.529> have

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
bushes one of the ways is when you have

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.290 
bushes one of the ways is when you have
established<00:00:23.100> blackberry<00:00:23.760> plants<00:00:24.150> they're

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
established blackberry plants they're

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.080 
established blackberry plants they're
going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> put<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:25.019> new<00:00:25.560> shoots<00:00:26.090> automatically

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
going to put up new shoots automatically

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.450 
going to put up new shoots automatically
and<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.260> way<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.160> go<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and so one way is that I can just go and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.760 
and so one way is that I can just go and
dig<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.900> these<00:00:30.900> near<00:00:31.170> shoots<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:33.559> put<00:00:34.559> them<00:00:34.680> in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
dig up these near shoots and put them in

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.940 
dig up these near shoots and put them in
a<00:00:34.829> pot<00:00:35.059> let<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.390> bigger<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:37.079> dig<00:00:37.680> them<00:00:37.860> up

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
a pot let them get bigger or dig them up

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.330 
a pot let them get bigger or dig them up
and<00:00:38.129> actually<00:00:38.250> put<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.730> right<00:00:38.879> where<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> want

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
and actually put them right where I want

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.119 
and actually put them right where I want
the<00:00:41.340> other<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.899> take<00:00:43.140> cuttings<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.000 

when<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.219> take<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> cutting<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.660> woody<00:00:49.020> plant

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
when you take a cutting of a woody plant

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.310 
when you take a cutting of a woody plant
like<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.570> actually<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:52.140> take

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
like this you can actually just take

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.720 
like this you can actually just take
this<00:00:52.469> cutting<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.160> put<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.520> water

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this cutting and you can put it in water

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
this cutting and you can put it in water
and<00:00:53.910> roots<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.719> start<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.050> grow<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> then

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and roots will start to grow and then

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.950 
and roots will start to grow and then
you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.829> put<00:00:56.039> those<00:00:56.510> cuttings<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.719> roots

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you can put those cuttings with roots

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.670 
you can put those cuttings with roots
into<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> pot<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.129> soil<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.379> allow<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
into a pot with soil and allow them to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.229 
into a pot with soil and allow them to
establish<00:01:02.129> into<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> bush<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.000> plant

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
establish into a bush and then plant

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.690 
establish into a bush and then plant
them<00:01:03.359> next<00:01:03.660> year<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> want

bushes and the next year there'll be

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
bushes and the next year there'll be
whole<00:01:17.310> plants<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.000> their<00:01:18.150> own<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:19.049> I'll

want<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:22.610> got<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.790> bug<00:01:24.030> friend

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.970 

it<00:01:31.000> just<00:01:31.210> showed<00:01:31.420> up<00:01:31.630> some<00:01:32.410> sort<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.770> little

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
it just showed up some sort of a little

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.150 
it just showed up some sort of a little
beetle<00:01:33.870> not<00:01:34.870> sure<00:01:35.050> what<00:01:35.230> kind<00:01:35.410> but<00:01:36.090> he's<00:01:37.090> nice

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
beetle not sure what kind but he's nice

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.620 
beetle not sure what kind but he's nice
got<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.190> little<00:01:39.370> red<00:01:39.610> dot<00:01:39.820> on<00:01:39.850> his<00:01:40.090> back<00:01:40.360> that's

probably<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.110> very<00:01:41.430> easy<00:01:42.430> indicator<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.210> looks

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
probably a very easy indicator it looks

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.850 
probably a very easy indicator it looks
like<00:01:43.510> he<00:01:43.600> just<00:01:43.630> let<00:01:43.990> out<00:01:44.110> some<00:01:44.290> moisture<00:01:44.710> from

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
like he just let out some moisture from

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.500

cutting here and I'm actually going to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.640 
cutting here and I'm actually going to
experiment<00:01:52.180> i'm<00:01:52.510> going<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.870> take<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.080> cutting

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
experiment i'm going to take a cutting

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.680 
experiment i'm going to take a cutting
from<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.980> old<00:01:54.220> growth<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:55.210> i'm<00:01:55.360> also<00:01:55.510> going

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
from the old growth and i'm also going

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.090 
from the old growth and i'm also going
to<00:01:55.750> take<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:55.990> cutting<00:01:56.320> from<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.620> new<00:01:56.830> growth

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
to take a cutting from the new growth

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.920 
to take a cutting from the new growth
which<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.880> gross<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.480> are<00:01:58.570> coming<00:01:58.810> off

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
which is the gross that are coming off

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.080 
which is the gross that are coming off
from<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.260> year<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.740> propagate<00:02:00.730> them<00:02:00.880> both

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
from this year and propagate them both

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.719 
from this year and propagate them both
and<00:02:01.300> see<00:02:01.510> which<00:02:01.540> one<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.440> most<00:02:02.740> successful

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
and see which one is the most successful

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.390 
and see which one is the most successful
and<00:02:04.090> then<00:02:04.810> not<00:02:05.320> only<00:02:05.350> for<00:02:05.650> my<00:02:05.740> own<00:02:05.860> experience

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
and then not only for my own experience

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.850 
and then not only for my own experience
will<00:02:06.610> i<00:02:06.640> have<00:02:06.910> a<00:02:07.270> more<00:02:07.960> efficient<00:02:08.380> method<00:02:08.709> but

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
will i have a more efficient method but

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.760 
will i have a more efficient method but
i'll<00:02:09.550> also<00:02:09.760> be<00:02:09.970> able<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.209> share<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.990> more

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
i'll also be able to share the more

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.630 
i'll also be able to share the more
efficient<00:02:12.160> method<00:02:12.459> with<00:02:12.640> everybody<00:02:13.030> else<00:02:17.640> so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
efficient method with everybody else so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.060 
efficient method with everybody else so
when<00:02:18.820> i<00:02:18.850> take<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.090> cutting<00:02:19.450> i<00:02:19.750> want<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.770> take<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
when i take a cutting i want to take a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.340 
when i take a cutting i want to take a
cutting<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.050> doing<00:02:23.320> really

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
cutting this you know it's doing really

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.580 
cutting this you know it's doing really
well<00:02:24.540> obviously<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.959> see<00:02:26.170> here<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.530> is

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
well obviously you can see here this is

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.760 
well obviously you can see here this is
dead<00:02:26.980> i'm<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:28.260> go<00:02:29.260> ahead<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.470> trim

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
dead i'm just going to go ahead and trim

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.600 
dead i'm just going to go ahead and trim
this<00:02:29.950> off<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:33.040> i<00:02:33.130> don't<00:02:33.280> want<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.490> take

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
this off and i don't want to take

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.009 
this off and i don't want to take
cuttings<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.120> already<00:02:34.360> have<00:02:34.480> berries<00:02:34.840> on

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
cuttings that already have berries on

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.300 
cuttings that already have berries on
them<00:02:35.230> because<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.910> takes<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.239> lot<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:38.310> nutrients

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
them because it takes a lot of nutrients

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.520 
them because it takes a lot of nutrients
to<00:02:39.550> be<00:02:39.760> able<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.239> sustain<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.019> berry<00:02:41.230> growth

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
to be able to sustain the berry growth

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.290 
to be able to sustain the berry growth
so<00:02:42.190> those<00:02:42.370> cuttings<00:02:42.700> will<00:02:42.850> probably<00:02:43.120> most

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
so those cuttings will probably most

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.320 
so those cuttings will probably most
likely<00:02:43.360> die<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.440> i<00:02:44.470> want<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.709> take<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> cutting

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
likely die so i want to take a cutting

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.240 
likely die so i want to take a cutting
that<00:02:46.330> has<00:02:46.540> no<00:02:48.959> as<00:02:49.959> no<00:02:50.410> berries<00:02:50.800> on<00:02:50.950> them<00:02:51.130> this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that has no as no berries on them this

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:00.150 
that has no as no berries on them this
is<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.269> new<00:02:52.510> growth<00:02:52.780> here

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.450 

so<00:03:00.700> I'm<00:03:00.790> going<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:00.940> snip<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.300> one<00:03:01.540> as<00:03:02.460> test

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
so I'm going to snip this one as test

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.510 
so I'm going to snip this one as test
subject<00:03:03.910> number<00:03:03.970> one<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:06.130> that's<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.370> new

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
subject number one and that's a new

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.670 
subject number one and that's a new
growth<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.640> then<00:03:09.750> see<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.080> find<00:03:11.290> an<00:03:11.560> old

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
growth and then see if I can find an old

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.470 
growth and then see if I can find an old
growth<00:03:11.950> here<00:03:12.190> that<00:03:12.400> doesn't<00:03:12.550> have<00:03:12.850> berries

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.550 

this<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:16.840> looks<00:03:16.990> like<00:03:17.110> it's<00:03:17.350> putting

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
this one here looks like it's putting

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.140 
this one here looks like it's putting
out<00:03:17.710> new<00:03:17.890> shoots<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.640> I'm<00:03:21.730> going<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.910> try<00:03:22.030> this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
out new shoots so I'm going to try this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.460 
out new shoots so I'm going to try this
one<00:03:22.540> here<00:03:22.870> as<00:03:23.080> test<00:03:23.560> number<00:03:23.680> two<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:26.170> here

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
one here as test number two and now here

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.740 
one here as test number two and now here
I'm<00:03:26.590> actually<00:03:26.770> click<00:03:27.160> clipping<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:28.030> full<00:03:28.420> stem

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
I'm actually click clipping a full stem

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.950 
I'm actually click clipping a full stem
and<00:03:29.130> it's<00:03:30.130> got<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> new<00:03:30.520> shoot<00:03:30.760> here<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.240> i'm

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
and it's got a new shoot here so i'm

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
and it's got a new shoot here so i'm
going<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.200> try<00:03:32.380> propagating<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:36.040> then<00:03:36.760> i

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
going to try propagating this and then i

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.300 
going to try propagating this and then i
think<00:03:38.980> i'll<00:03:39.100> also<00:03:39.280> try<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:44.590> also<00:03:44.770> snipping

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
think i'll also try just also snipping

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.770 
think i'll also try just also snipping
off<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.610> little<00:03:45.760> chute<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.120> was<00:03:46.420> coming<00:03:46.690> off

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
off the little chute that was coming off

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.390 
off the little chute that was coming off
the<00:03:46.900> big<00:03:47.080> stem<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.590> now<00:03:47.740> i'm<00:03:47.800> picking<00:03:48.310> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
the big stem so now i'm picking the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.920 
the big stem so now i'm picking the
small<00:03:48.640> stem<00:03:48.880> off<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.180> big<00:03:49.330> stem<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.660> i'll<00:03:49.750> try

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
small stem off the big stem and i'll try

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:08.150 
small stem off the big stem and i'll try
that

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.900 

there's<00:04:08.730> another<00:04:08.970> new<00:04:09.450> growth<00:04:09.750> big<00:04:10.050> stem<00:04:10.910> now

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
there's another new growth big stem now

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.340 
there's another new growth big stem now
because<00:04:12.210> i'm<00:04:12.330> picking<00:04:12.900> all<00:04:12.990> sorts<00:04:13.290> of

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
because i'm picking all sorts of

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.970 
because i'm picking all sorts of
different<00:04:13.530> variances<00:04:14.340> i'll<00:04:14.670> be<00:04:15.150> able<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.980> see

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
different variances i'll be able to see

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.520 
different variances i'll be able to see
from<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:17.910> experiment<00:04:18.390> which<00:04:19.080> ones<00:04:19.290> are<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
from this experiment which ones are the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.009 
from this experiment which ones are the
best<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:20.060> then<00:04:21.060> i'll<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.299> able<00:04:21.420> to<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.780> do

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
best and then i'll be able to just do

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.050 
best and then i'll be able to just do
that<00:04:22.170> next<00:04:22.380> time<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:26.250> next<00:04:26.430> step<00:04:26.700> will<00:04:26.820> be<00:04:26.850> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
that next time the next step will be the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.500 
that next time the next step will be the
water<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.570> soil<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.020> i<00:04:28.650> will<00:04:29.390> clue<00:04:30.390> you

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
water and the soil and i will clue you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.240 
water and the soil and i will clue you
in<00:04:30.600> on<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.750> as<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.440> happens<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.980> i'll<00:04:32.100> also

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
in on that as it happens and i'll also

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.880 
in on that as it happens and i'll also
keep<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.610> up<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.820> date<00:04:32.850> on<00:04:33.470> which<00:04:34.470> one<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.800> the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
keep you up to date on which one is the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:43.360 
keep you up to date on which one is the
best

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.430 

you
