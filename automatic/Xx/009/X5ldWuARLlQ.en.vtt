00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
like the D tire system you want to break

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.679 
like the D tire system you want to break
down<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> controls<00:01:44.820> work

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
down how the controls work

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.960 
down how the controls work
yeah<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> dieter<00:01:46.530> system<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.579> designed

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
yeah the dieter system is was designed

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.960 
yeah the dieter system is was designed
by<00:01:48.149> Rick<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:49.399> Seymour<00:01:50.399> Duncan<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
by Rick it's a Seymour Duncan or a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
by Rick it's a Seymour Duncan or a
Seymour<00:01:51.329> Duncan<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.409> active

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
Seymour Duncan right and it's an active

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
Seymour Duncan right and it's an active
system<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.610> under<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> saddle<00:01:54.240> transducer

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
system with under the saddle transducer

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.740 
system with under the saddle transducer
and<00:01:55.350> also<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> condenser<00:01:56.189> mic<00:01:56.369> inside<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.570> is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and also a condenser mic inside this is

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
and also a condenser mic inside this is
a<00:01:57.780> totally<00:01:58.110> hollow<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.189> semi<00:01:59.430> hollow

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
a totally hollow it's a semi hollow

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.639 
a totally hollow it's a semi hollow
guitar<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> chambered<00:02:00.960> guitar<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
guitar it's not a chambered guitar and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.850 
guitar it's not a chambered guitar and
there<00:02:02.610> are<00:02:02.790> controls<00:02:03.689> back<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> back<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
there are controls back in the back of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
there are controls back in the back of
the<00:02:05.070> preamp<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.539> control<00:02:06.810> your

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the preamp that you can control your

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.660 
the preamp that you can control your
bass<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> mid-range<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.979> get<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.280> blended

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
bass and mid-range you get that blended

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490 
bass and mid-range you get that blended
out<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.030> then<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.630> have<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:09.959> tone<00:02:10.259> knob

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
out and then you just have one tone knob

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.729 
out and then you just have one tone knob
in<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.769> front<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.670> balance<00:02:12.440> but<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.650> a

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
in the front just for balance but it's a

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.190 
in the front just for balance but it's a
sweet<00:02:13.980> sounding<00:02:14.340> system<00:02:14.690> okay<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.989> there's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
sweet sounding system okay so there's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.080 
sweet sounding system okay so there's
also<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.590> nylon<00:02:17.130> string<00:02:17.280> version<00:02:17.579> over<00:02:17.910> here

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
also a nylon string version over here

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.180 
also a nylon string version over here
right<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> cedar<00:02:19.170> top<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
right is that like a cedar top that's a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.680 
right is that like a cedar top that's a
cedar<00:02:20.400> top<00:02:20.609> everything<00:02:20.940> else<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.329> about<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
cedar top everything else is about the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.949 
cedar top everything else is about the
same<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.109> it<00:02:22.260> same<00:02:22.590> electronics<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.959> then

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
same on it same electronics and then

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.509 
same on it same electronics and then
there's<00:02:25.140> also<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.470> base<00:02:25.709> down<00:02:25.980> here<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.370> has

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
there's also a base down here that has

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.960 
there's also a base down here that has
the<00:02:26.640> same<00:02:26.670> electronics<00:02:28.340> does<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.579> what's<00:02:29.850> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the same electronics does the what's the
