00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.290
 good a video that I have time to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.150
 record while we wait for the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.280
 German pieces since at the end of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 buy German since it will take two or 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.789
 three days but on the other hand I save a hundred 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.789
 euros or more 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.820
 well I explain 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.250
 this is the jackpot normally used for 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.340
 suck brake fluid good 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.680
 what is crystal 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.310
 so 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.770
 Yesterday 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.830
 I thought you have to change the liquid 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.280
 differentiate the differential but how is it 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.310
 so thick it's quite thick you can 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.000
 heat heats up and goes more fluid and 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.020
 everything even leave the carafe in the sun 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.420
 and goes more 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.010
 hot goes you need help to a 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.720
 person who holds a funnel or a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.490
 hose because you have to take into account 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.880
 that we are at ground level 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.309
 we do not get human way of lifting 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.200
 the car above us we do not have 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.280
 an elevator and getting an elevator 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 you need a hand pump to go up 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.160
 the good thing that we have thought that I have 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.130
 thought-out 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.550
 let's see the glass jar lame will 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.620
 I put differential fluid the fillings 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.050
 of differential fluids 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.030
 as far as it suits me 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.560
 then I can scrub the glass with 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 soap or soda or whatever you want 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.479
 like the hose that goes again this 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.700
 long hose so that the liquid 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.070
 when we make the vacuum drip 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.170
 down and then I have very up 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.140
 for also to differentiate which tube 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.729
 It's a good thing I've done as I was 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.070
 short because the other plastic boat 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.479
 it was a little smaller I added a 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.520
 piece of old glass hose that 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.490
 I had around here that was hard to move 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.100
 gasoil gas these things and in the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.570
 part above I said well then the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.680
 part of bottom I already have it so that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.010
 push the differential fluid for this 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.070
 tubule 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.740
 or fatter if possible but good 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.300
 I have this squishy more or less and 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.840
 I can handle it and put it where 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.819
 I want this other pipe is cooked 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.709
 followed and then we have problems with 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.719
 with her that does not do what we 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.450
 we want because it gets cooked 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.849
 plastic is hard nor your father good 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 this tube is the one that we already had what 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.579
 we have put here a flange for 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.420
 reinforce that does not come up 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.639
 fired and here we have a piece of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.950
 hose glass rubber hose 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.349
 own that is the same one that is stuck 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.639
 inside the crystal does not 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.810
 missing bridle because it has cost me a lot 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.790
 to poke 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.370
 another thinner glass hose 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.060
 lower diameter tucked inside this 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.030
 the diameter of this exterior is 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.950
 as the inside diameter of this and here 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.599
 we have taken a car valve from the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.300
 cameras that collect soil here by 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.209
 there to do my little things to do 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.040
 together or what is missing is missing the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.430
 howitzer but good I do not need it I need 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.469
 only the hitch 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.269
 and how it is curved because this would be a 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.000
 cart or some wheel of some 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.709
 truck of these that go out by the 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.890
 patental service leave for one side 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.409
 Well, I cut it, I put it inside 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.129
 of the hose that is finite and I've 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:32.120
 put a flange to hold a bit 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.370
 we want to put air pressure in here with 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.799
 the compressor and the oil have to 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.090
 push him to come out here now 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.099
 I'm going to do a water test 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.319
 suppose it were to do so out that way 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.760
 oil but I'm going to do with water there 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.639
 things that are better done with water than 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.530
 they are cheaper good now continued the 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.530
 video and we see the play
