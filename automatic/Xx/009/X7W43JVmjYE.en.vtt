00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
foam to come out and I think that's what

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.709 
foam to come out and I think that's what
gives<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.859> a<00:01:56.979> quality<00:01:57.249> wash<00:01:57.609> every<00:01:58.209> time<00:01:58.420> I

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
gives it a quality wash every time I

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.520 
gives it a quality wash every time I
