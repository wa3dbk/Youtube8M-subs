00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.350
 severely criticized yes and only one of the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.510
 most successful technicians even though it hurts 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 yes because my winning percentage is 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.170
 high very high 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 I the only thing that the only thing I say to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.920
 problem in any order we have and I know what 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.320
 I say openly let's go make a 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.820
 good match to ecuador 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.530

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.239
 antofagasta and if things do not happen 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.309
 as in all the equipment that has been 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.870
 I go where I entered I do not have 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.970
 I look for a window I do not have to lie down 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.050
 back I am a very honest man my 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.310
 I work very honest and the only thing I do 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.610
 right now I go out and shake hands 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.869
 all that when I arrived then 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.729
 justice in this country and one of them is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.420
 have a solabarrieta as a commentator 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.140
 chau chau 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.360
 good thing is that before when I'm going to start 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.790
 the note with us we ask you to 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.070
 put the forums did not want and good 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.399
 we finished then this note here in the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.190
 dressing room of the University of Chile 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.720
 right replicators 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.729
 When I took the microphone, I do it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.460
 strictly professional teachers and 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.539
 not personal and when I criticize the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.240
 albos from the point of view 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.759
 professional never personal because of 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.220
 life for that I studied this career 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.710
 and I defend through this microphone the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.630
 game and values we do not like the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.069
 barcelos technicians I do not like 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 technicians who have commitments with 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.940
 representatives of players and I do not 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.039
 they like the technicians who also believe 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.119
 better than they are without figueroa 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.670
 frames within these three 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.620
 characteristics and he considers that in 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.569
 this criticism is linked to one these 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.190
 three good elements the one who understands it 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.750
 well but I have emphasized 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.819
 fundamentally performance in the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.190
 case of someone who claims to be a very technical 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.100
 successful who has never accomplished anything 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.350
 because he has never achieved 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.360
 does not yet have titles that I can 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.690
 exhibit except for some data for example from 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.850
 second division of everton nothing more 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.250
 and at the same time I have emphasized 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.750
 in other things that should be very 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.820
 important and those that have done 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.380
 mention as for example the way in which 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.140
 a cycle of the catholic university 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.210
 and because mohamed morals in mexico 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.290
 He gave up his hiring in Veracruz 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.330
 it will have to be a little bit more punctilious 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.280
 and meticulous in for example investigate 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.830
 journalistically because it follows what 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.960
 magnificent veracruz and we can dollars 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.270
 because he desists to hire him when 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.520
 there was even a contract to sign no 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.410
 will have to find out those exact the 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.530
 name that will remind you of the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.120
 Oscar human players who eventually 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.310
 I was going to get to see and that was a great 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.790
 slab is why mohamed morals 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.280
 president of the far 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.200
 at that time he decided not to hire him 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.510
 money back to contracting 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.160
 also the antecedents look for him 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.360
 I will ask Mohamed Morales why not 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
 he wanted to help semar against pnv and what 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.840
 they were going to find one of the reasons why 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.810
 which I consider him figueroa 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.430
 does not have height height for 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.430
 direct a team with a small origin
