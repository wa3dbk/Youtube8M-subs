 expo official learn the same 2013 what 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.430

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.440
 was going he transformed a privilege into a 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.269
 right we are in the process of 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.579
 customize education inclusion 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.679
 you have to give every day the 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.539
 technology you have to use it but you have to 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.789
 integrate it with a pedagogy of ours 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.599
 great challenge for the next five years 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.599
 thank you 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 Well I came up with the idea when I saw a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.880
 movie 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.940
 the movie is called steel giant 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.560
 is very good external network and I started to 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.360
 call the rockets I wanted to know how 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.100
 that is fused with all that passion 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.360
 desire and patience wanted to take me 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.520
 changed life 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.130
 will they ever wonder if the young 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.920
 can make a change in education 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.860
 I can only tell you that the moment is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.390
 now if you have the idea to govern I know that 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.319
 it's worth all we have the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.040
 possibility 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.510
 mark the future of computing 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.530
 because we do the programs 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.290
 us and all this 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.209
 thanks to the effort to many hours of 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.000
 work and that the difference between 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.790
 you who are there either child of 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.640
 school and integrating myself that I am here 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.500
 it's just so much you want many hours 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.510
 of work and that at the beginning nothing is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.890
 easy and that does not mean that one does not 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.250
 know how to do something that can not reach 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.250
 do what
