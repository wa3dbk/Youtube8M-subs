00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 this case to reflect what was the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.370
 historical triumph of the cougars if 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.859
 wants the best news that we have 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.200
 received in the year of a selected 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.080
 after what was the world cup 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 of soccer but without any doubts 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.750
 noting yourself in the story because from here 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.990
 from now on it will be held very 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.619
 Argentina's rugby team counts 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.869
 fundamentally in the context 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 international in the rugby championship 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.980
 victory over australia 21 to 17 was in 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.760
 the province of mendoza as it had already 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.129
 annotated 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.379
 and almost reached a victory against 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.430
 South Africa remember you on 25 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.589
 August 2012 in another edition of the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.079
 rugby championship tournament which was 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.449
 invited in Argentina and that 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 I needed a victory justly 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.430
 to try to continue 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.370
 in that period in which the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.829
 ideal obviously not to fail 17 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.350
 victories 17 sorry defeats had to 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.200
 suffer beyond that agonizing draw 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.180
 that also had its flavor to triumph 1 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.190
 remember in 2012 but 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.690
 what happened on Saturday has to do 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.320
 with other 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.000
 line of play with trying to have the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.510
 ball in the end situation that the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.040
 cougars could not perform a cade said 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.830
 we wanted control of the ball what 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.630
 we got over the end came we saw and its 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.840
 criminal to reverse history what 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.420
 began losing the Argentine team and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.570
 ends with the convincing 21 17 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.610
 to repeat ourselves in the story 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.590
 in one of the most glorious pages of 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.390
 racc vi I had to contain myself because 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.770
 I still do not fall I'm very excited 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.140
 without doubts that the first thing that there is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.710
 to do is to thank people because 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.530
 many times he was not unconditional to 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.810
 despite the defeats testimonies of 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.020
 urca of also of agustin creevy great 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.630
 symbol of the Argentine team in that 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.990
 final harangue with his teammates putting together 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.930
 a more serene round without avoiding 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.670
 the power to be excited among the most 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.490
 outstanding of what was lived in the night 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 and there the excited embrace of the cougars 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.720
 making history victory for the first 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.720
 once in the rugby championship
