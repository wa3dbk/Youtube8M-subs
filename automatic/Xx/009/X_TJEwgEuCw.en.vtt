00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I'm just going to do a whole overview of

the go-kart for any new people or anyone

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.000 
the go-kart for any new people or anyone
that<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.140> wants<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.500> everything<00:00:19.890> about

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
that just wants to know everything about

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.490 
that just wants to know everything about
it<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> don't<00:00:21.090> want<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> watch<00:00:21.500> 20-something

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
it and don't want to watch 20-something

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900 
it and don't want to watch 20-something
videos<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:24.300> I'll<00:00:25.170> start<00:00:25.560> off<00:00:25.740> firstly<00:00:26.340> with

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
videos so I'll start off firstly with

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.779 
videos so I'll start off firstly with
the<00:00:27.359> throttle<00:00:27.890> actually<00:00:28.890> no<00:00:29.039> I'll<00:00:29.400> start<00:00:29.670> off

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the throttle actually no I'll start off

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.709 
the throttle actually no I'll start off
with<00:00:30.199> how<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> made<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.590> okay<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.210> made<00:00:33.510> out

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
with how I made it okay so it's made out

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.030 
with how I made it okay so it's made out
of<00:00:34.070> steel<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.640> square<00:00:35.969> tubing<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.770> think

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
of steel just square tubing it's I think

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.900 
of steel just square tubing it's I think
two<00:00:38.550> looks<00:00:39.360> about<00:00:39.540> two<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.680> two<00:00:40.860> point<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
two looks about two or two point not to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.290 
two looks about two or two point not to
20<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.360> 25<00:00:42.719> mil<00:00:43.280> still<00:00:44.280> tubing<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:47.120> on<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
20 or 25 mil still tubing and on the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.130 
20 or 25 mil still tubing and on the
front<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.780> used<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.379> bit<00:00:49.590> thicker<00:00:50.010> walled<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
front I used a bit thicker walled and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
front I used a bit thicker walled and
it's<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.559> bigger<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.190> tell

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it's a little bit bigger as you can tell

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
it's a little bit bigger as you can tell
for<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> front<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.660> case<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.960> hit<00:00:55.140> it's

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
for the front just in case I hit it's

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.200 
for the front just in case I hit it's
not<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> hit<00:00:56.370> anyway<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:56.879> I've

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
not going to hit anyway because I've

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.470 
not going to hit anyway because I've
made<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> wheels<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.469> tiny<00:00:58.710> bit<00:01:00.289> out<00:01:01.289> more

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
made the wheels a tiny bit out more

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
made the wheels a tiny bit out more
these<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.690> casters<00:01:04.320> usually<00:01:04.739> four<00:01:04.920> caster

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
these are casters usually four caster

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.910 
these are casters usually four caster
wheels<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.729> trolleys<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.320> I've<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.560> welded

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
wheels for trolleys and I've just welded

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.190 
wheels for trolleys and I've just welded
this<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.350> usually<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:11.040> trolley<00:01:11.340> wheel

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
this on and usually your trolley wheel

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.580 
this on and usually your trolley wheel
goes<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> lower<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
goes this way and then I lower the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.109 
goes this way and then I lower the
support<00:01:17.009> bar<00:01:17.220> across<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.970> because

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
support bar across here because

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.330 
support bar across here because
otherwise<00:01:18.810> they'll<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.290> fold<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:21.020> yeah

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
otherwise they'll just fold in and yeah

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.920 
otherwise they'll just fold in and yeah
my<00:01:23.340> dad's<00:01:23.549> might<00:01:23.790> showed<00:01:24.420> me<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.840> was

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
my dad's might showed me when I was

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.179 
my dad's might showed me when I was
building<00:01:25.229> he<00:01:25.350> stood<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.100> these

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
building he stood on this and these

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.460 
building he stood on this and these
whole<00:01:26.460> things<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.600> sort<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.930> bent<00:01:28.259> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
whole things just they sort of bent in

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.890 
whole things just they sort of bent in
so<00:01:29.340> having<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.729> bar<00:01:29.939> across<00:01:30.150> doesn't<00:01:30.600> allow

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
so having that bar across doesn't allow

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.899 
so having that bar across doesn't allow
them<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.259> bend<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.220> strengthens<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
them to bend in and it strengthens that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.179 
them to bend in and it strengthens that
part<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:34.170> less<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:34.890> aren't<00:01:35.100> very

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
part or less because these aren't very

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.460 
part or less because these aren't very
strong<00:01:35.640> metal<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> support

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
strong metal you have to have a support

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.460 
strong metal you have to have a support
on<00:01:37.619> them<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> buy<00:01:40.020> these<00:01:40.079> they

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
on them so when you buy these they

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.149 
on them so when you buy these they
already<00:01:40.590> come<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:42.079> steel<00:01:43.079> tube<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.710> it's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
already come with a steel tube it's it's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.060 
already come with a steel tube it's it's
about<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:45.390> thick<00:01:45.689> wall<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.860> pretty

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
about that thick wall it's it's pretty

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.730 
about that thick wall it's it's pretty
thick<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.460> about<00:01:47.930> four<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.079> five<00:01:49.290> mil<00:01:49.530> it's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
thick it's about four or five mil it's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.050 
thick it's about four or five mil it's
just<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.360> yeah<00:01:51.360> little<00:01:51.899> tubing<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.590> still<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.759> on

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that tubing what you do is you swelled a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.530 
that tubing what you do is you swelled a
three-quarter<00:01:56.640> inch<00:01:56.759> straight<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.090> 5/8<00:01:57.509> or

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
then I just put a nut to space it out of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.069 
then I just put a nut to space it out of
it<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.100> hits<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.659> put<00:02:03.990> my

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.979 
it as it hits this and then just put my
wheel<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:05.899> there<00:02:06.899> wheels<00:02:07.259> from<00:02:07.910> trolleys<00:02:08.989> I

wheel on there wheels from trolleys I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.530 
wheel on there wheels from trolleys I
got<00:02:10.709> them<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> cast<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.370> shot<00:02:11.580> although<00:02:11.790> they

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
got them in a cast a shot although they

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.119 
got them in a cast a shot although they
have<00:02:12.750> high<00:02:12.959> speed<00:02:13.260> bearings<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.800> them

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
have high speed bearings in them

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.880 
have high speed bearings in them
rated<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.939> not<00:02:15.480> high<00:02:15.629> speed<00:02:15.689> bearings<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.379> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
rated to not high speed bearings but the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.580 
rated to not high speed bearings but the
bearings<00:02:17.280> are<00:02:17.370> rated<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.959> 25,000<00:02:18.959> rpm<00:02:19.079> so

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
bearings are rated to 25,000 rpm so

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.009 
bearings are rated to 25,000 rpm so
they're<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.640> break<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:24.019> flooring

the air then and then I've got some
tubing<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.439> welded<00:02:44.280> around<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.209> yeah

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
tubing and welded around and then yeah

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.940 
tubing and welded around and then yeah
just<00:02:45.599> bent<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.349> around<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.030> put<00:02:48.030> up<00:02:48.120> top<00:02:48.950> this

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
just bent it around and put up top this

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.789 
just bent it around and put up top this
is<00:02:50.010> from<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> bicycle<00:02:50.909> it's<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.200> yeah<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799

is from a bicycle it's the yeah the
frame<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.250> bicycle<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.730> then<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.420> is

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
frame of the bicycle and then this is

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.740 
frame of the bicycle and then this is
the<00:02:54.720> handlebars<00:02:55.170> usually<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.530> bicycle<00:02:55.889> I<00:02:55.950> just

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the handlebars usually a bicycle I just

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.869 
the handlebars usually a bicycle I just
bent<00:02:57.750> them<00:02:57.930> around

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
bent them around

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.160 
bent them around
these<00:02:59.879> are<00:03:00.090> usually<00:03:00.209> where<00:03:00.510> your<00:03:00.629> Forks<00:03:00.959> are

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
these are usually where your Forks are

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.800 
these are usually where your Forks are
and<00:03:01.379> I<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:01.560> granted<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.129> Forks<00:03:02.430> off<00:03:02.639> and<00:03:02.879> I

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and I just granted the Forks off and I

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.780 
and I just granted the Forks off and I
then<00:03:04.349> put<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> pole<00:03:04.950> up<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:06.209> actually<00:03:06.299> goes

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
then put a pole up here it actually goes

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.670 
then put a pole up here it actually goes
know<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.209> see<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:10.139> this<00:03:10.409> pole

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
know if you can see it but this pole

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.349 
know if you can see it but this pole
goes<00:03:10.889> right<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.370> here<00:03:11.609> so<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:12.000> pretty

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
goes right up to here so it's pretty

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.170 
goes right up to here so it's pretty
strong<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.930> then<00:03:13.889> this<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> crank<00:03:14.849> from<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
strong and then this is a crank from the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.110 
strong and then this is a crank from the
bicycle<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.829> grinded<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.609> sides<00:03:17.849> of

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
bicycle and I just grinded the sides of

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.080 
bicycle and I just grinded the sides of
off<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.859> welded<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.400> bar<00:03:20.639> on<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:20.970> this

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
off that and welded this bar on to this

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.089 
off that and welded this bar on to this
then<00:03:21.709> over<00:03:22.709> here

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
I got a piece of aluminium and yeah it

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.289 
I got a piece of aluminium and yeah it
has<00:03:28.199> to<00:03:28.349> be<00:03:28.440> very<00:03:28.680> thick<00:03:28.859> as<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.160> bends<00:03:29.400> then

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
has to be very thick as it bends then

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.520 
has to be very thick as it bends then
I've<00:03:30.419> got<00:03:30.569> drilled<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.900> hole<00:03:30.930> at<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.230> bottom

and put a nut and then made these tire

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.610 
and put a nut and then made these tire
rods<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:35.849> yeah<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.049> bit<00:03:37.139> of<00:03:37.230> rod<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620

rods with a yeah just a bit of rod and
then<00:03:38.190> got<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.579> nut<00:03:39.299> head<00:03:39.870> up<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.139> oxy<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.560> then

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
then got a nut head up with oxy and then

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.349 
then got a nut head up with oxy and then
smacked<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.160> around<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.549> make<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> circle<00:03:42.180> and

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
smacked it around to make a circle and

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.479 
smacked it around to make a circle and
that's<00:03:43.319> how<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> did<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:43.980> then<00:03:44.129> this<00:03:44.280> is

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:54.819 
just a bit of Steel that I welded onto
there<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.299> then<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.449> turns<00:03:49.639> look<00:03:50.639> soo<00:03:53.299> so

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
there and then that turns look soo so
