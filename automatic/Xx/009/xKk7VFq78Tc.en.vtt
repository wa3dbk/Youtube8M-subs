00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.480
 so hello to all 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.520
 Hello 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.950
 today is December 15 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.800
 time from fifteen o'clock 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.970
 in the town of old Oskol 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.000
 sunny 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.090
 this is another dedicated video 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.530
 programmed tanks want to check 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.560
 notice that I am considering a standard 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:39.200
 that's all, that is, this code is suitable for 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:41.870
 most kunak racks here's 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.820
 there is this frame pretty sweet partisans and 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.500
 how the cat won't fit there for such a stand 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.500
 xiaomi rick or there went their hynek 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.140
 your code format it you will 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.140
 consider other lessons 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.800
 in particular, in this lesson I will look at 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.940
 such a thing as tool correction 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.940
 tool offset 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.740
 he knocks he is introduced into the machine 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.200
 field 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.170
 geometry that is for each instrument 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 besides binding by accident and near there 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:32.320
 input field for wear along the z axis i.e. 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.300
 and the next field on normal on searches in 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.450
 racks goes the field so-called 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.900
 geometry to bend the value 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.730
 tool offset I score in 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.790
 depending on how prepared 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:50.190
 program she is hammered either on great 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.190
 come either on 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.120
 if the whole diameter is clogged diameter 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.230
 tool or increment forgotten 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.450
 which should 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:06.120
 the tool should come closer or 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.510
 on the contrary to move on here are the contours that 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.510
 here 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.280
 so 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.450
 consider our program I took it in 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.790
 first lesson out of 2 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.750
 did you consider the movement of tools by 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.830
 circular 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.660
 police project 2 you framed here 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.660
 collector how it looks in the program 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.840
 frame 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.860
 the tool moves linearly 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.220
 by interpolation 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.860
 comes on the trajectory I added a function 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.790
 already 41 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.790
 This is a left correction, that is, when 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.770
 Armen moves 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.250
 clockwise and 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.760
 we process the material it is 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.760
 left 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.880
 the additive is already 41 and add it are called 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.930
 d1 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.930
 in that 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.930
 out 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.540
 Corrections can be taken from any 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.319
 tool that is you can write up to 10 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.109
 then tool corrections swept 65 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.280
 and although 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.280
 the tool we use 1 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.750
 correction function is already 41 and 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.250
 turn off from find at the end of the cycle 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.250
 breadbasket and 40 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.570
 the same in the following example task 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.150
 circular interpolation also include 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.170
 41 collections and disconnect 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.150
 function 40 must be specified 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.569
 world from which cell will be taken to 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.959
 vibration corrector on 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.150
 the tool is usually in this geometry 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.220
 entered 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.870
 transformation minus for example 5 acres 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:30.250
 the tool is suitable let's say we fill 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.790
 diameter tool fit the top ten 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.760
 vanilla 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.840
 workable diameter for ten if 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.840
 we will score minus 5 days 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:48.320
 all I wanted to say this year in 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.440
 this video about diane correction 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.440
 here 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.779
 thanks to all
