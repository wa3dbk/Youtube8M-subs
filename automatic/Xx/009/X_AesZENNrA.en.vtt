couple of quid to get the colors that
you<00:01:38.729> want<00:01:38.880> sometimes<00:01:39.630> there's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.560> bit

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you want sometimes there's a little bit

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
you want sometimes there's a little bit
of<00:01:40.710> difference<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> price<00:01:41.340> other<00:01:41.549> times

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
of difference in the price other times

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.520 
of difference in the price other times
there's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.299> more<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> price<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.380> all

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
there's a lot more in the price it all

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010 
there's a lot more in the price it all
depends<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.790> source<00:01:45.060> material<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
depends on what the source material is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.649 
depends on what the source material is
the<00:01:46.920> likes<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.220> cobalt<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.000> turquoise<00:01:48.329> or

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the likes of cobalt or turquoise or

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.340 
the likes of cobalt or turquoise or
stuff<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
stuff like that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.560 
stuff like that
so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.009> would<00:01:50.490> say<00:01:50.670> stick<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> artist

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so I would say stick to the artist

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
that again another dinky little box got

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.850 
that again another dinky little box got
lots<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.340> mixing<00:04:06.700> space<00:04:06.970> on<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.329> but<00:04:08.079> ideally

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
lots of mixing space on it but ideally

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.319 
lots of mixing space on it but ideally
whenever<00:04:09.310> you're<00:04:09.459> painting<00:04:09.850> with<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:10.030> small

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
whenever you're painting with a small

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.599 
whenever you're painting with a small
box<00:04:10.570> like<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.989> you'll<00:04:11.320> want<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.650> have<00:04:11.739> some

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
box like that you'll want to have some

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.240 
box like that you'll want to have some
other<00:04:12.730> mixing<00:04:13.209> palette<00:04:14.019> available<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.100> you

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
other mixing palette available to you

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.219 
other mixing palette available to you
and<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.760> find<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.329> something<00:04:16.690> like<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:16.870> is

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
and I find that something like that is

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.560 
and I find that something like that is
just<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:18.070> bit<00:04:18.190> rate<00:04:18.430> because<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.090> has<00:04:19.239> deep

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
just a bit rate because it has deep

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.420 
just a bit rate because it has deep
wells<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.229> has<00:04:20.410> got<00:04:20.560> wells<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.979> will<00:04:21.130> hold<00:04:21.280> a

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
wells it has got wells that will hold a

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.850 
wells it has got wells that will hold a
lot<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.640> wash<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.630> for<00:04:22.810> your<00:04:22.930> larger<00:04:23.560> sky

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
lot of wash so for your larger sky

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010
