this whole box I'm not a huge fan of
that<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.790> bike<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.300> ran<00:01:24.600> through

water<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> water<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.580> shoot<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
water so the water would shoot off this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.249 
water so the water would shoot off this
front<00:01:27.630> tire<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.070> into<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.460> filter<00:01:30.259> so

be<00:02:32.480> doing<00:02:32.689> one<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.019> top<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.489> then

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
be doing one on the top here and then

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.210 
be doing one on the top here and then
one<00:02:34.879> on<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.060> back<00:02:35.269> here<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.439> I'll<00:02:36.560> guide<00:02:37.010> you

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
one on the back here and I'll guide you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.300 
one on the back here and I'll guide you
through<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.579> as<00:02:37.730> well<00:02:38.890> okay<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:39.920> here's<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
through that as well okay so here's the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.940 
through that as well okay so here's the
air<00:02:40.459> box<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:42.049> got<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> little<00:02:42.439> one-inch

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
air box and we got the little one-inch

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.490 
air box and we got the little one-inch
filters<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:44.810> three<00:02:45.019> different<00:02:45.109> ways<00:02:45.349> to

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
filters so it's three different ways to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.619 
filters so it's three different ways to
drill<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:45.859> you<00:02:46.010> can<00:02:46.129> use<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> spade<00:02:46.579> bit

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
drill this you can use a spade bit

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.879 
drill this you can use a spade bit
obviously<00:02:47.629> you<00:02:47.780> want<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.079> one-inch<00:02:48.409> one<00:02:48.680> or

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
obviously you want the one-inch one or

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.949 
obviously you want the one-inch one or
the<00:02:48.980> three-quarter<00:02:49.549> inch<00:02:49.700> one<00:02:49.909> I<00:02:50.150> don't<00:02:50.780> have

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
the three-quarter inch one I don't have

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:51.339 
the three-quarter inch one I don't have
it

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
it

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.920 
it
so<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.680> also<00:02:52.099> have<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.459> hole<00:02:52.909> saw<00:02:53.150> or<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.659> can<00:02:53.840> do

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
so I also have a hole saw or you can do

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.289 
so I also have a hole saw or you can do
like<00:02:54.139> a<00:02:54.170> Unibet<00:02:54.709> or<00:02:55.129> if<00:02:55.639> you're<00:02:55.819> really<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.269> a

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
like a Unibet or if you're really on a

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.129 
like a Unibet or if you're really on a
budget<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.870> guess<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.200> could<00:02:57.439> use<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.650> knife

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
budget I guess you could use a knife

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.339 
budget I guess you could use a knife
we're<00:03:00.139> going<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.319> start<00:03:00.590> with<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.829> hole<00:03:00.980> saw

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
we're going to start with the hole saw

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.720 
we're going to start with the hole saw
and<00:03:03.349> then<00:03:03.590> work<00:03:03.739> our<00:03:03.950> way<00:03:04.040> up<00:03:04.069> with<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.459> unive

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
and then work our way up with the unive

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.759 
and then work our way up with the unive
it<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:07.579> again<00:03:08.409> we're<00:03:09.409> going<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.590> do<00:03:09.680> this

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
it so again we're going to do this

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:21.819 
it so again we're going to do this
backside<00:03:10.250> here<00:03:20.139> then<00:03:21.139> we're<00:03:21.230> going<00:03:21.349> to<00:03:21.409> do<00:03:21.530> one

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
backside here then we're going to do one

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:35.430 
backside here then we're going to do one
on<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.010> top<00:03:33.159> and<00:03:34.159> you<00:03:34.340> want<00:03:34.519> this<00:03:34.609> to<00:03:34.699> be<00:03:34.790> snug

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
on the top and you want this to be snug

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.930 
on the top and you want this to be snug
we<00:03:36.440> are<00:03:36.560> going<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.769> silicone<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.459> or<00:03:37.609> glue<00:03:37.790> it

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
we are going to silicone it or glue it

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.509 
we are going to silicone it or glue it
in<00:03:38.470> but<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.949> tighter<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.340> better<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:46.280> now<00:03:46.400> I'm

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
in but the tighter the better so now I'm

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.550 
in but the tighter the better so now I'm
going<00:03:46.609> to<00:03:46.699> use<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.970> unibit<00:03:47.419> do<00:03:48.169> a<00:03:48.199> little<00:03:48.379> bit

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
going to use the unibit do a little bit

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.849 
going to use the unibit do a little bit
more<00:03:53.079> again<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:54.260> want<00:03:54.409> to<00:03:54.470> be<00:03:54.530> constantly

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
more again you want to be constantly

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:01.360 
more again you want to be constantly
checking<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:59.769> I'm<00:04:00.769> probably<00:04:00.979> going<00:04:01.189> to<00:04:01.250> get

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
checking it I'm probably going to get

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.280 
checking it I'm probably going to get
the<00:04:01.489> knife<00:04:01.699> and<00:04:02.000> smooth<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:02.900> out<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.139> little

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.589 
the knife and smooth this out a little
bit<00:04:07.599> okay<00:04:08.599> so<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:08.989> top<00:04:09.290> one

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
bit okay so this top one

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.640 
bit okay so this top one
that's<00:04:10.900> perfect<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:12.610> slipped<00:04:13.360> right<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.650> it's

that's perfect it slipped right in it's
pretty<00:04:14.890> snug<00:04:17.729> now<00:04:18.729> we're<00:04:18.880> going<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.030> finish

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
pretty snug now we're going to finish

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:46.170 
pretty snug now we're going to finish
this<00:04:19.419> one<00:04:19.660> off<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:27.150> little<00:04:28.150> bit<00:04:28.330> too<00:04:28.509> tight<00:04:45.180> has

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
this one off a little bit too tight has

a nice snug fit there you go
it's<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.430> top<00:04:51.639> of<00:04:51.789> the<00:04:51.849> unit<00:04:52.330> see<00:04:53.289> there's<00:04:53.470> one

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
it's the top of the unit see there's one

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.749 
it's the top of the unit see there's one
up<00:04:53.710> top<00:04:53.889> there's<00:04:54.580> one<00:04:54.729> on<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.880> backside<00:04:59.759> now

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
we have to oil that little filter it's

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.249 
we have to oil that little filter it's
probably<00:05:09.789> easier<00:05:10.300> just<00:05:10.449> to<00:05:10.539> pull<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:10.930> out<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
probably easier just to pull it out and

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.300 
probably easier just to pull it out and
pull<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:11.800> all<00:05:11.889> like<00:05:12.070> that<00:05:13.889> qe<00:05:14.889> we<00:05:14.979> got<00:05:15.099> the<00:05:15.220> air

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
pull it all like that qe we got the air

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.610 
pull it all like that qe we got the air
filters<00:05:15.699> laid<00:05:15.909> out<00:05:16.090> here<00:05:16.389> I'm<00:05:17.020> using<00:05:17.199> a<00:05:17.349> fab

one spray-on air filter oil cool okay
we<00:05:25.930> have<00:05:26.050> two<00:05:26.289> small<00:05:26.470> ones<00:05:26.860> here<00:05:31.680> you<00:05:32.680> gotta

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
we have two small ones here you gotta

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.500 
we have two small ones here you gotta
squeeze<00:05:33.729> it<00:05:35.190> make<00:05:36.190> sure<00:05:36.220> it's<00:05:36.610> all<00:05:36.820> in<00:05:36.849> every

spot probably wear gloves stuffs kind of

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.790 
spot probably wear gloves stuffs kind of
nasty<00:05:43.030> it's<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:44.050> little<00:05:44.229> too<00:05:44.349> late<00:05:44.530> for<00:05:44.740> that

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
nasty it's a little too late for that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.899 
nasty it's a little too late for that
well<00:05:46.020> if<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.139> over<00:05:47.530> oil<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:48.190> filter<00:05:48.580> it's<00:05:48.760> not

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
well if you over oil the filter it's not

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.850 
well if you over oil the filter it's not

to cause the carburetor to run a little

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.960

a<00:06:10.830> super<00:06:11.830> glue<00:06:12.069> or<00:06:12.869> silicon<00:06:13.869> or<00:06:14.469> I'm<00:06:15.069> going<00:06:15.189> to

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
a super glue or silicon or I'm going to

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:16.439 
a super glue or silicon or I'm going to
be<00:06:15.309> using<00:06:15.399> a<00:06:15.580> gorilla<00:06:15.879> glue
