00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
you'll notice that about this group of

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.950 
you'll notice that about this group of
guys<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:51.370> instance<00:00:51.699> are<00:00:51.820> 45<00:00:52.330> plus<00:00:52.660> meant

guys and for instance are 45 plus meant
earlier<00:00:53.970> that<00:00:54.970> they<00:00:55.120> don't<00:00:55.360> get<00:00:55.570> rattled<00:00:55.870> too

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
earlier that they don't get rattled too

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.610 
earlier that they don't get rattled too
easily<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:57.780> tend<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.900> give<00:00:59.170> things<00:00:59.440> an

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
easily they tend to give things an

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.950 
easily they tend to give things an
opportunity<00:01:00.400> to<00:01:00.579> unfold<00:01:01.059> instead<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.720> jumping

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
opportunity to unfold instead of jumping

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.790 
opportunity to unfold instead of jumping
on<00:01:02.290> every<00:01:02.620> move<00:01:02.829> that<00:01:02.860> goes<00:01:03.280> up<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.640> road<00:01:04.800> so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
on every move that goes up the road so

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.529 
on every move that goes up the road so
very<00:01:06.070> collected<00:01:06.700> very<00:01:06.940> intelligent<00:01:07.539> riders

Dickinson now on the front those guys
always<00:01:27.820> capable<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.780> big<00:01:28.960> turn<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.410> speed

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.380 

maybe<00:01:32.619> they're<00:01:32.920> thinking<00:01:33.310> off<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.820> can<00:01:34.000> get<00:01:34.149> one

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
maybe they're thinking off I can get one

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.060 
maybe they're thinking off I can get one
rider<00:01:34.720> up<00:01:35.080> there<00:01:35.320> that<00:01:35.590> would<00:01:35.710> be<00:01:35.830> perfect

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
rider up there that would be perfect

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
rider up there that would be perfect
what<00:01:36.429> they<00:01:36.610> got<00:01:36.789> to<00:01:36.910> keep<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.270> gap<00:01:38.009> manageable

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
what they got to keep the gap manageable

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.850 
what they got to keep the gap manageable
so<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.270> one<00:01:40.479> rider<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:41.020> make<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.320> across<00:01:41.409> if

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
so that one rider can make it across if

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.609 
so that one rider can make it across if
the<00:01:41.979> gap<00:01:42.220> gets<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.640> be<00:01:42.759> too<00:01:42.790> large<00:01:43.619> doesn't

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
the gap gets to be too large doesn't

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.040 
the gap gets to be too large doesn't
matter<00:01:44.740> what<00:01:45.040> kind<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.369> tactics<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.000> have

matter what kind of tactics you have

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.020 
matter what kind of tactics you have
the<00:01:47.230> gap<00:01:47.440> on<00:01:47.680> your<00:01:47.950> own<00:01:48.070> jump<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> gap<00:01:48.850> on

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
the gap on your own jump in the gap on

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.930 
the gap on your own jump in the gap on
your<00:01:49.240> own<00:01:49.330> is<00:01:49.480> quite<00:01:49.720> difficult<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.640> what

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
your own is quite difficult so what

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.550 
your own is quite difficult so what
we're<00:01:52.060> going<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.270> see<00:01:52.480> is<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.840> race<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.140> going

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
to start winding up to warp speed these

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.110 
to start winding up to warp speed these
guys<00:01:57.010> are<00:01:57.250> going<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.460> be<00:01:57.550> going<00:01:57.730> in<00:01:58.030> a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
guys are going to be going in a

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.350 
guys are going to be going in a
significant<00:01:59.020> rate<00:01:59.260> around<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.860> course<00:02:00.360> they

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
significant rate around the course they

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.710 
significant rate around the course they
will

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
will

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.990 
will
making<00:02:02.140> short<00:02:02.560> work<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:03.070> doing<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.760> lapse

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
making short work of doing it lapse

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.960 
making short work of doing it lapse
probably<00:02:04.630> go<00:02:04.750> significantly<00:02:04.990> faster<00:02:05.650> on<00:02:06.100> some

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
probably go significantly faster on some

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.320 
probably go significantly faster on some
of<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.210> key<00:02:07.450> wraps<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:09.399> forget<00:02:09.729> also<00:02:09.970> in

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
of the key wraps don't forget also in

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.420 
of the key wraps don't forget also in
there<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:11.280> dance<00:02:12.280> wats<00:02:12.820> Winter<00:02:13.570> X<00:02:13.600> where<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.830> guy

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
there is dance wats Winter X where a guy

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.020 
there is dance wats Winter X where a guy
thighs<00:02:15.850> are<00:02:16.180> like<00:02:16.330> figure<00:02:17.080> out<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.500> my<00:02:17.680> waist

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
thighs are like figure out is my waist

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.510 
thighs are like figure out is my waist
so<00:02:19.030> he<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.540> extraordinarily<00:02:20.230> powerful<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
so he is extraordinarily powerful and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.700 
so he is extraordinarily powerful and
can<00:02:22.150> generate<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.690> tremendous<00:02:22.960> amount<00:02:23.620> of

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
can generate a tremendous amount of

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.599 
can generate a tremendous amount of
speed

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.970 

so<00:02:27.609> a<00:02:27.640> lot<00:02:27.969> of<00:02:28.150> these<00:02:28.269> masters<00:02:28.810> guys<00:02:29.109> but<00:02:29.799> not
