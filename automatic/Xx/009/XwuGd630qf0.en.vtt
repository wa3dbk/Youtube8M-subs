Maps<00:01:17.729> why<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.750> rationally<00:01:19.500> hope<00:01:19.650> it's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
Maps why I rationally hope it's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
Maps why I rationally hope it's
something<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.369> leave<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.729> their<00:01:20.939> haven't

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
something they do leave in their haven't

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.969 
something they do leave in their haven't
run<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> growing<00:01:22.049> buses<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.710> appear

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
run in growing buses that will appear

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
run in growing buses that will appear
randomly<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.030> something<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.450> nice

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
randomly will be something that's nice

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.210 
randomly will be something that's nice
so<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> won't<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> keep<00:01:25.710> constantly

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so you won't have to keep constantly

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010

on the ground you'll see that they grass
textures<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> lot<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.040> there's<00:01:41.310> an

actual<00:01:41.939> grass<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> floor<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
actual grass on the floor and it's it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.499 
actual grass on the floor and it's it
looks<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.189> fuller<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> there's<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> lot<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
looks a lot fuller and there's a lot of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.289 
looks a lot fuller and there's a lot of
enemies<00:01:45.960> around<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.130> because<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.119> are

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
enemies around you but because there are

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.969 
enemies around you but because there are
a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> enemies<00:01:48.899> around<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.619> they're<00:01:49.770> AI

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
a lot of enemies around you they're AI

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.469 
a lot of enemies around you they're AI
they<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.329> get

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
they actually will you can get

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.789 
they actually will you can get
distracted<00:01:51.780> by<00:01:51.990> those<00:01:52.049> enemies<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> guess

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
distracted by those enemies so I guess

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
distracted by those enemies so I guess
that's<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> bad<00:01:54.390> thing

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that's that's a good and a bad thing

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.789 
that's that's a good and a bad thing
because<00:01:54.810> you're<00:01:55.020> gonna<00:01:55.110> actually<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.470> to

because you're gonna actually have to

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
because you're gonna actually have to
make<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> commands<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.969> forget

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
make use of the commands you have forget

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.170 
make use of the commands you have forget
your<00:01:57.899> AI<00:01:58.259> test<00:01:58.770> me<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.070> stuff<00:01:59.369> by<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.880> same

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
your AI test me do stuff by the same

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.789

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
they would fly off and actually start

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.709 
they would fly off and actually start
finding<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> enemies<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.180> are<00:02:06.240> surrounding

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
finding the enemies that are surrounding

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.900 
finding the enemies that are surrounding
because<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.250> many<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
commands actually get them to focus on

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.130 
commands actually get them to focus on
the<00:02:11.640> boss<00:02:11.790> itself<00:02:12.090> they've<00:02:12.690> done<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> few

in<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.650> ps3<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.489> via<00:02:38.730> versions<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.360> one

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
in the ps3 and the via versions this one

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.160 
in the ps3 and the via versions this one
looks<00:02:39.930> very<00:02:40.019> very<00:02:40.709> basic<00:02:41.280> but<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.630> ps4

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
looks very very basic but in the ps4

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.240 
looks very very basic but in the ps4
version<00:02:43.440> they've<00:02:43.560> actually<00:02:43.680> upgraded<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
version they've actually upgraded the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.710 
version they've actually upgraded the
visuals<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> little<00:02:44.850> bit<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.209> I'm<00:02:45.300> hoping<00:02:45.569> to

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
visuals a little bit so I'm hoping to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.240 
visuals a little bit so I'm hoping to
see<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.200> they've<00:02:46.350> done<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.800> for<00:02:46.860> more<00:02:47.160> of

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
see that they've done that for more of

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.280 
see that they've done that for more of
the<00:02:47.370> other<00:02:47.550> spells<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.269> game<00:02:48.360> because

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the other spells in the game because

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.479 
the other spells in the game because
they<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.680> don't<00:02:49.739> really<00:02:49.950> much<00:02:50.100> they<00:02:50.250> showed

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
they all don't really much they showed

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.650 
they all don't really much they showed
there<00:02:50.760> wasn't<00:02:50.940> really<00:02:51.000> much<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.269> currently

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
there wasn't really much you currently

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.210 
there wasn't really much you currently
do<00:02:51.870> inside<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.410> demo<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.010> wasn't

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
do inside this demo so there wasn't

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.759 
do inside this demo so there wasn't
really<00:02:53.280> much<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.670> could<00:02:53.850> actually<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:54.959> but

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
really much I could actually see but

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.259 
really much I could actually see but
from<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.670> skill<00:02:57.180> in

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
from what this see of that skill in

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.820 
from what this see of that skill in
particular<00:02:57.540> they've<00:02:57.900> upgraded<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.470> visuals

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
particular they've upgraded the visuals

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.789 
particular they've upgraded the visuals
so<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.180> version<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.720> game<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.019> noticed

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
so in this version of the game I noticed

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.850 
so in this version of the game I noticed
it<00:03:02.220> was<00:03:02.519> running<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:03.060> version<00:03:03.569> 2.0<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.680> it's

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
it was running on version 2.0 so it's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.190 
it was running on version 2.0 so it's
fair<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.220> say<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.090> ps4<00:03:06.690> version

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
fair to say that the ps4 version

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.110 
fair to say that the ps4 version
released<00:03:07.739> will<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.010> coming<00:03:08.310> with<00:03:08.340> 2.0<00:03:08.880> as

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
released will be coming with 2.0 as

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.850 
released will be coming with 2.0 as
standard<00:03:09.660> which<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.260> something<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.650> lot<00:03:10.799> of

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
standard which is something a lot of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.170 
standard which is something a lot of
people<00:03:10.920> have<00:03:11.190> actually<00:03:11.459> been<00:03:11.549> wondering<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
people have actually been wondering and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.400 
people have actually been wondering and
a<00:03:12.269> lot<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.450> people<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.840> been<00:03:12.989> asking<00:03:13.290> about

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
a lot of people have been asking about

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.530 
a lot of people have been asking about
but<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.950> does<00:03:14.130> seem<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.269> come

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
but it does seem like it's going to come

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.960 
but it does seem like it's going to come
with<00:03:15.720> version<00:03:15.989> 2.0<00:03:16.680> as<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.609> base<00:03:17.760> game

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
with version 2.0 as just the base game

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.670 
with version 2.0 as just the base game
so<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.420> feel<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.840> game<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.200> going<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> be

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
so I feel that this game is going to be

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.410 
so I feel that this game is going to be
the<00:03:19.829> complete<00:03:20.250> version<00:03:20.519> including

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the complete version including

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.140 
the complete version including
everything<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:22.980> going<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.489> polished

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
everything and it's going to be polished

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.750 
everything and it's going to be polished
up<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.450> refined<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.530> few<00:03:25.739> extras<00:03:26.160> but<00:03:26.670> it

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
up and refined with a few extras but it

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.949 
up and refined with a few extras but it
doesn't<00:03:26.970> feel<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:27.359> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.570> be<00:03:27.690> just

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
doesn't feel like it's going to be just

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.110 
doesn't feel like it's going to be just
a<00:03:28.200> quick<00:03:28.500> port<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.040> ps4<00:03:29.280> free<00:03:29.790> version

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
a quick port of the ps4 free version

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.880 
a quick port of the ps4 free version
onto<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.390> ps4<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.260> does<00:03:31.410> feel<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:31.620> they<00:03:31.769> put

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
onto the ps4 it does feel like they put

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.289 
onto the ps4 it does feel like they put
in<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.100> little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.489> extra<00:03:32.700> effort<00:03:33.030> into<00:03:33.150> this

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
in a little bit extra effort into this

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.390 
in a little bit extra effort into this
one<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.989> prove<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.470> 2.0<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:34.890> do<00:03:35.160> have

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
one to prove that was 2.0 you do have

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.990

looking good I've a lot of people during
the<00:04:14.910> streams<00:04:15.239> would<00:04:15.389> ask<00:04:15.600> me<00:04:15.840> if<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:15.989> was

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
considering getting the ps4 version

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.270 
considering getting the ps4 version
honestly<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.830> kept<00:04:20.159> saying<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.820> really

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
honestly I I kept saying not really

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.160 
honestly I I kept saying not really
Lesly<00:04:21.519> do<00:04:21.639> enough<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.150> upgrade<00:04:22.810> there<00:04:22.960> enough

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
Lesly do enough to upgrade there enough

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.470 
Lesly do enough to upgrade there enough
to<00:04:23.290> change<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.710> I'm<00:04:23.980> still<00:04:24.400> leaning<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.300> I'm

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
to change it I'm still leaning on I'm

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.750 
to change it I'm still leaning on I'm
still<00:04:25.690> thinking<00:04:26.200> them<00:04:26.620> probably<00:04:27.040> not<00:04:27.130> but<00:04:27.639> at

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
still thinking them probably not but at

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.280 
still thinking them probably not but at
the<00:04:27.880> same<00:04:28.090> time<00:04:28.360> after<00:04:28.570> that's<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.930> trying<00:04:29.200> to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
the same time after that's the trying to

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.290 
the same time after that's the trying to
ps4<00:04:29.560> version<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.100> feeling<00:04:30.430> how<00:04:30.580> good<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.060> felt

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
ps4 version and feeling how good it felt

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.540 
ps4 version and feeling how good it felt
I<00:04:31.600> may<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.650> I'm<00:04:32.770> still<00:04:33.010> interested<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
I may if I'm still interested in the

game if I'm still playing the game at
the<00:04:34.930> time<00:04:35.080> I'm<00:04:35.320> probably<00:04:35.950> gonna<00:04:36.160> actually

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
the time I'm probably gonna actually

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.210 
the time I'm probably gonna actually
upgrade<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.419> ps4<00:04:37.690> version<00:04:37.840> but<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:39.010> main

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
going after that we know we've got them

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.150 
going after that we know we've got them
DLC<00:04:53.200> missions<00:04:53.470> as<00:04:53.560> well<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.890> believe<00:04:54.130> that

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
DLC missions as well and I believe that

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.770 
DLC missions as well and I believe that
I<00:04:54.430> hope<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:54.910> DLC<00:04:55.210> missions<00:04:55.450> are<00:04:55.510> gonna<00:04:55.600> be

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
I hope that DLC missions are gonna be

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.450 
I hope that DLC missions are gonna be
included<00:04:56.140> in<00:04:56.230> this<00:04:56.290> package<00:04:56.500> as<00:04:56.680> well<00:04:56.710> but

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
included in this package as well but

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.980 
included in this package as well but
hopefully<00:04:57.640> when<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.120> ps4<00:04:58.390> version<00:04:58.870> gets

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
hopefully when the ps4 version gets

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.360 
hopefully when the ps4 version gets
released<00:04:59.410> that's<00:04:59.860> when<00:05:00.070> they'll<00:05:00.190> start

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
released that's when they'll start

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.850 
released that's when they'll start
actually<00:05:00.640> adding<00:05:00.910> more<00:05:01.350> content<00:05:02.350> to<00:05:02.410> order<00:05:02.710> to

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
actually adding more content to order to

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.840 
actually adding more content to order to
all<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.100> different<00:05:03.370> versions<00:05:03.460> of<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.669> games

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
all the different versions of the games

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.010 
all the different versions of the games
and<00:05:03.970> all<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.150> different<00:05:04.300> platforms<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.930> the

and all the different platforms of the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.720 
and all the different platforms of the
game<00:05:05.169> so<00:05:05.740> hopefully<00:05:06.040> they<00:05:06.130> had<00:05:06.250> more<00:05:06.460> missions

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
game so hopefully they had more missions

game so hopefully they had more missions
to<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.850> ps4<00:05:07.330> version<00:05:07.570> more<00:05:07.810> missions<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.290> the
