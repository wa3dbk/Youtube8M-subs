people first start soloing in the scale

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.300 
people first start soloing in the scale
they're<00:02:07.479> always<00:02:07.659> going<00:02:07.899> from<00:02:08.109> one<00:02:08.289> note<00:02:08.500> down

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
they're always going from one note down

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.479 
they're always going from one note down
to<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.609> next<00:02:09.910> note<00:02:10.090> or<00:02:10.680> one<00:02:11.680> note<00:02:11.859> up<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.370> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
to the next note or one note up to the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.300 
to the next note or one note up to the
next<00:02:12.670> note<00:02:12.850> like<00:02:13.060> this

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.860 

which<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.489> good<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.849> just<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.120> natural<00:02:18.299> start

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870

fifth fret of the B to the G so we're

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.839 
fifth fret of the B to the G so we're
not<00:03:57.810> ringing<00:03:58.349> them<00:03:58.500> out<00:03:58.620> together

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.569 

we're<00:04:02.689> trying<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.079> hear<00:04:03.260> them<00:04:03.409> as<00:04:03.579> singular

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
notes then I'm going to the root right

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.000 
notes then I'm going to the root right

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
rollover on the seventh from the D to

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:57.050 
rollover on the seventh from the D to
the<00:04:48.630> a

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
just want you to start seeing when you

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:34.720 
just want you to start seeing when you
start<00:05:25.370> working<00:05:25.670> on<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.910> scale

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.430 

okay<00:05:35.730> hmm<00:05:37.170> then<00:05:37.380> we<00:05:37.500> had<00:05:37.590> this<00:05:37.770> one

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.399 

Oh

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.709 

okay<00:05:47.409> here's<00:05:47.650> another<00:05:47.889> classic<00:05:48.189> one

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.320 

see<00:05:51.259> that<00:05:51.469> some<00:05:51.919> on<00:05:52.129> the<00:05:52.249> route<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:52.969> seventh

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
see that some on the route the seventh

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.089 
see that some on the route the seventh
of<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:53.509> D<00:05:54.099> then<00:05:55.099> went<00:05:55.369> to<00:05:55.459> the<00:05:55.549> seven<00:05:55.819> on<00:05:55.909> the<00:05:56.029> G

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
of the D then went to the seven on the G

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:06.629 
of the D then went to the seven on the G
and<00:05:58.099> back<00:05:59.319> like<00:06:00.319> that

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.149 

then<00:06:07.210> I<00:06:07.240> went<00:06:07.449> to<00:06:07.509> the<00:06:07.659> fifth<00:06:07.960> of<00:06:08.199> the<00:06:08.680> G<00:06:08.860> so

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
then I went to the fifth of the G so

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:52.580 
then I went to the fifth of the G so
look<00:06:09.310> at

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.530 

okay<00:06:53.590> so<00:06:54.190> that's<00:06:54.520> just<00:06:54.670> a<00:06:54.850> really<00:06:55.090> good<00:06:55.330> tip

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
okay so that's just a really good tip

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.810 
okay so that's just a really good tip
when<00:06:55.570> you're<00:06:55.780> working<00:06:56.080> on<00:06:56.140> the<00:06:56.290> scale<00:06:56.820> start

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
when you're working on the scale start

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.370 
when you're working on the scale start
getting<00:06:58.180> those<00:06:58.330> next-door-neighbor<00:06:58.810> things

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
getting those next-door-neighbor things

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.350 
getting those next-door-neighbor things
and<00:06:59.530> experiment<00:07:00.160> as<00:07:00.310> you<00:07:00.520> start<00:07:00.790> to<00:07:01.180> practice

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
and experiment as you start to practice

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.170 
and experiment as you start to practice
over<00:07:01.690> a<00:07:01.780> jam<00:07:02.110> track<00:07:02.350> or<00:07:02.800> you<00:07:03.400> just<00:07:03.640> start<00:07:03.850> you

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
over a jam track or you just start you

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.700 
over a jam track or you just start you
know<00:07:04.300> playing<00:07:04.540> with<00:07:04.660> another<00:07:04.990> friend<00:07:05.290> or

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
know playing with another friend or

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.110 
know playing with another friend or
you're<00:07:06.310> just<00:07:06.340> playing<00:07:06.700> along<00:07:06.790> with<00:07:06.940> a

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
you're just playing along with a

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.050 
you're just playing along with a
recording<00:07:10.440> it's<00:07:11.440> a<00:07:11.500> big<00:07:11.770> step<00:07:12.100> to<00:07:12.280> take<00:07:12.310> so<00:07:12.820> I

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
recording it's a big step to take so I

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.000 
recording it's a big step to take so I
hope<00:07:13.300> that<00:07:13.330> helps<00:07:13.750> you<00:07:13.840> and<00:07:14.080> I<00:07:14.140> you<00:07:14.650> know<00:07:14.740> think

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
did for me so get those next-door

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.020 
did for me so get those next-door
neighbors<00:07:20.830> going<00:07:21.070> invite<00:07:21.610> the<00:07:21.730> neighbors
