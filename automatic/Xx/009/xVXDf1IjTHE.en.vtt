fantasies and so all you need really is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
fantasies and so all you need really is
a<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.320> bit<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> imagination<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.460> with

a little bit of imagination and with

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399 
a little bit of imagination and with
this<00:01:27.060> particular<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> lot<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.170> hard

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this particular one it's a lot of hard

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
this particular one it's a lot of hard
work<00:01:28.470> because<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> man<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.850> adapt

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
work because the man have to adapt

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.730 
work because the man have to adapt
different<00:01:30.450> styles<00:01:31.340> maybe<00:01:32.340> different<00:01:33.240> voices

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
different styles maybe different voices

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.330 
different styles maybe different voices
mmm

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
mmm

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.280 
mmm
you<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> would<00:01:36.180> suggest<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.780> woman<00:01:37.079> is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you know I would suggest the woman is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.130 
you know I would suggest the woman is
kind<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.950> face<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.820> ass<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.299> she<00:01:39.720> doesn't<00:01:39.960> see

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
kind of face down ass up she doesn't see

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.179 
kind of face down ass up she doesn't see
him<00:01:40.350> mm-hmm

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
him mm-hmm

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.950 
him mm-hmm
and<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:41.909> therefore<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> puppet<00:01:42.930> show

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and so therefore it's like a puppet show

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
and so therefore it's like a puppet show
but<00:01:43.229> from<00:01:43.380> behind<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.670> he's<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.240> like

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
but from behind and so he's just like

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
but from behind and so he's just like
doing<00:01:45.899> all<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:46.140> different<00:01:46.350> characters<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
doing all these different characters and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
doing all these different characters and
he's<00:01:47.310> changing<00:01:47.700> his<00:01:47.850> stroke<00:01:48.180> well<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.020> if

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
he's changing his stroke well what if

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.469 
he's changing his stroke well what if
