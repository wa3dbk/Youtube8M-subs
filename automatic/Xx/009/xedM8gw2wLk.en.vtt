cooking you can already reduce your

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.330 
cooking you can already reduce your
portion<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> when<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.009> are<00:01:56.130> done<00:01:56.280> with

cooking and your back to eat don't you

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.260 
cooking and your back to eat don't you
not<00:01:58.660> tempted<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.200> simply<00:01:59.860> eat<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.910> leftover

so what is left after that so smaller

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.690 
so what is left after that so smaller
portions<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.750> fourth<00:02:05.200> step<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:06.040> get<00:02:06.460> rid<00:02:06.490> of

starts craving for Energy starts asking

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.229 
starts craving for Energy starts asking
for<00:04:12.200> extra<00:04:12.410> energy<00:04:12.650> so<00:04:13.069> remember<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.459> six

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
for extra energy so remember that six

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.300 
for extra energy so remember that six
meals<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.870> day<00:04:14.959> it's<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.590> very<00:04:15.770> simple<00:04:15.950> thing<00:04:16.280> to

meals a day it's a very simple thing to
remember<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:17.630> another<00:04:18.109> strategy<00:04:18.410> is<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.739> add

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
remember the another strategy is to add

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.659 
remember the another strategy is to add
more<00:04:19.280> rows<00:04:20.320> fresh<00:04:21.320> salads<00:04:21.829> fresh<00:04:22.130> fruit<00:04:22.400> this

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
more rows fresh salads fresh fruit this

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.150 
more rows fresh salads fresh fruit this
is<00:04:22.820> very<00:04:23.060> important<00:04:23.600> you<00:04:23.930> can<00:04:24.169> eat<00:04:24.440> raw<00:04:24.919> as

is very important you can eat raw as
much<00:04:25.520> as<00:04:25.730> possible<00:04:25.940> because<00:04:26.690> every<00:04:27.020> time<00:04:27.050> you

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
much as possible because every time you

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.350 
much as possible because every time you
cook<00:04:27.590> something<00:04:28.100> every<00:04:28.460> time<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.730> heat<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.120> up

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
cook something every time you heat it up

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
cook something every time you heat it up
you<00:04:29.840> lose<00:04:30.110> part<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.780> good<00:04:32.780> ingredients

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
you lose part of the good ingredients

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.060 
you lose part of the good ingredients
part<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.710> maybe<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.250> vitamins<00:04:35.030> or<00:04:35.240> part<00:04:35.510> of

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
part of maybe the vitamins or part of

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.909 
part of maybe the vitamins or part of
you<00:04:37.070> know<00:04:37.220> what<00:04:37.520> what<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.479> really<00:04:39.050> going<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.350> be

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
you know what what is really going to be

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.909 
you know what what is really going to be
a<00:04:39.950> boost<00:04:40.250> with<00:04:40.460> with<00:04:41.300> vegetables<00:04:42.229> and<00:04:42.229> fruits

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
a boost with with vegetables and fruits

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.520 
a boost with with vegetables and fruits
so<00:04:43.130> i<00:04:43.310> would<00:04:43.700> say<00:04:43.910> raw<00:04:44.479> food<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.350> really

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
so i would say raw food is really

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.710 
so i would say raw food is really
something<00:04:46.130> which<00:04:46.280> feels<00:04:46.820> healthy<00:04:47.540> and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
something which feels healthy and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.659 
something which feels healthy and
energizing<00:04:48.590> straight<00:04:48.770> away<00:04:49.010> it<00:04:49.340> gives<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.639> a

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
energizing straight away it gives you a

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.870 
energizing straight away it gives you a
light<00:04:49.850> on<00:04:49.880> top<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.300> that<00:04:51.130> another<00:04:52.130> tip<00:04:52.370> another

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
light on top of that another tip another

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.940 
light on top of that another tip another
