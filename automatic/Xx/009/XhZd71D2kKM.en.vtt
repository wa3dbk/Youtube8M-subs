00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the way do get a bit confusing like

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.450 
the way do get a bit confusing like
you'll<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> slid<00:01:29.189> under

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you'll think that you slid under

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.179 
you'll think that you slid under
something<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.270> another<00:01:30.540> sliding

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
something but then another sliding

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.410 
something but then another sliding
obstacle<00:01:32.189> comes<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> way<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
obstacle comes in the way so you have to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
obstacle comes in the way so you have to
slide<00:01:33.689> twice<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.860> basically<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.670> average

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
slide twice it's basically your average

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.560 
slide twice it's basically your average
temple<00:01:36.689> run<00:01:36.900> game<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.939> too<00:01:39.360> much
