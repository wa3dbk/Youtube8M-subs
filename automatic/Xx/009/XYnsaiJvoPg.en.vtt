 "Dairy &amp; Sexual Early Maturity" 

00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:09.677
 We have known for more than a decade that women who eat meat have the highest levels of estrogenic hormones in their bloodstream, and vegans the lowest. 

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:12.283
 But maybe that's because vegans are much slimmer. 

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:19.354
 This year the consumption of animal products has been definitively associated with the levels of circulating steroid hormones in the blood, 

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:21.789
 regardless of the levels of body fat. 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:30.908
 The reason we are concerned is because the increasing consumption of animal products may have adverse effects on the development of hormone-dependent cancers. 

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:36.672
 Of the diet-related risk factors, the researchers were most concerned about milk and dairy products 

00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:43.603
 because the milk we drink today comes from pregnant cows, in which estrogen and progesterone levels are remarkably high. 

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:49.441
 That may explain why milk drinkers are five times more likely to have twins compared to vegans. 

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.315
 This shows how much influence dairy can have on our hormones. 

00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:57.631
 This year a groundbreaking study has been published in an international journal for pediatrics 

00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:01.555
 showing how much estrogen we are exposed to when we drink milk, 

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:05.366
 given that the majority of commercial milk comes from pregnant cows. 

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:13.479
 During the 60s and 70s, genetic manipulation of dairy cows made it possible for cows to milk during their entire pregnancy. 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.552
 That is why the current commercial cow's milk contains such large amounts of estrogen and progesterone. 

00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:24.312
 In the same period there has been a huge increase in estrogen-dependent malignant diseases, 

00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:29.145
 such as ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer and prostate cancer. 

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.898
 Eating and drinking estrogens is not only problematic for women, 

00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:36.624
 Research shows that among various food products, cow's milk and cheese 

00:01:36.624 --> 00:01:42.010
 have the highest correlation with getting and dying from male cancers. 

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:53.560
 Preuberal children in particular are concerned about exposure to exogenous estrogens in commercial cow's milk. 

00:01:53.564 --> 00:02:03.520
 So what they did is let young men, aged 19 to 21, and children, aged 7 to 9, knock back about 1 liter of cow's milk within 10 minutes. 

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:05.950
 This is what happened to the men. 

00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:13.620
 The estrogen estrogen estrogen levels increased by 60% within an hour of drinking the milk 

00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:16.660
 And their testosterone levels dropped considerably. 

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:23.870
 There are men who do not want to drink soy milk because of their irrational fear of phytoestrogens, 

00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:27.200
 despite the fact that soy does not have the feminising effects on men, 

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:32.480
 however, they think it is fine to drink cow's milk that actually contains estrogen estrogens. 

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:40.389
 Within the hour that the milk reached the intestines, estrogen levels increased and testosterone levels decreased. 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.030
 What about the children? 

00:02:44.034 --> 00:02:48.400
 The same, only worse considering they start with such low levels. 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.130
 Within an hour of drinking cow's milk, the levels of steroid sex hormones in their small bodies tripled. 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.470
 Half of the children could not even drink the milk. 

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.500
 Why would we care? 

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:05.870
 Because some of these powerful estrogens can be categorized as carcinogens. 

00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:10.520
 Milk is a rich source of these hormones and concentrates in the mammary gland drainage. 

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:16.580
 Not something you'll find in advertisements soon ... 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:25.960
 The additional suppression of testosterone secretion indicates that men are undoubtedly influenced by commercial cow's milk. 

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:32.510
 And the height, growth and sexual maturation in young children can also be influenced by normal cow's milk intake. 

00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:41.240
 As I told you in the last episode, recent studies about the onset of puberty show an alarming trend of early sexual maturation in girls. 

00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:46.590
 During the same period, the exogenous (external) exposure to estrogens has 

00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:51.890
 spread throughout the world through the intake of commercial cow's milk. 

00:03:51.894 --> 00:03:59.400
 They think that this cow's milk intake is one of the main causes of early sexual maturation in young children. 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:11.040
 "This relationship between estrogens in cow's milk and sexual maturation in children must be recognized as an important theme."
