00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
fifty cents five dollars it seems a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.580 
fifty cents five dollars it seems a
little<00:03:50.090> bit<00:03:50.209> too<00:03:50.329> high<00:03:50.540> because<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:51.049> find<00:03:51.319> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
little bit too high because I find the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.839 
little bit too high because I find the
five<00:03:51.769> dollar<00:03:51.950> range<00:03:52.130> is<00:03:52.280> already<00:03:52.519> competing

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
five dollar range is already competing

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.900 
five dollar range is already competing
with<00:03:52.970> some<00:03:53.090> premium<00:03:53.540> hamburgers<00:03:54.049> out<00:03:54.200> there

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
with some premium hamburgers out there

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.190 
with some premium hamburgers out there
and<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.000> guess<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.269> is<00:03:56.359> not<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.750> hard<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.989> make

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
and I guess it is not that hard to make

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.770 
and I guess it is not that hard to make
