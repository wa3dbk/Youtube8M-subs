is a natural design of the bag this part

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.349 
is a natural design of the bag this part
isn't<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.070> really<00:00:23.490> slouchy<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:24.119> because

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
isn't it's really slouchy just because

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.420 
isn't it's really slouchy just because
it's<00:00:24.539> empty<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.710> part<00:00:25.949> right<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it's empty but this part right here is a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.070

natural<00:00:26.880> design<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> bag<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.810> really

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
natural design of the bag and I really

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
natural design of the bag and I really
like<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.560> believe<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.130> adds<00:00:29.279> character

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
like that I believe it adds character

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.420 
like that I believe it adds character
and<00:00:30.269> adds<00:00:30.420> personality<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> bag<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.949> don't

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and adds personality to the bag I don't

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.920 
and adds personality to the bag I don't
like<00:00:32.520> bags<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.360> stiff<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
like bags that are really stiff and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.680 
like bags that are really stiff and
straight<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:35.130> slouchy<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.239> bag<00:00:36.510> is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
thing there's two things that I really

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
thing there's two things that I really
don't<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.330> bag<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> first

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
don't like about this bag and the first

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.930 
don't like about this bag and the first
thing<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.280> handles<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.760> really<00:02:12.060> smooth

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
thing is the handles are really smooth

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.750 
thing is the handles are really smooth
so<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:14.170> actually<00:02:14.530> slides<00:02:14.740> off<00:02:14.950> my<00:02:15.070> arm<00:02:15.250> all<00:02:15.490> the

so it actually slides off my arm all the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.690 
so it actually slides off my arm all the
time<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.570> annoys<00:02:17.110> me<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:18.040> you're<00:02:18.550> those

material it is but it reminds me of the

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.189

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
here but I would think that if I drop

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.390 
here but I would think that if I drop
something<00:05:54.229> in<00:05:54.409> here<00:05:54.560> it'd<00:05:54.680> be<00:05:54.800> easy<00:05:54.979> to<00:05:55.099> clean

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
something in here it'd be easy to clean

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.459 
reminds me of so I really like that
it<00:06:08.060> seems<00:06:08.270> like<00:06:08.419> it'd<00:06:08.509> be<00:06:08.629> easy<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:08.930> clean<00:06:09.199> if<00:06:09.229> I

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
it seems like it'd be easy to clean if I

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.559 
it seems like it'd be easy to clean if I
were<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:09.949> drop<00:06:10.250> something<00:06:10.550> in<00:06:10.789> there<00:06:11.000> like<00:06:11.539> a

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
were to drop something in there like a

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:17.050 
were to drop something in there like a
liquid<00:06:13.509> okay<00:06:14.509> so<00:06:15.379> I<00:06:15.770> pretty<00:06:16.580> much<00:06:16.669> talked

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
liquid okay so I pretty much talked

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.010 
liquid okay so I pretty much talked
about<00:06:17.979> um<00:06:19.120> what<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.150> really<00:06:20.449> love<00:06:20.629> about<00:06:20.659> the

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
about um what I really love about the

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.559
