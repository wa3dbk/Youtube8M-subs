should have been in another mechanics

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.420 
should have been in another mechanics
that<00:00:25.199> would<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.500> had<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> parts<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.279> been

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
call around the day the mechanics that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.560 
call around the day the mechanics that
are<00:00:34.680> open<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.280> fire<00:00:35.640> stone<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> whatnots

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
are open their fire stone and whatnots

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.670 
are open their fire stone and whatnots
they're<00:00:36.809> probably<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.200> little<00:00:37.320> spendy<00:00:39.680> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
they're probably a little spendy you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
they're probably a little spendy you
might<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.860> go<00:00:41.190> hang<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:44.090> Oklahoma

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
might just go hang out at the Oklahoma

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.479 
might just go hang out at the Oklahoma

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080 

the<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.370> I<00:01:05.400> thought<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.730> was<00:01:05.910> going<00:01:06.000> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the one I thought I was going to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.470 
the one I thought I was going to
convince<00:01:06.450> myself<00:01:06.690> I<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.270> left

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
convince myself I like and then I left

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.540

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
it on the roof to be blown away in the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.720 
it on the roof to be blown away in the
wind<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.980> really<00:01:13.980> doesn't<00:01:14.220> matter<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> was

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
wind so really doesn't matter if it was

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:37.420 
wind so really doesn't matter if it was
a<00:01:14.850> good<00:01:14.970> painting<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.200> now

pretty<00:02:38.220> easy<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.639> do<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.030> road<00:02:39.209> because<00:02:39.329> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
pretty easy to do on the road because I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.699 
pretty easy to do on the road because I
would<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> carry<00:02:40.139> what<00:02:40.319> paintings

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
would have to carry what paintings
