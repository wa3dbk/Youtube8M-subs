up market share and I think a lot of

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.550 
up market share and I think a lot of
that<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.189> because<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:24.119> real<00:00:24.600> life<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.410> don't

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
communicate to them across all of those

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.830 
communicate to them across all of those
another<00:00:53.610> thing<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> also

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
another thing that we can do is also

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.630 
another thing that we can do is also
have<00:00:54.989> an<00:00:55.079> achievement<00:00:55.350> system<00:00:55.649> spans<00:00:56.280> games

across<00:00:56.969> characters<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.440> point<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
across characters so at that point you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
across characters so at that point you
know<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.489> there's<00:00:59.760> probably<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.059> lot<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
know I think there's probably a lot of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.549 
know I think there's probably a lot of
people<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> audience<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.020> myself

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
people in the audience and myself

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
people in the audience and myself

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
included that would invest all this time

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.359 
included that would invest all this time
in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> achievements<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.650> character<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
in the achievements of one character and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.380 
in the achievements of one character and
then<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> don't<00:01:05.760> want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.180> another

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
then I don't want to go into another

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.880 
then I don't want to go into another
character<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> don't<00:01:07.590> want<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.830> like

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
character because I don't want it like

well once we have real life ID you're

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.450 
well once we have real life ID you're
actually<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.840> able<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:14.280> an

account and then you don't feel kind of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.770 
account and then you don't feel kind of
that<00:01:17.729> pressure<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> staying<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> same

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that pressure of staying on the same

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.030 
that pressure of staying on the same
character<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> already<00:01:19.740> did<00:01:19.920> all

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.800 

and<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:29.320> one<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:30.250> think<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.480> know<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.690> guys

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
and this one I think you know you guys

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.900 
and this one I think you know you guys
may<00:01:32.140> or<00:01:32.230> may<00:01:32.350> not<00:01:32.380> see<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.430> value<00:01:33.730> of<00:01:33.820> this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
may or may not see the value of this

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.180 
may or may not see the value of this
today<00:01:34.270> but<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:34.780> really<00:01:35.230> really<00:01:35.530> believe<00:01:35.860> that

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
kind of some screens just so it kind of

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.259 
kind of some screens just so it kind of
makes<00:02:43.359> a<00:02:43.450> little<00:02:43.540> more<00:02:43.689> sense<00:02:47.849> so<00:02:48.849> this<00:02:49.150> would

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
makes a little more sense so this would

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.780 
makes a little more sense so this would
be<00:02:49.299> an<00:02:49.450> example<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.989> what<00:02:50.260> your<00:02:51.010> friends<00:02:51.639> list

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790

be an example of what your friends list
might<00:02:52.030> look<00:02:52.209> once<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> actually<00:02:53.139> have<00:02:53.530> you

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
might look once you actually have you

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.989 
might look once you actually have you
know<00:02:53.799> some<00:02:54.010> real-life<00:02:54.219> friends<00:02:54.459> added<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.879> it

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:54.999 
know some real-life friends added to it

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.309 
know some real-life friends added to it
so<00:02:55.420> your<00:02:55.540> real-life<00:02:55.689> friends<00:02:55.930> will<00:02:56.109> be<00:02:56.170> at<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
so your real-life friends will be at the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.020 
so your real-life friends will be at the
top<00:02:56.469> and<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:57.159> still<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.700> character

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
top and you still have the character

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.369 
top and you still have the character
friendship<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.629> this<00:02:58.780> doesn't<00:02:58.959> replace

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
friendship so this doesn't replace

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.959 
friendship so this doesn't replace
character<00:02:59.859> friendship<00:03:00.219> at<00:03:00.310> all<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.639> you<00:03:00.700> still

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
character friendship at all so you still

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.030 
character friendship at all so you still
have<00:03:01.180> all<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.659> same<00:03:01.810> systems<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.349> have<00:03:02.620> today

but you kind of have this additional
kind<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.409> more<00:03:05.560> powerful<00:03:05.980> functionality<00:03:07.379> so

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
kind of more powerful functionality so

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.959
