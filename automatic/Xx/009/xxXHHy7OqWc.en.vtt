00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.629
 Valery Minkin and in this video I would like 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.179
 tell you one news I return 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.280
 speeding up yes you can say i 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.370
 I did not leave him but for myself I 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 I consider such a long break 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.010
 For several months I did not take a hand cube 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.470
 I think 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.270
 my natural results are gone 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 it is peculiar when something long 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.250
 time doing lost interest 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 I did not follow the cube at that time 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.760
 news 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.700
 but now my eyes are shining again 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.149
 at the sight of the cube I became hungry until 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.129
 speedcubing decided to return in principle 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.510
 what's in the plans 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.180
 plans here maybe to speak on 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.120
 competitions on mine in November of this year 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 my 2015 also shoot new videos 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.469
 tutorials some reviews and so on so on 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.899
 further so on, that is not to cast 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.780
 your channel yesterday here for the first time took in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.030
 hands cube assembled it there collector 30 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.250
 did the average time was about twenty 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.390
 three and a half seconds now i'm mine 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.589
 along 1 smeared clean and wanted to show 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:17.990
 to you in g5 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:17.990
 let's see let's go at inspection 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.810
 It was a good cross, but something I do 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:40.110
 hard bought to the rear that's what it means 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:43.679
 lack of practice 17,941 in principle 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.049
 a good start for me could even 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:50.700
 time a little knock off if there never was 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.740
 blunted so something I'm not at all tea 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.179
 my subscribers already probably swung there 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.970
 on the contrary, I only worsen my time 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:05.640
 but nothing now let's see what is from me 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:10.039
 left tu-tu-tu here lost lost 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.269
 element convulsive convulsive yet 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.190
 some hands i am even present 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:20.489
 strangely this was never 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:28.019
 worry new with lighthouses because 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:33.769
 This video subscribers 21 911 pancake not 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.769
 good time did not enter the garden 20 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.750
 let's go again with us at the inspection here 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.750
 will not be so big now I think 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.780
 again I was not driven 2023 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:21.980
 i.e. 21 is already offsetting me at its best 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.980
 case is something i'm all home and long 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:33.120
 I add two or three seconds to build 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:39.200
 started 17 then 21 principle right here 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:52.270
 It can be something they can not count as 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:58.590
 maybe the letter b could hit again 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:03.670
 17 685 remained the last attempt 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:12.240
 take a good look at it 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:12.240
 so that at least there was a garden 20 in god 5 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.630
 drove under inspection principle 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:44.320
 A brief and 17,646 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.910
 it was there + 2 but I myself generously not 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.180
 I will write it down I hope 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.520
 sorry but just at home never + 2 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.870
 do not write down referring to what you want 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.560
 quickly stop the timer 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.950
 all things so let's see now a 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.800
 here again here it is on the chassis of five 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.450
 builds better attempt last worst 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.100
 this is the third 23 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:17.470
 436 average lately 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:21.220
 inspections 5.2 seconds so so so instead 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.950
 thieves 5 here it is clear that everything again assemblies 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:31.300
 so without bidding 5 and there is this mean 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:33.070
 time 19 179 1989 in principle but damn myself 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.700
 20 entered could have 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.830
 19 myself count if there are 21 tests 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.570
 did not go and let's still one more 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.630
 we will carry out the assembly just like that 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:49.190
 to soothe the soul while 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.650
 In principle, there is nothing special to do and 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.610
 a little bit 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:06:00.590
 can pick something worthwhile 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:04.160
 will come out and maybe not likely not 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.160
 tupanul ft elsen 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.090
 120 log in 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:23.970
 not even entered with 20 ml give away yet 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:27.990
 extreme build in this video and 2 r2bs 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:32.810
 f2 and that we will inspect on 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:41.720
 hide on full and my not become long 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:41.720
 inspect it 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:52.349
 caught the eye and collect for 16 822 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.990
 well, let's get one more thing 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.509
 since I liked straight eyes true 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.310
 reluctant to stop burning I 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:03.930
 missing speedkubing 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:08.820
 on the cube therefore rustling everyday 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:11.580
 so okay let's try was 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:16.250
 good cross here again bought for that 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.250
 daddy on standing right the first guy 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:34.079
 18 118 is a good time and let's quickly 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:36.869
 meadow 5 soup 17 816 

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:40.019
 this is the last vogue again so 

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:44.759
 look here they are our five attempts zashib 

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:47.699
 I will send at the expense of the last here 20 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.649
 struck out as better and 16 as best in 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:54.749
 offset went 

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:59.009
 18 17 17 his then in the game 17 816 

00:07:54.749 --> 00:08:03.779
 and now how much I spent assemblies 8 

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:07.439
 assemblies average time of all assemblies 18,991 

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:12.079
 Ie myself 19 all friends all kacha all 

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:12.079
 skips to new meetings of my videos
