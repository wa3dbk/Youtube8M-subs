00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.640
 I found this coal already good and then I 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.640
 I kept going down 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.220
 and it will start to listen as well as that 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.590
 a lot of zombie noise right now I do not know why 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.090
 what do they listen to us but so keep digging 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.390
 and see what I found 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.650
