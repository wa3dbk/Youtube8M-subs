00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
for now let's let's build this thing

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.779 
for now let's let's build this thing
okay<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.140> let's<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:51.140> I<00:00:52.140> lied<00:00:52.579> one<00:00:53.579> more

rush<00:01:00.960> 101<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.870> he<00:01:03.870> when<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.010> saw

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
rush 101 all right he when I when I saw

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.670 
rush 101 all right he when I when I saw
this<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.600> immediately<00:01:06.600> thought<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.320> kind

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
this I immediately thought of my kind

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.510 
this I immediately thought of my kind
underground<00:01:08.159> T<00:01:08.340> bud<00:01:08.549> because<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.950> basically

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
underground T bud because it basically

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
underground T bud because it basically
works<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> same<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.360> except<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.229> he<00:01:13.619> had

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
works the same way except that he had

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
works the same way except that he had
the<00:01:14.280> brilliant<00:01:14.640> idea<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.420> using<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.990> detector

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the brilliant idea of using a detector

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
the brilliant idea of using a detector
rail<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.369> divert<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> wiring<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.509> opposed<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
rail to divert the wiring as opposed to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.300 
rail to divert the wiring as opposed to
how<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> did<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:21.229> okay<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.680> makes<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.009> one

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
how I did it this okay it makes it one

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
how I did it this okay it makes it one
less<00:01:23.729> short<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.810> awesome<00:01:25.049> okay<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
less short that's awesome okay and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.120 
less short that's awesome okay and
second<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:27.409> because<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> very

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
second of all because this is very

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.920 
second of all because this is very
similar<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.210> underground<00:01:30.420> T<00:01:30.750> bud

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
similar to my kind of underground T bud

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.179 
similar to my kind of underground T bud
it<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.340> sort<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> gave<00:01:33.540> me<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> idea<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.560> make

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it it sort of gave me the idea to make

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.620 
it it sort of gave me the idea to make
this<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> little<00:01:35.700> bit<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.060> lightweight<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this a little bit more lightweight and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.350 
this a little bit more lightweight and
actually<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.380> less<00:01:37.829> long<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.180> what

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
actually one less long so that's what

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.740 
actually one less long so that's what
I'm<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> show<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.979> how<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> make<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.970> uh

and gave me the idea of using this to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.850 
and gave me the idea of using this to
redirect<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.130> wiring<00:02:13.580> now<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.470> suppose<00:02:15.470> now

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
redirect the wiring now I suppose now

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.650 
redirect the wiring now I suppose now
let<00:02:16.010> me<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.100> build<00:02:16.370> from<00:02:16.490> scratch<00:02:16.610> now<00:02:17.390> here

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
let me just build from scratch now here

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.730 
let me just build from scratch now here
here<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> little<00:02:19.910> bit<00:02:20.030> tweaked<00:02:20.510> version

right here it's going to redirect the
power<00:02:46.820> back<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.210> this<00:02:47.360> block<00:02:47.630> here<00:02:47.870> which

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
power back to this block here which

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.840 
power back to this block here which
we're<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.440> use<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.920> power<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.370> piston

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
we're going to use to power this piston

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.340 
we're going to use to power this piston
and<00:02:51.310> detector<00:02:52.310> rail<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.870> here<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.990> go<00:02:54.140> now

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
repeater 22 and that is it there you go

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.790 
repeater 22 and that is it there you go
okay<00:03:09.430> now<00:03:10.600> what<00:03:11.600> I'm<00:03:11.720> going<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.870> do<00:03:12.050> is<00:03:12.260> there

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
okay now what I'm going to do is there

okay now what I'm going to do is there
is<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:13.310> way<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.940> make<00:03:14.600> this<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:15.080> truly

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
is a way to make this a truly

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.350 
is a way to make this a truly
underground<00:03:16.100> tea<00:03:16.370> but<00:03:16.580> remember<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.060> couldn't

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
underground tea but remember I couldn't

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.690 
underground tea but remember I couldn't
figure<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.540> before<00:03:18.190> x-rays<00:03:19.190> figured<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.580> out

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
figure that before x-rays figured it out

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.020 
figure that before x-rays figured it out
so<00:03:20.330> I'm<00:03:21.200> gonna<00:03:21.470> put<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.980> link<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.489> the

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
so I'm gonna put a link in the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.270 
so I'm gonna put a link in the
description<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:24.020> video<00:03:24.260> because<00:03:24.920> he
