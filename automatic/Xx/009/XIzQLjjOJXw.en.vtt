 spielvereinigung essenheim like the game 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.520
 You look at us as usual 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 Cuba both teams went that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.949
 endgame with kick-off highly concentrated 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.050
 660 are sure not to watch too much 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.090
 light and everyday task and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.289
 was already in the fifth minute of play 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.489
 small wide awake Schwabenheim with the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930
 early opportunity here in the lead too 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.219
 go 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.460
 following the game association 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.079
 Essenheim with more game shares 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.870
 great chances of pascal maier in the eleven 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.860
 the 16 and 34 minutes, however, remained 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.000
 unused 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 0 0 went into the half-time break 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.359
 after the page change, the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.190
 Counterparty a little more cautious only 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.780
 few high-profile opportunities 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.090
 nobody wanted to come here 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.549
 physically it was more important 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.170
 but the impartial one had the part 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.990
 always under control 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 in the 86 minute then the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.409
 crucial scene 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.360
 Eheimheim with one 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.670
 side-puller in the middle martin hague 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.670

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.830
 hectic closing phase and eating home 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.440
 threw himself into every ball schwabenheim 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.330
 but it was not enough 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.860
 at the end wins the game association 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.770
 Do not eat at anytime 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.420
 top-class but always highly enthralling 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.900
 and exciting final match for the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.960
 kreispokal mainz bingen with us German 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.190
 a next one short two three words to the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.950
 game before it for you now the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.300
 Award ceremony is just great 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.729
 just been cool 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.880
 goalkeeper held on both sides 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.210
 say and just a dream easy 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.040
 cool game was exhausting but right 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.000
 cool and exciting what can you say 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.489
 after such a game 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.660
 we give the word directly as there is 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.650
 not much to tell 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.820
 these were opportunities over and over 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.560
 A lot was relatively balanced 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.640
 Opportunities for us in the first half 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.700
 worked out 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.130
 Schlarmann came back with a 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.470
 the huge chance as the goalkeeper of 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.440
 holger cremer has super parried and it 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.049
 was also talking to me 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.209
 the trainer of schwabenheim in the 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.269
 Halftime and we knew who the first 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.340
 scoring the goal also wins the game 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.230
 that was pretty emotional 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.299
 Not every day before that 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.220
 a backdrop may play football 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.560
 I also told the guys about the game 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.870
 just enjoy it and have fun 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.880
 have and they have shown it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.370
 willingness to run was the happier there 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.570
 we had the end 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.570
 and now we have one more title 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.260
 Henkel told me shortly after the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.190
 award ceremony the participant medal 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.520
 to be handed over 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.410
 bitter is bitter because we are more 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.660
 made but it is all right 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.190
 lucky won today because of it 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.590
 was actually the chance were distributed 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.660
 we have good areas in the 90 minutes 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.220
 and now we finish with Thomas 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.570
 voeckler there it goes again from the place 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.920
 although I have the last six 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.709
 seven minutes to three more four 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.180
 high-profile chance and the goalkeeper 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.340
 has kept very well what that says 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.709
 However, from our basilea was already 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.750
 Well, we must be very sad already 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.970
 the boys but our highlight is yes 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.600
 actually the relegation games too 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.250
 contest 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.350
 because we have been working on today 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.760
 how to play before such a backdrop 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.200
 also a experience that young 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.090
 players now had then they know 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.510
 actually something in three weeks off and 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.510
 to come
