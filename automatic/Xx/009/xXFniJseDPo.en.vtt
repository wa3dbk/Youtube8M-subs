00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.440
 and no dear friends, today I'm going to 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:08.020
 teach them how to make little bells 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.420
 They are very nice for the little tree 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:15.130
 Christmas or for a wedding to decorate 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:18.230
 those of the church benches here 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:22.250
 let's go on this in this 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.600
 let's make to knit 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.600
 13 points 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.080
 7 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.810
 points that I have made we are going to pull 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.220
 this little bow that I have here 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.330
 and it closes well 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.330
 and it stays that way 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.320
 and in this that would come to do the 13 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.659
 let's do it 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.680
 the first point 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.290
 the closed 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.610
 and what I'm knitting 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.300
 it's a tape as you see it is a tape of 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.660
 make the bow that is very finite 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.659
 and it's very good to weave things like that for 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.039
 have the body 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.549
 now we close the first point of the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.160
 first round and we will do in each 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.620
 one two points 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 increasing here we are going to do 1 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.160
 two 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.030
 and successively the whole round 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.030
 increasing in a chain chain 2 2 2 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.030
 points 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.689
 I already told you at every point you put in 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.900
 each chain two points so here we go 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.629
 to close 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.239
 and this is going to start the third 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.810
 turn the third round you have to knit 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:41.959
 everything like this without increases and nothing 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.959
 all tissue where it goes 11 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.980
 and we weave 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.060
 back and as 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.290
 As finishing the first round we are going 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.739
 to make knitting in each one 18 turns 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.080
 we have to do 8 laps with a point 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.290
 in each chain 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.860
 here we already reached 88 laps 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.769
 we arrived and where we're going to start 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:19.250
 that would be the nine laps we are going to 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:21.820
 make two points together in the chain 1 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.820
 and 2 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.909
 now we have 4 without increase 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.909
 one 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.290
 and in the fourth we increase 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.420
 in the room we increase 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.170
 world 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.170
 and 2 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.480
 now let's do the 3 without increases 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.480
 one 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.250
 two 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.200
 3 and in the fourth we increase 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.200
 and 2 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.659
 and we continue 3 on the rise 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.180
 and in the fourth we increase and so on 

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:43.259
 finish 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.259
 the turn 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.900
 and finish the round let's do three 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:56.440
 normal turns in each chain a 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.480
 point three laps so on each chain 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.110
 a point 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.300
 in each chain a point and we're going to 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.699
 do three laps like that 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:13.520
 well now let's do the last 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:19.950
 turn the last round we will do 1 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:26.180
 in a chain a point we have 1 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.180
 and 2 and we put back in the same place 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.830
 and it will stay like this little tip 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.830
 well now we have one 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.260
 and we do not make it normal in the second 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:48.880
 we do again 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.090
 a little dot and we have two chains one and 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.090
 two 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.900
 and we reintroduce in the same 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.780
 site 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.280
 and we do the other one and then like that 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.660
 successively until all the 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.780
 around 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:11.160
 Now I'm going to show you how the 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.170
 sota I have already finished and February 1 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.310
 so I'm going to show you how it is that 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.800
 finish the job 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.879
 the work ends like this 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.879
 and it 's pink 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.180
 all on tiptoes like I told them how 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:32.099
 has to finish the white but for 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.589
 lack of time I show you and those who 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:39.960
 they are made and it can also be done 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:44.839
 the packaging this to touch the bell 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.839
 and he is left some tapes and hanging 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:56.060
 and to do this you just have to 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:58.490
 Carry 12 chains and knit 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.160
 Weaving and weaving 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.060
 also more upwards so that it is 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.060
 well elongated 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.590
 the first few laps are normal and the 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.289
 last laps are decreasing and go 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.889
 staying like these that are now 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.889
 A) Yes 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.210
 good dear friends I hope that you 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.220
 like it and I want to tell you that you are 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.620
 Bells are very nice to put on 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.229
 the Christmas tree and as I said 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.289
 before in the churches and adorn the 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:38.340
 banks with flowers and can also be 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:41.310
 put these white so hanging with a 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.300
 little branch of flowers two little bells together 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:49.650
 white because they are for boyfriends and they 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.680
 they put in a big ribbon wide loop 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.900
 wide a good bond is made with a good 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.539
 little branch of flowers stuck on the bench 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.860
 They are very nice to fix 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:02.390
 church benches 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.420
