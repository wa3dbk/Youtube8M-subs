changed my life I haven't been the same

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.969 
changed my life I haven't been the same
since

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.950 

the<00:01:28.979> bottles<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.640> King<00:01:29.880> Kong<00:01:30.180> were<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.659> made

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the bottles and King Kong were all made

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.109 
the bottles and King Kong were all made
of<00:01:31.170> course<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.680> quite<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> large<00:01:32.280> scale<00:01:32.729> much

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
of course on quite a large scale much

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.779 
of course on quite a large scale much
larger<00:01:33.689> than<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.110> average<00:01:34.560> puppet<00:01:35.520> film

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
larger than the average puppet film

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.620 
larger than the average puppet film
today<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.799> think<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.219> Kong<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.969> actually<00:01:39.420> 18

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
today I think the Kong was actually 18

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.889 
today I think the Kong was actually 18
to<00:01:40.020> 20<00:01:40.560> inches<00:01:40.710> high<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.549> he<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.509> made<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to 20 inches high and he was made of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.410 
to 20 inches high and he was made of
metal<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.679> he<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.340> covered<00:01:44.789> with<00:01:44.819> sponge

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
metal and he was covered with sponge

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.710 
metal and he was covered with sponge
rubber<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.950> fur<00:01:47.429> rabbit<00:01:48.000> fur<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.420> put

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
rubber and then a fur rabbit fur was put

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.740 
rubber and then a fur rabbit fur was put
on<00:01:48.869> top<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.649> give<00:01:49.679> the<00:01:50.039> fur<00:01:50.369> effect<00:01:50.789> that's<00:01:51.479> why

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
on top to give the fur effect that's why

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.679 
on top to give the fur effect that's why
in<00:01:52.079> some<00:01:52.679> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.520> scenes<00:01:53.819> you<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> fur

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
in some of the scenes you see the fur

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.169 
in some of the scenes you see the fur
quivering<00:01:55.229> well<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.189> from<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> animators

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
quivering well that's from the animators

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.990 
quivering well that's from the animators
hands<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:58.200> he<00:01:58.319> touches<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.069> move<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.459> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
hands when he touches it to move it it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.449 
hands when he touches it to move it it
that<00:02:00.479> shifts<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.959> fur<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.069> you<00:02:02.099> get

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
that shifts the fur a little so you get

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.350 
that shifts the fur a little so you get
that<00:02:02.640> shimmer<00:02:03.539> effect<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.259> looks<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:05.360> wind

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that shimmer effect that looks like wind

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.229 
that shimmer effect that looks like wind
blowing<00:02:06.720> we<00:02:07.079> rationalize<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:07.979> by<00:02:08.190> saying<00:02:08.340> wind

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
blowing we rationalize it by saying wind

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.930 
blowing we rationalize it by saying wind
he's<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.019> big<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> wind<00:02:10.760> blowing<00:02:11.760> through

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
he's so big that wind blowing through

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.770 
he's so big that wind blowing through
his<00:02:12.090> fur<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.160> film<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.340> appeared<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> be<00:02:14.910> 50

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
his fur in the film he appeared to be 50

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.370 
his fur in the film he appeared to be 50
feet<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.940> course<00:02:18.390> he<00:02:18.510> carried<00:02:18.870> fay<00:02:19.079> wray

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
be moving by itself you have to keep it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.270 
be moving by itself you have to keep it
in<00:03:16.090> synchronization<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:17.530> takes<00:03:17.800> quite<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.160> bit

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
in synchronization it takes quite a bit

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.640 
in synchronization it takes quite a bit
of<00:03:18.460> experience<00:03:19.080> but<00:03:20.080> that's<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.470> basic

of experience but that's the basic

principle is a series of still pictures
and<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:24.820> think<00:03:25.240> that<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.880> will<00:03:28.120> last<00:03:28.470> today

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and I think that it will last today

and I think that it will last today

sick computer generation images make and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.770 
sick computer generation images make and
so<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.280> spectacular<00:04:33.280> image<00:04:33.700> like<00:04:34.000> seeing<00:04:34.630> a

so the spectacular image like seeing a

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.330 
so the spectacular image like seeing a

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.000 

it's<00:04:42.340> just<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.850> think<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:44.020> overabundance<00:04:44.560> of

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
it's just I think the overabundance of

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.420 
it's just I think the overabundance of
CGI<00:04:45.910> in<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.870> 30-second<00:04:47.710> commercial<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.400> see

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
CGI in a 30-second commercial you see

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.890

else so but i still think fantasy being
an<00:05:39.919> actuality<00:05:40.370> today<00:05:41.830> will<00:05:42.830> last<00:05:43.069> a<00:05:43.280> long<00:05:43.490> time
