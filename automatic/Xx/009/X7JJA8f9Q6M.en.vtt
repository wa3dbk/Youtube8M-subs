construction<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.929> this<00:01:12.020> one<00:01:12.170> also<00:01:12.289> uses

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
construction and this one also uses

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.169 
construction and this one also uses
video<00:01:13.219> type<00:01:13.429> batteries<00:01:13.759> as<00:01:13.880> opposed<00:01:14.119> to

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
video type batteries as opposed to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.120 
video type batteries as opposed to
double<00:01:14.420> ace<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:18.409> if<00:01:18.499> you<00:01:18.590> need<00:01:18.770> even<00:01:18.890> more

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
double ace and if you need even more

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.039 
double ace and if you need even more
color<00:01:19.369> controlled<00:01:19.759> as<00:01:19.909> as<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.179> like<00:01:20.390> z9t

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
color controlled as as I like z9t

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.179 
color controlled as as I like z9t
this<00:01:21.590> here<00:01:22.840> can<00:01:23.840> do<00:01:23.990> full<00:01:24.170> spectrum<00:01:24.590> obviously

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
this here can do full spectrum obviously

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.219 
this here can do full spectrum obviously
can<00:01:25.310> do<00:01:25.429> daylight<00:01:25.819> and<00:01:25.939> tungsten<00:01:26.119> but<00:01:27.049> it<00:01:27.140> can

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
can do daylight and tungsten but it can

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.840 
can do daylight and tungsten but it can
also<00:01:27.350> do<00:01:27.560> all<00:01:27.799> your<00:01:27.979> colors<00:01:28.280> through<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
also do all your colors through the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.910 
also do all your colors through the
spectrum<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:29.619> eliminating<00:01:30.619> any<00:01:30.740> need<00:01:30.799> for

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
spectrum so eliminating any need for

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:40.110 
spectrum so eliminating any need for
gels<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:31.869> we're<00:01:32.869> blue<00:01:35.590> green<00:01:36.590> yellow

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.820 

and<00:01:41.120> then<00:01:41.240> also<00:01:41.390> from<00:01:41.990> within<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.440> color<00:01:42.620> you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
and then also from within the color you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.920 
and then also from within the color you
can<00:01:42.980> also<00:01:43.100> control<00:01:43.400> your<00:01:43.490> saturation<00:01:43.930> more

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
can also control your saturation more

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.680 
can also control your saturation more
saturated<00:01:45.560> or<00:01:46.340> less<00:01:47.180> if<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:47.540> need<00:01:47.630> a

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
saturated or less if you just need a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.160 
saturated or less if you just need a
hint<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.020> color<00:01:48.730> so<00:01:49.730> this<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:50.030> iolite<00:01:50.330> z9t<00:01:50.900> this

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
hint of color so this is iolite z9t this

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.590 
hint of color so this is iolite z9t this
retails<00:01:51.500> for<00:01:51.590> about<00:01:51.800> $1,200<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.270> rest<00:01:53.480> of<00:01:53.540> the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
retails for about $1,200 the rest of the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.390 
retails for about $1,200 the rest of the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
unit's here run between four and six

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.520 
unit's here run between four and six
hundred<00:01:55.550> dollars<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:57.110> these<00:01:57.290> are<00:01:57.440> your
