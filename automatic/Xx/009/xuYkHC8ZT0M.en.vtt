00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
school and it's a chemistry joke I think

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.630 
school and it's a chemistry joke I think
it's<00:02:18.180> about<00:02:18.360> coffee<00:02:19.070> someone<00:02:20.070> explain<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.520> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
