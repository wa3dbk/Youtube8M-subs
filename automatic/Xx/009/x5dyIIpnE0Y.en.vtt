00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the rotor in place it turns easily I use

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.789 
the rotor in place it turns easily I use
some<00:01:18.659> black<00:01:18.840> threads<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.500> hang<00:01:19.680> the

timed<00:01:58.520> out<00:01:58.730> some<00:01:58.940> fun<00:01:59.180> I<00:01:59.450> turn<00:01:59.960> on<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.170> power

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
timed out some fun I turn on the power

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:13.710 
timed out some fun I turn on the power
supply<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:01.040> slowly<00:02:01.580> turn<00:02:01.880> up<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.120> voltage

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690 

with<00:02:14.260> most<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> lights<00:02:14.950> off<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.550> see

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
with most of the lights off you can see

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.840 
with most of the lights off you can see
some<00:02:15.910> purplish<00:02:16.330> corona<00:02:20.490> here<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.700> in

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
some purplish corona here it is in

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.420 
some purplish corona here it is in
complete<00:02:22.180> darkness

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670 

here<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> enterprise<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.750> held<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.109> place<00:02:28.230> so

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
here the enterprise is held in place so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.830 
here the enterprise is held in place so
we<00:02:28.799> can<00:02:28.920> look<00:02:29.040> at<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.280> more<00:02:29.400> closely<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:30.060> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
we can look at it more closely and this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.660 
we can look at it more closely and this
else<00:02:31.079> have<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> pretty<00:02:31.560> small<00:02:31.799> inner<00:02:32.069> diameter

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
else have a pretty small inner diameter

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.640 
else have a pretty small inner diameter
so<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:33.359> lot<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.629> Corona<00:02:33.989> leaks<00:02:34.290> out<00:02:34.469> of<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so a lot of Corona leaks out of the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.530 
so a lot of Corona leaks out of the
cracks<00:02:34.920> especially<00:02:35.400> here<00:02:36.030> where<00:02:36.239> there's<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
cracks especially here where there's a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.140 
cracks especially here where there's a

hole near the sharp wire ends notice
back<00:02:39.359> here<00:02:39.719> is<00:02:39.810> where<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.109> aluminum<00:02:40.439> foil

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
back here is where the aluminum foil

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.039

foil end between those two ends is where

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.050

the<00:02:52.109> electric<00:02:52.409> field<00:02:52.439> is<00:02:52.769> strongest<00:02:53.219> also

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
the electric field is strongest also

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.119 
the electric field is strongest also
since<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> diameter<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.230> small<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.889> such<00:02:56.099> a

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
since the diameter is so small is such a

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.190 
since the diameter is so small is such a
small<00:02:56.400> hole<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.939> back<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.359> suspect<00:02:57.870> most<00:02:57.989> of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
small hole in the back I suspect most of

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.869 
small hole in the back I suspect most of
the<00:02:58.290> ion<00:02:58.560> wind<00:02:58.799> that's<00:02:59.010> propelling<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.760> on

the ion wind that's propelling it is on

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.470 
the ion wind that's propelling it is on
the<00:03:00.000> outside<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.540> nacelle

the outside of the nacelle
here<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.629> using<00:03:03.840> an<00:03:04.079> incense<00:03:04.470> stick<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
here I'm using an incense stick to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.979 
here I'm using an incense stick to
create<00:03:05.250> smoke<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.849> show<00:03:06.030> air<00:03:06.209> flow<00:03:06.450> one

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
create smoke to show air flow one

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.539 
create smoke to show air flow one
interesting<00:03:07.439> effect<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.919> that<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.159> airflow

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
interesting effect is that the airflow

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.369 
interesting effect is that the airflow
over<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.819> saucer<00:03:09.359> follows<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> saucers

over the saucer follows the saucers

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.140 
over the saucer follows the saucers
downward<00:03:10.799> shape<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.700> probably<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
downward shape this is probably the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:23.190 
downward shape this is probably the
