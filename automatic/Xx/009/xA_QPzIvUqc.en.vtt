00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.650
 hello to all, thank you for being with us 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.070
 so after the live the difficulties encountered with the game launches 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.229
 and curly 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.420
 the various whims the tone of the 150th sure 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.159
 you saw that the adventurous 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.839
 of the download and announced that we were going to put on line a 5 50 young people 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.060
 with 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.060
 as with all lying with all functions very well 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.930
 take the time before putting on-line watches and that works and 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.720
 then 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.360
 to triturate it in every way to be sure that he will not ask 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.730
 problem once he visitors 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.740
 so the 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.300
 the concept themselves 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.470
 new in 50 young deaths to be able to launch games 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.370
 % and without having to make 10 euros without having to write and patches and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.900
 everton in every way 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.560
 a way the game becomes as simple as possible so it works with him 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.450
 let's say now never redo the features of one of the wings and 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.429
 private televisions 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.429
 with the games protect in any case all that we have been able to test 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.070
 and to decide 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.420
 as the other would say 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.310
 so all that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.680
 and conclude at the 5 50 m of ways 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.750
 functional 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.200
 so he also offers the possibility to connect percent 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.590
 people that I do not go out well 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 media go home not yet directly by promised work 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.630
 digs his head to find a solution it is not necessarily 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.430
 very far 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.850
 but for the moment what interests us is 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.159
 as you can see that the 250 of young people allows to launch games 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.640
 it does not ring anymore 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.900
 a simple way p this without having to patrick priest but to tamper with whatever 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.340
 whether in club or shows that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.969
 but after the launching video it works on the back 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.010
 on some psp 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.170
 the insurer axa abandons his prized 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.170
 ah yes and it's going very well 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.030
 m a funny little anecdote and smokes of newspapers not usually the blow that 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.490
 scared of profile 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 even 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.029
 not even afraid 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.049
 the best to do 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.889
 this was to show that it works very well is that there is 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.739
 not 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.329
 but always 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.409
 five cantons will change look 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.430
 this time 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.859
 DiomandÃ© 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.299
 and we will go 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.399
 so jump from the office 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:46.089
 here 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.909
 boxing 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.909
 yet publishes his record 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.319
 it's gone very quickly 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 quite simply 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.319
 directly effectively and simply 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.589
 so there we are at the most patrician no problem for individuals 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.209
 the ultimate game 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.029
 the market gap and everything is a way of 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.349
 for completed passes between kinematics reads 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.349
 it's me who did it is also motivated products 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.989
 it is now necessary that it is often in the skin 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.939
 some time 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.939
 I'm gone 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.049
 m 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.049
 that's how it works very very small to show that 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.209
 that everything works it must be that the loading at its end we do not have 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.449
 big problems 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.299
 all funds cya 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.299
 for fun 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.029
 dampierre against 4 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.629
 crispy 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.579
 it's going to be heavy 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.479
 it's going to taste 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.019
 no more 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.479
 it's his 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.629
 we must not say it 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.629
 the joke 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.279
 the release certificate 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.889
 Why 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.889
 did these people estimate 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:37.889
 c 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.129
 cf. 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.129
 still 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:47.710
 see 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.820
 defeated by naming tried at the same time now what works more 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.379
 late 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:52.930
 as a reminder the consoles are served 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.129
 we felt that it works
