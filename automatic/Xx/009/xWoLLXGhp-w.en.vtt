nonstick<00:00:37.950> cooking<00:00:38.309> spray<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.780> take

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
nonstick cooking spray and then take

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and this process is made infinitely

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
and this process is made infinitely
easier<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.539> an<00:00:45.840> apple<00:00:46.440> corer<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
each wedge it makes I cut those yet

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.729 
each wedge it makes I cut those yet
again<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.239> half<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> size<00:00:52.230> apples

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
again in half to get the size apples

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
again in half to get the size apples
that<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.489> dish<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.840> take

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that I want for this dish and then take

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
that I want for this dish and then take
your<00:00:55.199> cake<00:00:55.440> mix<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.980> literally<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.910> do

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
your cake mix and literally all you do

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.479 
your cake mix and literally all you do
is<00:00:57.449> dump<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> top<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> apples<00:00:58.770> hence

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is dump it on top of the apples hence

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
is dump it on top of the apples hence
why<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.059> probably<00:01:00.449> called<00:01:00.750> dump<00:01:01.170> cake

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
why this is probably called dump cake

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
why this is probably called dump cake
if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> make<00:01:02.460> sure<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.760> it's
