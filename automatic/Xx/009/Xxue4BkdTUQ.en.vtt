hi there I'm Xu Rana and this is the
Wednesday<00:00:02.730> drawing<00:00:02.760> show<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.720> today<00:00:04.290> we're

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
Wednesday drawing show and today we're

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.559 
Wednesday drawing show and today we're
going<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> look<00:00:04.799> at<00:00:04.950> circles<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.700> ellipses

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
going to look at circles and ellipses

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.500 
going to look at circles and ellipses
there<00:00:07.500> are<00:00:07.560> two<00:00:07.710> very<00:00:08.069> basic<00:00:08.309> shapes<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.360> are

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
there are two very basic shapes that are

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.419 
there are two very basic shapes that are
really<00:00:09.960> good<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> understand<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.070> be<00:00:11.160> able<00:00:11.190> to

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
really good to understand and be able to

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.780 
really good to understand and be able to
draw<00:00:11.790> without<00:00:12.120> thinking<00:00:13.490> drawing<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> circle

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
draw without thinking drawing a circle

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.730 
draw without thinking drawing a circle
is<00:00:15.059> easy<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:16.109> draw<00:00:16.260> around<00:00:16.379> something

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
is easy just draw around something

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.550 
is easy just draw around something

freehand circle drawing skills if we
tilt<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.019> circle<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:29.039> will<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:29.429> how<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
tilt a circle you will see how it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.790 
tilt a circle you will see how it
changes<00:00:30.630> its<00:00:30.840> shape<00:00:30.929> into<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:32.099> ellipse<00:00:32.700> a

changes its shape into an ellipse a

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.920 
changes its shape into an ellipse a
circle<00:00:34.800> fits<00:00:35.399> neatly<00:00:35.730> into<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> square

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
circle fits neatly into a square

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
circle fits neatly into a square
touching<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> center<00:00:38.340> points<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.820> all<00:00:39.180> four

lines<00:00:39.950> now<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.160> fact<00:00:41.489> gives<00:00:41.910> us<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> great

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
lines now this fact gives us a great

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.490 
lines now this fact gives us a great
reference<00:00:42.780> point<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.860> drawing<00:00:44.190> ellipses

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
reference point when drawing ellipses

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.619 
reference point when drawing ellipses
see<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.680> happens<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.550> tilt<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.149> circle

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
see what happens when we tilt the circle

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.350 
see what happens when we tilt the circle
inside<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.469> square<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.760> still<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.210> an

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
inside the square we still get an

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
inside the square we still get an
ellipse<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> square<00:00:52.649> changes<00:00:53.219> shape

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
ellipse but the square changes shape

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.840 
ellipse but the square changes shape
either<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> rectangle<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.829> trapeze<00:00:56.280> add

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
either into a rectangle or a trapeze add

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
either into a rectangle or a trapeze add
perspective<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> becomes<00:00:58.469> an<00:00:58.739> irregular

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
perspective and it becomes an irregular

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.900 
perspective and it becomes an irregular
quadrangle<00:01:00.410> now<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> helps<00:01:01.890> us<00:01:01.980> when<00:01:02.670> trying

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
quadrangle now this helps us when trying

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.399 
quadrangle now this helps us when trying
to<00:01:03.000> draw<00:01:03.180> cylindrical<00:01:03.870> shapes<00:01:04.170> from

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
to draw cylindrical shapes from

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.480 
to draw cylindrical shapes from
different<00:01:04.860> angles<00:01:06.590> using<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.770> rectangle<00:01:08.340> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
different angles using a rectangle we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.289 
different angles using a rectangle we
can<00:01:08.670> construct<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.390> simple<00:01:09.930> cylinder<00:01:10.740> shape<00:01:11.299> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
can construct a simple cylinder shape to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.750 
can construct a simple cylinder shape to
make<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> drawing<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:12.930> interesting<00:01:13.760> rotate

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
make the drawing more interesting rotate

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.020 
make the drawing more interesting rotate
the<00:01:14.909> rectangle<00:01:15.060> into<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> diamond<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.650> shape

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
the rectangle into a diamond like shape

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.749 
the rectangle into a diamond like shape
the<00:01:18.030> shape<00:01:18.270> still<00:01:18.960> represents<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> square<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the shape still represents the square so

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.300 
the shape still represents the square so
find<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.150> visual<00:01:21.659> Centers<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> each<00:01:22.650> line<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
find the visual Centers of each line and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
find the visual Centers of each line and
use<00:01:23.549> those<00:01:23.820> points<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.659> construct<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
use those points to construct the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.399 
use those points to construct the
ellipse<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.340> new<00:01:26.580> more<00:01:27.409> three-dimensional
