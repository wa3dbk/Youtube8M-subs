00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 with a part a section that is a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.520
 no classic 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 in consciousness that has Mr. director 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.649
 he is going to present it in this way 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.830
 favor 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.549
 yes logically fair just the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.070
 classics of always those dishes of the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.650
 grandmother of the mother of the aunt of still life 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.890
 from the canteen of the whole avenue we are going to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.289
 make some steps to the sailor 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 let's clarify so come here 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.710
 for this meat cut in this way and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.010
 so thin as that for relatives 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.010
 of a meat for Milanese to this is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.309
 call escalope beyond how you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 you will prepare classically if you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.000
 you prepare custom - made table 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.600
 turns into a milanesa but the cut 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600
 of the flesh 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.660
 the infinite thin cut 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 traditionally passes it back and forth 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.810
 for flour and throw it to butter or 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.760
 oil 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.160
 and after putting marching the iii has 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.010
 the state permarch to which they are now the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.050
 sailor and it is called the marinera tenÃ©s 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.510
 to do the marinera and will help me 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.210
 the sailor begins to beat the eggs 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.370
 we'll put a little salt tiqui 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.980
 tiqui first the show there is already 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.230
 it's split he added a girl spoonful 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.680
 stirring as we gave charge and a 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.220
 little more and also he cited a what 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.280
 it would be a clove of garlic 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.410
 writing some parsley is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.590
 injured a lot of flavor yes and that is not 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.550
 missing 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.350
 then exam 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.540
 in the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 with the speed 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.680
 the aggregate of flour do not clump 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.810
 even has a good paste in two 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.810
 parts 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 d 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 m 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.630
 once the sailor then told me 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.740
 you grab the step that is that cut 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.740
 thin meat 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.720
 go through the mosque and leave it there is a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 so much melts 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.280
 really the escalope goes through the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.790
 marinera and from there it jumps violet to 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.790
 hot oil 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:43.200
 that is the difference we approach 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.860
 and the absolutely trio oil does not have 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.860
 be a little 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.140
 the temperature of the oil if it is 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.980
 too loud you're going to burn 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.980
 the marinera 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.859
 cadista again the little cork to do 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.590
 because I want to control and help the 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:19.959
 temperature of seeing m 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 when a lot of procuring the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.700
 oil life 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.700
 very hot 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.709
 very good with the future of the uses 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.640
 of a crescent bubble 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.130
 for then it's that way to scale it creates the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.310
 sailor a classic always go 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.590
 to serve with a purÃ©e quoted from potatoes 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.090
 flavored with this a few years and we 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.430
 let's go to the break listening to the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.360
 of fire and with the grace of the company 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.960
 plane of saints 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.960
 and they are coming back
