this<00:01:00.359> okay<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> proposed<00:01:03.899> model<00:01:04.140> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
this okay and the the proposed model is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
this okay and the the proposed model is
that<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:06.000> scratch<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.840> the

that you get a little scratch on the

that you get a little scratch on the

inside of a normal arterial wall and the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
endothelial cells get a slight injury

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.469

and<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.830> proposed<00:01:14.189> mechanism<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.090> sugar

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and it proposed mechanism is a sugar

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.170 
and it proposed mechanism is a sugar

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
body they come along because it's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310

oxidized<00:01:56.189> LDL<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> LDL<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
oxidized LDL of the LDL they go in and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.050 
oxidized LDL of the LDL they go in and
they<00:01:58.380> try<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.649> consume<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.790> they<00:01:59.880> can

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
they try and consume that so they can

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.179 
they try and consume that so they can
but<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:00.869> become<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.380> bloated<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.130> they

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
but they become like bloated and they

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.350 
but they become like bloated and they
can't<00:02:02.399> move<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.820> become<00:02:03.090> what's<00:02:03.299> called

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
can't move they become what's called

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.100 
can't move they become what's called
foam<00:02:03.719> cells<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:06.060> coppa<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.570> been<00:02:06.750> shown

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
foam cells so the coppa has been shown

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.300 
foam cells so the coppa has been shown
to<00:02:07.829> inhibit<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.520> oxidization<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.810> LDL<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
to inhibit the oxidization of LDL or the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.450 
to inhibit the oxidization of LDL or the
LDL<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
LDL so

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.900 
LDL so
can<00:02:12.610> almost<00:02:12.940> break<00:02:13.210> that<00:02:13.540> step<00:02:13.930> okay<00:02:14.910> which

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
can almost break that step okay which

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.320 
can almost break that step okay which
then<00:02:17.070> prevents<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.370> macrophages<00:02:18.880> coming

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
then prevents the macrophages coming

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.450 
then prevents the macrophages coming
along<00:02:19.540> trying<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.050> consume<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> LDL<00:02:21.070> not

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
along trying to consume the LDL not

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.310 
along trying to consume the LDL not
being<00:02:21.670> able<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.940> move<00:02:22.150> afterwards<00:02:22.720> becoming

so<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.520> consume<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.150> lot<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.300> cholesterol<00:02:40.840> and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
so just consume a lot of cholesterol and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.560 
so just consume a lot of cholesterol and
now<00:02:41.590> they're<00:02:41.770> oxidizing<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.550> by<00:02:43.090> smoking<00:02:43.450> the

have a bacopa they would be 100 percent

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.300 
have a bacopa they would be 100 percent
fine<00:02:49.660> but<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.410> can<00:02:50.590> see<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.980> link<00:02:51.160> between

the two as a say an extreme example

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.600 
the two as a say an extreme example
because<00:02:53.470> they<00:02:53.530> eat<00:02:53.650> fast<00:02:53.950> food<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.340> having<00:02:54.580> a

more health-conscious amongst us I would

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.190 
more health-conscious amongst us I would
suggest<00:03:02.710> that<00:03:03.010> bacopa<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.940> going<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.750> be<00:03:04.870> quite

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
suggest that bacopa is going to be quite

now<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:07.960> could<00:03:08.350> say<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.710> hey<00:03:08.860> I'll<00:03:09.010> take

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
now you could say that hey I'll take

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.890 
now you could say that hey I'll take

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
their antioxidant products of course I

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.720 
their antioxidant products of course I
used<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.190> be<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> big<00:03:45.460> believer<00:03:45.640> in

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730

used to be a big believer in

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
antioxidants I still believe in them but

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.180 
antioxidants I still believe in them but
they<00:03:47.590> need<00:03:47.740> to<00:03:47.830> be<00:03:47.920> pulsed<00:03:48.430> now<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.130> you

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
they need to be pulsed now so that you

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.700 
they need to be pulsed now so that you
don't<00:03:51.430> cause<00:03:51.610> down-regulation<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.470> then<00:03:53.590> you

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
don't cause down-regulation and then you

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.500 
don't cause down-regulation and then you
can<00:03:53.860> use<00:03:53.980> something<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:54.280> n-acetylcysteine

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
can use something like n-acetylcysteine

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.320 
can use something like n-acetylcysteine
which<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.590> an<00:03:56.680> amino<00:03:56.800> acid<00:03:57.310> which<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.000> the
