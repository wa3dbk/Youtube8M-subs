00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.000

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.989
 clearstream investigation say stream 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.489
 it's a clearing house 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.710
 based in luxembourg which was 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.450
 then unknown to the general public and of which he 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.190
 denounced the unrest 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.480
 today everyone in France 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.430
 know clearstream it became 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.760
 obviously synonymous with state scandal 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.410
 ten years of legal battle 60 inches 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.750

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.340

 also among your fellow members the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.380
 middle of the press and then a flash and 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.030
 then the night after ten years is the 3 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.830
 February 2011 is still fresh 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 very recent agreement of cassation you 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.890
 definitely board and recognize 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.390
 in your work your work then 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.390
 journalist and investigators 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.380
 there is internet what here they can 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.900
 nothing against the internet yet they can 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.040
 nothing nickname but they will not be able to do anything 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.320
 can do all the laws that fly 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.000
 Thursday makes them bother what he there they 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.410
 will not happen to me when I saw 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.670
 franÃ§ois hollande to the bourget attacks 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
 finance by train etc 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.420
 I think you're not bad but I 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.680
 felt big blow of bluff more 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.940
 there they earn a lot 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 elections because in front they had 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.340
 a sarkozy on the history of banks there 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.750
 was shabby 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.430
 for now we do not give a damn about this 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.470
 that they are paradises that's 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.360
 speech it was a way of being 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.100
 in power if he really had a 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.750
 strong political will to fight 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.760
 the tax havens they had they had 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.990
 any latitude to make it a point 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.550
 economic point of view it's a disaster 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.440
 at the level of the paper press this is 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.470
 obvious sales of weight down from 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.320
 16% or one and quarter 7 loeb his 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.540
 death of 14 and the express that made our 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.860
 raises to 17.10 release in a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.270
 catastrophic situation 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.190
 is the fact that journalists 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.540
 does not present the number correctly 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.280
 or playfully my game 2 28 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.270
 capture points of the journalist or a 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.160
 lack of information 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.750
 but of course fadel 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.720
 our question when there is the answer 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.110
 that the financial press is undoubtedly 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.100
 the most beleaguered press and they 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.960
 be to the banks and the sewers so 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.910
 financial journalism 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.950
 maybe I have to say our 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.660
 lapidary in my words but does exist 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.740
 not we see that behind there 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.310
 pressure groups of groups of 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.410
 press and it is that one is of a 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.210
 generally bombarded with a 10's 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.860
 stock market figure and / or who are 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.390
 completely falsified there is a species 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.680
 big lie around all this and 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.200
 I do not believe in the contest I do not think 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.420
 all this but I know very well that these 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.150
 newspapers are paid by by arnaud by 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.500
 pino by bullets from the east and by 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.270
 banks is that there are advertisers and 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.070
 who has all this is that and that we can not 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.840
 displease what and I see them with 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.300
 clearstream it was the ultimate you 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.850
 you are bombarded with lawsuits and in fine 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.890
 and even if you win you lose what 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.330
 newspaper publishers a journalist 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.820
 and antes so scared now 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.960
 of the same over to lose lawsuits but 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.490
 they are afraid of lawsuits because the 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.050
 procedures that handles makes sure that they 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.900
 were obviously there is self-censorship 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.790
 there is censorship and that is dramatic 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.620
 FERC vizag to talk about it 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.570
 showed that locusts 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.800
 as for a strong journalistic will 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.780
 you manage to overthrow powers on 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.920
 would like your opinion on the sphere 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.950
 snowdon 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.480
 yes I find it incredible that France 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.459
 was not to give us asia 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.870
 would you have done yourself justice but here we are 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.910
 in geopolitics we are in the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.709
 realpolitik and so that's it 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.950
 does not attack the United States with impunity 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.630
 what these people are doing politics but 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.310
 they do not do politics so who did not 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.500
 no courage they have no 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.790
 and they are selling their souls 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.440
 they lost they are in the process of 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.030
 lose lose all the battles 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.000
 there is internet what here they can 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.669
 nothing against the internet yet a proof 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.260
 nothing nickname me for nothing they can 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.910
 do all the laws they want I 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.419
 say by reading shit what are they there 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.419
 will not arrive 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.180
 this crisis us it's just a year its 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.610
 particular program a plan more 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.140
 generally it is seen named fits 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.230
 besides in the heavy weight a 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.400
 expedition 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.470
 neither the Russians nor the Chinese do not have 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.660
 want the UN to turn into a 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.410
 machine to give the good and the bad 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.410
 governance points
