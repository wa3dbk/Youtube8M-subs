Greta<00:05:51.770> I<00:05:52.100> noticed<00:05:52.910> that<00:05:53.030> you<00:05:53.090> never<00:05:53.270> use<00:05:53.480> a

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
Greta I noticed that you never use a

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.380 
Greta I noticed that you never use a
glass<00:05:53.780> pan<00:05:57.280> why<00:05:58.280> do<00:05:58.340> I<00:05:58.490> choose<00:05:58.730> metal<00:05:59.180> over

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
glass pan why do I choose metal over

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.720 
glass pan why do I choose metal over
glass<00:05:59.750> baking<00:06:00.140> pans<00:06:00.530> because<00:06:01.130> glass<00:06:01.400> has<00:06:01.700> a

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
glass baking pans because glass has a

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.120
