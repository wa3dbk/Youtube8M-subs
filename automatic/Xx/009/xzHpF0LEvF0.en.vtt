00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.040
 good day 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.230
 we recently had a chance 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.230
 to make such an order is a ladder 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.539
 closing zabezhnymi steps and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.529
 it became necessary to do as well 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.019
 inside under the steps to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.230
 do these on the step I did 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 small such device 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.399
 who use many carpenters for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 different needs but in this situation i'm here 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.290
 used it to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.899
 it was bend the stairs 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.899
 or misdemeanors as others say 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.880
 adaptation this represents 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.640
 here is such a box as I said 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.670
 you can use it for many carpenters 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.100
 see and on the channel in ermolke wich and 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.000
 alexander timoshkin and they use them 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.640
 for different needs 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.290
 this situation, I decided to use it 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.110
 in order to make notches 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.990
 on under the steps to the same depth 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.320
 with the same distance 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.240
 this he is a piece of chipboard 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.430
 you guide which falls into the groove 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.930
 on circulars and two daughters 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.380
 the only thing that I did is from behind 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.119
 this gadget 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.460
 screwed just such a little boss planted 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.119
 on glue in order to randomly when 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.280
 cutting the thumb did not go here 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:58.840
 drop in here not now I will show you 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.460
 just a couple of seconds as we climb 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.950
 even had to say what is here from the slot 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.410
 on the right, on the left, I marked up on that 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.750
 the distance that i need to 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.780
 I cut it to be the same 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.090
 I bent to the same and this 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.090
 the situation is 15 millimeters 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.180
 move 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.180
 let me check 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.879
 to cut one half because I have 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.739
 here final can right so far I 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.129
 simply turn to another 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.480
 side I crawl in a heap 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.659
 As a result, we have 45 millimeters left 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.269
 slotted 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.430
 which allows in general under 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.530
 a certain degree bend under 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:21.190
 step when it is completely cut 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.440
 it bends much easier 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.910
 adaptation can and ready after all 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.140
 every each person even working 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.660
 absolutely small workshops and on 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.660
