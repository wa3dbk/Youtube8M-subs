 hello hello here with vladi and good 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.130
 today I bring you this video about marvin 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:11.400
 dotcom page number one about 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.970
 auctions the small print let's say that of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.490
 this page that everyone believes is the 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.750
 auction these are a penny and it's not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.940
 so you bid a penny but in reality 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.210
 you spend a lot more good I'm going to 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.810
 really explain this page how it is 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 is worth seeing matt beech against auctions 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.810
 habitual up to 80 percent of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 discounts that's a lie what 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.489
 I will demonstrate below the video are 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.460
 the new products man that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.950
 honestly it had to be that way because if 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.100
 no this would be even more scam than that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.129
 It is already auction without price reservation 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.910
 truth free of return charges 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.410
 discounts buy them now if you pay 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.820
 sure also to see here 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.290
 let's see many things that we 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.650
 for we would think that this is 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.320
 continued the uff would be an incredible luck 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.330
 have been able to win these things for 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.070
 example one 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.040
 a trip index a week in the sum 327 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.940
 ok but now we will see the other side of 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.890
 this is the good face of matt 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.280
 beat puntocom although now let's see 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.410
 the face marks me here I am with my 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.740
 account I have three credits that are 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.720
 daily credits that I'm playing because 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.210
 because look, I feel like 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.190
 to see mainly to play in this 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.030
 madrid page we have to recharge 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.910
 credits is valid and is that the truth is that 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.420
 the scam comes here look at pay 50 euros 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.960
 for 400 credits it is worth and for what purpose 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.360
 these credits well for to do the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.810
 the bets in the auctions are worth 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.390
 we go here and we can push no and to 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.179
 Bid here minimum or be good to bid 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.420
 a penny of just a penny you have to 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.200
 put eight credits eight of these 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.840
 credits then you spend 25 50 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.770
 no euros and that you start for example 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.260
 you start from a penny you were not going 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.410
 You put gambling, you look, what does one put 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.050
 now two cents 34 and is following 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.810
 doing it you will not gain anything nothing 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.080
 more when the price is super high and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.500
 you are very lucky and you bet 23 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.420
 times and you win something is that there are really 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.319
 is when you 're not wrong but it 's 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.290
 almost impossible because this page does not 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.689
 if it had not been done for that to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.749
 lose to lose money to people 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:57.980
 it would not have been done you know then let's go 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:03:00.260
 to see some closed auctions go ha 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.209
 there were auctions that I've seen that I've 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.920
 seen in the morning and I at night 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.019
 that is, if you bet you are betting 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.420
 betting then you lose all your 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.340
 money and above you do not gain anything in our 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.919
 you have to go with a lot of much 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.109
 for example head is worth much we will 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:20.599
 this lg nexus 5 with 16 gigabytes are worth 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.540
 in a new fucking mother phone as I already 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.359
 he says it's worth but here where he puts 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.550
 bid history look that boyle has 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.900
 spent 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.990
 aido has spent a quantity of his 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.430
 credits then he has spent 34 euros 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.890
 with 2 with 2 cents in really in the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.920
 more product what has been betting 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:53.260
 here then it will have spent about 160 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.180
 180 euros we go that then the mobile is 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.130
 it really does not come out at this price this 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.410
 price is only to fool people 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.140
 to come to this page you win something 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.630
 but with a lot of head and good luck for 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.340
 example the liverpool this liverpool has 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.620
 lost but has bid a lot of money and 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.630
 then he has lost all his money is 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.210
 luck this page is like any 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.140
 another lottery you can bet and 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.580
 to lose we go is a casino worth you enter 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.639
 a casino where he does is lose the 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.889
 money the only thing you do 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.780
 then this page does not suit you 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.419
 that people win and that's why they've 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.700
 open then yes no if the people 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.900
 would win like this so it would close 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.689
 to see first 30 and these cents are 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.379
 the gains also for him 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:45.219
 for page 34,000 as two people 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:47.680
 have entered this page then I 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:50.129
 I'm winning a lot 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.990
 but really for me 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:59.380
 this is a conforming pardon without saying 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.080
 well explained more or less everything that 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.470
 it's a scam we're that clear and nothing 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.210
 I hope to see you in my next video of 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.230
 anything else we see in the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.230
 next goodbye
