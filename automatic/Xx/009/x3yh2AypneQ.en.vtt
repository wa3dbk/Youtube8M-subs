00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
name-brand products and it's not just

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.990 
name-brand products and it's not just
because<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.930> his<00:00:28.140> pricing<00:00:28.820> here<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:29.910> my

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
is quite remarkable to the case that

smaller than a 1 RMB coin in diameter
and<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.940> ensures<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.570> balance<00:00:52.230> between

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and that ensures a balance between

and that ensures a balance between
sizing<00:00:52.980> accessibility<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.789> control<00:00:54.829> as<00:00:55.829> for

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the headphone part I can say that it can

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
easily fit in anybody's ears but for me

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.510 
easily fit in anybody's ears but for me
it's<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.379> size<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.160> length

it's the right size and the right length

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
it's the right size and the right length

and let's go on with some of the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
features I found noteworthy first I will

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.849 
features I found noteworthy first I will
start<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.390> his<00:01:57.539> ability<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> connect<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.560> an

from a single earbud to a dual one this
is<00:02:04.829> perhaps<00:02:05.039> not<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.459> most<00:02:05.670> value<00:02:06.240> adding

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is perhaps not the most value adding

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.539 
is perhaps not the most value adding

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
personally and I have a pair of Java

personally and I have a pair of Java
Rob's<00:02:10.979> Wireless<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.970> many<00:02:12.120> cases<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.660> would

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
Rob's Wireless and in many cases I would

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080 
Rob's Wireless and in many cases I would
just<00:02:13.019> want<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.769> single<00:02:14.190> ear<00:02:14.489> but<00:02:14.700> on

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
just want to have one single ear but on

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.600 
just want to have one single ear but on
but<00:02:15.870> since<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> two<00:02:16.440> earbuds<00:02:16.890> are<00:02:17.010> connected

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
but since the two earbuds are connected

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.240 
but since the two earbuds are connected
permanently<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:18.599> they<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:19.319> separable<00:02:19.980> I

permanently and they are not separable I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.430 
permanently and they are not separable I
will<00:02:20.880> always<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:21.420> bear<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.870> weight<00:02:22.019> of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
will always have to bear the weight of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.860 
will always have to bear the weight of
both<00:02:22.829> metal<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:23.819> sabar<00:02:24.090> only<00:02:24.390> need<00:02:24.599> one

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
both metal here but sabar only need one

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.250 
both metal here but sabar only need one
and<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:26.640> looks<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.060> trophies<00:02:27.750> build<00:02:27.989> our

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260

well<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:28.980> problem<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.670> they<00:02:30.090> have

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
well with this problem and they have

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.910 
well with this problem and they have
come<00:02:30.480> up<00:02:30.599> with<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.930> cost-effective

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
come up with this cost-effective

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.550 
come up with this cost-effective
solution<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.810> right<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.110> would<00:02:34.319> like<00:02:34.410> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
solution and right here I would like to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.350 
solution and right here I would like to
point<00:02:34.769> out<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.129> even<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.819> additional

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
point out that even with the additional

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.199 
point out that even with the additional
air<00:02:36.599> but<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.920> whole<00:02:38.160> pair<00:02:38.459> still<00:02:38.879> feel

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
air but on the whole pair still feel

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.600 
air but on the whole pair still feel
weightless<00:02:39.920> apart<00:02:40.920> from<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.220> extra

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
weightless apart from the extra

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.039 
weightless apart from the extra
headphone<00:02:42.060> there<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.450> also<00:02:42.629> another

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
headphone there is also another

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.750 
headphone there is also another
noteworthy<00:02:43.560> feature<00:02:43.950> which<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.549> Dru

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
noteworthy feature which is the Dru

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.699 
noteworthy feature which is the Dru
connectivity<00:02:45.480> meaning<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.079> headphone<00:02:46.440> can

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
connectivity meaning the headphone can

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.500 
connectivity meaning the headphone can
connect<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.099> two<00:02:47.310> devices<00:02:47.489> at<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.060> same<00:02:48.090> time

connect to two devices at the same time
I<00:02:49.220> personally<00:02:50.220> don't<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.430> much<00:02:50.730> use<00:02:50.760> for

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I personally don't have much use for

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.759 
I personally don't have much use for
this<00:02:51.360> feature<00:02:51.599> but<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.440> yet<00:02:52.590> another

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
this feature but this is yet another

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.740 
this feature but this is yet another
value<00:02:53.370> adding<00:02:53.730> point<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.180> those<00:02:54.359> who<00:02:54.569> have
