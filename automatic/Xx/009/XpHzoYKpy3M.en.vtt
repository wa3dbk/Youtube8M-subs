00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 let's calculate the integral 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:14.440
 of x root party x minus one of x 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.020
 well the first thing that bothers me about this 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.820
 integral is this network is an integral not 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.380
 any expression appears in roots 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.670
 without roots is simpler than with 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.370
 estate 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.590
 so that there does not appear a 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.630
 root would interest us that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.070
 so that the root disappears what 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.170
 inside out a square because when 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.510
 with root goes then let's do the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.910
 change x equal to squared because 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.870
 then we have t squares within 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.449
 the root 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.040
 so if x is equal to square 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.989
 we will have that x will be the same as the derivative 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.960
 of x would be the derivative of t squared that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.329
 would be 2 t for the derivative always of the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.460
 inside 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.220
 we are going to substitute this to see what 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.860
 happens 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:11.290
 x this picture root party of root xa 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.440
 of this square minus 1 x which is 2 t of 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.440
 t 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.940
 then here we will have 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.940
 t square for 2 t2 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.260
 and root with block observes we have less 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.800
 one 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.800
 t 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.450
 then this is an integral where no 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.979
 more roots there are no roots therefore 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.630
 it seems simpler than the initial 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.420
 then the change will have to be undone 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.969
 we have a quotient of polynomials for 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.909
 do this what you do is divide the 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.909
 numerator between the denominator 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.470
 these integrals when roots appear 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.690
 they are called irrational not to divide 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.170
 this 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.170
 let's look at the highest grade 2 t square 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:16.650
 2 t 4 x - 1 - 2 t square 2 t block 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.650
 carry this cube we change the sign 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.349
 we have two square t left but you're leaving 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.099
 but we keep dividing 2t squares 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.099
 between t 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.329
 2 t left 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.750
 we have here you that we about this 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.750
 much 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.890
 then 2 t for less 1 - 2 and 2 sports 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.310
 squares of squares we change from 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.310
 sign 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.410
 but this remains and we do the same thing again 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:13.530
 same 2 t 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:16.950
 / you have 222 depot -1 2 and 2 for forgiveness 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.980
 2 for less some minus 22 porte 23 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.370
 we change the sign 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.750
 we have two we know that always 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.209
 We make a division by dividing 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.060
 saves divisor by quotient plus rest 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.210
 if we put you by divider dividing 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.550
 mink party 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.990
 is equal to divisor by conscious 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.810
 party of issuers we are dividing 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.060
 all for you 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.920
 since I am this goes away we are left 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.830
 conscious more rest splitter party 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.440
 where is dividing splitter party that 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.220
 let's see what we have here is 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.019
 let's just put it dividend match 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.019
 Divider is the same 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:08.450
 to quotient 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.870
 that was 2 t square 2 t2 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.410
 more rest of vision party that is 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.320
 minus one 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.989
 then this is this is what we have 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.829
 within the integral therefore here 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.259
 we will have 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.530
 this cube was left at least one party that 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:28.150
 is this here is 2 t squares the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.090
 integral to this would be integral to this 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.389
 plus the integral of this we put 2 t 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.530
 square plus two plus two 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:41.379
 dt what is that integral is immediate more 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.810
 and now two games minus one of t that 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.759
 it is also immediate is a logarithm 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.900
 then we will have the integral of two of 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.419
 square would be 2 cube split by 3 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.810
 more the integral of all this would be two 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.919
 of four parties two square lots 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.680
 plus two of which is the integral of two and 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.830
 now more the rate of this is one 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.070
 that would be from rivas as I jump out 2 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.639
 Neperian logarithm of absolute value 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.000
 of t minus one more and we'll have to take 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.490
 the integral counted but we the 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.990
 we want with x then you have to undo 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.039
 the change we have made at the beginning 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.949
 with the t here we will have to spend 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.520
 squared the other part as the root x 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.639
 It does not matter 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.190
 apte then if we replace that there 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:38.490
 where do we put you root of x do we have 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.760
 2 cube 2 wright of x raised to cube 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.820
 match for three 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.670
 more than square root x squared 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.480
 root of x squared square root yx 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:56.390
 and the square they go we would stay x more 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:06:00.140
 two issues two reis px now plus two the 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:04.320
 neperian logarithm of t which is root of 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:07.110
 x minus one more 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.320
 we have undone the change and this would be the 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.110
 value of the integral that we were raised 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.070
 as an exercise because the following is left 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:23.580
 do the integral of x party root 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:26.430
 cubic tx - 1st of x first of all we 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.010
 we will pose what change to make 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.440
 and once we make the change 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.450
 we substitute everything we do the integral and 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.310
 once we have calculated integral in 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.530
 function of t we undo the change 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.530
 we have the value of the integral
