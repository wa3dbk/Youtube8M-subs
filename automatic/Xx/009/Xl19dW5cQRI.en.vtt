00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.949
 It was important that we believed in Munz from the beginning 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:05.949
 MÃ¼ller from one of a misfortune in the game 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.450
 Of questionable choices, we did not throw percent off track 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.750
 let and the sex in the half fell after the 2 0 and stood where I say 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.560
 now here is Predator the front runner is nothing more 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.170
 but the effort at all Norman Diehl get the solution to go outside 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.250
 Although now scoring a goal and then will be too 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.699
 This will also make the opponent nervous. That's exactly what has happened and therefore 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.430
 have what Pallas percent luminous total deserved result as we do 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.910
 occurred here that was very good and percent especially what comes to it 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.730
 that's just why I'm the hero's father 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.000
 from this gameplay and even the damn that is often happened 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.210
 that he misses 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.210
 after 2 2 the water did not quite push back on that we the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.730
 Opponents also in the phase then hardly any chances admitted 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.040
 I think I will 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.910
 he does not go because she does not get ripped off by the light that does it right 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.230
 Good and now calls the AuM of other 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 on sunday only then do you realize the screed process step 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.500
 place 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.260
 how should that be? 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.230
 important is being led we are very happy he gave a bad start 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.340
 was later learned and around 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.590
 so before that said if Werder want to meet me demands then 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.450
 live differently and have progressed through the visit of them round 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.670
 we knew a goal 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.510
 by Bernie titles 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.280
 and van Bommel 2 2 Kabul AFP broadcasts to perform about 15 was playable 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.940
 in the end, the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.280
 make an entry but put an end 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 the Andernacher also the not only ten minutes was also to play 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.990
 but we have to keep fighting we have to keep working 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990
 not that we happen again in Cottbus name of the authors 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.829
 At the end thought since we did it the novel was open at the back and this time 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.850
 the business percent at the last moment because everything went wrong and wants 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.340
 yes and more and more bans 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.650
 Wednesday 4 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.650
 six years ago Dreier already in Cologne equal situation 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.920
 Neumann so also with gloves and Black Forest the light was indeed happy 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.200
 Pauli should not spared the loot end I already had in the 4 me 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.049
 that already has a murder 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.099
 LR Toni Schruf the district Euro 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.369
 stand for 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:14.939
 very rough until the end 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.799
 the accused coincidences had last full and the water and that 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.399
 should give us courage and just show 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:25.379
 what you percent who you have to do what you need to be successful in order to succeed 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.249
 "What that can do can only be positive
