00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.279
 well we will resume where 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.910
 we stayed to return to 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.119
 our history 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.480
 what did the sailor shadoks become the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:41.589
 cosmo bus the jbe and the cosmo moon 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.930
 after leaving the earth it's not 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.510
 very clear that finally I see it you 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.260
 remains a movie there on your desk you 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.670
 can we the past we refer to it is 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.550
 at the castle ah yes obviously it's 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:09.280
 annoying yes but I can translate you 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:12.429
 know I usually agree the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.330
 shadoks caravelle bases the space and the 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:18.520
 land gradually disappearing after 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.909
 five to six weeks we perceived by the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.530
 through a drifting cellar 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.210
 it was the moon with the three 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.369
 unhappy abandoned shadoks who 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.369
 was crying like madeleines is for 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.720
 two days later it was the cosmo 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:51.780
 buses and big-headed shadoks have 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 drafted and then after guess who and yes 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.560
 the gy be he had broken down 2 to 6 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.570
 may like bacon a shadok did not have 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.689
 of grudge and that anyway he 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.320
 had forgotten he his valet jbe also by 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.320
 on the market 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.060
 and like all these adventures there 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.340
 was pretty tired 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.700
 they decided each other 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.230
 that they would go on vacation rests 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.599
 the sailor says he knew precisely 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.940
 a planet specifically for that where he was doing 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.940
 always tip is always hot 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.970
 that's how shadoks and egypt 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.970
 a day a very long time ago 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.260
 took the path of the holiday planet 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.690
 and test the case on the solar and the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.910
 sailor who had saved them all terminal 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.790
 story on one of those old maxims 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.970
 which he had the secret is still 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.970
 in the navy that there is the most harm
