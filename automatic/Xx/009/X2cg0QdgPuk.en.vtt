00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.039

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.500

 it says yes, we'll see you now 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.909
 equal to the live test until the same 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.619
 we are in the game now it is natural 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.009
 again with minecraft beta mind that 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.470
 his 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.190
 The mouse is also very good in the hand 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.320
 very smooth edged to basically 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.380
 the tabletop runs let the who 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.240
 Hello hello, this is very big and big 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.520
 you really have no resistance so 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.250
 not what I like to 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.290
 mouse but as super super great 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.269
 it works well and click that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.959
 not always so clique is not that loud 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.120
 very quiet 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.989
 the mausrad turns really right 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.800
 Well that's it was really so fell 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.470
 I now have two more next to me 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.350
 the left mouse button 102 buttons and for 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.050
 the thumb, we also have 200, 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.120
 that means it still prove and the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.160
 surfaces now generally thumb and 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.970
 from little fingers are super good 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.410
 I can also do a little bit 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.299
 So you can see faster 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.100
 mum faster sometimes faster and it 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.930
 are very slow to do very slowly 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.549
 No that's that's now so the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.170
 They are not fast for me now 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.600
 I also have weight 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.070
 i have shown yes fucked up ruby 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600
 exactly the same and first and also 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.640
 Giant too soon and I satisfied myself 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.530
 very people I am honest with you 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.610

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.930

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.160
 I would say that but she is 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.420
 really great so I have them in the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
 hand in the hand 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.540
 I also no longer a cramp 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.400
 little finger as it was before 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.290
 always was and leon blocks away built the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.620

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.890
 in the camera is super gau is like 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.290
 I really like it very much 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.760
 and you can probably right here 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.959
 you can pack in the weights here 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.690
 wrap up 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.709
 and 6 this is my first gaming mouse 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.600

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.840

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.410
 really far that you can right here 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.090
 lay down 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.340
 it hinders not when it 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.510
 just the keyboard goes or something like that 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.900
 Somehow a little resistance means 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.930

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.209
