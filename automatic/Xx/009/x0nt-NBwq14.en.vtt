00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.110
 then all guys with this new one 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.879
 ios and therefore not sa player view before 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.890
 social initiatives serve credit but 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.720
 its points are reliable are 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.759
 series pay you if there are problems 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.080
 call us or simply on 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.660
 their facebook page is enough 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.730
 quick to respond 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.160
 having said that we pass to the same level as it is today 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.410
 the dear old marco reus old 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.800
 promoters say dear because it is expensive share 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.320
 cost on the 80 heads of having operated 82 and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.269
 I resold it 82.8 must be 4,000 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.580
 credits to make you this fantastic of 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.500
 god but i am satisfied because why 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.030
 a player that I liked throughout 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.409
 honesty 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.729
 you will then see a vote review that 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.440
 I gave him but basically a 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.729
 player who is worth the credits that 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.110
 you spend 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.330
 but this is precisely what I will explain later 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.680
 why make you two reviews in a row because 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.540
 for the gaming doctor angel wait 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.729
 a little bit as I have to find again 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.619
 first is the style of play I had 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.059
 before the Christmas holidays to do it 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.310
 I need some time for some games 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.290
 Scazzi so you probably won't have them 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.060
 I will show unless it's promotions 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.439
 in another of maximum cooked this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.479
 small detail will soon return as well 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.300
 born email peak we will do some 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.260
 way of the match so time is 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.540
 will fill in another way 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.290
 as usual I share the votes in 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.090
 dribbling and passing speed is in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.860
 head is already a reason to test the foot shot 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.440
 as you are already seeing from the bandit a little 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.420
 from passing speed flag 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.180
 I gave him an 8 because we see it 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.230
 from the city foot now start ie second 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.140
 me royce 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.610
 I put you as a global vote 8 but here 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.050
 many of you is not that up because if there 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.240
 gives the global vote for all three things 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.950
 then cyclically separately because 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.690
 basically I think the vote 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.450
 global the one that should interest you 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.770
 this player at 5 of global 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.210
 this global sense 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.950
 obviously it means that the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.050
 features they have on a harmonica 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.030
 and between them though if I put them 8 it wants 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.920
 say that the player pushed moves 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.510
 however, it is always better 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.040
 specify which of the three bars 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.229
 certainly taken into consideration 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.090
 more than the others in 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.099
 First of all, let's happily review the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.470
 speed because because the player is 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.019
 Quick and fast it definitely has a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.540
 very very much acceleration 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.040
 important succeeds calmly to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.530
 take the ball and keep it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.569
 during the entire period of the race 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.920
 so without the ball and with the balls on your feet 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.829
 and this one thing girls that few 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.689
 until now I managed to find myself in 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.430
 few players as players 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.219
 usually with direct and ball the ball to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.040
 so they slow down for no reason 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.709
 instead it tends to slow down but really 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.989
 just do not realize it even further 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.670
 passing all this to dribble 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.200
 speed and with all this capacity of 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.030
 keep the ball at the foot of the race 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.280
 you can easily do the three 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.599
 emilia for the first time maybe not for 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.299
 the second time 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.730
 I'm happy with the player I have between 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.379
 hands after sanchez you can 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.720
 quietly dribbling 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.510
 when you want whatever you want 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.489
 movement you can do to make him 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 it does so from this point of view 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.389
 of dots statute the dribbling of the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.280
 visit is a fantastic player 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.810
 you will surely succeed if you drift a 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.180
 make the most of it 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.859
 I don't recommend using it as an exterior 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.109
 because it's wasted it has a great shot 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.169
 primis advice used as external but 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.909
 as a left striker then to the 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.489
 ronaldo to understand the life player 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.440
 to as many many satisfactions as 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.810
 passages instead guys the vote yes 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.489
 it lowers a bit because I noticed 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.659
 that often so player 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.489
 it doesn't have a great power of often like 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.440
 if he took the land instead of the ball 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.659
 I don't know why the game was 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 I made difficult passages though 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.959
 I noticed this many players 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.620
 make the steps in any condition 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.310
 possible 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.169
 one out of all xabi alonso while he doesn't 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.540
 I know rounds turned for example of 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.940
 the passage will be slow in doing so 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.069
 when he is with the ball stopped in the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.500
 to start again and make the transition is a bit 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.819
 I didn't like this thing slow 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.150
 much so that is why he does not have 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.099
 had like a 9 or even more on 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.510
 I don't like passages so much though 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.430
 how could you see some clips 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.229
 however we are talking about a player who 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.430
 in long passages in short passages 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.959
 gets along 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 the important thing is they do not put in conditions 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.829
 difficult to do it by passing on 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.060
 I put the dancer of the shooting vote 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.970
 also here goes the sincere because of 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.889
 test that of foot as you notice of 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.790
 head put a shot of half past six 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.100
 foot 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.480
 the why part between the team that depart 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.660
 now why banal in my opinion why the 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.490
 player in itself is a player who 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.340
 exploits a lot of his skills from 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.080
 sprinter though also a great shot 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.200
 useless to go around it then second 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.570
 me a player who can surely do them 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.510
 give satisfactions at the level of shots 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.520
 foot then use it by centralizing ways 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.900
 not going outside because they are there 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.580
 players who definitely have a 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.480
 excellent dribbling certainly noticeable from 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.670
 but not a good shot 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.800
 in that case use as external he who 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.530
 instead it is the opposite of these players 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.990
 you tend to make it come back, keep it 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.550
 to center in short used as for 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.290
 no you can say unfortunately ciocci 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.310
 because it is not and it will never be found 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.620
 however, she is sure of a player 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.210
 interesting as a striker 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.210
 the leading trio took only half 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.920
 because because it is too light said 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.100
 just petty boys 6 found a 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.870
 heavier player than the brand does not 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.720
 the check is the problem 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.740
 really big if instead found it 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.480
 found alone in the middle of the area 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.580
 obviously like any striker of 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.440
 high level puts it in this thing 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.750
 therefore having to pull when 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.820
 I didn't like it alone 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.580
 consequently six and a half I do 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.760
 more and more classic or good beef 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.780
 kitsch he marked no who cares 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.580
 while regarding the shooting of 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.890
 foot here you take an 8 because it is a 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.210
 spectacular player one of the goals that 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.940
 you are seeing that you have already seen 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.350
 surely you noticed him 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.370
 he pulled it on the pole and then he did 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.380
 someone draxler 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.840
 then the shot there and I don't pull from a stop 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.970
 that is to say in the sense and not red 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.890
 after a dribble but not in the race it is not 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.360
 trailer but pulled that finance 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.520
 which is printed on the post putting 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.140
 out of order the goalkeeper the accuracy of 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.030
 that shot is certainly important 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.250
 the power just as otherwise 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.110
 goalkeeper took the concept of 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.230
 bottom what is is a player who knows 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.020
 pull that is better if the user alone 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.740
 while pulling but surely we say of da 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.510
 some satisfaction even at the level of 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.980
 shooting I advise you of how 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.780
 external kant system because I said 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.510
 crucial guys find themselves the ones like 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.280
 see in the vote 2 is true for I gave him 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.230
 how external is wasted 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.600
 the external attacker is most just as 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.040
 striker has flaws then like 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.080
 I could start at half past seven 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.300
 because he is a difficult player to 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.310
 use in the sense it is difficult to find 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.690
 the perfect field position from 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.080
 external wasted I repeat it from 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.210
 striker and has problems then how 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.220
 external striker 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:04.250
 in short it is not that much to make him play 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:07.910
 with the modules that foresee the ts per 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.860
 understand us for 20 sos insomnia 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.450
 the player just bread 7 and a half like 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.350
 global vote but certainly deserves 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.480
 lot I don't put it to him because he is 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.370
 really these defects in the passages 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.200
 and in the head shot does not make it a 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.390
 eight player in my opinion there are 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.280
 certainly more complete players though 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.740
 you will surely have fun 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.330
 another positive note I tell you at the end 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.960
 of the video to positive note of the video 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:36.740
 of the kitsch beef test that there 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:40.400
 I recommend a lot and awareness 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.889
 that in this game more than ever I weigh 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.530
 boozer will surely have an easy life 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:48.290
 as clearly stronger players 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.810
 in defense which I'll show you feel 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.300
 one month giving is destroyed 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.960
 literally by very fast players 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.669
 how naldo and santana this thing is 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.919
 here it made me mad at you 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:02.900
 but boys and the hard truth that is 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:05.479
 unfortunately it weighs boozer also in 

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.800
 This game has an easy life 

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:09.590
 the boys thank you the world can 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.330
 video I hope you enjoyed it and see you 

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.590
 in short with the next pink sleeps that 

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.479
 should go out Wednesday and then 

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.970
 tomorrow some of you will be drawn 

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:18.970
 to make a game with me is everything
