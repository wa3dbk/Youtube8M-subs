00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello in this video I will comment on the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.950
 colors that suit us in terms of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.769
 shadows and eyeliners when we have 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.629
 the brown eyes as for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.320
 eyeliners we should always choose 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:22.200
 dark tones we do not necessarily have 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.900
 than to use a black eyeliner but yes 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:30.870
 as long as they are dark it can be a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:35.690
 gray marengo a blue night a green very 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:39.630
 dark a very dark brown but 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.210
 we should run away from the light tones already 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.170
 that do not benefit us at all do not 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.120
 that highlights our eye color in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.239
 how much the shadows are always going to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.940
 favor the warm tones there already 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.079
 we can play with light colors and tones 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.589
 dark wine tones 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.210
 because this does make them stand out 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.930
 our eyes 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.750
 the dark blues 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:15.450
 the entire range of brown lands 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 the whole range of brown tones 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 rosacea 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.759
 that go a little green to brown all 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:32.280
 that range if we had to look at 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:36.819
 the colors of a station we would be 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.750
 then all autumn tones for example 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:45.130
 this color palette would not be very good 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.200
 and also as eye shadows we do not 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.869
 they go well 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.869
 light green light blue 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.300
 and the colors the silvers whenever 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.740
 we have to put points of light we 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.740
 the best would see the ivories 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.730
 and the bronze golden tones 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.569
 all that range of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.390
 of tones is the one that would not be good 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.730
 and the one that would make our eyes 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.459
 home 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.849
 in future videos I'll show you what 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.460
 colors we should use if we have another 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:38.970
 color of green blue eyes you will see 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.970
 so see you in another video chao
