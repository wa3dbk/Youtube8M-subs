let's<00:00:57.760> take<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.970> look<00:00:58.120> at<00:00:58.180> how<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.330> Nana<00:00:58.540> looper

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
let's take a look at how the Nana looper

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.570 
let's take a look at how the Nana looper
360<00:00:59.380> works<00:00:59.590> I'm<00:01:00.010> going<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.250> go<00:01:00.310> ahead<00:01:00.400> and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
360 works I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.040 
360 works I'm going to go ahead and
switch<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.910> an<00:01:01.000> empty<00:01:01.210> loop<00:01:01.420> position<00:01:01.870> and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
switch to an empty loop position and

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.480 
switch to an empty loop position and
we'll<00:01:02.320> start<00:01:02.530> creating<00:01:02.800> a<00:01:02.920> loop<00:01:03.040> from<00:01:03.160> scratch

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
we'll start creating a loop from scratch

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.580 
we'll start creating a loop from scratch
okay<00:01:04.150> we'll<00:01:05.080> move<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.379> position<00:01:05.470> 2<00:01:07.439> you'll<00:01:08.439> see

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
okay we'll move to position 2 you'll see

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.690 
okay we'll move to position 2 you'll see
that<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.830> memory<00:01:09.070> light<00:01:09.250> went<00:01:09.460> out<00:01:09.520> on<00:01:09.640> the

that the memory light went out on the
pedal<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.119> indicates<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.540> there's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
pedal that indicates that there's

nothing stored in that location now to

nothing stored in that location now to
begin<00:01:12.850> recording<00:01:13.000> it's<00:01:13.540> as<00:01:13.630> simple<00:01:13.780> as

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
begin recording it's as simple as

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:36.330 
begin recording it's as simple as
pressing<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.380> foot<00:01:14.560> switch<00:01:14.740> once<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:36.130> stop

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
pressing the foot switch once to stop

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.860 
pressing the foot switch once to stop
playback<00:01:36.610> simply<00:01:37.210> press<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.540> foot<00:01:37.720> switch

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
playback simply press the foot switch

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.990 
playback simply press the foot switch
twice<00:01:38.200> now<00:01:38.830> recording<00:01:39.190> overdubs<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.760> even

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
twice now recording overdubs is even

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.700 
twice now recording overdubs is even
easier<00:01:40.150> simply<00:01:40.990> start<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.260> loop<00:01:41.440> playing

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
easier simply start the loop playing

00:01:41.710 --> 00:02:02.500 
easier simply start the loop playing
back<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.190> press<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.580> pedal<00:01:42.790> once

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

press<00:02:03.510> the<00:02:03.630> pedal<00:02:03.780> once<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> drop<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:04.500> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
press the pedal once to drop out of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.320 
press the pedal once to drop out of
overdub<00:02:04.950> mode<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.430> press<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.910> pedal<00:02:06.150> twice

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
overdub mode and press the pedal twice

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.880 
overdub mode and press the pedal twice
to<00:02:06.510> stop<00:02:06.720> playback<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.680> continue

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
to stop playback and we can continue

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
to stop playback and we can continue
overdubbing<00:02:08.430> into<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.850> loop<00:02:09.090> without<00:02:09.510> using

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
overdubbing into this loop without using

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.180 
overdubbing into this loop without using
up<00:02:09.869> any<00:02:10.050> additional<00:02:10.290> memory<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:10.979> just

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
up any additional memory it's just

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.160 
up any additional memory it's just
stored<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:11.580> same<00:02:11.790> loop<00:02:12.000> location<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.080> we

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
stored in that same loop location so we

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.540 
stored in that same loop location so we
can<00:02:13.260> continue<00:02:13.470> doing<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.040> many<00:02:14.250> times<00:02:14.430> as

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
can continue doing this as many times as

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:56.050 
can continue doing this as many times as
we<00:02:14.610> like

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.070 

now<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.270> make<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.420> mistake<00:02:57.600> while<00:02:57.990> you're

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
now if you make a mistake while you're

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.600 
now if you make a mistake while you're
recording<00:02:58.290> an<00:02:58.530> overdub<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.100> very<00:02:59.280> easy<00:02:59.490> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
recording an overdub it's very easy to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.980 
recording an overdub it's very easy to
undo<00:02:59.880> what<00:03:00.030> you've<00:03:00.150> done<00:03:00.330> I'm<00:03:00.720> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> go

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
undo what you've done I'm going to go

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.150 
undo what you've done I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.230> record<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.560> part<00:03:01.770> here<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:01.950> has<00:03:02.130> a

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
ahead and record a part here that has a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:26.260 
ahead and record a part here that has a
mistake<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.090> we'll<00:03:03.209> drop<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.420> back<00:03:03.690> out

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.550 

so<00:03:27.270> it's<00:03:27.390> very<00:03:27.480> easy<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.840> undo<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.410> make<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
so it's very easy to undo if you make a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.110 
so it's very easy to undo if you make a
mistake<00:03:28.740> while<00:03:29.100> you're<00:03:29.220> over<00:03:29.430> dubbing<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.880> in

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
fact you can redo so if you decide you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.290 
fact you can redo so if you decide you

easy it is to operate the Nana looper
360<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.360> few<00:03:45.510> button<00:03:45.780> presses<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.290> you're
