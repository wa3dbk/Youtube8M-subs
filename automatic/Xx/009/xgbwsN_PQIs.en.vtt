about this website since the last time I
did<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.010> video<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.270> thing<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.539> learned<00:00:21.750> is

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
did that video so one thing I learned is

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.210 
did that video so one thing I learned is
that<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.410> make<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> fullscreen

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
that you can make it fullscreen

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.910 
that you can make it fullscreen
so<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.800> all

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
can zoom out so you can actually have

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.130 
can zoom out so you can actually have
space<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> puzzle<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> I've<00:00:33.750> also<00:00:33.930> made

some<00:00:34.350> improvements<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> way<00:00:35.610> I'm

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
some improvements to the way I'm

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.119 
some improvements to the way I'm
recording<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.840> hooked<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.620> an<00:00:37.800> external

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
recording this I hooked up an external

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.760 
recording this I hooked up an external
microphone<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.540> normal<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.590> like

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
microphone because the normal just like

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.639 
microphone because the normal just like
computer<00:00:41.280> microphone<00:00:41.850> wasn't<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:43.020> great<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
computer microphone wasn't that great so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
computer microphone wasn't that great so

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
personally for me the way that I do

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.470 
personally for me the way that I do
jigsaw<00:03:42.349> puzzles<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.919> don't<00:03:43.699> really<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.269> it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
jigsaw puzzles I don't really like it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.289

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
okay so I have three sides this is a

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.119 
okay so I have three sides this is a
much<00:03:47.810> shorter<00:03:48.139> puzzle<00:03:48.680> than<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:48.919> thought<00:03:49.069> I

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
much shorter puzzle than I thought I

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.770 
much shorter puzzle than I thought I
thought<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.459> was<00:03:49.549> like<00:03:49.609> a<00:03:49.669> square<00:03:49.970> puzzle<00:03:50.299> but

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
thought it was like a square puzzle but

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.689 
thought it was like a square puzzle but
okay<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.379> I<00:03:51.410> have<00:03:51.560> three<00:03:51.590> sides<00:03:52.069> done<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.639> I'm

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
okay so I have three sides done and I'm

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.189 
okay so I have three sides done and I'm
gonna<00:03:52.849> clear<00:03:53.150> all<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.419> stuff<00:03:53.480> out<00:03:53.690> from<00:03:54.079> the

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
gonna clear all this stuff out from the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.890 
gonna clear all this stuff out from the
inside<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.459> can<00:03:55.819> start<00:03:56.120> putting<00:03:56.750> these

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
inside so that I can start putting these

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.990 
inside so that I can start putting these
pieces<00:03:57.349> on<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:59.000> inside<00:03:59.680> I<00:04:00.680> also<00:04:01.459> gets<00:04:01.609> kind<00:04:01.910> of

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.850 
that's right there or that piece is
going<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.570> this<00:05:23.960> puzzle<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.320> actually<00:05:24.620> pretty

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
going and this puzzle is actually pretty

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.110 
going and this puzzle is actually pretty
quick<00:05:25.100> this<00:05:25.220> was<00:05:25.400> a<00:05:25.430> lot<00:05:25.580> quicker<00:05:25.790> than<00:05:25.940> I

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
quick this was a lot quicker than I

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.580 
quick this was a lot quicker than I
thought<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.420> was<00:05:26.480> going<00:05:26.630> to<00:05:26.780> be<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.080> don't<00:05:27.410> even

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
thought it was going to be I don't even

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.420 
thought it was going to be I don't even
know<00:05:27.680> how<00:05:27.800> long<00:05:27.920> I've<00:05:28.040> been<00:05:28.190> recording

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
know how long I've been recording

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.140 
know how long I've been recording
probably<00:05:29.000> just<00:05:29.570> like<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:29.720> couple<00:05:30.050> minutes<00:05:30.170> but

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
probably just like a couple minutes but

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.180 
probably just like a couple minutes but
yeah<00:05:32.150> so<00:05:32.450> next<00:05:32.690> next<00:05:33.140> time<00:05:33.320> for<00:05:33.680> number<00:05:33.860> three

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
yeah so next next time for number three

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.830 
yeah so next next time for number three
I<00:05:34.220> was<00:05:34.370> thinking<00:05:34.640> I<00:05:34.730> would<00:05:34.850> do<00:05:34.940> one<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.300> these<00:05:35.750> a

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
I was thinking I would do one of these a

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.260 
I was thinking I would do one of these a
week<00:05:35.980> maybe<00:05:36.980> two<00:05:37.250> if<00:05:37.550> I<00:05:37.670> end<00:05:37.790> up<00:05:37.850> having<00:05:38.120> time

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
week maybe two if I end up having time

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.720 
week maybe two if I end up having time
but<00:05:38.570> I'm<00:05:38.690> getting<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.170> busy<00:05:39.470> before<00:05:39.770> VidCon

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
those topics down below I'll pick one

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.050 
those topics down below I'll pick one
for<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.620> next<00:05:45.980> episode<00:05:46.400> and<00:05:46.670> that<00:05:46.820> one<00:05:46.910> will

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
for the next episode and that one will

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.580 
for the next episode and that one will
be<00:05:47.150> a<00:05:47.180> little<00:05:47.420> more<00:05:47.660> organized<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.230> a<00:05:48.350> little

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
be a little more organized and a little

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.230 
be a little more organized and a little
more<00:05:48.680> structured<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.340> there<00:05:49.790> we<00:05:49.850> go<00:05:49.970> they

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
more structured and there we go they

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.150 
more structured and there we go they
take<00:05:50.390> some<00:05:50.600> puzzles<00:05:50.930> done<00:05:51.170> and<00:05:51.590> that<00:05:52.010> only

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
take some puzzles done and that only

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.310 
take some puzzles done and that only
took<00:05:52.340> me<00:05:52.520> five<00:05:52.700> minutes<00:05:52.940> so<00:05:53.660> I<00:05:53.690> think<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:54.110> can

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
took me five minutes so I think I can

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.500 
took me five minutes so I think I can
escape<00:05:55.070> out<00:05:55.340> of<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.670> and<00:05:56.620> cool

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
escape out of that and cool

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.330 
escape out of that and cool
hopefully<00:05:59.510> the<00:05:59.720> technical<00:06:00.290> aspects<00:06:01.010> of<00:06:01.190> this

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
hopefully the technical aspects of this

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.610 
hopefully the technical aspects of this
one<00:06:01.490> were<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.730> little<00:06:02.030> bit<00:06:02.270> smoother<00:06:02.540> so<00:06:03.410> I'm

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
one were a little bit smoother so I'm

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.500 
one were a little bit smoother so I'm
gonna<00:06:03.800> go<00:06:04.040> and<00:06:04.370> get<00:06:04.730> back<00:06:04.910> to<00:06:05.060> work<00:06:05.150> on<00:06:05.300> some
