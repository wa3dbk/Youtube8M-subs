Cumberbatch's<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.460> version<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.210> Sherlock<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
Cumberbatch's a version of Sherlock I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
Cumberbatch's a version of Sherlock I
think<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:38.329> independent<00:01:39.329> thing

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
think this one is an independent thing

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
think this one is an independent thing
no<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.259> from<00:01:40.380> Scholastic<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.610> my

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
no it's from Scholastic this is when my

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
no it's from Scholastic this is when my
heart<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.150> wicked<00:01:42.630> by<00:01:43.020> Tricia<00:01:43.290> sterling<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
heart was wicked by Tricia sterling and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.889 
heart was wicked by Tricia sterling and
I<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> thought<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.630> really

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
I just thought that this was a really

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530 
I just thought that this was a really
cool<00:01:46.140> cover<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.790> basically<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.360> involves

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
cool cover and basically it involves

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.460 
cool cover and basically it involves
birds<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> trees<00:01:50.780> good<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.259> one

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
birds and trees good to know this one

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530
