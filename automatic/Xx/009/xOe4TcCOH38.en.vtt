 yo guests and welcome to another new one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.950
 episode of matties 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.899
 mission to fucking world power 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 episode 4 in this series is rhine and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.900
 that's what it comes down to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.929
 but this one was playing against FC Twente 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.030
 with mattie that is everywhere under the number 68 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.049
 we're close to 69 and you have to go there 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.940
 actually for the rest he career 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.740
 get stuck or become your success 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.390
 that's a bad joke this is a good one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.859
 tackle mattie it is through 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.170
 he is going to be a prototype in a bit one 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.970
 cheat this and then you are in for by 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.500
 In this competition you do 26 times 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.160
 low stroke with your arms then you do the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.689
 head roll 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.250
 then you hit dirty air and then you know 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.130
 this law has expired you are a part 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.800
 of fc twente sick victory and what 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.329
 he always 6.9 again those types in 69 he 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 comes back everywhere I don't know how 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.559
 it would come 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 wonder illuminati all okay that would be 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 on something 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.539
 Matthew 1960 now oh you have none 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.520
 success of a hit 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.840
 force sick player anyway 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 valuable lesson is against cambuur 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.500
 leeuwarden an against cambuur we start 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.210
 we actually pretty good too 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 article mattie who grab the ball that you 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.660
 that we were out of the arc just stood 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.100
 Edwin has to be intercepted there 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.600
 the chance of his life but he has to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.949
 but the fat keeper makes it up 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.260
 jeroen hooeven light i don't have one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.400
 new house or something that picked up 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.659
 at the next moment is allowed 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.369
 run but it runs he is tripping 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.680
 just what and at once 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 high tea in its place and then you ask 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.710
 yourself 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 pepperoni is socks or boils between you 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 dial 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.350
 well that is for question well like me 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 the say and its a ridiculous you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.810
 generalizations 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 when have I never heard and if 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.840
 You could choose between picnic we look like 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.369
 see or swim with a psv 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.930
 with whom would you wind fresh again 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.880
 unbelievably these fraumeni forces 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.650
 come get upset, I really do not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 normally more after my career as 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.049
 interview might go to him not 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.610
 be completely so let's continue 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 go to the game play I'm meanwhile 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 i just fucking fucking goddamn it 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.100
 But yes what do you want when you do an interview 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.600
 you and no one will ask the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.979
 seriously then you have to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.899
 what he tries everything he can 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.180
 Cambuur but I am not going to get income brackets 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.220
 as looks in the 90th minute causing this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.020
 of 600 ends and that does not happen already 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.729
 often your a career moot and head to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.409
 head and it doesn't blow me by the way 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.479
 just against the computer runs 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.219
 container like cows 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.240
 what they do not run that much 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.680
 comparison is epic 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.500
 I indeed asked me have we 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.750
 would have ever been a football that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.470
 paris an interview green banana 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.590
 at wrote 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.060
 double a very strange question 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.200
 well i don't believe there is anyone else 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.569
 who will take me seriously 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.099
 today 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.050
 bit disappointing just like Mattie 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.860
 shots with the game on another one 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.360
 Coutigny and the next here again 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.920
 frytop good place that you think that goes 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.260
 that mattie but no that comes on one or 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.700
 other who is this stef netherlands who too 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.050
 still played football and they had life you had 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.480
 of three also has a good axis 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.530
 I believe on you also is saymak 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.060
 it scored but that is completely 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.130
 offtopic like the number I got it 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.660
 having a zero and wanting stacks just goes 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.980
 good in general and mattie too and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.360
 maybe he needs a transfer 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.370
 yes but then you see that as 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.019
 leave final mark 6 points and then you become 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.430
 just another falcon forest 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.019
 good damn yes because that way 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.010
 Of course you never get dresse to 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.330
 a good valve 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.799
 despite that this is the end of the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.569
 video sorry that is too short 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.130
 probably e these clips all that time 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.870
 in use you can view the entire video that is 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.340
 so fakken brilliant and the description 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.810
 look back and if you like this kind of videos 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.580
 well liked a blue late 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.540
 Thumb back and tell and the judges 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.280
 whether you like it or not 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.200
 sorry she's short but this costs it 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.299
 even more time than and afterwards commentary 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.440
 with the only game play of 25 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.510
 minutes this is quite a lot of work until 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.799
 bye 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.209
 home I fortunately not heard part 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.930
 made out and that is a lot for me 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.940
 more important 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.590
 4 5 who think of what the bastard this 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.480
 and we have to go further and not like that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.650
 cocks week like last week and i am 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.420
 fucking angry 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.890
 damn, where am I here anyway 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.890
 and therefore if you get a little irritated
