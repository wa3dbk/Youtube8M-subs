00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.059 
like a purple color when connected it's
kind<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.090> cool<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.259> stay<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
kind of cool and that will stay on for

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.530 
kind of cool and that will stay on for
the<00:02:11.129> entire<00:02:11.160> time<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.940> are<00:02:11.970> using<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the entire time that you are using it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.950 
the entire time that you are using it
with<00:02:12.569> your<00:02:12.989> computer

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.470 

but<00:02:16.740> essentially<00:02:17.130> that's<00:02:17.430> how<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.270> it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
but essentially that's how you do it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.560 
but essentially that's how you do it
that's<00:02:18.900> pretty<00:02:19.710> simple<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.330> want<00:02:21.480> to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
that's pretty simple if you want to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.290 
that's pretty simple if you want to
disconnect<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> controller<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:24.030> either

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
disconnect the controller you can either

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.780 
disconnect the controller you can either
turn<00:02:24.570> off<00:02:24.810> Bluetooth<00:02:25.100> altogether<00:02:26.100> or<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.460> can

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
turn off Bluetooth altogether or you can

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.290 
turn off Bluetooth altogether or you can
go<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.120> select<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.690> controller<00:02:28.140> itself<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
go and select the controller itself and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.290 
go and select the controller itself and
hit<00:02:30.300> disconnect<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.230> will<00:02:31.380> turn<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.190> off

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.970 

but<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.510> one<00:02:36.720> thing<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.560> find<00:02:37.800> that's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
but the one thing I have to find that's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.260 
but the one thing I have to find that's
kind<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.400> weird

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
kind of weird

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.240 
kind of weird
is<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.900> actually<00:02:40.110> haven't<00:02:40.620> found<00:02:40.980> any

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
is that I actually haven't found any

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.320 
is that I actually haven't found any
games<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.900> work<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> ps4<00:02:43.890> controller

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
games that work with the ps4 controller

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.700 
games that work with the ps4 controller
wirelessly

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
wirelessly

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.020 
wirelessly
like<00:02:46.710> in<00:02:46.890> my<00:02:47.040> other<00:02:47.070> video<00:02:48.710> GTA<00:02:49.710> Vice<00:02:50.430> City<00:02:50.460> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
like in my other video GTA Vice City and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.830 
like in my other video GTA Vice City and
san<00:02:51.360> andreas<00:02:52.340> both<00:02:53.340> those<00:02:53.670> games<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.570> work

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
san andreas both those games do work

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.250 
san andreas both those games do work
with<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> ps4<00:02:55.410> controller<00:02:56.570> but<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.780> has<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.230> be

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
with the ps4 controller but it has to be

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.830 
with the ps4 controller but it has to be
via<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.340> USB<00:02:59.640> cable<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.270> some<00:03:00.510> reason

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
via the USB cable for some reason

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.780 
via the USB cable for some reason
because<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.230> tried<00:03:01.620> playing<00:03:02.250> both<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.670> these

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
because I tried playing both of these

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.820 
because I tried playing both of these
games<00:03:03.120> while<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.660> controller<00:03:04.260> was<00:03:04.440> connected

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
games while the controller was connected

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.490 
games while the controller was connected
wirelessly<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.820> for<00:03:06.510> some<00:03:06.690> reason<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
wirelessly and for some reason it the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.900 
wirelessly and for some reason it the
game<00:03:07.710> just<00:03:07.980> does<00:03:08.130> not<00:03:08.250> recognize<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
game just does not recognize the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
game just does not recognize the
controller<00:03:09.570> for<00:03:09.870> some<00:03:10.080> reason<00:03:10.440> I'm<00:03:11.010> not

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
controller for some reason I'm not

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.210 
controller for some reason I'm not
entirely<00:03:11.520> sure<00:03:11.670> why<00:03:12.830> but<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.010> kind<00:03:14.160> of

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
entirely sure why but it's kind of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.610 
entirely sure why but it's kind of
unfortunate<00:03:14.690> maybe<00:03:15.690> there's<00:03:16.050> just<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.350> glitch

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
unfortunate maybe there's just a glitch

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.040 
unfortunate maybe there's just a glitch
and<00:03:16.980> maybe<00:03:17.610> update<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.239> needed<00:03:18.390> or<00:03:18.690> something

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
and maybe update is needed or something

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.540 
and maybe update is needed or something
but<00:03:19.260> yeah<00:03:20.180> san<00:03:21.180> andreas<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.780> Vice<00:03:21.930> City<00:03:21.959> at<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
but yeah san andreas in Vice City at the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.820 
but yeah san andreas in Vice City at the
moment<00:03:23.970> for<00:03:24.330> me<00:03:24.510> hasn't<00:03:25.140> worked<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
moment for me hasn't worked with the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.490 
moment for me hasn't worked with the
controller<00:03:26.280> wirelessly<00:03:26.700> um<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:28.110> may<00:03:28.440> be

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
controller wirelessly um it may be

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.640 
controller wirelessly um it may be
different<00:03:29.040> for<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.340> guys<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.209> those<00:03:31.080> games

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
different for you guys so if those games

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.840 
different for you guys so if those games
do<00:03:31.950> work<00:03:33.170> let<00:03:34.170> me<00:03:34.200> know<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.680> maybe<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.130> can<00:03:35.310> find

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
do work let me know and maybe I can find

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.060 
do work let me know and maybe I can find
a<00:03:35.970> workaround<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.780> get<00:03:37.200> them<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.560> work<00:03:37.590> with

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
a workaround and get them to work with

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.570 
a workaround and get them to work with
the<00:03:38.310> controller<00:03:39.739> but<00:03:40.739> yeah<00:03:40.920> that's<00:03:41.070> basically

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
the controller but yeah that's basically

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.600 
the controller but yeah that's basically
it<00:03:42.019> like<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.050> like<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.830> said<00:03:43.860> these<00:03:44.250> are<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.489> only

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
it like a like I said these are the only

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.250 
it like a like I said these are the only
two<00:03:44.820> games<00:03:45.090> I've<00:03:45.239> tested<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:46.050> that's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
two games I've tested because that's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.320 
two games I've tested because that's
really<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.650> only<00:03:46.739> games<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> own<00:03:47.640> for<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
really the only games that I own for the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.240 
really the only games that I own for the
Mac<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:49.340> can<00:03:50.340> actually<00:03:50.790> test<00:03:52.070> but<00:03:53.070> if<00:03:53.160> you

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
Mac that I can actually test but if you

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.699 
Mac that I can actually test but if you
guys<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.640> any<00:03:53.790> games<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.690> have<00:03:55.140> tested

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
guys have any games that you have tested

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.790 
guys have any games that you have tested
personally<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.930> whichever<00:03:57.930> games<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.620> do

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
personally and whichever games that do

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.259 
personally and whichever games that do
or<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.310> work<00:03:59.489> leave<00:03:59.910> those<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.120> the

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
or don't work leave those in the

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.790 
or don't work leave those in the
comments<00:04:00.690> section<00:04:00.930> below<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.200> I'll<00:04:01.500> make<00:04:01.769> a

comments section below and I'll make a

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.410 
comments section below and I'll make a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
list in the description of what games do

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.040 
list in the description of what games do
and<00:04:06.720> don't<00:04:06.959> work<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:09.480> that'll<00:04:09.720> be<00:04:09.810> helped

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
and don't work so that'll be helped

anyway that's pretty much it that's how

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.570 
anyway that's pretty much it that's how
you<00:04:15.720> connect<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.109> ps4<00:04:16.560> controller<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.370> your

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
you connect the ps4 controller to your

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.700 
you connect the ps4 controller to your

the way this particular macbook is
running<00:04:26.070> OS<00:04:26.430> 10

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150

running OS 10
lion<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:28.620> assume<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:30.030> same<00:04:30.509> process<00:04:31.169> would<00:04:31.620> be

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
lion I assume the same process would be

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.969 
lion I assume the same process would be
for<00:04:32.340> Mavericks<00:04:32.850> as<00:04:33.060> well<00:04:33.590> but<00:04:34.590> like<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.919> said

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
for Mavericks as well but like I said

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.550 
for Mavericks as well but like I said
I'm<00:04:35.280> not<00:04:35.430> entirely<00:04:35.699> sure<00:04:35.910> if<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.270> will<00:04:36.560> work

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
I'm not entirely sure if that will work

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.830 
I'm not entirely sure if that will work
because<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.400> haven't<00:04:38.580> used<00:04:38.850> or<00:04:39.270> tried<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.720> this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
because I haven't used or tried to this

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.760 
because I haven't used or tried to this
with<00:04:40.080> Mavericks<00:04:40.530> yet<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.880> yeah<00:04:42.110> anyway<00:04:43.110> once
