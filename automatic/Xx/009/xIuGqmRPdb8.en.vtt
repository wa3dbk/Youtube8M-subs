00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
that because my mom barely ever cooks

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.570 
that because my mom barely ever cooks
she<00:04:52.169> really<00:04:52.410> only<00:04:52.530> cooked<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:52.979> like<00:04:53.100> Sundays

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
she really only cooked on like Sundays

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.450 
she really only cooked on like Sundays
and<00:04:54.090> every<00:04:54.870> now<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.200> then<00:04:55.260> if<00:04:55.500> she<00:04:55.560> just<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:56.250> in

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
and every now and then if she just is in

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.950 
and every now and then if she just is in
the<00:04:56.580> mood<00:04:56.790> even<00:04:57.210> if<00:04:57.419> it's<00:04:57.600> something<00:04:57.780> small

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
the mood even if it's something small

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.900 
the mood even if it's something small
they<00:04:58.380> eat<00:04:58.590> out<00:04:58.740> all<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:58.950> time<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.250> guess<00:04:59.640> that's

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
they eat out all the time I guess that's

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.000 
they eat out all the time I guess that's
why<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.630> eat<00:05:01.169> out<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:01.350> much<00:05:01.620> when<00:05:01.830> we<00:05:01.890> were

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
why I eat out so much when we were

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.800 
why I eat out so much when we were
younger<00:05:02.340> she's<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.850> cook<00:05:03.030> all<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.330> time<00:05:03.360> but

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
younger she's the cook all the time but

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.830 
younger she's the cook all the time but
I<00:05:04.220> guess<00:05:05.220> since<00:05:05.460> we<00:05:05.640> like<00:05:05.820> got<00:05:06.090> older<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.720> like

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
I guess since we like got older and like

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.630 
I guess since we like got older and like
in<00:05:06.990> high<00:05:07.110> school<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.530> stuff<00:05:07.680> she<00:05:08.310> didn't<00:05:08.520> cook

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
in high school and stuff she didn't cook

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.940 
in high school and stuff she didn't cook
as<00:05:08.850> often

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
as often

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.470 
as often
probably<00:05:10.340> after<00:05:10.490> hospital<00:05:11.060> she<00:05:11.210> studies

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
probably after hospital she studies

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.090 
probably after hospital she studies
because<00:05:11.810> quite<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.050> bit<00:05:12.230> in<00:05:12.350> high<00:05:12.470> school<00:05:12.710> but

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
because quite a bit in high school but

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.220 
because quite a bit in high school but
