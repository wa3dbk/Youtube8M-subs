 chapter 17 and if I never get tired of 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.640
 count know all champions for if 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.480

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.760
 against the champions today I will make the zone of 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.360
 9 tails today's tips come from the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.970
 mini duke hand 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.509
 let's analyze the enemy 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.160
 first the strengths I put to 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.689
 very much the line pressing your 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.939
 rival and being able to move without any 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.199
 problem with his passive heals a lot 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.820
 online which turns into task 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.980
 difficult to finish with her wear base 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.420
 he has a lot of mobility getting like this 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.339
 a very effective fights in objectives 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.079
 she is a great champion to finish with 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.170
 individual goals can even 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.410
 defeat them from 100 to 0 seconds the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.540
 weak 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.160
 in its definitive you are a character without 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.170
 too much mobility what makes it 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.730
 in an easy goal depends a lot on your 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.500
 spell to kill his rivals who 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.489
 it is not easy to guess all the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.989
 important skills now you have to 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.150
 hit them so it's considered difficult 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.190
 to use if the hooks can end with 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.940
 she easily when I say easily 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.150
 it is easily 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.400
 now the tips 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.230
 the sitar is the most dangerous skill 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.460
 from there, he gets the most 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.490
 It is likely that we will win one against one 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.020
 so try to run away when ari does not 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.550
 has its definitive is the moment 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.410
 to attack his only defensive ability 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.820
 at that time is to use so 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.220
 dodge it and attack 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.770
 about deception hurts to come but more 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.479
 When you return, remember that even if it hits you 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.250
 the first time does not mean that I 'm going to 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.890
 hit the second so try to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.900
 dodge the always when ariza idea 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.740
 it can be a big problem so 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.810
 we have to try that those 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 movements are not effective pon uars 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.540
 around the middle line to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.220
 be able to see where you are going and warn your 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.740
 companions 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.870
 carey much other moves but if hunting 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.760
 is yours try to make the goal 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.280
 main in the fights be it and for 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.990
 as much as possible that we will play against 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.520
 ari then champions that rivalicen in 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.110
 line like for example ole house 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.660

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.550

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.660

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.110
