00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 Most the selection responded to your decision 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.020
 I communicated them through 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.899
 to respond and 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.899
 I have been shocked at least they were silent 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.249
 and then I was also pronounced toy 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.199
 the government in the sense that you are abandoning a little group 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.219
 We will say that to a lot of people but I think that there in the past 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.470
 months 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.850
 3 I'll just leave about that 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 we have worked very hard 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.120
 we have used all sorts of other perspectives we all have 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.830
 other ways 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.600
 luckily tried to influence those boys individually and collectively 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.550
 to have 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.830
 but I don't think we are the 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.420
 say not try everything you have done everything to 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.530
 to change 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.989
 and so it goes 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.869
 then to say that you can still find the memorial through steam 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.100
 becoming 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.190
 what I said the results were disappointing 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.360
 the racing despite everything worked hard also by me 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.790
 and if you are still sensitive to the influence that line wants to exert 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.810
 has been very limited 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.940
 then not afraid of the next season 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.080
 and then I don't think it makes sense 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.910
 yes you have to take on the challenge something for myself and also not for ajax 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.880
 So 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.120
 after the decision 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.910
 the previous season with van gaal at az it was also very bad at eleven 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.970
 take place 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.010
 who has been able to take sporting revenge that you did not expect 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.390
 of course a very successful donald is going 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.130
 after the big difference i think integral and but in this case it is 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.520
 van gaal can look back on a whole 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.640
 career with a lot 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.410
 yes it wins experiences in which he fall back on and I don't 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 it gave but it is not enough either 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.830
 getting there with that difficult job has again 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.389
 address the problems 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.259
 and that doesn't matter 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.729
 meijer 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.839
 that hard on I did not achieve the objective what was that objective 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.369
 the hits second place 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.829
 which they gradually adjusted during the season 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.800
 yes we are 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.179
 down the lane say till 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:37.809
 February was still busy with the first prize in our head after the second 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.459
 price of oil has ended 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.549
 Sunday is that it also that the curtain has already fallen 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.929
 but is normally because ajax is a listed company 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:51.329
 I always get so curious every time a little wash is used to it 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.429
 brought out why it was chosen to be so early in the afternoon 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:57.429
 set the minimum 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.239
 at the moment that is news that wishes to yield 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.049
 That 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.609
 that contains 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.739
 recently that the news is like a trainer 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.860
 Because it is normally chosen that they have no chance 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.119
 gives to say that time has been the situations 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.119
 it's just absurd 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.139
 a suitable successor for Jan 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.139
 that's not allowed 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.009
 hunters 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.529
 janus oomen 8 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:31.379
 Yes 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.379
 No 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.719
 No 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.259
 I'm going quietly it's nice 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.359
 Think about it no sizes in recent months 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.969
 everything has happened and then I will watch 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.969
 what the future will bring 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.449
 well the results well i worked hard and in the end it is one 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.709
 disappointment 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.709
 what ended up with it 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.919
 so what it is hard work 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.929
 I have 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.289
 actually do it 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.729
 the image that marco has of singing group 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.289
 were not influencing that is in their view that they are full 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.139
 What you do see is that canvas has tried a lot in recent months 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.919
 To be sure the group did not rule out construction 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.029
 possibilities to build in or 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:33.599
 one also saw that the group just responded well that they were flying to 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.110
 to each other that all takes time 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.499
 I think that is the decision as it is today 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.150
 purely at marco 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.020
 with those indicating 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.620
 I gave everything 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.490
 and I see that group needs more than what I will not win 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.309
 and I think then you 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.309
 2006 a lot harder 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.860
 volvo something like a trainer 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.400
 fredje gets the capacity and possess to 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.300
 see yourself in the mirror and see what you can bring whatever you finish 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.509
 need 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.409
 but that much more than people that you dare to look at yourself 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.359
 that was a good thing that doesn't make much of the brand but I think it's special 

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:12.439
 powerful 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.610
 if you dare to look in the mirror as a human being, yes I know what my fans say 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.490
 the city 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.270
 I have reached that limit 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.559
 and for ajax and for the limelight 10 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.559
 more is needed and I can't do it 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.120
 man 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.680
 eats 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.969
 yes the people who might resolve themselves 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.099
 9 after the summer 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.959
 there was someone who called for me this afternoon against me you feel this like 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.080
 a defeat because we have spent a lot of time together so far 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.360
 absolutely not, I think we have gone through a very special period 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.100
 where we build with all our heart and soul have gone to do it 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.809
 is very disappointing 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:56.990
 view images week half a year passed three times they said we would 

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:00.949
 no less than four we sit there for five to ten years according to the two and and the doing and 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.330
 so good luck 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.319
 and builders 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.210
 that hurts that hurts 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.210
 wildervank also do not deny 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.240
 well ahead I do not think the ship was swollen right now that may also be that 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.640
 it is indicated that it seems that these are benefits 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.240
 the problems are they must be recognizable 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.280
 are indicated who knew marco weekend whole technical staff wording around it 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.479
 put 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.960
 but as a technical staff you must also be able to see camp at 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.960
 bring him what binds 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.430
 that needs 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.430
 to have full on the championship 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.319
 suffer the volatility in the team 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.040
 the mental resilience the leadership 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.110
 those are the things then 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.089
 is the team apart 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:53.759
 these are clearly recognizable things that folders with cloth cover run times 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.120
 and if you then say that you cannot change that, bidding with or not seeing yourself 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:59.029
 that you can just respect it from the winter break
