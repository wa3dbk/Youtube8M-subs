00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.240 
amazing now if you think about it this
whole<00:00:45.210> tombstone<00:00:45.930> concept<00:00:46.680> could<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.070> real

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
whole tombstone concept could be real

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.270 
whole tombstone concept could be real
convenience<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.000> people<00:00:48.530> such<00:00:49.530> examples

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
expenses I knew as to pay these burial

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.880 
expenses I knew as to pay these burial
expenses<00:01:38.800> your<00:01:39.760> family<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:41.020> if<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.350> become<00:01:41.590> an

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
expenses your family so if you become an

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.310 
expenses your family so if you become an
instant<00:01:42.310> tombstone<00:01:42.880> after<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.360> die<00:01:43.600> it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
instant tombstone after you die it's

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.590 
instant tombstone after you die it's
your<00:01:45.100> family<00:01:45.490> saves<00:01:45.729> money<00:01:45.940> from<00:01:46.180> having<00:01:46.510> to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
your family saves money from having to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.880 
your family saves money from having to
bury<00:01:46.870> you<00:01:47.080> because<00:01:47.320> there's<00:01:47.500> something<00:01:47.800> to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
bury you because there's something to

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.980 
bury you because there's something to
bury<00:01:48.130> you're<00:01:48.370> just<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.670> tombstone<00:01:49.120> all<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
bury you're just a tombstone all you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.630 
bury you're just a tombstone all you
really<00:01:50.110> have<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.830> find<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:51.369> lift

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
really have to do is find that we lift

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.969 
really have to do is find that we lift
this<00:01:51.790> tombstone<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> cemetery<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.710> they're

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
this tombstone to a cemetery and they're

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:54.330 
this tombstone to a cemetery and they're
done

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
done

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.560 
done
so<00:01:54.520> it's<00:01:54.640> cost-effective<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:56.170> saves<00:01:56.619> time<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
so it's cost-effective it saves time and

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.030 
so it's cost-effective it saves time and
if<00:01:58.690> they<00:01:58.810> don't<00:01:59.020> want<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.320> keep<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.590> tombstone

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
if they don't want to keep the tombstone

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.160 
if they don't want to keep the tombstone
just<00:02:00.280> bash<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.729> up<00:02:00.820> into<00:02:01.090> your<00:02:01.180> little<00:02:01.360> apples

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
just bash it up into your little apples

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.859 
just bash it up into your little apples
and<00:02:02.790> spread<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.910> around<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:04.300> ashes<00:02:04.540> or

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
and spread it around like ashes or

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.270 
and spread it around like ashes or
something<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.410> there<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.590> go<00:02:05.740> we're<00:02:05.890> all<00:02:06.009> set

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
something and there you go we're all set

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.370 
something and there you go we're all set
so<00:02:06.910> this<00:02:07.030> could<00:02:07.210> work<00:02:07.390> for<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:07.930> good<00:02:08.140> for<00:02:08.320> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
so this could work for it's good for the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.740 
so this could work for it's good for the
economy<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.550> most<00:02:12.550> importantly<00:02:13.209> prevents

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
economy and most importantly prevents

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:43.239 
economy and most importantly prevents
the<00:02:13.840> chance<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.350> there<00:02:14.530> ever<00:02:14.709> being<00:02:14.980> zombies

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.249 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.220 

in<00:02:44.249> fact<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.359> come<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.569> handy<00:02:45.689> for<00:02:46.049> lots

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
in fact this can come in handy for lots

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.220 
in fact this can come in handy for lots
of<00:02:46.349> things<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.829> say<00:02:47.239> computers<00:02:48.239> instead<00:02:49.139> of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
of things like say computers instead of

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.869 
of things like say computers instead of

if<00:04:20.590> elevator<00:04:20.979> crushed<00:04:21.340> my<00:04:21.609> head<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:22.720> might<00:04:23.470> do<00:04:23.770> a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
if elevator crushed my head I might do a

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.920 
if elevator crushed my head I might do a
little<00:04:23.949> convulsion<00:04:24.669> like<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.540> probably

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
little convulsion like that I probably

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.020 
little convulsion like that I probably
squished<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.770> my<00:04:26.889> brains<00:04:27.220> been<00:04:27.400> flowing<00:04:27.790> out

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
squished in my brains been flowing out

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.760 
squished in my brains been flowing out
over<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.330> ground

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:40.210 

is<00:04:31.009> that<00:04:31.550> your<00:04:31.789> best<00:04:38.680> it's<00:04:39.680> just<00:04:39.830> an<00:04:39.919> Atari

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
is that your best it's just an Atari

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.830 
is that your best it's just an Atari
game<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:40.639> I<00:04:40.669> guess<00:04:40.819> it's<00:04:40.970> best<00:04:41.270> thing<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.479> do<00:04:41.690> is

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
game so I guess it's best thing to do is

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.330 
game so I guess it's best thing to do is
just<00:04:41.960> have<00:04:42.169> them<00:04:42.289> you<00:04:42.409> know<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.770> convulsions

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
just have them you know have convulsions

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.540 
just have them you know have convulsions
on<00:04:43.490> spot<00:04:44.349> why<00:04:45.349> are<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.590> elevators<00:04:46.069> going<00:04:46.340> like

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
on spot why are the elevators going like

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.640 
on spot why are the elevators going like
this<00:04:46.639> anyway<00:04:47.000> what<00:04:47.210> kind<00:04:47.419> of<00:04:47.479> insane<00:04:48.050> places

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
this anyway what kind of insane places

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.589 
this anyway what kind of insane places
this<00:04:48.830> will<00:04:49.009> be<00:04:49.099> possessed<00:04:49.550> but<00:04:49.789> anyway<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:53.120> mean

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
this will be possessed but anyway I mean

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.330 
this will be possessed but anyway I mean
seriously<00:04:54.050> if<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.349> could<00:04:54.530> tweak<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.979> way<00:04:55.099> this

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
seriously if I could tweak the way this

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.610 
seriously if I could tweak the way this
guy<00:04:55.550> dies<00:04:55.879> I'd<00:04:56.360> probably<00:04:56.870> make<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.199> little<00:04:57.500> more

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
guy dies I'd probably make a little more

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:32.990 
guy dies I'd probably make a little more
accurate<00:05:02.199> something<00:05:03.199> like<00:05:03.349> this

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.130 

it's<00:05:34.000> realism<00:05:34.510> I<00:05:35.050> would<00:05:35.860> be<00:05:36.010> right<00:05:36.370> that's<00:05:37.140> to

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
it's realism I would be right that's to

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.450 
it's realism I would be right that's to
