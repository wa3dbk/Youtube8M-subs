advanced stuff like Phrygian mode well

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.570 
advanced stuff like Phrygian mode well
that's<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.710> minor<00:04:27.920> scale<00:04:28.190> but<00:04:28.340> it's<00:04:28.430> got<00:04:28.550> a

lowered second degree it's kind of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.390 
lowered second degree it's kind of
difficult<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.320> get<00:04:30.470> into<00:04:30.500> phrasing<00:04:31.130> with<00:04:31.250> that

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
talking about diminished chords well the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.850 
talking about diminished chords well the
car<00:05:08.570> monic<00:05:08.810> minor<00:05:08.990> has<00:05:09.230> on<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.620> Rays

car monic minor has on the Rays

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.110 
car monic minor has on the Rays
seventh-degree<00:05:10.370> there's<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.790> diminished

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
seventh-degree there's a diminished

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.860 
seventh-degree there's a diminished
chord<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.990> that<00:05:12.050> step<00:05:12.670> but<00:05:13.750> then<00:05:14.750> it's

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
chord on that on that step but then it's

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.210 
chord on that on that step but then it's
talk<00:05:15.080> about<00:05:15.290> diminished<00:05:15.620> scales<00:05:15.860> that's<00:05:16.130> a

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
talk about diminished scales that's a

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.530 
talk about diminished scales that's a
really<00:05:16.550> difficult<00:05:16.700> thing<00:05:16.880> to<00:05:17.030> phrase<00:05:17.360> with

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
really difficult thing to phrase with

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.640 
really difficult thing to phrase with
like<00:05:17.690> if<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:17.870> if<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.140> don't<00:05:18.290> even<00:05:18.440> know<00:05:18.530> what

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
like if you if you don't even know what

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.320 
like if you if you don't even know what
Phrygian<00:05:19.010> mode<00:05:19.040> is<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.970> chance<00:05:20.210> of<00:05:20.270> you

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
Phrygian mode is the chance of you

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.670 
Phrygian mode is the chance of you
really<00:05:20.660> be<00:05:20.750> able<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.960> phrase<00:05:21.230> and<00:05:21.500> use

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
really be able to phrase and use

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.130 
really be able to phrase and use
diminished<00:05:22.370> scale<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:22.880> almost<00:05:23.180> like<00:05:23.390> nil<00:05:23.750> so

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
diminished scale it's almost like nil so

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.960 
diminished scale it's almost like nil so
yeah<00:05:25.010> I<00:05:25.040> think<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.400> sounds<00:05:25.490> like<00:05:25.669> you<00:05:25.760> kind<00:05:25.940> of

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
yeah I think it sounds like you kind of

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.100 
yeah I think it sounds like you kind of
