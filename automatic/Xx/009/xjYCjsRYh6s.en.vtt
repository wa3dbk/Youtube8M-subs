knife it's even more dangerous than the
sharp<00:00:35.790> knife<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> really

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
with the old fingers so we're just

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520 
with the old fingers so we're just
moving<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.030> around<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.420> once<00:00:43.379> you've

this by the way but I can't stop myself

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.780 
this by the way but I can't stop myself
from<00:03:16.080> doing<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:17.190> slice<00:03:17.430> all<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.640> way

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
