00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.760
 I love chrysanthemums very much 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.490
 probably because I was born in the fall and 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.560
 although chrysanthemums are considered an autumn flower 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.930
 turns out to admire flowering 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.720
 chrysanthemums can be almost all year round 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.089
 just plant her at home 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.249
 and how to make the chrysanthemum at home 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.259
 blossomed tell my girlfriend nelya 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:30.319
 Murashkina Meet the mill 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.780
 live what beauty 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:34.280
 these chrysanthemums and how different they are 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.320
 I heard that chrysanthemum is generally 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.350
 unusual flower and just some 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.300
 magic yes yes you know connected with it 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.640
 and many interesting stories 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.730
 and in principle the imperial family in 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.790
 Japan is a symbol and on their coat of arms and 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.370
 the highest order is also called the order 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.680
 chrysanthemums and only the imperial family 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.100
 had the right to wear clothes with embroidered 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.490
 flower chrysanthemum 8 they even ninth 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.800
 the month is called chrysanthemum 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.710
 if a headache can be applied to 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.409
 temples chrysanthemum leaves afterwards 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.350
 chrysanthemum in the house emit phytoncides and 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.790
 cleans the air in the same way as 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.800
 coniferous plant 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.920
 June shoots can be brewed in tea and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.190
 hypertensives do it two flowers on 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.770
 cup of tea and hypertension 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.020
 let us go please tell me where 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.540
 buy chrysanthemums and how much it does not cost 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.080
 The first thing we do is buying chrysanthemum 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.120
 look at her little leaves on her flowers 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.640
 so that there are no spots 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.200
 We look at the soil so that there will not climb 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.380
 what living creatures 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.630
 if everyone is healthy we take home but all 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.670
 equals to two-week quarantine 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.360
 chrysanthemum is in almost any 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.310
 garden shops worth chrysanthemum 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.869
 approximately 50 hryvnia as correctly 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.799
 take care you teach us to 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.500
 we put on a bright place and as much as possible 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.830
 to ventilate the anode gates 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.149
 window sill temperature should be 18 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.970
 degrees in 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.459
 the hotel if the chrysanthemum is higher 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.790
 blooms quickly, that is, you need to open 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.970
 window pane enough watering loves 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.340
 plentiful but without stagnant water 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.230
 the soil will fit on the garden but literally 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.109
 to make it more nutritious 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.120
 you can go there a little bit of peat humus 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.750
 a little bit of sand to be 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.019
 looser 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.329
 and it can be several times a week 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.280
 send a bath and cool souls 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.250
 rinse this prevention against 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.220
 mites nicknames usually settle on 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.920
 the underside of foxes. where does it come from 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.319
 if she lives at home with us well we could have her 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.220
 bring he could fly out of the vents and 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.159
 then what to do 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.480
 apply this environmentally friendly 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.970
 fitoderm 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.519
 Of course I want to chrysanthemum bloomed 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.159
 longer how long will it bloom at home 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.099
 That such a plan chrysanthemum will bring 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.340
 about a month you have if the buds already 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.129
 faded friable twigs like this 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.930
 bend become loose 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.940
 ugly chrysanthemums cut under 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.160
 spine and put in a cool place 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.379
 cool place it's literally 35 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.959
 degrees before that we watered until spring 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.560
 we can and not forget this first option 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.870
 the following we cut our 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.709
 chrysanthemum in some more pot 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.750
 we change the soil to a more nutritious and 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.169
 continue to care for her fertilize 1 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.229
 weekly we water regularly and in a month 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:42.229
 one and a half two our chrysanthemum grows and 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:44.500
 on her again appear buds and 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:47.329
 this which is the second time we bloomed 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.579
 the next stage we cut it and put 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.019
 cool place all then without a trace 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.109
 she must eat too 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.659
 It turns out that the chrysanthemum home need 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.989
 1 year to replant necessarily as 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.269
 in the spring of March we bring in our 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.690
 chrysanthemum in the house transplanted more 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.639
 nutrient soil at the bottom put claydite 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.519
 and if a small pot just 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.669
 can and and pepper can usually look at 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.680
 drain holes here in this 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:18.669
 shipping container 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.370
 if there are roots then chrysanthemum 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.169
 needs a transplant take a pot 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.080
 slightly larger 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:33.600
 we put clay on the bottom then we crush 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.990
 chrysanthemum seize the right hand and 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.320
 we get here we see that the roots of april 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.660
 all com and she needs to her 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.729
 it was simply transplanted 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.000
 universal chrysanthemums are not very 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.849
 demanded we plant so that the land was 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.740
 somewhere a centimeter less than 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.650
 edge of the pot so we can well 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.810
 water and a little bit with thrombosis 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.840
 here is this primer that we add 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.400
 pot it should be wet 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.860
 preferably to know the way I have 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.210
 there was always a question here yakub acquired 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.190
 there is a lot of it 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.190
 I used for example for transplant 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.500
 chrysanthemum yes and he stayed with me 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.479
 package how to properly store tie it 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.919
 then it doesn't dry out and very well 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.560
 stored and watered around the edge of the pot so 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.460
 to some water flowed out of the drainage 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.159
 holes 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.300
 and here this water which will pour out then from 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.159
 drainage hole 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.430
 it needs to be drained or let it be there 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:36.610
 stays in 20-30 minutes if water 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.979
 not absorbed and need to drain fertilize 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.039
 by the way universal indoor 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.199
 fertilizer for flowering plants can 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:47.020
 even plant in open ground from anyone and 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.479
 surrender but true in the open field she 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.090
 may increase slightly in volume 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.750
 such chrysanthemums can be propagated 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.990
 we take cutting and cut it here 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.409
 he is already good enough on the cable 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.300
 so that there are 34 internodes on the cherenochka 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:07.990
 there is here the leaves grow this one 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:12.270
 internode then the second is the third lower 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.270
 we surely remove the leaves 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.590
 in order to better take root possible 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.990
 put even just some water there 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.810
 activated carbon and after two or three 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.120
 of the week he gives root then we plant 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.699
 Here in such a pot of it will be 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.979
 enough the same rules which are hot 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.800
 even the moon rules the cuttings only 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.349
 we put a bottle on top or 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.749
 plastic bag or greenhouse 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.360
 from under the cake in order for us to have 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:44.479
 Here is such a beautiful bushy bush 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.300
 Be sure to pinch the stem 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:50.180
 let's take here is an escape we 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.849
 take and pinch the tip when he 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.879
 on the cable 15-20 centimeters but as in 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:58.969
 In this case, we pinch the tip 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:01.789
 so it stimulates what will be from 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:04.340
 here are these side pillows leaflets 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:06.860
 beat out the shoots that is here the same 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.900
 shoots how they grow up here if we 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.710
 we won't do this chrysanthemum just 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.080
 pull out 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.289
 and will not be fluffy when jump out 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.479
 side shoots grow 10-12 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.180
 pinch them again in their 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:23.360
 queue still side shoots allowed and 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.949
 such parables packs we do 2 3 and how 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.560
 times if we properly care for 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:29.810
 chrysanthemum every time in october she 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.979
 seven cars will delight us 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.819
 yes it 's winter outside and we just have a holiday 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.169
 and the sun 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:38.169
 thank you 0
