00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.010
 There are many deep sounds in the world 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:16.570
 In England it went to Ford University Acoustics Research Center 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:22.060
 I think it is based on a questionnaire survey targeting 1.1 million people around the world 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:25.500
 Dental clinic turbines are ranked in the worst 20 unpleasant sounds 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 That sound is really that 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.340
 I say it's good because I 'm myself 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:38.560
 Hope will do 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:43.510
 Now it may not easily write a mouth gone after all stretched strength Toka Kinpyo 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:49.739
 There was a bit of saying that only the sound of that turbine was gone 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 to Cary the ras clasps a rider of 3 weeks eyes miss 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:59.180
 This dental clinic Date Tokyo blue era possible to reduce the use that sound is an ongoing patient's acquisition of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180
 It will be a great shortcut 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.090
 Clean up that unpleasant turbine noise 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.799
 Noise whitening 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:16.130
 Far from reducing the existing healing music and classic in turbine 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:19.390
 Frequency and pregnancy is different because it is not a taste to hear 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.460
 It was the cause of discomfort 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.840
 One of the reasons why turbine noise is unpleasant 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 You can get a sharp metallic sound 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.490
 So Munich Technical University in Germany 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 No frequency based on your rattan sharpness Bismarck Professor inherited 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 Also soften the sharpness towards turbine 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.770
 Furthermore, the frequency and the sound of the hearing that are in harmony with the turbine sound are inserted. 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:51.310
 Makes it hard to hear unpleasant things with the masking effect 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.310
 It was established as one healing music including the turbine book 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.900
 Actually 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.210
 Toka Well child and I used 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.250
 Very good for those who have some fear 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.880
 I think that it is kill 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.979
 Even headphones 53 that did not open the mouth 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.760
 Just listen to music 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.280
 I got an open mouth 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:24.220
 Patients to foreigners and a small children's hard to take the communication 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:30.670
 Such noise whitening is effective for such patients 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:36.130
 If you try to put on the headphones, you may not hear any sound or the children will be quiet and the mouth 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.010
 The good was because was able to smoothly can fertilizer not scare or so me open 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.750
 think 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:49.450
 It is a stand that is also old to the house and the taste that is before to exert 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.500
 Until now, there were patients who were not good at the sound of the turbine and were interrupted during the treatment 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.840
 you know 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.140
 Since such patients decreased after introducing noise whitening, it is very useful 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.140
 is 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.640
 I just checked that I really headed on that trip 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.480
 I 've been together well and it's not that key at all 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.280
 From now on without being scared a little 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.480
 I think I will go back to the dentist 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.880
 Thanks to that bgm 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:25.120
 I really can not hear a sloppy sound 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.700
 Absolutely bet Remember me the sound I'd have trees been considerably improved technology is making progress 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.330
 I could not make it happen 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.190
 There a 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:39.020
 This noise whitening will stop the wind noise as well. 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.970
 The voice the doctor is speaking reaches the patient 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.460
 It is that the place could not be clear until now 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.460
 I think that good because it is improved 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.800
 Commissioned to have to adjust the frequency to hear the voice of the people in this noise white brother 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.300
 It does not does not interfere with communication with the patient's 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.850
 The 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.150
 Headphone to the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.340
 If that media exists that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.730
 That's because I cut it 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:14.909
 Hm 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.909
 Dgm does not enter, but it is so easy to invest in sparrows and if there is a relationship under uki 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.920
 Reduce the deep sound of the turbine that has kept the patient away 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.920
 Let's improve the weekly publication ability 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.410
 Remove that discomfort and the turbine cleanly 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.410
 Noise whitening
