00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
don't break the balls okay and it should

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.429 
don't break the balls okay and it should
be<00:00:22.980> pretty<00:00:23.160> simple<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> found<00:00:25.109> inside

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
be pretty simple now what I found inside

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.220 
be pretty simple now what I found inside
is<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:26.010> packet<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:27.330> white<00:00:27.599> stuff<00:00:27.930> now

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
is a little packet this white stuff now

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.919 
is a little packet this white stuff now
what<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.060> thermal<00:00:30.689> grease

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
what this is is just the thermal grease

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.000 
what this is is just the thermal grease
that<00:00:31.260> goes<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.260> connectors<00:00:34.260> okay<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:37.010> all

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
that goes on the connectors okay now all

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.280 
that goes on the connectors okay now all
you're<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> take<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:40.230> these

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
you're going to do is take some of these

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
you're going to do is take some of these
thermal<00:00:40.710> grease<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.480> put<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
thermal grease and put it and put a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
thermal grease and put it and put a
whole<00:00:42.840> bunch<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.770> say<00:00:44.000> this

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
whole bunch of it I would say this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
whole bunch of it I would say this
candle<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.360> squeezed<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> little<00:00:46.050> bit<00:00:46.370> into

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
candle I squeezed a little bit into

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
candle I squeezed a little bit into
those<00:00:47.520> connectors<00:00:48.030> there's<00:00:48.629> three<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> them

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
those connectors there's three of them

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.310 
those connectors there's three of them
okay<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> does<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
okay and all that does is that it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.250 
okay and all that does is that it
prevents<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> connector<00:00:53.340> from<00:00:53.520> getting<00:00:53.879> hot

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
prevents the connector from getting hot

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.770 
prevents the connector from getting hot
from<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> bulb<00:00:55.649> itself<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:58.489> mean<00:00:59.780> these

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
from the bulb itself so I mean these

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
from the bulb itself so I mean these
obviously<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.469> hot<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:02.100> bit<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.399> mean<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
obviously get hot a little bit I mean it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.750 
obviously get hot a little bit I mean it
gets<00:01:02.850> transferred<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.660> mean<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> OEM<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.519> not

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
gets transferred I mean the OEM is not

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.420 
gets transferred I mean the OEM is not
it<00:01:06.000> doesn't<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.689> hot<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.130> 55

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it doesn't get very hot there are 55

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
it doesn't get very hot there are 55
watts<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.150> within<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.750> maximum<00:01:10.229> range

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
watts that's within the maximum range

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
watts that's within the maximum range
but<00:01:10.680> these<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.010> 80<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
but these are 80 so they are going to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
but these are 80 so they are going to
get<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.229> hotter<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> be

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
get a little hotter so you want to be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
get a little hotter so you want to be
sure<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.950> stuff<00:01:17.159> doesn't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
sure that you know this stuff doesn't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.660 
sure that you know this stuff doesn't
get<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.619> nut<00:01:19.860> connector<00:01:20.100> doesn't<00:01:20.549> get

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
get that this nut connector doesn't get

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.870 
get that this nut connector doesn't get
melted<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.659> he's<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:22.880> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
melted as you can see he's got that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.359 
melted as you can see he's got that
plastic<00:01:24.439> it's<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:26.750> in<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
plastic it's all in there so you want to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.080 
plastic it's all in there so you want to
be<00:01:29.460> sure<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> thermal<00:01:30.509> grease<00:01:32.090> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
be sure you use that thermal grease so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.160 
be sure you use that thermal grease so
in<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:34.500> case<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.840> doesn't

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
in this case you know this one doesn't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.620 
in this case you know this one doesn't
really<00:01:37.200> require<00:01:37.590> anything<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.540> I'm

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
really require anything so what I'm

really require anything so what I'm
going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> apply<00:01:41.600> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
going to do is I'm going to apply that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
going to do is I'm going to apply that
thermal<00:01:43.049> grease<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.299> connector<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:46.520> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
thermal grease in the connector now that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.310 
thermal grease in the connector now that
way<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.270> able<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:52.070> put<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> light

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
way that way I'm able to put the light

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.420 
way that way I'm able to put the light
if<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> arrange<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.340> way<00:01:56.399> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
if you can arrange it here that way I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.480 
if you can arrange it here that way I
can<00:01:56.579> hold<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> camera<00:01:57.409> with<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> other

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
can hold the camera with the other

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.640 
can hold the camera with the other
and<00:02:00.700> while<00:02:01.390> I'm<00:02:01.510> squeezing<00:02:01.870> this<00:02:02.140> stuff<00:02:02.500> in

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
and while I'm squeezing this stuff in

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.639 
and while I'm squeezing this stuff in
here<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:05.610> I'll<00:02:06.610> show<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.880> what<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.180> mean<00:02:07.649> now

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
here so I'll show you what I mean now

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.030 
here so I'll show you what I mean now
you<00:02:09.190> can<00:02:09.340> see<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.610> connector<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.179> there<00:02:10.450> I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
you can see the connector is there I

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.780 
you can see the connector is there I
already<00:02:12.040> cut<00:02:12.370> portion<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:14.850> sleeve<00:02:16.770> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
already cut portion of that sleeve and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.080 
already cut portion of that sleeve and
there<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:20.130> mean<00:02:21.130> don't<00:02:21.250> overdo<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.730> just

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
there this I mean don't overdo I just

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.620 
there this I mean don't overdo I just
put<00:02:23.080> enough<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:26.050> where<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.180> squeeze

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
put enough to where we just squeeze

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.100 
put enough to where we just squeeze
enough<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.530> can<00:02:29.680> see<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:31.690> way<00:02:31.810> when<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.080> put

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
enough you can see that way when you put

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.740 
enough you can see that way when you put
the<00:02:32.350> connector<00:02:32.680> into<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> light<00:02:33.750> you're

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the connector into the light you're

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.800 
the connector into the light you're
going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.959> be<00:02:35.050> able<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:36.300> into<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.420> bulb<00:02:37.630> you're

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
going to be able to into the bulb you're

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.009 
going to be able to into the bulb you're
going<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.050> be<00:02:38.140> able<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:39.330> not<00:02:40.330> have<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.570> have

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
going to be able to not have it have

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.350 
going to be able to not have it have
this<00:02:41.200> white<00:02:41.830> stuff<00:02:42.130> all<00:02:42.370> over<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.640> place<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
this white stuff all over the place so I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.910 
this white stuff all over the place so I
mean<00:02:46.360> you'll<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.959> able<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.320> tell<00:02:47.500> when<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.709> see

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
mean you'll be able to tell when you see

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.979 
mean you'll be able to tell when you see
enough<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:49.030> actually<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.510> feels<00:02:49.810> that

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
enough it actually just feels that

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.270 
enough it actually just feels that
little<00:02:50.260> hole<00:02:51.000> okay<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.030> did<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.450> same<00:02:52.630> here<00:02:53.280> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
little hole okay I did the same here so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.479 
little hole okay I did the same here so
just<00:02:54.790> leave<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.150> resting<00:02:55.600> on<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.810> side

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
just leave it resting on the side

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.770 
just leave it resting on the side
they're<00:02:57.489> going<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.730> hurt<00:02:57.850> anything<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.510> I

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
they're going to hurt anything and I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.780 
they're going to hurt anything and I
still<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.230> some<00:02:59.440> more<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.370> don't<00:03:00.550> have<00:03:00.580> to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
still have some more you don't have to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.940 
still have some more you don't have to
overdo<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.390> could<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.569> throw<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.739> away

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
overdo it you could just throw this away

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.650 
overdo it you could just throw this away
don't<00:03:03.280> use<00:03:03.489> this<00:03:03.640> grease<00:03:03.940> or<00:03:04.150> anything<00:03:04.180> else

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
don't use this grease or anything else

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.289 
don't use this grease or anything else
it<00:03:04.870> just<00:03:05.650> flows<00:03:06.090> slowly<00:03:07.090> for<00:03:07.510> these<00:03:07.750> stuff<00:03:09.299> so

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
it just flows slowly for these stuff so

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.370 
it just flows slowly for these stuff so
I'm<00:03:10.360> just<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.750> put<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.049> more<00:03:11.290> on

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
I'm just going to put a little more on

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.600 
I'm just going to put a little more on
this<00:03:11.530> one<00:03:13.769> like<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.890> said<00:03:15.160> don't<00:03:15.310> have<00:03:15.489> to

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
this one like I said don't have to

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.199 
this one like I said don't have to
overdo<00:03:15.850> it

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
overdo it

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.050 
overdo it
it's<00:03:17.140> just<00:03:17.470> for<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.680> thermal<00:03:18.370> protection<00:03:18.820> of

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
it's just for a thermal protection of

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.900 
it's just for a thermal protection of
the<00:03:19.180> plug<00:03:19.739> because<00:03:20.739> those<00:03:21.190> light<00:03:21.489> bulbs<00:03:21.790> are

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
the plug because those light bulbs are

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.160 
the plug because those light bulbs are
going<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.120> get<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.510> little<00:03:22.840> hot<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:25.049> what<00:03:26.049> I'm

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
going to get a little hot so what I'm

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.009 
going to get a little hot so what I'm
going<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.410> do<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.570> you're<00:03:28.570> going<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.840> put

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
going to do is that you're going to put

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.009 
going to do is that you're going to put
this<00:03:29.170> here<00:03:30.150> we're<00:03:31.150> from<00:03:31.360> everything<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.790> I

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
this here we're from everything and I

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.620 
this here we're from everything and I
mean<00:03:35.019> as<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.290> see<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.739> difference<00:03:36.630> it's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
mean as you can see the difference it's

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.110 
mean as you can see the difference it's
if<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.530> put<00:03:38.739> this<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.950> ball<00:03:39.220> next<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.850> one

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
if you put this a ball next to this one

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.789 
if you put this a ball next to this one
I<00:03:40.860> mean<00:03:41.860> even<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.989> will<00:03:43.989> see<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.470> actual

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
I mean even I will see that the actual

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.380 
I mean even I will see that the actual
diameter<00:03:44.980> may<00:03:45.519> be<00:03:45.579> a<00:03:45.700> little<00:03:45.940> larger<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.650> I

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
diameter may be a little larger so I

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.009 
diameter may be a little larger so I
mean<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.900> could<00:03:50.079> tell<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.380> difference<00:03:50.910> so

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
mean you could tell the difference so

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.030 
mean you could tell the difference so
the<00:03:53.019> construction<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.709> even<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:54.010> little

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
the construction is even a little

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.449 
the construction is even a little
different<00:03:54.519> but<00:03:54.640> I<00:03:54.850> think<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.540> going<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.720> be<00:03:55.870> a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
different but I think it's going to be a

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.240 
different but I think it's going to be a
maybe<00:03:57.459> not<00:03:57.670> something<00:03:57.970> major<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.769> I'm<00:04:00.070> going

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
maybe not something major but I'm going

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.380 
maybe not something major but I'm going
to<00:04:00.280> be<00:04:00.400> gaining<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.200> little<00:04:02.440> more<00:04:03.390> light

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
to be gaining just a little more light

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.060 
to be gaining just a little more light
and<00:04:04.859> I<00:04:05.859> mean<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.340> goes<00:04:06.600> running<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.750> those<00:04:08.070> so

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
and I mean it goes running to those so

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.310 
and I mean it goes running to those so
the<00:04:09.880> cops<00:04:10.120> will<00:04:10.329> not<00:04:10.510> even<00:04:10.720> be<00:04:10.810> able<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:11.049> tell

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
the cops will not even be able to tell

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.400 
the cops will not even be able to tell
that<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:13.060> have<00:04:13.269> them

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
that you have them

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.250 
that you have them
even<00:04:14.980> though<00:04:15.100> they're<00:04:15.280> going<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.490> be<00:04:16.260> brighter

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
even though they're going to be brighter

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.550 
even though they're going to be brighter
so<00:04:18.070> anyway<00:04:18.760> once<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.209> put<00:04:19.390> them<00:04:19.480> on<00:04:19.630> out<00:04:19.810> I'll

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
so anyway once I put them on out I'll

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.290 
so anyway once I put them on out I'll
start<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.040> video<00:04:21.190> again<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.609> then<00:04:21.940> I'll<00:04:22.090> show

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
start a video again and then I'll show

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.630 
start a video again and then I'll show
you<00:04:22.360> guys<00:04:22.540> how<00:04:22.600> they<00:04:22.900> look<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.920> compare<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.520> to

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
you guys how they look and compare it to

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.610 
you guys how they look and compare it to
the<00:04:24.760> other<00:04:24.940> portion<00:04:25.390> of<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.600> video<00:04:25.900> open<00:04:26.440> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the other portion of the video open to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.190 
the other portion of the video open to
two<00:04:27.520> browser<00:04:27.970> pages<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.600> can<00:04:28.750> put<00:04:28.960> right

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
two browser pages and you can put right

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.110 
two browser pages and you can put right
next<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.590> each<00:04:29.710> other<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.820> should<00:04:31.030> be

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
next to each other and you should be

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.690 
next to each other and you should be
able<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.390> see<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> difference<00:04:32.140> okay<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.250> let

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
able to see the difference okay so let

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.560 
able to see the difference okay so let
me<00:04:33.730> get<00:04:33.910> this<00:04:34.060> back<00:04:34.540> on<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:37.180> know<00:04:37.270> like<00:04:37.450> I

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
me get this back on and you know like I

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
was actually fit right on one thing I

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.680 
was actually fit right on one thing I
wanted<00:05:26.140> to<00:05:26.200> mention<00:05:26.440> is<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:28.300> lights<00:05:28.540> are

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
wanted to mention is that the lights are

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.750 
wanted to mention is that the lights are
not<00:05:28.810> going<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.050> fit<00:05:29.260> perfectly<00:05:29.830> straight<00:05:30.550> like

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
not going to fit perfectly straight like

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.810 
not going to fit perfectly straight like
the<00:05:30.970> pin<00:05:31.300> going<00:05:32.229> up<00:05:32.470> straight<00:05:32.830> up<00:05:32.860> he's<00:05:33.640> going

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
the pin going up straight up he's going

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.909 
the pin going up straight up he's going
to<00:05:33.880> go<00:05:34.000> like<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.330> little<00:05:34.900> bit<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.290> side<00:05:35.530> okay

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
to go like a little bit to the side okay

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.860 
to go like a little bit to the side okay
so<00:05:35.979> just<00:05:36.220> keep<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.520> in<00:05:36.580> mind<00:05:36.700> it<00:05:37.510> actually

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
so just keep that in mind it actually

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.440 
so just keep that in mind it actually
happened<00:05:38.229> on<00:05:38.320> both<00:05:38.800> of<00:05:39.040> them

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
happened on both of them

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.390 
happened on both of them
you<00:05:41.080> can<00:05:41.229> hardly<00:05:41.500> tell<00:05:41.590> because<00:05:41.979> I<00:05:42.220> put

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
you can hardly tell because I put

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.630 
you can hardly tell because I put
everything<00:05:42.580> back<00:05:42.820> already<00:05:44.970> but<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:48.220> actual

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
everything back already but the actual

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.340 
everything back already but the actual
difference<00:05:49.330> I<00:05:50.160> mean<00:05:51.160> you<00:05:51.310> could<00:05:51.430> tell<00:05:51.610> that

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
difference I mean you could tell that

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
mean if you look at the other portion

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.490 
mean if you look at the other portion
I'm<00:06:04.990> going<00:06:05.140> to<00:06:05.200> try<00:06:05.410> to<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:06.370> split<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.850> video

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
I'm going to try to to split the video

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.050 
I'm going to try to to split the video
and<00:06:08.500> put<00:06:08.740> them<00:06:08.830> right<00:06:09.010> next<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.370> each<00:06:09.460> other

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
and put them right next to each other

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.820 
and put them right next to each other
make<00:06:10.330> sure<00:06:10.479> you<00:06:10.600> gotta<00:06:10.750> try<00:06:10.990> to<00:06:11.020> do<00:06:11.229> that<00:06:13.830> but

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
make sure you gotta try to do that but

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
I'm not sure if I can do it but if you

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.450 
I'm not sure if I can do it but if you
guys<00:06:16.690> want<00:06:16.930> to<00:06:17.050> see<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.260> difference<00:06:17.650> you

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
guys want to see the difference you

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.560 
guys want to see the difference you
could<00:06:18.610> actually<00:06:18.760> just<00:06:19.090> open<00:06:19.450> to<00:06:20.610> two<00:06:21.610> browser

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
could actually just open to two browser

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.200 
could actually just open to two browser
windows<00:06:22.750> and<00:06:23.289> replay<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:23.770> video<00:06:23.919> twice<00:06:24.370> and

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
windows and replay the video twice and

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.320 
windows and replay the video twice and
you<00:06:25.479> see<00:06:25.720> you'll<00:06:26.110> see<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:27.550> difference<00:06:27.970> just

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
you see you'll see the difference just

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.899 
you see you'll see the difference just
just<00:06:28.569> force<00:06:28.840> it<00:06:29.020> when<00:06:29.770> it<00:06:29.889> gets<00:06:30.009> to<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:30.400> when

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
just force it when it gets to the when

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.629 
just force it when it gets to the when
I'm<00:06:31.030> actually<00:06:31.180> shining<00:06:32.159> their<00:06:33.159> light<00:06:33.370> into

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
I'm actually shining their light into

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.040 
I'm actually shining their light into
the<00:06:33.759> camera<00:06:34.120> and<00:06:34.150> you'll<00:06:34.360> see<00:06:34.569> the<00:06:34.659> difference

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
the camera and you'll see the difference

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.730 
the camera and you'll see the difference
I<00:06:35.259> mean<00:06:35.919> the<00:06:36.039> lights<00:06:36.460> are<00:06:36.610> white<00:06:37.440> and<00:06:38.440> I<00:06:38.530> think

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
I mean the lights are white and I think

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.969 
I mean the lights are white and I think
that<00:06:38.860> night<00:06:39.099> is<00:06:39.250> going<00:06:39.430> to<00:06:39.520> be<00:06:39.870> one<00:06:40.870> one<00:06:41.800> big

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
that night is going to be one one big

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.159 
that night is going to be one one big
difference<00:06:42.159> so<00:06:42.639> anyways<00:06:43.599> that's<00:06:43.930> what<00:06:44.050> I

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
difference so anyways that's what I

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.800 
difference so anyways that's what I
wanted<00:06:44.379> to<00:06:44.500> show<00:06:44.680> you<00:06:44.740> guys<00:06:44.949> and<00:06:45.250> the

wanted to show you guys and the

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.879 
wanted to show you guys and the
installation<00:06:46.810> is<00:06:46.900> simple<00:06:47.050> to<00:06:47.409> replace<00:06:47.560> him

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
installation is simple to replace him

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.980 
installation is simple to replace him
and<00:06:47.979> it<00:06:48.099> probably<00:06:48.310> took<00:06:48.580> me<00:06:48.960> including<00:06:49.960> the

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
and it probably took me including the

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.230 
and it probably took me including the
video<00:06:50.349> probably<00:06:50.590> took<00:06:50.800> me<00:06:50.889> ten<00:06:51.129> minutes<00:06:51.430> so

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
video probably took me ten minutes so

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.369 
video probably took me ten minutes so
it's<00:06:52.960> not<00:06:53.080> a<00:06:53.199> long<00:06:53.440> time<00:06:54.479> anyways<00:06:55.479> until<00:06:55.810> the

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:56.379 
it's not a long time anyways until the

okay<00:07:01.750> guys<00:07:01.960> I'm<00:07:02.199> back<00:07:02.229> I<00:07:02.789> actually<00:07:03.789> figure<00:07:04.780> I

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
okay guys I'm back I actually figure I

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.409 
okay guys I'm back I actually figure I
do<00:07:05.069> the<00:07:06.069> comparison<00:07:06.699> this<00:07:06.849> way<00:07:07.120> I<00:07:07.150> actually

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419 
do the comparison this way I actually

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:14.129 
do the comparison this way I actually
turned<00:07:07.900> on<00:07:08.050> my<00:07:08.610> my<00:07:09.610> fault<00:07:09.909> light<00:07:10.120> and<00:07:13.110> you<00:07:14.110> can

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
turned on my my fault light and you can

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.149 
turned on my my fault light and you can
see<00:07:15.900> you<00:07:16.900> know<00:07:17.020> the<00:07:17.139> fog<00:07:17.349> lights<00:07:17.590> are<00:07:17.740> yellow

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
see you know the fog lights are yellow

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.430 
see you know the fog lights are yellow
and<00:07:18.819> the<00:07:19.719> other<00:07:19.870> ones

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
and the other ones

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.270 
and the other ones
our<00:07:21.830> blue<00:07:22.280> white<00:07:23.200> so<00:07:24.200> they<00:07:24.650> actually<00:07:24.830> sign

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 
our blue white so they actually sign

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.240 
our blue white so they actually sign
almost<00:07:25.640> the<00:07:25.760> same<00:07:26.320> so<00:07:27.320> I<00:07:27.350> would<00:07:27.800> think<00:07:27.920> the<00:07:28.070> fog

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250 
almost the same so I would think the fog

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.980 
almost the same so I would think the fog
lights<00:07:28.490> are<00:07:28.670> a<00:07:29.530> little<00:07:30.530> more<00:07:31.600> or<00:07:32.600> a<00:07:32.720> little

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
lights are a little more or a little

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.010 
lights are a little more or a little
brighter<00:07:33.260> than<00:07:34.250> the<00:07:34.460> headlight<00:07:34.820> so<00:07:35.060> I<00:07:35.330> figure

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.020 
brighter than the headlight so I figure

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.920 
brighter than the headlight so I figure
I<00:07:36.110> show<00:07:36.290> you<00:07:36.320> guys<00:07:36.620> this<00:07:36.860> and<00:07:38.140> and<00:07:39.550> then<00:07:40.930> you

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 
browser or I'll try to somehow split the

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.880
