Metro<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> only<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Metro but this is the only one I have is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.290 
Metro but this is the only one I have is
Crysis<00:00:42.510> 3<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> top<00:00:44.430> left

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
Crysis 3 so right now at the top left

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.340 
Crysis 3 so right now at the top left
I<00:00:45.440> have<00:00:46.440> fraps<00:00:47.399> running<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.120> recording<00:00:49.110> with

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I have fraps running I'm recording with

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.979 
I have fraps running I'm recording with
the<00:00:49.829> Elgato<00:00:50.579> Game<00:00:51.210> Capture<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:53.899> whether<00:00:54.899> or

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the Elgato Game Capture so whether or

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.590 
the Elgato Game Capture so whether or
not<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.379> recording<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
not I'm recording or not it will not it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.680 
not I'm recording or not it will not it
doesn't<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:57.960> affect<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:59.250> performance<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
doesn't really affect the performance so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
doesn't really affect the performance so
this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.449> type

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
this is how this is the this is the type

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
this is how this is the this is the type
of<00:01:03.690> performance<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.439> would<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.739> even<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of performance you would get even if I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450 
of performance you would get even if I
wasn't<00:01:05.580> even<00:01:05.790> recording<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.770> got<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> pretty

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
wasn't even recording so I got it pretty

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.840 
wasn't even recording so I got it pretty
much<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.909> got<00:01:09.119> everything<00:01:09.630> maxed<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.850> except

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
much I got everything maxed out except

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.260 
much I got everything maxed out except
for<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.970> anti-aliasing<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
for the the anti-aliasing the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
for the the anti-aliasing the
anti-aliasing<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:16.860> FX<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.830> but

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
anti-aliasing I got it at FX a a but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.310 
anti-aliasing I got it at FX a a but
everything<00:01:20.220> else<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.930> completely<00:01:21.930> maxed

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
everything else is just completely maxed

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.280 
everything else is just completely maxed
out<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.070> noticed<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> don't<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:24.990> notice

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
out I noticed that I don't really notice

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.070 
out I noticed that I don't really notice
a<00:01:25.470> difference<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.700> anti<00:01:27.060> look<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.630> notice

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a difference in the anti look I notice

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.929 
a difference in the anti look I notice
up<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.320> helicopters<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:30.060> flickering<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
up these helicopters I get flickering I

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
up these helicopters I get flickering I
have<00:01:32.939> vsync<00:01:33.479> off<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> goes

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
have vsync off so I can see if it goes

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.020 
have vsync off so I can see if it goes
higher<00:01:35.310> than<00:01:35.549> 60<00:01:35.970> frames<00:01:36.240> per<00:01:36.360> second

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
higher than 60 frames per second

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.410 
higher than 60 frames per second
and<00:01:39.190> that's<00:01:40.190> about<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.549> but<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:40.970> haven't<00:01:41.180> really

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
and that's about it but I haven't really

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.730 
and that's about it but I haven't really
noticed<00:01:41.540> any<00:01:42.020> difference<00:01:42.500> in<00:01:42.650> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
noticed any difference in the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.149 
noticed any difference in the
anti-aliasing<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:43.880> FX<00:01:44.810> AAA<00:01:45.080> just<00:01:45.500> runs<00:01:45.860> so

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
anti-aliasing and FX AAA just runs so

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.830 
anti-aliasing and FX AAA just runs so
much<00:01:46.400> better<00:01:46.759> that's<00:01:47.030> why<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.330> left<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.750> on

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
much better that's why I left it on

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.490 
much better that's why I left it on
there<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.520> wanted<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.610> give<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:49.880> real<00:01:50.500> in-game

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
there I wanted to give you real in-game

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.910 
there I wanted to give you real in-game
performance<00:01:52.310> how<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.610> would<00:01:53.030> play<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.390> game

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
performance how I would play the game

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.359 
performance how I would play the game
let's<00:01:55.369> see<00:01:55.640> but<00:01:55.909> that's<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:58.009> I'm<00:01:58.130> having

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
let's see but that's in the I'm having

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.539 
let's see but that's in the I'm having
those<00:01:58.640> gaming<00:01:59.030> editions<00:01:59.720> as<00:02:00.050> my<00:02:01.009> graphics

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
those gaming editions as my graphics

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.719 
those gaming editions as my graphics

it<00:02:05.720> runs<00:02:05.960> pretty<00:02:06.290> cool<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.880> notice<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.509> gets

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
it runs pretty cool it I notice it gets

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.070 
it runs pretty cool it I notice it gets
hotter<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.229> crossfire<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:11.420> them<00:02:11.600> the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
hotter and crossfire I have them the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.699 
hotter and crossfire I have them the

as<00:02:15.860> much<00:02:16.070> as<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.310> would<00:02:16.519> if<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.790> were<00:02:16.880> just

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
as much as I would if it were just
