so<00:00:00.570> you<00:00:00.630> came<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> hear<00:00:01.410> about<00:00:01.560> how<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.949> manage

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so you came to hear about how to manage

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
so you came to hear about how to manage
stress<00:00:02.669> right<00:00:04.160> what's<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.279> simple<00:00:05.549> definition

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
stress right what's a simple definition

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
stress right what's a simple definition
of<00:00:06.480> stress<00:00:07.940> where<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.120> demand<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:10.050> higher

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
of stress where the demand is higher

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.600 
of stress where the demand is higher
than<00:00:10.830> your<00:00:11.870> capacity<00:00:12.870> or<00:00:13.080> your<00:00:13.259> energy<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.400> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
than your capacity or your energy is it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.129 
than your capacity or your energy is it
when<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.240> feel<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:15.660> too<00:00:15.900> many<00:00:16.020> things

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
when you feel you have too many things

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.349 
when you feel you have too many things
to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.369> don't<00:00:17.609> feel<00:00:17.820> like<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.180> have

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
to do and you don't feel like you have

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.540 
to do and you don't feel like you have
enough<00:00:18.390> energy<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.529> meet<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.980> demand<00:00:21.470> right

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
enough energy to meet the demand right

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.189 
enough energy to meet the demand right
so<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.699> need<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.000> figure<00:00:24.210> out<00:00:24.359> how<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> increase

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
so we need to figure out how to increase

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.519

energy<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:26.010> our<00:00:26.160> life<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.840> how<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.869> conserve

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
energy in our life and how to conserve

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.659 
energy in our life and how to conserve
energy<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:31.109> number<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.800> before<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.369> go<00:00:32.399> any

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
energy so number one before we go any

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.090 
energy so number one before we go any
further<00:00:32.910> one<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> things<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.559> take<00:00:34.860> away
