00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi friends with you alexey this is the second 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.600
 part of what pisses me off am a little 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.240
 pony friendship is magic now we are 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.519
 talk about the second season of the upper edition 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.650
 you took enough 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.210
 enthusiastically therefore I write down 2 write 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 comments that infuriates you in the second 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.020
 season or if you disagree with my 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.699
 point of view, too, write okay 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.619
 drove and start from the first 2 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.260
 serial about descor he gives dry money 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.969
 and I personally really like these two 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.870
 I will revise the series with pleasure 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.850
 but annoying me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.879
 well rather than annoying 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.500
 straining and raises questions a 1 why 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.780
 celestia it does not help 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.579
 inside actually she already has experience 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 fighting this monster called 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.960
 discord and somehow that 's why she 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 locks left here this picture by the way 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.879
 shows very well how celeste herself 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.410
 sometimes leads throughout this season 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.430
 liked in general, that is why here at 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.110
 from you the sun raises the devil take me 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.090
 then your help would be just 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.159
 By the way, Noah Discord also the hub yet 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.290
 for some reason, when it came itself 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.390
 already kill and for some reason he doesn't 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.310
 did not take note of what they 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.830
 actually they already have elements of harmony 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 have they already recovered from that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.390
 witchcraft which they imposed more 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.369
 so some nonsense from this 2 serial not 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.409
 getting worse 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.520
 test taste to show loves and series me 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.799
 just for the soul takes as aka kra within 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.710
 finds a job that made sweetie 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.650
 belle awesome series me she is very 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.049
 like but a little annoying again 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.049
 a little annoying and bitchy behavior 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.110
 release i personally me this is when i'm not 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.970
 watched season 4 no bit caused 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.390
 questions why is she so shitty 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.220
 leads and our generosity and somehow strange 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 well after not care after sweetie belle in 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.020
 fourth season, I realized that it was still 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.719
 garbage taste hotter step hu-100 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.939
 I will go on this list because well 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.220
 after all, everything will lead in an inappropriate way 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.100
 the basics of mayor duval 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.500
 This whole series is terribly annoying because 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.000
 upper behavior rainbow dash callers 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.590
 Probe sleep there behaved 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.890
 secondly some strange things happen 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.660
 things in Ponville then this balcony will fall with 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.640
 these old men then strollers come together 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.940
 breakage somehow annoying as always 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.130
 far-fetched I don't like it 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.290
 heri rarely reconsider sexy 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.290
 secret of maya xs 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.590
 again a series about how a spike suddenly 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.780
 our grow with this became terribly greedy 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.630
 don't know i don't like the idea of ​​that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.570
 that he just grew up so well, in short to me 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.750
 just episode did not like strains 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.000
 I have all this basics last round up 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.020
 I can not stand this series because 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.860
 behavior and jay in it just 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.970
 disgusting 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.590
 First, well, she did not win on 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.420
 competition she has 2 place but not 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.530
 so do all friends when they to 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.040
 she came to them so coolly 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.870
 I ignored it very much 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.150
 I really liked this series 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.820
 I can look honest because well, not 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.209
 I know somehow unjustifiably yes and behavior 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.459
 of these here's how you understand when they 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.380
 send it to the competition also not 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.500
 very beautiful as well as the moment when 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.420
 she jumped over the train and she 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.430
 jump over shoots well and go 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.380
 further to break away from them there is no table 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.820
 look at this train happy about something that 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.709
 they are cut off there 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.540
 but this time they will pass you catch up 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.140
 Well, delirium is some honest word I do not like 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.540
 this series 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.769
 but sometimes I reconsider because 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.269
 that I marital dance and chatting is all good 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.190
 in this series but this dog and which 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.740
 was supposed to protect the world of Saratov Tartar 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.900
 of which 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.790
 jumped out suddenly where are they from 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.310
 Ponyville how well very much like a tightly 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.020
 in general all of a sudden so but somehow not 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.860
 fit, but although the US Navy its cool 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.590
 then say smooth dragon quest 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.270
 episode dislikes episode in many ways 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.770
 thanks to this disgusting character 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.050
 the dragon who you met met there 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.670
 here in these here on the volcanoes terrible 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.760
 character's opinion did not like creepy 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.980
 so I look here very rarely and to me he 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.260
 I don't like it but you said everything to me 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.080
