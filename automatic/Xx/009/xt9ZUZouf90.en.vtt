skyhook<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.799> probably<00:02:05.219> working<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> lot<00:02:05.729> better

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
skyhook is probably working a lot better

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.850 
skyhook is probably working a lot better
than<00:02:06.119> GPS<00:02:06.540> because<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.229> allow<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.649> wife

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
than GPS because there's allow a wife

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.800 
than GPS because there's allow a wife
festivals<00:02:08.429> around<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.270> obviously<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:09.750> you're

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
festivals around but obviously if you're

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
festivals around but obviously if you're
the<00:02:09.929> wilderness<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.619> where<00:02:10.770> GPS<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.459> going

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the wilderness that's where GPS is going

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.180 
the wilderness that's where GPS is going
to<00:02:11.730> kick<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.080> work<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.470> lot<00:02:13.620> better<00:02:13.739> but

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
to kick in and work a lot better but

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.070 
to kick in and work a lot better but
they<00:02:14.340> both<00:02:14.489> work<00:02:14.819> together<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.569> harmony<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
they both work together in harmony and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.369 
they both work together in harmony and
it<00:02:16.709> gives<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> lot<00:02:17.370> better<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:18.379> exact

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
it gives you a lot better on exact

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.380 
it gives you a lot better on exact
location<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:20.640> pretty<00:02:20.819> cool<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:23.390> next

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
location so that's pretty cool and next

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.820 
location so that's pretty cool and next
that's<00:02:24.870> pretty<00:02:25.050> much<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:25.260> i<00:02:25.319> got<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830

and<00:06:09.750> other<00:06:10.750> than<00:06:10.900> that<00:06:11.080> I<00:06:11.410> haven't<00:06:11.740> really

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
and other than that I haven't really

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.620 
and other than that I haven't really
gone<00:06:12.070> deep<00:06:12.400> into<00:06:12.700> looking<00:06:13.060> into<00:06:13.300> all<00:06:13.510> the

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
gone deep into looking into all the

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.450 
gone deep into looking into all the
instincts<00:06:14.050> faults<00:06:14.440> via<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:14.950> iphone<00:06:14.980> but

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
instincts faults via the iphone but

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.550 
instincts faults via the iphone but
obviously<00:06:15.790> iphone<00:06:16.120> has<00:06:16.560> third-party

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
obviously iphone has third-party

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.070 
obviously iphone has third-party
application<00:06:18.250> downloading<00:06:18.820> now<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.900> has<00:06:20.050> a

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
application downloading now it has a

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.590 
application downloading now it has a
much<00:06:20.320> much<00:06:21.190> better<00:06:21.430> in<00:06:21.670> interface<00:06:22.300> from<00:06:22.480> what

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
much much better in interface from what

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.430 
much much better in interface from what
I've<00:06:22.690> seen<00:06:22.720> as<00:06:23.470> a<00:06:23.530> bigger<00:06:23.950> screen<00:06:24.430> and<00:06:26.070> YouTube

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
I've seen as a bigger screen and YouTube

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.580 
I've seen as a bigger screen and YouTube
now<00:06:29.440> it<00:06:29.590> has<00:06:29.710> 3g<00:06:30.010> which<00:06:30.460> is<00:06:30.640> great<00:06:31.300> and<00:06:31.690> here

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
now it has 3g which is great and here

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.320 
now it has 3g which is great and here
here's<00:06:33.160> where<00:06:33.370> I<00:06:33.400> think<00:06:33.700> the<00:06:33.790> instinct<00:06:34.150> Falls

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
here's where I think the instinct Falls

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.510 
here's where I think the instinct Falls
Way<00:06:34.570> behind<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:36.490> come<00:06:36.790> it<00:06:37.360> runs<00:06:37.750> on<00:06:37.840> SD<00:06:38.520> memory

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
Way behind it come it runs on SD memory

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.850 
Way behind it come it runs on SD memory
and<00:06:40.320> it<00:06:41.320> only<00:06:41.440> goes<00:06:41.680> from<00:06:41.890> 2<00:06:42.160> to<00:06:42.190> 8<00:06:42.550> gigabytes

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
and it only goes from 2 to 8 gigabytes

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.520 
and it only goes from 2 to 8 gigabytes
so<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:46.000> iphone<00:06:46.390> is<00:06:46.420> obviously<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.290> clear

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
so the iphone is obviously the clear

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.250 
so the iphone is obviously the clear
winner<00:06:47.770> where<00:06:48.130> the<00:06:48.850> eight<00:06:49.090> gigabytes<00:06:49.600> is<00:06:49.840> the

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
winner where the eight gigabytes is the

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.430 
winner where the eight gigabytes is the
minimum<00:06:50.740> you<00:06:50.800> can<00:06:50.950> get<00:06:51.220> now<00:06:51.370> and<00:06:52.260> that's<00:06:53.260> the

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
minimum you can get now and that's the

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.370 
minimum you can get now and that's the
maximum<00:06:54.010> on<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.370> instinct<00:06:54.850> and<00:06:55.380> that's

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
maximum on the instinct and that's

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.280 
maximum on the instinct and that's
internal<00:06:57.280> memory<00:06:57.700> to<00:06:57.970> sure<00:06:58.960> you<00:06:59.080> can't

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
internal memory to sure you can't

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.530 
internal memory to sure you can't
upgrade<00:06:59.560> it<00:06:59.980> but<00:07:00.160> you<00:07:00.760> don't<00:07:00.940> need<00:07:01.060> you<00:07:01.270> out

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
upgrade it but you don't need you out

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.120 
upgrade it but you don't need you out
because<00:07:01.720> it<00:07:01.990> when<00:07:02.410> you<00:07:02.530> compare<00:07:02.860> them<00:07:03.010> the

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
because it when you compare them the

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.580 
because it when you compare them the
instinct<00:07:03.520> is<00:07:03.640> already<00:07:03.970> fully<00:07:04.780> upgraded<00:07:05.410> is

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
instinct is already fully upgraded is

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.980 
instinct is already fully upgraded is
already<00:07:05.980> the<00:07:06.160> smallest<00:07:06.550> iphone<00:07:06.940> so<00:07:07.750> there's<00:07:07.930> a

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
already the smallest iphone so there's a

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.200 
already the smallest iphone so there's a
lot<00:07:08.170> of<00:07:08.310> instinct<00:07:09.310> website<00:07:09.670> didn't<00:07:09.910> mention

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
lot of instinct website didn't mention

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.390 
lot of instinct website didn't mention
so<00:07:10.420> so<00:07:11.020> i<00:07:11.050> kind<00:07:11.380> of<00:07:11.410> rambled<00:07:11.800> on<00:07:11.830> this<00:07:11.980> i<00:07:12.130> wasn't

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
so so i kind of rambled on this i wasn't

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.880 
so so i kind of rambled on this i wasn't
too<00:07:12.550> prepared<00:07:12.850> but<00:07:13.290> that's<00:07:14.290> just<00:07:14.410> my<00:07:14.590> thoughts

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
too prepared but that's just my thoughts

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.520 
too prepared but that's just my thoughts
on<00:07:15.190> obviously<00:07:16.150> the<00:07:16.240> iphone<00:07:16.600> is<00:07:16.630> still<00:07:17.290> the

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
on obviously the iphone is still the

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.160 
on obviously the iphone is still the
clear<00:07:17.770> winner<00:07:17.980> and<00:07:18.420> the<00:07:19.420> instant<00:07:19.840> got<00:07:19.990> some

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.170 
clear winner and the instant got some

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.740 
clear winner and the instant got some
work<00:07:20.350> to<00:07:20.380> do<00:07:20.620> on<00:07:20.830> SD<00:07:21.490> memory<00:07:21.670> is<00:07:22.090> kind<00:07:22.360> of<00:07:22.450> a<00:07:22.510> bad

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
work to do on SD memory is kind of a bad

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.240 
work to do on SD memory is kind of a bad
thing<00:07:22.780> with<00:07:23.230> cell<00:07:23.440> phones<00:07:23.710> if<00:07:23.830> you<00:07:23.920> ask<00:07:24.010> me

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
thing with cell phones if you ask me

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.580 
thing with cell phones if you ask me
internal<00:07:25.120> memory<00:07:25.420> is<00:07:25.540> probably<00:07:25.990> a<00:07:26.080> lot<00:07:26.380> better

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
internal memory is probably a lot better

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.780 
internal memory is probably a lot better
and<00:07:27.360> for<00:07:28.360> the<00:07:28.420> most<00:07:28.540> part<00:07:28.860> the<00:07:29.860> iphone<00:07:30.280> just

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
and for the most part the iphone just

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.170 
and for the most part the iphone just
with<00:07:31.390> itunes<00:07:31.810> syncing<00:07:32.410> internal<00:07:33.130> memory<00:07:33.460> now

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.180 
with itunes syncing internal memory now

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.970 
with itunes syncing internal memory now
a<00:07:34.210> 3g<00:07:34.750> and<00:07:35.020> gps<00:07:35.050> end<00:07:35.800> skyhook<00:07:36.310> to<00:07:37.150> boot<00:07:37.980> it's

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:38.980 
a 3g and gps end skyhook to boot it's

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.220 
a 3g and gps end skyhook to boot it's
the<00:07:39.430> iphone<00:07:39.730> 3g<00:07:40.060> is<00:07:40.120> now<00:07:40.300> clearly<00:07:40.780> the<00:07:41.050> winner

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.230 
the iphone 3g is now clearly the winner

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.200 
the iphone 3g is now clearly the winner
over<00:07:41.730> instinct<00:07:42.730> even<00:07:42.970> though<00:07:43.030> it<00:07:43.060> doesn't

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.210 
over instinct even though it doesn't

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.690 
over instinct even though it doesn't
have<00:07:43.450> live<00:07:43.630> TV<00:07:43.960> or<00:07:44.200> video<00:07:44.590> recording<00:07:45.220> i'm

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700 
have live TV or video recording i'm

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.400 
have live TV or video recording i'm
pretty<00:07:46.060> sure<00:07:46.300> most<00:07:46.480> people<00:07:46.840> can<00:07:46.960> live<00:07:47.110> and

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:47.410 
pretty sure most people can live and

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.390 
pretty sure most people can live and
they're<00:07:47.560> probably<00:07:47.710> going<00:07:47.890> to<00:07:47.980> go<00:07:48.100> with<00:07:48.280> the

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 
they're probably going to go with the

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.340 
they're probably going to go with the
iphone<00:07:48.730> and<00:07:49.330> a<00:07:49.510> pretty<00:07:49.660> sure<00:07:49.780> the<00:07:49.900> instinct<00:07:50.260> is

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.350 
iphone and a pretty sure the instinct is

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.740 
iphone and a pretty sure the instinct is
just<00:07:50.380> could<00:07:50.650> be<00:07:50.740> like<00:07:50.950> the<00:07:51.220> HTC<00:07:51.580> touch<00:07:51.970> and

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750 
just could be like the HTC touch and

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.810 
just could be like the HTC touch and
other<00:07:52.870> devices<00:07:53.140> at<00:07:53.530> copied<00:07:53.860> iphone<00:07:54.190> it's<00:07:54.700> not

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:54.820 
other devices at copied iphone it's not

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.750 
other devices at copied iphone it's not
going<00:07:54.940> to<00:07:55.030> go<00:07:55.120> very<00:07:55.360> far<00:07:55.960> so<00:07:56.430> that's<00:07:57.430> all<00:07:57.550> I<00:07:57.610> got
