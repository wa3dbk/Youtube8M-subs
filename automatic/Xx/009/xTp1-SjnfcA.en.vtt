00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
before when you guys were doing your

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.200 
before when you guys were doing your
your<00:03:03.630> last<00:03:03.870> routines<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.710> was<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.430> amazed<00:03:05.850> at

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
your last routines I was just amazed at

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.320 
your last routines I was just amazed at
how<00:03:06.690> hard<00:03:06.990> they<00:03:07.290> worked<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.740> for<00:03:08.100> routines<00:03:09.000> in

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
how hard they worked you for routines in

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.600 
how hard they worked you for routines in
one<00:03:09.600> at<00:03:09.780> night<00:03:09.810> was<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.980> exhausting

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
one at night was it just so exhausting

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.110 
one at night was it just so exhausting
um<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.750> was<00:03:12.960> definitely<00:03:13.170> challenging<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:15.090> think

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
um it was definitely challenging I think

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.080 
um it was definitely challenging I think
the<00:03:15.600> fact<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.830> amount<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.310> routines<00:03:17.760> was

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the fact that the amount of routines was

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
the fact that the amount of routines was
hard<00:03:18.330> but<00:03:18.600> what<00:03:19.230> really<00:03:19.350> makes<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.800> difficult

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
hard but what really makes it difficult

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.010 
hard but what really makes it difficult
is<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.400> there's<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.000> many<00:03:21.150> different<00:03:21.300> styles

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
is that there's so many different styles

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.930 
is that there's so many different styles
that<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.380> have<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.770> perform<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.430> they

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
that you have to perform and they

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.110 
that you have to perform and they
require<00:03:24.450> different<00:03:24.690> energies<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.910> was

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
require different energies and it was

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.790 
require different energies and it was
just<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.540> was<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.810> really<00:03:27.990> cool<00:03:28.260> experience<00:03:28.320> I
