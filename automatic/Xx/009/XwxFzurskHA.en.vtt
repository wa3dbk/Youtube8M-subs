and<00:00:03.939> we're<00:00:04.120> not<00:00:04.240> gonna<00:00:04.390> use<00:00:04.600> the<00:00:04.930> vamp<00:00:05.350> a<00:00:05.620> car

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:05.920 
and we're not gonna use the vamp a car

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.360 
and we're not gonna use the vamp a car
23<00:00:06.670> to<00:00:07.000> mount<00:00:07.299> the<00:00:07.540> tire<00:00:07.809> on<00:00:08.320> the<00:00:08.470> wheel<00:00:08.650> first

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
23 to mount the tire on the wheel first

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.370 
23 to mount the tire on the wheel first
thing<00:00:09.550> I<00:00:09.610> did<00:00:09.820> was<00:00:09.969> I<00:00:10.090> clean<00:00:10.480> the<00:00:10.660> inside<00:00:11.080> and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
thing I did was I clean the inside and

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.549 
thing I did was I clean the inside and
outside<00:00:11.590> of<00:00:11.860> the<00:00:12.040> wheel<00:00:12.220> really<00:00:12.940> well<00:00:13.559> we're

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
outside of the wheel really well we're

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.200 
outside of the wheel really well we're
gonna<00:00:14.650> take<00:00:15.099> this<00:00:16.019> aluminum<00:00:17.019> angled<00:00:18.210> valve

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
gonna take this aluminum angled valve

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.439 
gonna take this aluminum angled valve
stem<00:00:19.630> and<00:00:20.289> mount<00:00:20.740> that<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.310> wheel<00:00:21.520> it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
stem and mount that to the wheel it

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.359 
stem and mount that to the wheel it
basically<00:00:23.170> instead<00:00:23.860> of<00:00:23.980> giving<00:00:24.160> you<00:00:24.310> a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
basically instead of giving you a

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.040 
basically instead of giving you a
straight<00:00:24.640> valve<00:00:24.970> stem<00:00:25.330> that<00:00:25.480> you<00:00:25.600> can't<00:00:25.869> get

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
straight valve stem that you can't get

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.230 
straight valve stem that you can't get
to<00:00:26.260> to<00:00:26.380> put<00:00:26.560> air<00:00:26.710> in<00:00:26.920> it<00:00:27.220> angles<00:00:27.760> it<00:00:27.910> off<00:00:28.060> at

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
to to put air in it angles it off at

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.599 
to to put air in it angles it off at
about<00:00:28.330> 83<00:00:28.900> degrees<00:00:29.350> so<00:00:29.770> it's<00:00:29.949> very<00:00:30.160> easy<00:00:30.430> to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
about 83 degrees so it's very easy to

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.860 
about 83 degrees so it's very easy to
access<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:33.399> have<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.940> torque<00:00:34.359> spec<00:00:34.690> on

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
access and they have the torque spec on

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.830 
access and they have the torque spec on
that<00:00:35.050> from<00:00:35.320> seven<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.829> ten<00:00:36.340> Newton<00:00:37.120> meters<00:00:37.540> I

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
that from seven to ten Newton meters I

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.100 
that from seven to ten Newton meters I
think<00:00:38.710> which<00:00:38.829> is<00:00:38.860> about<00:00:39.220> 80<00:00:39.579> inch<00:00:40.180> pounds<00:00:40.750> so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
think which is about 80 inch pounds so

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.990 
think which is about 80 inch pounds so
we'll<00:00:41.290> put<00:00:41.469> some<00:00:41.500> Loctite<00:00:42.070> on<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.670> and

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
we'll put some Loctite on that and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000 
we'll put some Loctite on that and
torque<00:00:43.329> that<00:00:43.450> on<00:00:43.719> this<00:00:44.260> is<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.530> tire<00:00:44.770> we're

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
torque that on this is the tire we're

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
torque that on this is the tire we're
gonna<00:00:45.130> put<00:00:45.340> on<00:00:45.460> it's<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.600> Michelin<00:00:47.050> Pilot<00:00:47.950> power

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
gonna put on it's a Michelin Pilot power

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.069 
gonna put on it's a Michelin Pilot power
2ct<00:00:49.540> a<00:00:49.750> dual<00:00:50.170> compound<00:00:50.770> tire<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.809> Z

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
2ct a dual compound tire and it's a Z

low-profile<00:00:58.719> you<00:00:58.960> can<00:00:59.140> see<00:00:59.320> there's<00:00:59.559> almost

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
low-profile you can see there's almost

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.420 
low-profile you can see there's almost
no<00:01:00.250> sidewall<00:01:00.969> on<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.329> at<00:01:01.449> all<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.160> this

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
no sidewall on that at all and and this

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.940 
no sidewall on that at all and and this
machine<00:01:03.699> does<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.269> great<00:01:04.539> job<00:01:04.950> installing

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950

machine does a great job installing
extremely<00:01:06.850> low<00:01:07.000> profile<00:01:07.539> so<00:01:07.810> I<00:01:07.840> drop<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.289> blue

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:08.529 
extremely low profile so I drop a blue

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:11.370 
extremely low profile so I drop a blue
loctite<00:01:08.799> on<00:01:09.219> there<00:01:09.429> and<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:10.329> use<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:10.990> dial

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
loctite on there and I use this dial

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.059 
loctite on there and I use this dial
indicating<00:01:12.219> each<00:01:12.850> pound<00:01:13.329> torque<00:01:13.689> wrench<00:01:14.069> to

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069 
indicating each pound torque wrench to

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:18.389 
indicating each pound torque wrench to
torque<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.549> valve<00:01:15.789> stem<00:01:16.149> to<00:01:17.020> 75<00:01:17.679> inch<00:01:17.950> pounds

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
torque the valve stem to 75 inch pounds

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.800 
torque the valve stem to 75 inch pounds
and<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:18.819> can<00:01:18.969> see<00:01:19.149> that's<00:01:19.359> what<00:01:19.539> it<00:01:19.630> looks

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
and you can see that's what it looks

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:30.269 
and you can see that's what it looks
like<00:01:20.020> okay<00:01:20.649> I<00:01:20.679> just<00:01:20.979> lubricated<00:01:29.039> okay<00:01:30.039> so<00:01:30.099> I

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:30.279 
like okay I just lubricated okay so I

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:31.889 
like okay I just lubricated okay so I
was<00:01:30.399> able<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.700> get<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.299> most<00:01:31.659> of<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
was able to get that on most of the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:39.059 
was able to get that on most of the
weight<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.049> my<00:01:32.139> hand<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:38.380> lubricate<00:01:38.919> the

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
weight of my hand now lubricate the

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:51.850 
weight of my hand now lubricate the
outside

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.100 

so<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.160> had<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.550> use<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.940> helper<00:01:54.390> push

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so I actually had to use the helper push

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.710 
so I actually had to use the helper push
this<00:01:55.350> tire<00:01:55.680> into<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> center<00:01:56.730> as<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.150> tyre

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
this tire into the center as this tyre

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.850 
this tire into the center as this tyre
is<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.230> tight<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> did<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
is so tight and then what I did was I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580 
is so tight and then what I did was I
spoon<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> last<00:02:02.820> inch<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.470> gonna

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
spoon on the last inch and now I'm gonna

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440 
spoon on the last inch and now I'm gonna
head<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:05.220> ahead<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.520> hook<00:02:05.730> up<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:05.940> inflator

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
head go ahead and hook up the inflator

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.000 
head go ahead and hook up the inflator
and<00:02:06.570> inflate<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.080> tire<00:02:07.260> so<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.440> took<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.830> wheel

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
and inflate the tire so I took the wheel

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:26.320 
and inflate the tire so I took the wheel
out<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> clamps<00:02:09.500> euros

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.390
