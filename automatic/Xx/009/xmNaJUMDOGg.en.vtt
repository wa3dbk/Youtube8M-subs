Pennsylvania's first vodka the story

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.029 
Pennsylvania's first vodka the story
came<00:00:18.390> from<00:00:18.630> an<00:00:18.779> idea<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.170> much<00:00:19.350> earlier<00:00:19.740> late

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
came from an idea of much earlier late

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.769 
came from an idea of much earlier late
90s<00:00:20.490> when<00:00:20.760> all<00:00:20.939> these<00:00:21.090> brew<00:00:21.330> pubs<00:00:21.600> were

90s when all these brew pubs were

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.390 
90s when all these brew pubs were
starting<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.949> couldn't<00:00:23.160> figure

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
starting up and I just couldn't figure

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.550 
starting up and I just couldn't figure
out<00:00:23.519> why<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.150> restaurant<00:00:24.750> wasn't<00:00:24.960> making<00:00:25.439> its

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
out why a restaurant wasn't making its

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859 
out why a restaurant wasn't making its
own<00:00:25.680> vodka<00:00:25.920> or<00:00:26.490> its<00:00:26.580> own<00:00:26.730> gin<00:00:27.090> nobody<00:00:27.779> was

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
own vodka or its own gin nobody was

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050 
own vodka or its own gin nobody was
making<00:00:28.279> handcrafted<00:00:29.279> vodka<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.820> time

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
making handcrafted vodka at that time

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.269 
making handcrafted vodka at that time
I've<00:00:30.869> never<00:00:31.019> been<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> beer<00:00:31.679> drinker<00:00:31.830> really

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I've never been a beer drinker really

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.389 
I've never been a beer drinker really
always<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.940> vodka<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.230> looked<00:00:34.469> into

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.830 

but<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.579> end<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.940> obviously<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.480> premium

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
but your end of it obviously is premium

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.510 
but your end of it obviously is premium
you<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.680> pure<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.370> be

you want to get as pure as you can be
absolutely<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.329> ideal<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:43.340> vodka<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:45.149> make

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
absolutely the ideal of vodka is to make

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.049 
absolutely the ideal of vodka is to make
something<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.140> has<00:00:46.170> no<00:00:46.710> smell<00:00:46.770> has<00:00:47.730> very

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
something that has no smell has very

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.840 
something that has no smell has very
little<00:00:48.270> taste<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.800> goes<00:00:50.039> down<00:00:50.250> very<00:00:50.430> smoothly

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
little taste and goes down very smoothly

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
little taste and goes down very smoothly
but<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:52.500> always<00:00:52.770> wants<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> little

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
but one always wants to have a little

but one always wants to have a little
characteristic<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.420> ones<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.320> you

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it all by so how do you do this how do

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.199 
it all by so how do you do this how do
you<00:03:02.320> make<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> potato<00:03:02.739> bucket<00:03:03.400> well<00:03:03.700> we<00:03:03.910> start

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
you make a potato bucket well we start

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.539 
you make a potato bucket well we start
with<00:03:04.450> our<00:03:04.600> Pennsylvania<00:03:05.530> potatoes<00:03:05.980> first

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
with our Pennsylvania potatoes first

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.090 
with our Pennsylvania potatoes first
thing<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.850> do<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.390> add<00:03:07.660> hot<00:03:08.290> water<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.769> our

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
thing I do is we add hot water to our

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.220 
thing I do is we add hot water to our
mash<00:03:09.400> tank<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:10.120> have<00:03:10.239> three<00:03:10.630> thousand<00:03:11.019> liters

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
mash tank we have three thousand liters

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.100 
mash tank we have three thousand liters
of<00:03:11.440> hot<00:03:12.100> water<00:03:12.340> we<00:03:12.910> add<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.209> potatoes<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.720> get

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
of hot water we add the potatoes to get

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.470 
of hot water we add the potatoes to get
to<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.709> really<00:03:15.070> runny<00:03:15.610> mashed<00:03:16.090> potato

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
to like a really runny mashed potato

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.170 
to like a really runny mashed potato
kind<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.220> consistency<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.579> then<00:03:18.850> we<00:03:19.000> add

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
kind of consistency and then we add

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.170 
kind of consistency and then we add
enzymes<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.079> break<00:03:20.170> down<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.920> starch<00:03:21.519> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
enzymes to break down the starch the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.610 
enzymes to break down the starch the
sugar<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:23.019> when<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.290> gets<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.560> certain

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
sugar and when it gets to a certain

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.979 
sugar and when it gets to a certain
temperature<00:03:24.310> we<00:03:24.850> pitch<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.239> yeast<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.690> mix

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
temperature we pitch the yeast and mix

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.840 
temperature we pitch the yeast and mix
it<00:03:26.200> well<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.769> then<00:03:27.040> we<00:03:27.160> place<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.820> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
it well and then we place it in the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.789 
it well and then we place it in the
fermentation<00:03:28.540> tank<00:03:28.810> for<00:03:29.110> three<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.590> five<00:03:29.739> days

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
fermentation tank for three to five days

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.280 
fermentation tank for three to five days
it<00:03:30.489> will<00:03:30.610> ferment<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.480> about<00:03:31.810> ten<00:03:32.110> percent

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
it will ferment to about ten percent

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.979 
it will ferment to about ten percent
alcohol<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.549> started<00:03:34.120> distilling<00:03:34.540> so

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
alcohol then we started distilling so

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.380 
alcohol then we started distilling so
this<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.560> effect<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:36.100> big<00:03:36.310> tub<00:03:36.579> partially

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
this is in effect a big tub partially

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.780 
this is in effect a big tub partially
distilled<00:03:37.750> vodka<00:03:38.019> yeah<00:03:38.590> this

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
distilled vodka yeah this

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.339 
distilled vodka yeah this
is<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.150> first<00:03:39.360> distillation<00:03:39.870> called<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
is the first distillation called the

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.770 
is the first distillation called the
stripping<00:03:40.739> run<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.760> how<00:03:41.909> many<00:03:41.969> distillations

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
stripping run and how many distillations

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.360 
stripping run and how many distillations
does<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.079> go<00:03:43.170> through<00:03:43.200> before<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.069> final

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
does it go through before it's the final

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.830 
does it go through before it's the final
product<00:03:44.579> top<00:03:44.879> three<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.390> it's<00:03:45.450> triple

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
product top three so it's triple

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.690 
product top three so it's triple
distilled<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.469> think<00:03:46.950> my<00:03:47.129> favorite<00:03:47.400> piece<00:03:47.670> of

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
distilled I think my favorite piece of

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.030 
distilled I think my favorite piece of
equipment<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.840> guy<00:03:49.140> right<00:03:49.349> here<00:03:49.409> so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
equipment is this guy right here so

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.709 
equipment is this guy right here so
that's<00:03:50.219> the<00:03:50.370> rectification<00:03:50.760> column<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.569> the

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:51.719 
that's the rectification column so the

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.069 
that's the rectification column so the
final<00:03:52.049> two<00:03:52.319> distillations<00:03:53.030> occur<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.450> so

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
final two distillations occur on that so

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.750 
final two distillations occur on that so
the<00:03:55.290> alcohol<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.159> when<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.370> gets<00:03:56.519> further

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
the alcohol is to when it gets further

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.759 
the alcohol is to when it gets further
up<00:03:57.060> right<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> water<00:03:57.810> right<00:03:58.109> in<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.349> water<00:03:58.500> or

up right a water right in the water or

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.530 
up right a water right in the water or
you<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.040> see<00:03:59.189> through<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.579> windows<00:04:00.359> will

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
you can see through the windows will

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.780 
you can see through the windows will
start<00:04:00.750> dripping<00:04:00.930> down<00:04:01.549> it's<00:04:02.549> like<00:04:02.700> you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
start dripping down it's like you

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.550 
start dripping down it's like you
actually<00:04:03.090> add<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.390> add<00:04:03.659> a<00:04:03.720> little<00:04:04.049> roof<00:04:04.319> to
