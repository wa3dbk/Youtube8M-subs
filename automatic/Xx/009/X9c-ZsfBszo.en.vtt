them so it's our two to change player as
I'm<00:00:47.520> clicking<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.300> switches<00:00:48.809> each<00:00:49.170> guy

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
I'm clicking here it switches each guy

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
I'm clicking here it switches each guy
and<00:00:50.000> right<00:00:51.000> now<00:00:51.120> i'm<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> set<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.690> very

and get to the top of the net now this

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
and get to the top of the net now this
play<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.110> basically<00:01:19.650> done<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.369> very<00:01:20.670> simple

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
but effective now by hitting X i can

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
but effective now by hitting X i can
test<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> play<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.070> basically<00:01:29.070> i<00:01:29.159> run<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
test the play and basically i run it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.850 
test the play and basically i run it
like<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> normal<00:01:30.000> play<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.630> hit<00:01:31.140> X<00:01:31.350> again<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> try

like a normal play I hit X again to try

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.580 
like a normal play I hit X again to try
it<00:01:31.979> again<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.420> pass<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.450> across<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> guy<00:01:34.350> as

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it again I pass it across to the guy as
