00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
is the first video of Xena in art so I

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.050 
is the first video of Xena in art so I
hope<00:00:16.030> you<00:00:16.150> all<00:00:16.330> enjoy<00:00:16.780> I<00:00:17.490> wanted<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:18.550> say<00:00:18.699> thank

you to everybody that took the pictures
of<00:00:22.089> the<00:00:22.359> annular<00:00:23.259> eclipse<00:00:23.650> that<00:00:23.859> took<00:00:24.070> place

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of the annular eclipse that took place

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.689 
of the annular eclipse that took place
this<00:00:25.390> time<00:00:25.779> last<00:00:26.470> week<00:00:27.269> across<00:00:28.410> think<00:00:29.410> it<00:00:29.529> was

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
this time last week across think it was

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.850 
this time last week across think it was
Western<00:00:30.699> America<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.929> Pacific<00:00:32.439> Ocean

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
Western America and the Pacific Ocean

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.640 
Western America and the Pacific Ocean
and<00:00:33.040> that<00:00:33.130> southern<00:00:33.940> China<00:00:34.360> thing<00:00:35.140> but<00:00:35.500> yeah

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
and that southern China thing but yeah

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.290 
and that southern China thing but yeah
there<00:00:35.860> was<00:00:35.950> there<00:00:36.160> some<00:00:36.850> really<00:00:37.150> nice

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
there was there some really nice

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.930 
there was there some really nice
pictures<00:00:37.570> taken<00:00:38.200> of<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.520> pictures

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
pictures taken of that and the pictures

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.580 
pictures taken of that and the pictures
that<00:00:40.090> you've<00:00:40.210> seen<00:00:40.420> her<00:00:40.570> right<00:00:40.780> now<00:00:40.990> are<00:00:41.290> of

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
that you've seen her right now are of

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.620 
that you've seen her right now are of
the<00:00:41.980> eclipses<00:00:42.580> that<00:00:42.700> took<00:00:42.970> place<00:00:43.030> last<00:00:43.360> week

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
the eclipses that took place last week

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.050 
the eclipses that took place last week
as<00:00:43.930> well<00:00:44.140> it's<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.980> shame<00:00:45.220> that<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.520> best<00:00:45.760> views

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
as well it's a shame that the best views

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.880 
as well it's a shame that the best views
of<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.420> Eclipse<00:00:46.810> were<00:00:47.020> mainly<00:00:47.500> from<00:00:47.830> the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
of the Eclipse were mainly from the

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.580 
of the Eclipse were mainly from the
Pacific<00:00:48.580> Ocean<00:00:49.060> where<00:00:49.630> nobody<00:00:50.050> can<00:00:50.320> really

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
Pacific Ocean where nobody can really

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.520 
Pacific Ocean where nobody can really
get<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.220> see<00:00:51.400> it<00:00:51.520> properly<00:00:51.910> but<00:00:52.270> or<00:00:52.990> well<00:00:53.410> I'm

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
get to see it properly but or well I'm

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.380 
get to see it properly but or well I'm
sure<00:00:53.770> there'll<00:00:53.980> be<00:00:54.040> enough<00:00:54.310> one<00:00:54.550> for<00:00:55.150> us<00:00:55.240> to

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
sure there'll be enough one for us to

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.630 
sure there'll be enough one for us to
see<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.810> near<00:00:55.960> future<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.250> let's<00:00:57.460> get

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
see in the near future so let's get

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.210 
see in the near future so let's get
started<00:00:58.060> on<00:00:58.270> space<00:00:59.140> headlines<00:00:59.710> from<00:01:00.010> around

I'm<00:01:19.090> gonna<00:01:19.659> say<00:01:19.930> what<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.230> were<00:01:20.470> all<00:01:20.620> thinking

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
I'm gonna say what you were all thinking

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.850 
I'm gonna say what you were all thinking
planet<00:01:22.150> eggs<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:23.050> may<00:01:23.350> well<00:01:23.590> be<00:01:23.650> the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
planet eggs and this may well be the

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.270 
planet eggs and this may well be the
case

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
ejects a solar flare out and this object

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.670 
ejects a solar flare out and this object
blocks<00:04:59.760> it<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.270> sends<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:00.990> back<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
blocks it and sends it back to the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.430 
blocks it and sends it back to the
surface<00:05:01.919> of<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.340> Sun<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:03.630> didn't<00:05:04.289> know<00:05:04.350> if
