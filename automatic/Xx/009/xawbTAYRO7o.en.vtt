00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
where the original root ball was you can

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.030 
where the original root ball was you can
see<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.270> taproot<00:02:50.780> going<00:02:51.050> on<00:02:51.200> down<00:02:51.410> deeper<00:02:51.860> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
see the taproot going on down deeper and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.150 
see the taproot going on down deeper and
then<00:02:52.730> as<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.000> add<00:02:53.239> soil<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.500> top<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:55.010> can

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
then as you add soil to the top you can

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.640 
then as you add soil to the top you can
see<00:02:55.220> you've<00:02:55.520> got<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.730> small<00:02:56.150> network<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.840> routes

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
see you've got a small network of routes

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.030 
see you've got a small network of routes
here<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:59.450> adding<00:02:59.810> that<00:02:59.930> compost<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.830> top

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
here so adding that compost to the top

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.350 
here so adding that compost to the top
of<00:03:01.190> your<00:03:01.250> plant<00:03:01.550> when<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.940> nightshade

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
of your plant when it's a nightshade

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.870 
of your plant when it's a nightshade
like<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.600> tomato<00:03:03.050> does<00:03:03.800> help<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.340> get<00:03:04.610> more

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
like a tomato does help it get more

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.060 
like a tomato does help it get more
water<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.959> will<00:03:06.110> put<00:03:06.320> out<00:03:06.440> more<00:03:06.590> roots<00:03:06.890> and

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
water and it will put out more roots and

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.490 
water and it will put out more roots and
become<00:03:07.340> healthier<00:03:07.760> but<00:03:08.660> that's<00:03:08.870> pretty<00:03:09.320> good

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
become healthier but that's pretty good

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.310 
become healthier but that's pretty good
root<00:03:09.739> system<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.340> I'd<00:03:10.430> say<00:03:13.870> I've<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:15.049> a<00:03:15.080> whole

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
root system and I'd say I've got a whole

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.229 
root system and I'd say I've got a whole
lot<00:03:15.500> left<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.890> clean<00:03:16.190> out<00:03:16.370> here<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.090> I'm<00:03:17.150> going
