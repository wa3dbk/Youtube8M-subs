00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
are our first impressions of the nokia

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.079 
are our first impressions of the nokia
n97<00:00:09.570> mini<00:00:10.610> now<00:00:12.139> personally<00:00:13.139> i<00:00:13.170> think<00:00:13.440> this

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
n97 mini now personally i think this

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.950 
n97 mini now personally i think this
should<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.210> been<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> phone<00:00:15.570> released

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
should have been the phone released

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.980 
should have been the phone released
before<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.440> n97<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.310> because<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.810> much

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
before the n97 it because it's so much

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.580 
before the n97 it because it's so much
better<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.500> feels<00:00:19.529> better<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.070> your<00:00:20.340> hand<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
better it feels better in your hand and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.410 
better it feels better in your hand and
as<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> little<00:00:24.060> bit<00:00:24.180> shiny

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
as you can see it's a little bit shiny

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
as you can see it's a little bit shiny
so<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> bit<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> fingerprint<00:00:25.980> magnet

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
so it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.000 
so it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet
or<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> human<00:00:26.880> there<00:00:27.500> but<00:00:28.500> there's<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> metal

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
or a human there but there's a metal

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.500 
or a human there but there's a metal
stainless<00:00:29.670> steel<00:00:30.090> back<00:00:30.900> cover<00:00:31.279> I<00:00:32.279> slowly<00:00:33.030> like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
stainless steel back cover I slowly like

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.700 
stainless steel back cover I slowly like
a<00:00:33.840> camera<00:00:34.350> lens<00:00:35.190> protector<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.710> they've

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a camera lens protector but they've

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.780 
a camera lens protector but they've
removed<00:00:38.040> there<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.460> obvious<00:00:38.790> reasons<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
removed there for obvious reasons it's a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.950 
removed there for obvious reasons it's a
little<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.090> smaller<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.450> little<00:00:42.480> bit<00:00:42.780> thinner

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
little bit smaller a little bit thinner

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.240 
little bit smaller a little bit thinner
than<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> original<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.860> 97<00:00:46.129> basically<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
than the original in 97 basically this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
than the original in 97 basically this
looks<00:00:47.730> exactly<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> little<00:00:49.050> bit

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
looks exactly like it just a little bit

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
looks exactly like it just a little bit
little<00:00:50.250> bit<00:00:50.309> small<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.579> color<00:00:53.789> scheme<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
little bit small the the color scheme is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
little bit small the the color scheme is
a<00:00:54.180> slightly<00:00:54.480> different<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> n97<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.829> was

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
a slightly different on the n97 this was

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.240 
a slightly different on the n97 this was
silver<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> little<00:00:57.750> bit<00:00:57.870> dark

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
silver over here it's a little bit dark

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.750 
silver over here it's a little bit dark
brownish<00:00:59.250> steel<00:01:00.980> let's<00:01:01.980> both<00:01:02.280> see<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:02.730> no

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
brownish steel let's both see there's no

naka tag on this side perfectly original
nice<00:01:05.549> plan<00:01:05.880> isn't<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:09.360> full<00:01:10.260> qwerty

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
nice plan isn't that the full qwerty

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.940 
nice plan isn't that the full qwerty
keypad<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.070> still<00:01:11.250> there<00:01:12.380> there's<00:01:13.380> no<00:01:13.530> d-pad

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
keypad is still there there's no d-pad

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
keypad is still there there's no d-pad
anymore<00:01:14.369> they've<00:01:14.700> integrated<00:01:14.970> interested<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
anymore they've integrated interested to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
anymore they've integrated interested to
the<00:01:16.650> keeper<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> keys<00:01:18.840> are

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the keeper right there the keys are

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.990 
the keeper right there the keys are
flatter<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:21.810> better<00:01:22.020> feedback<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.740> them

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
flatter and have better feedback to them

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.350 
flatter and have better feedback to them
then<00:01:24.000> d<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> 97<00:01:24.930> original<00:01:25.909> they<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:27.060> better

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
then d and 97 original they also better

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.999 
then d and 97 original they also better
spaced<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.590> feel<00:01:28.979> each

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
spaced out so you can actually feel each

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.610 
spaced out so you can actually feel each
individual<00:01:29.850> key<00:01:30.060> which<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.020> pretty<00:01:31.439> good

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.640 

yep<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:37.400> software<00:01:38.060> wise<00:01:38.300> it's<00:01:38.650> slightly

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
yep the software wise it's slightly

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.399 
yep the software wise it's slightly
faster<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.640> was<00:01:40.790> slightly<00:01:41.180> better<00:01:41.990> than<00:01:42.110> the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
faster it was slightly better than the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.350 
faster it was slightly better than the
yen<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.890> an<00:01:43.159> original<00:01:43.340> there's<00:01:44.180> still<00:01:44.330> a

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
yen is an original there's still a

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.730 
yen is an original there's still a
couple<00:01:44.479> bucks<00:01:44.810> here<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.140> there<00:01:45.200> because<00:01:45.590> this

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
couple bucks here and there because this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.240 
couple bucks here and there because this
is<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.010> shipping<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:46.490> wear<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:48.130> but<00:01:49.130> it's

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
is the shipping for wear and but it's

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.430 
is the shipping for wear and but it's
not<00:01:49.369> something<00:01:49.640> as<00:01:49.880> bad<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.479> 97<00:01:51.020> original

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
not something as bad as the 97 original

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.200 
not something as bad as the 97 original
firmware<00:01:51.710> was<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:55.490> kind<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.759> like<00:01:55.850> schooling

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
firmware was it's kind of like schooling

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.499 
firmware was it's kind of like schooling
all<00:01:57.340> over<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.430> place<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:58.909> that's<00:01:59.090> pretty<00:01:59.270> good

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
all over the place so that's pretty good

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.820 
all over the place so that's pretty good
pretty<00:01:59.810> useful<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:02.200> battery<00:02:03.200> life<00:02:03.409> seems<00:02:03.680> to

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
pretty useful and battery life seems to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.149 
pretty useful and battery life seems to
be<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.070> same<00:02:04.340> as<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.909> n97<00:02:05.890> original<00:02:06.890> nothing

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
be the same as the n97 original nothing

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.190 
be the same as the n97 original nothing
more<00:02:07.340> nothing<00:02:07.640> less<00:02:07.850> because<00:02:08.780> there's<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:11.200> 1200

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
more nothing less because there's a 1200
