00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
well hi there this is my first attempt

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.270 
well hi there this is my first attempt
at<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.139> 3d<00:00:10.710> background<00:00:11.580> using<00:00:13.009> polystyrene<00:00:14.009> or

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
at a 3d background using polystyrene or

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.240 
at a 3d background using polystyrene or
styrofoam<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:16.340> cement<00:00:17.720> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.250> my

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
styrofoam and cement this is just my

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640 
styrofoam and cement this is just my
last<00:00:20.460> put<00:00:21.150> together<00:00:21.300> before<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.900> cemented<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
last put together before I cemented it

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.849 
last put together before I cemented it
just<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.039> make<00:00:23.220> sure<00:00:23.250> everything<00:00:23.760> fits<00:00:24.859> it's

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
just to make sure everything fits it's

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.120 
just to make sure everything fits it's
all<00:00:25.949> good

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.830 

this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:30.199> one<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> panels<00:00:32.690> of<00:00:33.690> three

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.650 

sharing<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.700> inlet<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.820> outlet<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> tried<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
sharing the inlet and outlet I tried to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.400 
sharing the inlet and outlet I tried to
hide<00:00:39.840> everything<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> these<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> only

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
hide everything so these are the only

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.290 
hide everything so these are the only
things<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> front

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
things you really see from the front

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.560 
things you really see from the front
it's<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.289> outlet<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> filters

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's the outlet for one of the filters

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:58.069 
it's the outlet for one of the filters
and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> inlet<00:00:51.230> looking<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> back<00:00:57.079> that

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and the inlet looking at the back that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.920 
and the inlet looking at the back that
cavity<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.489> where<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.940> pipe<00:01:00.300> goes<00:01:00.539> down

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
cavity there is where the pipe goes down

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.429 
cavity there is where the pipe goes down
to<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.039> lets<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> water<00:01:02.520> out<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:04.260> got

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to and lets the water out and it's got

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.820 
to and lets the water out and it's got
to<00:01:04.530> come<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.830> past<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.580> heater<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
to come up past the heater and out that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.179 
to come up past the heater and out that
hole<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> heaters<00:01:10.530> mounted<00:01:11.010> by

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
hole so then the heaters mounted by

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520 
hole so then the heaters mounted by
those<00:01:11.400> suction<00:01:12.090> caps<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.720> welded<00:01:13.380> into

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
those suction caps that are welded into

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
those suction caps that are welded into
the<00:01:13.740> styrofoam<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> heater<00:01:15.689> just

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the styrofoam now so the heater just

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
the styrofoam now so the heater just
slides<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.960> it's<00:01:18.960> also<00:01:19.110> only<00:01:19.320> has<00:01:19.740> put<00:01:20.340> in

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
slides in and it's also only has put in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.710 
slides in and it's also only has put in
there<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.780> everything's<00:01:21.780> hidden<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
there so everything's hidden so that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.770 
there so everything's hidden so that
takes<00:01:25.530> care<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.189> filter<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
takes care of one filter and and the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
takes care of one filter and and the
heater<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> there's<00:01:29.430> plenty<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> room<00:01:29.939> for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
heater so there's plenty of room for

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.700 
heater so there's plenty of room for
water<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.750> around<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> heater<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
water to go around the heater this is

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.069 
water to go around the heater this is
the<00:01:34.710> middle<00:01:34.979> panel<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.579> boring<00:01:36.079> probably

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the middle panel bit boring probably

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
the middle panel bit boring probably
should<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.350> did<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.250> lumps<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
should have did a bit more lumps to that

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.710 
should have did a bit more lumps to that
it<00:01:39.360> looks<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.630> flat<00:01:40.400> made<00:01:41.400> some<00:01:41.610> rocks<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it looks a bit flat made some rocks so I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.539 
it looks a bit flat made some rocks so I
can<00:01:45.960> coat<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.920> cement<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
can coat them with the cement at the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.340 
can coat them with the cement at the
same<00:01:47.759> time<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> background<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.229> they

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
same time as I do the background so they

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.850 
same time as I do the background so they
all<00:01:49.500> look<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> same<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:51.049> can<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
all look the same I can just get this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
all look the same I can just get this
piece<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> hard

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
piece out this is this was the hard

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.660 
piece out this is this was the hard
piece<00:01:58.130> it's<00:01:59.130> got<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.700> sand<00:02:00.240> fall<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.030 

was<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.940> tricky<00:02:05.630> bit<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.960> do<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.930> looking<00:02:09.860> at

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
was the tricky bit to do so looking at

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.880 
was the tricky bit to do so looking at
the<00:02:10.390> that's<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.600> catchment<00:02:12.080> area<00:02:12.290> down<00:02:12.710> the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
the that's the catchment area down the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.460 
the that's the catchment area down the
bottom<00:02:13.160> that's<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.180> top<00:02:14.420> that's<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:17.470> uplift

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
bottom that's the top that's the uplift

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.740 
bottom that's the top that's the uplift
tube<00:02:18.740> from<00:02:19.100> our<00:02:19.280> under<00:02:19.700> gravel<00:02:20.000> filter<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.390> just

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
tube from our under gravel filter I just

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.030 
tube from our under gravel filter I just
use<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.110> tube<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:23.140> catchment<00:02:24.140> at<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.710> bottom

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
use the tube a catchment at the bottom

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.810 
use the tube a catchment at the bottom
and<00:02:25.940> an<00:02:26.840> outlet<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:28.510> sand<00:02:29.510> runs<00:02:29.840> down<00:02:30.820> into

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
and an outlet there sand runs down into

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.380 
and an outlet there sand runs down into
there<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.480> gets<00:02:33.110> pumped<00:02:33.410> back<00:02:33.560> up<00:02:33.740> again<00:02:34.040> and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
there and gets pumped back up again and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.460 
there and gets pumped back up again and
keeps<00:02:35.390> going<00:02:36.610> that's<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.880> Inlet<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.080> another

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
keeps going that's a Inlet for another

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.860 
keeps going that's a Inlet for another
filter<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.370> goes<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:46.540> up<00:02:47.540> through

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
filter and it it goes the up through

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.710 
filter and it it goes the up through
that<00:02:47.900> hole<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.590> then<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.820> crevice<00:02:50.510> is

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
that hole and then that that crevice is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.370 
that hole and then that that crevice is
cut<00:02:50.990> out<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:53.209> tube<00:02:53.510> at<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.780> back<00:02:54.050> there

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
cut out so the tube at the back there

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.050 
cut out so the tube at the back there
that<00:02:54.770> one<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.880> fit<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.720> behind<00:02:58.060> I'll

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that one can just fit in behind I'll

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.479 
that one can just fit in behind I'll
show<00:02:59.570> you<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.230> that's<00:03:00.470> removable<00:03:00.860> later

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:13.479 

yeah<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:10.310> electrical<00:03:11.150> conduit<00:03:12.370> at<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
yeah it's just electrical conduit at the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.570 
yeah it's just electrical conduit at the
bottom<00:03:13.790> there<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:17.019> so<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.980> outlets<00:03:19.370> for

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
bottom there it's so the the outlets for

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.729 
bottom there it's so the the outlets for
the<00:03:19.700> outlet<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.180> filter<00:03:20.630> see<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.530> holes

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
the outlet of the filter see the holes

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.580 
the outlet of the filter see the holes
drilled<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:25.000> outlet<00:03:26.000> comes

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
drilled in it so the the outlet comes

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.440 
drilled in it so the the outlet comes
from<00:03:27.590> under<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.980> gravel<00:03:28.310> apparently<00:03:29.269> that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
from under the gravel apparently that

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.270 
from under the gravel apparently that
keeps<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.930> gravel<00:03:30.260> clear<00:03:31.510> clean<00:03:32.510> or<00:03:32.900> cleaner

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
keeps the gravel clear clean or cleaner

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.330 
keeps the gravel clear clean or cleaner
limits<00:03:34.280> vacuuming<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.870> tubes<00:03:36.340> removable

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
limits vacuuming this tubes removable

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.660 
limits vacuuming this tubes removable
sir<00:03:37.640> can<00:03:37.880> just<00:03:38.060> slide<00:03:38.299> up<00:03:38.510> through<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.670> foam

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
sir can just slide up through the foam

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.420 
sir can just slide up through the foam
so<00:03:41.090> every<00:03:41.540> everything<00:03:42.140> is<00:03:42.470> removable<00:03:43.040> from

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
so every everything is removable from

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.570 
so every everything is removable from
the<00:03:43.549> background<00:03:44.060> once<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:45.190> once<00:03:46.190> it's<00:03:46.489> a

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
the background once it's once it's a

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.140 
the background once it's once it's a
silicon<00:03:47.540> din<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.140> can<00:03:48.890> just<00:03:49.070> put<00:03:49.610> down<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.910> tube

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
silicon din I can just put down the tube

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.460 
silicon din I can just put down the tube
and<00:03:51.700> stick<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.820> in

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.070 

the<00:03:57.470> first<00:03:57.739> coat<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.129> cement<00:03:58.840> and<00:04:02.080> looked

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
the first coat of cement and looked

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.750 
the first coat of cement and looked
looked<00:04:03.319> alright<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.830> coloring<00:04:04.220> wasn't<00:04:04.549> real

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
looked alright the coloring wasn't real

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.130 
looked alright the coloring wasn't real
good<00:04:04.790> but<00:04:05.599> I<00:04:05.720> fix<00:04:06.019> that<00:04:06.260> on<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.709> next<00:04:08.140> next

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
good but I fix that on the next next

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.770 
good but I fix that on the next next
level<00:04:09.170> this<00:04:09.620> was<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.830> very<00:04:10.069> thin<00:04:10.430> thin<00:04:11.299> coating

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
level this was a very thin thin coating

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.619 
level this was a very thin thin coating
of<00:04:11.870> cement<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:13.579> next<00:04:13.760> level<00:04:13.970> got<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.450> bit

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
of cement so the next level got it a bit

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:22.360 
of cement so the next level got it a bit
better<00:04:15.790> next<00:04:16.790> coat<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.209> should<00:04:17.419> say<00:04:21.340> yeah<00:04:22.340> I

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
better next coat I should say yeah I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.390 
better next coat I should say yeah I
just<00:04:22.699> kept<00:04:22.880> coating<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.800> until<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:24.949> looked

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
just kept coating and until it looked

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.980 
just kept coating and until it looked
right<00:04:26.320> then<00:04:27.320> stuck<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.860> in<00:04:27.949> the<00:04:28.070> tank<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:29.660> ended

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
right then stuck it in the tank it ended

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.320 
right then stuck it in the tank it ended
up<00:04:30.080> looking<00:04:30.289> something<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:30.889> this

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
up looking something like this

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.210 
up looking something like this
once<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.510> stuck<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.870> in<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.110> tank<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> cement

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
once I stuck it in the tank I a cement

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.820 
once I stuck it in the tank I a cement
gave<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.669> one<00:04:34.850> last<00:04:35.120> cement<00:04:35.780> coat<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.320> seal

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
gave it a one last cement coat to seal

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.750 
gave it a one last cement coat to seal
the<00:04:36.889> joins<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:38.590> there's<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.860> send<00:04:40.340> filter

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
the joins and there's the send filter

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.390 
the joins and there's the send filter
actually<00:04:41.210> working<00:04:41.889> no<00:04:42.889> one<00:04:43.039> was<00:04:43.220> more

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
actually working no one was more

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.409 
actually working no one was more
surprised<00:04:43.820> than<00:04:44.300> me<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.139> actually<00:04:45.530> works

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
surprised than me that it actually works

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.189 
surprised than me that it actually works
but<00:04:47.419> if<00:04:47.570> you<00:04:47.979> said<00:04:48.979> it's<00:04:49.250> it's<00:04:49.610> not<00:04:50.389> falling

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
but if you said it's it's not falling

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.590 
but if you said it's it's not falling
like<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:52.010> wanted<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.789> it's<00:04:53.000> actually<00:04:53.389> being

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
like I wanted it to it's actually being

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.400 
like I wanted it to it's actually being
pumped<00:04:54.410> out<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.770> bit<00:04:55.010> bit<00:04:55.729> hard<00:04:58.060> which<00:04:59.260> ran<00:05:00.260> the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
pumped out a bit bit hard which ran the

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.620 
pumped out a bit bit hard which ran the
risk<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:00.979> spreading<00:05:01.930> around<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.289> tank<00:05:04.630> I

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
risk of it spreading around the tank I

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.620 
risk of it spreading around the tank I
wanted<00:05:06.169> to<00:05:06.530> see<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.830> fall<00:05:07.099> not<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.460> sand<00:05:08.030> jet<00:05:10.630> so

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
wanted to see and fall not a sand jet so

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.140 
wanted to see and fall not a sand jet so
some<00:05:12.200> modifications<00:05:12.979> had<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.280> be<00:05:13.400> made<00:05:13.669> from

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
some modifications had to be made from

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:22.330 
some modifications had to be made from
here<00:05:16.450> looking<00:05:17.450> at<00:05:17.599> the<00:05:17.750> back<00:05:18.169> of<00:05:18.200> it<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:21.440> had

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
here looking at the back of it it I had

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.270 
here looking at the back of it it I had
to<00:05:22.460> cut<00:05:22.789> away<00:05:23.020> more<00:05:24.020> of<00:05:24.169> an<00:05:24.289> area<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.070> water

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
to cut away more of an area so the water

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.040 
to cut away more of an area so the water
had<00:05:25.580> more<00:05:26.449> area<00:05:27.199> to<00:05:27.940> slow<00:05:28.940> down<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.599> let<00:05:29.780> the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
had more area to slow down and let the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.670 
had more area to slow down and let the
sand<00:05:30.620> just<00:05:30.979> fall<00:05:31.370> you<00:05:31.760> can<00:05:32.320> it's<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.530> bubble

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
sand just fall you can it's the bubble

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.500 
sand just fall you can it's the bubble
lift<00:05:34.039> and<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.340> sand<00:05:34.580> just<00:05:34.760> falling<00:05:35.210> into<00:05:35.360> that

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
lift and the sand just falling into that

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.120 
lift and the sand just falling into that
cavity<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:37.180> then<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.690> water<00:05:38.949> can<00:05:39.949> actually

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
cavity and then the water can actually

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.760 
cavity and then the water can actually
run<00:05:40.639> out<00:05:40.849> now<00:05:41.300> along<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.990> top<00:05:44.050> made<00:05:45.050> made<00:05:45.530> that

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
run out now along the top made made that

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.700 
run out now along the top made made that
cavity<00:05:46.190> later<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.479> the<00:05:47.930> water<00:05:48.139> goes<00:05:48.470> out

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
cavity later so the the water goes out

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.650 
cavity later so the the water goes out
that<00:05:48.949> cavity<00:05:49.400> in<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.550> sand<00:05:49.910> goes<00:05:50.210> out<00:05:50.479> the

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
that cavity in the sand goes out the

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.040 
that cavity in the sand goes out the
little<00:05:50.870> hole<00:05:51.110> so<00:05:52.150> this<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.570> water<00:05:53.780> isn't

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
little hole so this the water isn't

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.439 
little hole so this the water isn't
pushing<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.889> sand<00:05:55.160> out<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.580> water<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:56.150> sins

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
pushing the sand out the water the sins

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.980 
pushing the sand out the water the sins
just<00:05:56.720> falling<00:05:57.289> out<00:05:57.440> now<00:05:58.599> made<00:05:59.599> it<00:05:59.750> look<00:05:59.870> a<00:05:59.960> bit

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
just falling out now made it look a bit
