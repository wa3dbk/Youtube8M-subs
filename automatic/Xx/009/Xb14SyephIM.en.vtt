in addition to all this the wireless
dongle<00:00:36.780> came<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> as<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.129> see<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
dongle came and as you can see this is a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.260 
dongle came and as you can see this is a
fractionally<00:00:39.750> small<00:00:40.079> almost<00:00:40.980> nothing<00:00:41.520> really

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
fractionally small almost nothing really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.420 
fractionally small almost nothing really
and<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.960> powers<00:00:43.320> both<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.040> actually

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and this powers both or this actually

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
and this powers both or this actually
connects<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> both<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> keyboard<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.690> the

connects to both the keyboard and the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.270 
connects to both the keyboard and the
mouse<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.410> required<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.920> absolute

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
mouse so that's required for absolute

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.490 
mouse so that's required for absolute
operation<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> neat<00:00:48.660> things<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.170> when

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
operation one of the neat things is when

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.750 
operation one of the neat things is when
you<00:00:49.590> need<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.920> move<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> keyboard<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.700> mouse

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you need to move the keyboard and mouse

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
you need to move the keyboard and mouse
the<00:00:51.600> mouse<00:00:51.629> has<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.350> perfect<00:00:52.739> little<00:00:52.800> cubby

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the mouse has this perfect little cubby

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
the mouse has this perfect little cubby
there<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> pack<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.899> your

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
there so when you need to pack up your

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.260 
there so when you need to pack up your
wireless<00:00:55.410> keyboard<00:00:55.770> mouse<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.850> stick<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.180> in

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
wireless keyboard mouse you stick it in

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.610 
wireless keyboard mouse you stick it in
there<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:57.719> sure<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.379> lose

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
there and make sure that you don't lose

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.310 
there and make sure that you don't lose
it<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.219> course<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.850> tiny<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.960> would<00:01:01.199> be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it of course it's so tiny it would be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.740 
it of course it's so tiny it would be
easy<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> lose<00:01:01.920> otherwise<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.629> need

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
easy to lose otherwise so you just need

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.210 
easy to lose otherwise so you just need
to<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.960> careful<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.860> cannot

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to be careful with that and you cannot

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.440 
to be careful with that and you cannot
operate<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.700> keyboard<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.150> mouse<00:01:06.270> without

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
operate the keyboard and mouse without

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.920 
operate the keyboard and mouse without
that<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:08.070> want<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> lose<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.930> let's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that so we don't want to lose that let's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.910 
that so we don't want to lose that let's
go<00:01:10.020> ahead<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> talk<00:01:10.409> about<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> construction

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
go ahead and talk about the construction

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.539 
go ahead and talk about the construction
of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> keyboard<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:14.280> thin

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
of the keyboard this is it's really thin

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
of the keyboard this is it's really thin
and<00:01:14.580> light<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.110> far<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and light and I do like that as far as a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
and light and I do like that as far as a
wireless<00:01:16.650> setup<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.970> definitely<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
wireless setup it's definitely not the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
wireless setup it's definitely not the
most<00:01:18.840> durable<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> world<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.100> spill

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
most durable in the world it is spill

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
most durable in the world it is spill
resistant<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.180> water<00:01:21.450> resistant<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.530> do

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
resistant or water resistant and I do

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
resistant or water resistant and I do
believe<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.310> keys<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.700> tightly<00:01:23.909> spaced

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
believe that the keys are tightly spaced

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.820 
believe that the keys are tightly spaced
together<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.229> doesn't<00:01:25.380> look<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
together and there doesn't look like to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
together and there doesn't look like to
be<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> lot<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> access<00:01:26.580> points<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.380> definitely

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
be a lot of access points I definitely

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.960 
be a lot of access points I definitely
wouldn't<00:01:28.560> try<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> type<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> underneath

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
wouldn't try to type with it underneath

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.330 
wouldn't try to type with it underneath
the<00:01:30.329> water<00:01:30.540> completely<00:01:30.810> submerge<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.189> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the water completely submerge but you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
the water completely submerge but you
know<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> um<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
know it is what it is um the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
know it is what it is um the
construction<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.979> mean<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.610> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
construction is I mean it's kind of

symbols<00:03:07.560> supposed<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.040> be<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.700> what<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.970> does

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
symbols supposed to be but what it does

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.699 
symbols supposed to be but what it does
is<00:03:09.360> actually<00:03:09.540> open<00:03:09.959> your<00:03:09.990> computer<00:03:10.230> file

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
is actually open your computer file

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.070 
is actually open your computer file
manager<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.790> when<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.330> click<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
manager so when you click that it's the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.650 
manager so when you click that it's the
same<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.290> clicking<00:03:13.790> computer<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.540> will

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
same as clicking computer and it will

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.930 
same as clicking computer and it will
open<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:16.019> basically<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.950> file<00:03:17.280> center<00:03:17.730> so

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
open up basically your file center so

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.940 
open up basically your file center so
you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.090> see<00:03:18.420> what's<00:03:18.989> attached<00:03:19.350> your<00:03:19.590> DVD

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
you can see what's attached your DVD

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.860 
you can see what's attached your DVD
drives<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.400> things<00:03:20.430> like<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.690> a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
drives and things like that this is a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.240 
drives and things like that this is a
unique<00:03:22.230> key<00:03:22.410> I've<00:03:22.530> never<00:03:22.709> seen<00:03:22.920> before<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
unique key I've never seen before it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.590 
unique key I've never seen before it
actually<00:03:23.340> opens<00:03:23.910> up<00:03:23.970> your<00:03:24.120> calculator

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
actually opens up your calculator

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.990 
actually opens up your calculator
automatically<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.470> guess<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.400> really<00:03:26.610> don't<00:03:26.760> use

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
automatically I guess I really don't use

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.610 
automatically I guess I really don't use
the<00:03:27.180> windows<00:03:27.480> calculator<00:03:27.690> very<00:03:28.140> often<00:03:28.500> but

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the windows calculator very often but

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.740 
the windows calculator very often but
occasionally<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:29.190> do<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.910> mean<00:03:30.330> that's<00:03:30.540> there

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
occasionally I do so I mean that's there

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.360 
occasionally I do so I mean that's there
and<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.739> be<00:03:31.830> your<00:03:31.980> mute<00:03:32.160> key

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and this is going to be your mute key

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.970 
and this is going to be your mute key
another<00:03:32.700> new<00:03:32.850> multimedia<00:03:33.300> key<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.830> does

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
another new multimedia key so it does

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.160 
another new multimedia key so it does
have<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> few<00:03:35.310> neat<00:03:35.519> options<00:03:35.910> especially<00:03:36.810> at

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
have a few neat options especially at

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.990 
have a few neat options especially at
this<00:03:37.260> price<00:03:37.440> point<00:03:37.560> or<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.160> can<00:03:38.550> expect<00:03:38.850> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000

of and then you
you<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.520> read<00:04:00.700> arrow<00:04:00.940> keys<00:04:01.240> here<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.690> mean

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
you have to read arrow keys here I mean

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.640 
you have to read arrow keys here I mean
the<00:04:02.350> keys<00:04:02.530> feel<00:04:02.890> nice<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.900> mostly<00:04:05.170> classic

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
the keys feel nice it's mostly classic

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.860 
the keys feel nice it's mostly classic
construction<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.360> pretty<00:04:07.540> much<00:04:07.690> almost

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
construction and it's pretty much almost

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.020 
construction and it's pretty much almost
exactly<00:04:08.380> what<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.620> expected

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
exactly what I expected

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.850 
exactly what I expected
I<00:04:10.060> think<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.720> mouse<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.230> better<00:04:11.530> part<00:04:11.710> of

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
I think the mouse is the better part of

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.220 
I think the mouse is the better part of
the<00:04:11.920> deal<00:04:12.160> in<00:04:12.910> this<00:04:13.060> combination<00:04:13.270> mainly

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
the deal in this combination mainly

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.540 
the deal in this combination mainly
because<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.590> really<00:04:14.830> like<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.130> way<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.340> feels

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
because I really like the way it feels

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.930 
because I really like the way it feels
I'm<00:04:16.420> I<00:04:16.810> have<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:16.959> really<00:04:17.230> large<00:04:17.470> hand<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.130> this

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
I'm I have a really large hand and this

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.790 
I'm I have a really large hand and this
actually<00:04:19.330> come<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.320> compasses<00:04:20.739> that

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
actually come in and compasses that

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.850 
actually come in and compasses that
pretty<00:04:21.160> well<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:22.090> feels<00:04:22.300> good<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:23.380> comes<00:04:23.680> with

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
pretty well it feels good it comes with

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.770 
pretty well it feels good it comes with
the<00:04:24.010> standard<00:04:24.670> button<00:04:24.910> configuration<00:04:25.630> you

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
the standard button configuration you

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.140 
the standard button configuration you
have<00:04:25.810> your<00:04:26.440> optical<00:04:27.190> mouse<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.850> has<00:04:28.000> your

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
have your optical mouse and it has your

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.020 
have your optical mouse and it has your
on<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.450> off<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.950> know<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.550> don't<00:04:30.820> really

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
on and off and you know I don't really

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.700 
on and off and you know I don't really
use<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.360> on<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.720> off<00:04:31.780> switch<00:04:31.960> very<00:04:32.320> often

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
use this on and off switch very often

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.740 
use this on and off switch very often
from<00:04:33.250> my<00:04:33.400> wireless<00:04:33.640> mice<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.330> actually<00:04:34.420> use

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
from my wireless mice and I actually use

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.050 
from my wireless mice and I actually use
biotech<00:04:35.230> wireless<00:04:35.590> mice<00:04:35.850> mainly<00:04:36.850> because

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
biotech wireless mice mainly because

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.280 
biotech wireless mice mainly because
they<00:04:37.150> have<00:04:37.270> an<00:04:37.330> automatic<00:04:37.660> power<00:04:37.960> off<00:04:38.260> feature

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
they have an automatic power off feature

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.230 
they have an automatic power off feature
and<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.070> does<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.280> keyboard<00:04:39.640> after<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.000> stop

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
and so does the keyboard after you stop

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.820 
and so does the keyboard after you stop
using<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:40.690> for<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> few<00:04:41.080> seconds<00:04:41.440> it'll<00:04:41.650> stop

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
using it for a few seconds it'll stop

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.550

actually<00:04:44.830> have<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.250> exact<00:04:45.790> biotech<00:04:46.390> mouse

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
actually have this exact biotech mouse

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.440 
actually have this exact biotech mouse
but<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:46.990> have<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.680> you<00:04:48.520> know<00:04:48.610> it's<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.910> blinky<00:04:49.300> one

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
but I have a you know it's a blinky one

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.080 
but I have a you know it's a blinky one
I<00:04:49.480> think<00:04:49.810> it's<00:04:49.900> called<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.170> lightning<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.910> my

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
I think it's called the lightning and my

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.270 
I think it's called the lightning and my
battery<00:04:52.330> life<00:04:52.600> has<00:04:52.630> been<00:04:53.140> I've<00:04:53.920> been<00:04:54.100> using

battery life has been I've been using

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.890 
battery life has been I've been using
the<00:04:54.550> original<00:04:54.910> batteries<00:04:55.270> for<00:04:55.480> months<00:04:55.780> and

the original batteries for months and
have<00:04:56.050> had<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.350> change<00:04:56.560> them<00:04:56.710> so<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.190> have<00:04:57.340> no

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
have had to change them so I have no

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.680 
have had to change them so I have no
reason<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.730> believe<00:04:57.880> this<00:04:58.150> one<00:04:58.300> won't<00:04:58.450> be<00:04:58.540> any

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
in some of the other ones and I use it

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.750 
in some of the other ones and I use it
pretty<00:05:48.280> often

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
pretty often

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.970 
pretty often
you<00:05:49.120> also<00:05:49.270> have<00:05:49.510> Windows<00:05:49.960> key<00:05:50.290> macro<00:05:50.740> manager

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
you also have Windows key macro manager

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.400 
you also have Windows key macro manager

which is free from Microsoft it comes as
part<00:05:53.620> I<00:05:53.680> think<00:05:53.740> you<00:05:53.920> have<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.100> download<00:05:54.310> it

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
part I think you have to download it

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.070 
part I think you have to download it
separately<00:05:55.000> but<00:05:55.210> you<00:05:55.330> can<00:05:55.480> change<00:05:55.630> these<00:05:55.840> keys

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
separately but you can change these keys

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.250 
separately but you can change these keys
to<00:05:56.230> whatever<00:05:56.380> you<00:05:56.620> like<00:05:57.480> so<00:05:58.480> we're<00:05:59.110> going<00:05:59.200> to

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
to whatever you like so we're going to

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.130 
to whatever you like so we're going to
go<00:05:59.350> ahead<00:05:59.470> and<00:05:59.650> set<00:05:59.860> that<00:06:00.010> away<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:01.750> came<00:06:01.990> with

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
go ahead and set that away it came with

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.930 
go ahead and set that away it came with
the<00:06:02.230> batteries<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:02.890> I<00:06:03.130> guess<00:06:03.280> some<00:06:03.520> assembly

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
the batteries and I guess some assembly

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.909 
the batteries and I guess some assembly
is<00:06:03.970> required<00:06:04.200> if<00:06:05.200> we<00:06:05.350> look<00:06:05.530> at<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.740> back<00:06:05.890> here

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
is required if we look at the back here

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.520 
is required if we look at the back here
it<00:06:08.919> does<00:06:09.130> have<00:06:09.450> does<00:06:10.450> have<00:06:10.720> your<00:06:10.930> standard

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
it does have does have your standard

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.470 
it does have does have your standard
flip<00:06:11.710> outs<00:06:11.890> there<00:06:12.130> so<00:06:12.340> you<00:06:12.430> can<00:06:12.580> change<00:06:12.729> your

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
flip outs there so you can change your

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.060 
flip outs there so you can change your
the<00:06:13.990> keyboard<00:06:14.350> is<00:06:14.470> really<00:06:14.860> thin<00:06:15.130> so<00:06:16.919> it's<00:06:17.919> not

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
the keyboard is really thin so it's not

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.320 
the keyboard is really thin so it's not
going<00:06:18.340> to<00:06:18.430> help<00:06:18.520> your<00:06:18.730> wrist<00:06:18.970> when<00:06:19.180> you're

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
going to help your wrist when you're

sitting there so if you have a separate

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.560 
sitting there so if you have a separate
wrist<00:06:21.340> support<00:06:21.669> you<00:06:21.790> might<00:06:21.940> want<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.180> use<00:06:22.360> that

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
wrist support you might want to use that

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.990 
wrist support you might want to use that
but<00:06:23.440> for<00:06:23.710> a<00:06:23.740> wireless<00:06:23.919> keyboard<00:06:24.250> I<00:06:24.730> mean<00:06:24.910> I

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
but for a wireless keyboard I mean I

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.879 
but for a wireless keyboard I mean I
don't<00:06:25.060> expect<00:06:25.450> them<00:06:25.570> to<00:06:25.630> be<00:06:25.720> very<00:06:25.960> thick<00:06:26.260> but

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
don't expect them to be very thick but

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.260 
don't expect them to be very thick but
where<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.190> construction<00:06:27.730> I<00:06:27.790> was<00:06:27.940> talking
