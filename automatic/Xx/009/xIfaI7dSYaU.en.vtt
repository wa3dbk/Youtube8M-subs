what my rating list for the car to think

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.210 
what my rating list for the car to think
it<00:00:22.010> was<00:00:22.099> like<00:00:22.220> a<00:00:22.310> five<00:00:22.550> or<00:00:22.580> something<00:00:23.150> but

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
it was like a five or something but

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.950 
it was like a five or something but
another<00:00:25.220> couple<00:00:26.000> months<00:00:26.330> has<00:00:26.449> passed<00:00:26.720> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.220 
I've been messing with these cards a lot
they've<00:00:28.400> gotten<00:00:28.699> a<00:00:28.730> lot<00:00:28.849> better

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.119

Springs since I've broken them in

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.049 
Springs since I've broken them in
they're<00:00:51.410> not<00:00:51.440> as<00:00:51.770> stiff<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.430> I<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.760> get<00:00:52.940> up<00:00:53.030> to

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
they're not as stiff so I can get up to

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:01.299 
they're not as stiff so I can get up to
spring

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.979 

but<00:01:01.879> I<00:01:01.910> don't<00:01:02.149> know<00:01:02.210> what<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:02.449> is<00:01:02.570> about<00:01:02.750> these

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
but I don't know what it is about these

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.840 
but I don't know what it is about these
cards<00:01:03.289> now<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.559> guess<00:01:03.920> since<00:01:04.610> I've<00:01:04.760> been

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
cards now I guess since I've been

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.170 
cards now I guess since I've been
messing<00:01:05.059> with<00:01:05.210> them<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.540> lot<00:01:06.640> all<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.790> oils

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
messing with them a lot all the oils

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.460 
messing with them a lot all the oils
from<00:01:08.330> my<00:01:08.479> hands<00:01:08.840> have<00:01:08.960> probably<00:01:09.229> gotten

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
from my hands have probably gotten

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.490 
from my hands have probably gotten
inside<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.040> cards<00:01:10.460> goes<00:01:10.700> now<00:01:10.940> they<00:01:11.500> spread

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
inside the cards goes now they spread

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.460 
inside the cards goes now they spread
and<00:01:13.600> they<00:01:14.600> can<00:01:14.780> fan<00:01:15.080> now<00:01:20.080> that's<00:01:21.080> what<00:01:21.259> really

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
and they can fan now that's what really

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.870 
and they can fan now that's what really
surprised<00:01:21.920> me<00:01:22.040> when<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.340> started<00:01:22.580> messing<00:01:22.729> with

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
surprised me when I started messing with

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.080 
surprised me when I started messing with
the<00:01:23.030> cardigan<00:01:23.710> they<00:01:24.710> fed<00:01:25.040> know<00:01:25.729> some<00:01:25.940> people

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.130 
are probably going to say that I put
Fanning<00:01:28.880> powder<00:01:29.060> or<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:29.600> soaked<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.740> deck<00:01:32.140> but

you just been messing with the cards
springing<00:02:15.650> them<00:02:17.050> I'm<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.110> doing<00:02:18.470> basic

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
springing them I'm just doing basic

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.160 
springing them I'm just doing basic
tricks<00:02:19.190> with<00:02:19.340> them<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.730> they<00:02:20.540> found<00:02:20.810> good<00:02:20.959> now

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
tricks with them and they found good now

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.830 
tricks with them and they found good now
I<00:02:21.880> guess<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> more<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.269> play<00:02:23.450> with<00:02:23.569> them<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
I guess the more you play with them the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.690 
I guess the more you play with them the
more<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.230> oils<00:02:25.010> from<00:02:25.130> your<00:02:25.220> hands<00:02:25.489> spread

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
more that oils from your hands spread

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.020 
more that oils from your hands spread
all<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.180> through<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.750> cards<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.910> they

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
all the way through the cards and they

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.000 
all the way through the cards and they
just<00:02:29.180> get<00:02:29.300> better<00:02:29.510> with<00:02:29.630> age<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:33.560> fan<00:02:33.830> just

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
just get better with age they fan just

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.559 
just get better with age they fan just
like<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> normal<00:02:34.549> deck<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.849> bicycles<00:02:35.330> right<00:02:35.360> out

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.940 
that's right I said giant fan let me
show<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:47.299> that<00:02:47.329> looks<00:02:47.660> like

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.280 

they<00:02:52.580> Farrow<00:02:52.879> a<00:02:53.000> lot<00:02:53.239> better<00:02:53.480> too

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:09.059 

that's<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.069> giant<00:03:00.430> fan<00:03:01.049> with<00:03:02.049> plastic<00:03:02.560> cards

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.649 

so<00:03:09.670> I'm<00:03:09.730> bumping<00:03:10.000> up<00:03:10.439> my<00:03:11.439> review<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.920> these

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
so I'm bumping up my review of these

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.589 
so I'm bumping up my review of these
from<00:03:13.659> a5<00:03:14.049> or<00:03:14.079> whatever<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.769> was<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.370> about<00:03:15.939> six

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
from a5 or whatever it was to about six

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.849 
from a5 or whatever it was to about six
six<00:03:17.439> and<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.620> half<00:03:17.680> maybe<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.129> seven<00:03:19.620> because<00:03:20.620> now

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
six and a half maybe a seven because now

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:21.959 
six and a half maybe a seven because now
they're<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.159> perfect<00:03:21.519> car<00:03:21.700> because<00:03:21.879> it

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
they're the perfect car because it

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:28.710 
they're the perfect car because it
plastic<00:03:24.659> they<00:03:25.659> have<00:03:25.840> good<00:03:26.140> grip<00:03:26.439> now<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:28.599> now

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
plastic they have good grip now so now

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.050 
plastic they have good grip now so now
you<00:03:28.810> can<00:03:28.959> do<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.109> lot<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.379> cuts

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.440 

spring<00:03:35.370> let<00:03:36.370> us<00:03:36.489> go<00:03:36.640> back<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.000> same<00:03:37.209> shape

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
spring let us go back to the same shape

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.790 
spring let us go back to the same shape
because<00:03:37.599> they're<00:03:37.930> plastic<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.590> they<00:03:38.650> got

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
because they're plastic and they got

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.800 
because they're plastic and they got
that<00:03:38.980> real<00:03:39.340> nice<00:03:39.550> stiffness<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:42.450> added<00:03:43.450> bonus

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
that real nice stiffness and added bonus

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.320

so maverick playing cards six and a half

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:03.090 
so maverick playing cards six and a half
to<00:03:54.730> seven<00:03:56.250> that's<00:03:57.250> my<00:03:57.520> review<00:03:57.850> update
