 i 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.420
 um 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.250
 and the combine harvester is 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.219
 composed of four modules well 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.619
 first differentiated features 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.770
 the harvest module followed by a 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:22.040
 mechanical cleaning module a module 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.340
 manual cleaning and finally the module 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.530
 of product download the first module 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.590
 It has two rolls of control of 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.280
 depth four cutting blades 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.510
 a conveyor belt to a system of 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.760
 pull out weeds and a set of bars all 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.239
 This module is responsible for carrying out 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.319
 the unearthing of the tubers 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.949
 transporting to the module 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:51.199
 mechanical cleaning this module is 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.199
 composed of a carpet tape with 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.229
 rubber fingers that cushions the fall of the 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.149
 product moving it towards two ro the 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.810
 derivators that have the peculiarity 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.870
 to eliminate weeds and clods 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.140
 after this process the tubers are 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.030
 derivatives on the lifting fingers 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.330
 these fingers through a series of 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.550
 rollers and tape effect the elimination 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.620
 lumps and elevated 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.650
 tubers towards the cleaning module 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.860
 manual which is formed by a table 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.740
 of broken translation for eight positions of 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 work that allow the elimination of 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.370
 the undesirable in a manual way once 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.290
 finished the manual cleaning module 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.440
 All the product is deposited in a 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.380
 storage hopper which through 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.590
 a conveyor belt deposits the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.330
 tubers in the filling sector 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.450
 allowing the use of pockets or 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.530
 pins existing special models that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.790
 they carry out the bagging of the entire product 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.700
 The cr 290 harvester is built 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.619
 on a robust chassis which allows 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.380
 through a cylinder level the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.060
 machine absorbing unevenness of the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.069
 hillside terrain 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.830
 It also has two tires High 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.640
 float those that facilitate a correct 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 displacement on rough terrain 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.380
 Due to its large dimensions, 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.959
 combine harvester has 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.510
 hydraulic steering on its wheels the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.110
 which is commanded from the tractor to 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.300
 facilitate access in headers 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.340
 minimizing in this way the radius of 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.260
 turn 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.410
 EscaÃ±uela has managed to design a machine 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.769
 fully hydraulic powered through 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.470
 of the tractor PTO 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.450
 plus two triple pumps that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 they activate the different orbital motors 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.650
 of each module that make up the machine 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.170
 managing to vary the speed at will 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.870
 with this new release 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.989
 scan once more shows your 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.850
 commitment to the producer putting 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.010
 its disposition 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.620
 new technologies that facilitate 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.530
 work adding in this way your 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.000
 trajectory characterized by quality 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:24.080
 and robustness the new harvester
