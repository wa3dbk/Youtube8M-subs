Chili's<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.130> grow<00:00:20.430> called<00:00:20.760> jaws<00:00:21.060> long<00:00:21.390> which

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
Chili's I grow called jaws long which

Chili's I grow called jaws long which
are<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:23.390> f1<00:00:24.390> hybrid<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.410> means<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
are an f1 hybrid it means I think that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.540 
are an f1 hybrid it means I think that
the<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.689> bread<00:00:27.930> by<00:00:28.140> crossing<00:00:28.470> two<00:00:28.980> specific

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the the bread by crossing two specific

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.179 
the the bread by crossing two specific
different<00:00:30.179> plants<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.800> desired

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
different plants to get the desired

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.819 
different plants to get the desired
plant<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.759> want<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> end<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.829> some

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
plant you want so you end up with a some

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
plant you want so you end up with a some
kind<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.070> freakish<00:00:35.550> thing<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:35.969> that's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
kind of freakish thing like that that's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
kind of freakish thing like that that's
why<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> draw<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> gray<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:38.040> what

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
why I draw because the gray that's what

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
why I draw because the gray that's what
I<00:00:38.280> still<00:00:38.550> got<00:00:38.700> growing<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.540> try<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I still got growing is just to try to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950 
I still got growing is just to try to
dry<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.550> always<00:00:41.780> have<00:00:42.780> always

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
dry it out and they always have always

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
dry it out and they always have always
said<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.469> can't<00:00:43.739> take<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.219> own<00:00:44.340> seeds<00:00:44.640> from

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
said you can't take your own seeds from

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.940 
said you can't take your own seeds from
an<00:00:44.969> f1<00:00:45.300> hybrid<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> resell<00:00:46.800> them

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
an f1 hybrid because if you resell them

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.119 
an f1 hybrid because if you resell them
again<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.640> resultant<00:00:48.120> fruit<00:00:48.420> will<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:49.129> either

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
again the resultant fruit will be either

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
again the resultant fruit will be either
one<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> other<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> parents<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
one or the other of the parents that the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.819 
one or the other of the parents that the
work<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.800> bred<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.969> make<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.390> plant<00:00:54.829> but

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
work that bred to make the plant but

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.770 
work that bred to make the plant but
then<00:00:56.129> offer<00:00:56.309> different<00:00:57.030> views<00:00:57.270> from<00:00:57.480> some<00:00:57.690> of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
then offer different views from some of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.270 
then offer different views from some of
the<00:00:57.840> tops<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.289> growers<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.920> they've

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the tops your growers that they've

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.569 
the tops your growers that they've
actually<00:00:59.460> been<00:00:59.730> reelected<00:01:00.680> f1<00:01:01.680> hybrid<00:01:02.190> tomato

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
actually been reelected f1 hybrid tomato

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.939 
actually been reelected f1 hybrid tomato
varieties<00:01:03.420> some<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.830> get

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
varieties some of them and then we get

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.300 
varieties some of them and then we get
in<00:01:05.040> exactly<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> same<00:01:05.970> fruit<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:08.130> only

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
in exactly the same fruit the only

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
in exactly the same fruit the only
difference<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.270> fewer<00:01:09.720> seeds

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
difference was that they got fewer seeds

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.100 
difference was that they got fewer seeds
in<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:10.680> means<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> amount<00:01:11.250> just

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
in which means that the amount just

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
in which means that the amount just
reverted<00:01:13.110> back<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> male<00:01:13.770> strand<00:01:14.400> male

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
reverted back to the male strand male

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
reverted back to the male strand male
side<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.659> apart<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
side of it but apart from that they

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.940 
side of it but apart from that they
would<00:01:16.920> actually<00:01:17.040> improving<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> strain<00:01:18.509> by

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
would actually improving the strain by

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
would actually improving the strain by
replanting<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.040> hybrid<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.210> supposed

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
replanting in hybrid which is supposed

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.289 
replanting in hybrid which is supposed
to<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.600> rubbish<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to be rubbish but there you go so I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.870 
to be rubbish but there you go so I
thought<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.439> try<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.770> because<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.220> if

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
thought I'm gonna try it because they if

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.980 
thought I'm gonna try it because they if
you<00:01:26.970> look<00:01:27.090> at<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> seed<00:01:27.450> catalogs<00:01:27.869> they're

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you look at the seed catalogs they're

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.830 
you look at the seed catalogs they're
always<00:01:28.200> expensive<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:29.610> getting<00:01:29.880> ten<00:01:30.240> look
