00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.790
 I like alexia and frankly 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.200
 why not if it offers me I 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.639
 may not say not exactly 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.410
 maybe it's interesting to have 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.350
 a reality show for once which is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.199
 based on how to evolve after a TV 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.300
 reality can be interesting in the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.460
 sense where to be filmed every day this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.230
 I do not know how to develop 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.630
 career actually have the harm we get 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 give after to change image 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 I think it's actually what 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.880
 would be more interesting would really 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 a documentary and if it's products 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.680
 precisely this docu-reality about your life 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 you would like to show what in 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.170
 I would like to show my life of all 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 days with my grandmother we see 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.489
 still the links I have with her 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.809
 I would like to perhaps just one 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.829
 took advantage to reunite 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.940
 with my father because I would have 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.770
 maybe not the account to do everything 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 only perhaps with a team 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.020
 behind me I will have more than two pots 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.579
 of wine of opportunity to do it 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.590
 I would like to see how I feel 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.270
 gives the means to actually get there 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.780
 I really am someone who works 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.609
 a lot 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.559
 bader also we give ourselves really 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.540
 means there is a patrician now who 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.159
 joined us on our project so 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780
 it's true that patrice moore chano so 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.560
 an artist here is a little man this 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.720
 artist it's true that begins to have 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.369
 a very good artistic structure but 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.229
 I would really like to see 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.869
 clashes have not his studio whether it's a 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.880
 repeated to really recorded the hours 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.250
 that I spend asking for them for everything 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.439
 what is the promo image all this 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.630
 we actually see all of that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 singing lessons I know what's a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.259
 universe that you want to create as 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.079
 like the collective of lady gaga to haus 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.520
 of gaga with fashion from the song of 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.549
 what is your goal 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.350
 it can be interesting it can be 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.850
 interesting in France because we did not 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.320
 not that actually 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.670
 so why not frankly it's a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.670
 rather interesting project
