00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.830
 1 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.450
 hello welcome on goal.com 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.279
 today still several 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.670
 possibilities of counters on a devil 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.890
 inspired by a video of eric paulson 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.150
 a job I blocked kombouarÃ© in wrestling 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.009
 like this one must not go too far 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.230
 with his wrestling it's right in front of the 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.840
 face like this first possibility 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.730
 I immediately handed over and hangzhou ok 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.460
 so I catchy john key that's the 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.900
 first possibility from there I 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.300
 will be able to place a web 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.470
 of air that so I'm going to do khachan 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.150
 frocks hook cross leg jeans 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.150
 bart there again 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.870
 second possibility what is 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.719
 interesting is that if I have regulars 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.820
 in combat often make wrestling already my 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.250
 opponent I usually face him he 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.710
 will expect gianella I will go back 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.190
 here crochet is still instead 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:18.229
 of the devil come hang place so 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.180
 I have and then I can place the following 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.850
 of the concatenation that is identical to 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.700
 previous that is catch next 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.399
 big slice and nautical ross 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.580
 interior play rests middle jean bart 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.580
 students 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.649
 we added an additional element 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.939
 that I pass the cons in jabou in 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.680
 crochet it's not very important 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.880
 the ag go on the hook for example 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.049
 here when I was finishing will send a 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.780
 cross I ducked uppercut to the bodies of 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:02:00.979
 cages the optics of the leg in the air 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:03.819
 again that gives us in the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.819
 same thing about jazz 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.670
 to work well I recommend you 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.500
 first started on the spot work 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.690
 every step of the sequence with the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.650
 different possibilities and then 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.050
 it 's a little bit of 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.820
 situation on the move so we can 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.470
 start simply by the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.110
 first step for example up tx 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.970
 is already people we are moving we are in 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.430
 situation she can move makes shameful 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.100
 pints and quantel morning cantal he 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.570
 must I hand over every time I can 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.950
 work we can do that for a 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:56.010
 strange mine can work that after 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:58.590
 with the hook the same thing okay 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 she after I incorporate the following of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.150
 the sequence is progressively 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.680
 worked well on for example a round 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.190
 tonight where we two or three minutes 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.050
 so we rarely have the opportunity to 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.390
 repeating well and doing it in form 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.260
 of drill which allows for good makelele 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.730
 well come back the movements think about 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.200
 share this video on the networks 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.880
 social is really what makes its 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.080
 big differences for me what 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.640
 more fun when I have a lot 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.680
 sharing on facebook including 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.090
 if you like it but video click on I like 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.130
 also forsake a little comment 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 for us because if we thought and 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.370
 as I always say whoever believes 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.700
 know no longer learns then guard 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.700
 an open mind 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.380
 it is
