00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.230
 hey what's up and running heartily 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.490
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.200
 his channel is today again and again 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.670
 a call of duty black ops two gameplay 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.660
 and really fast lukas 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.099
 Tichacek 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.450
 I know yesterday you have the map too 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.670
 seen at the live concert of flo 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.690
 By the way, my protégé carmen is flo 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.920
 Thyssen's comments are written 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.720
 is that is that anton has one 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.740
 get deep voice or something is up 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.910
 every case a protege is always 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.640
 a description linked look! 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.289
 times with him and yes usually 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.820
 as I said I never invite the same 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.320
 two days in a row but because 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 The skis are really cool to look at 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 is above all the place where I am 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.809
 believe a twelve man or a 13 man 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700
 have made fit and display that must 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.070
 you have a look 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 apropos feet then becomes eighth gamertag 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.079
 by marcel because I am still 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.430
 to visit them 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.780
 I think I have to go tomorrow 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.360
 that's her salary 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.280
 on the first of january 2014 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.750
 and yes tomorrow I have to go back 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.399
 unfortunately hain was definitely a whole 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.660
 short time so here the first basket fell 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.489
 already done as I said I believe 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.809
 I will not think so 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.670
 Idea three pieces or so made up 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.760
 any case bad to look here already 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.050
 the next feed and yes people on 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.789
 In any case, the camp in front of me does not play 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.129
 where marcel was otherwise would have the gameplay 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.600
 another precise say I know 24 times 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.680
 that of marcel but in the game 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.880
 In any case, I do not believe one 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.409
 changed times and not really like that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.369
 a lot of gameplay but as I said 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.630
 that in any case I only for 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.430
 and I will definitely see you 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.080
 like and he wanted in this video 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.720
 I'll tell you the story very briefly 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.570
 and people like me the few xbox 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 gamer days say I have spent time 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.619
 was probably really funny I wanted 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.240
 absolutely with gandalf and so play 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.920
 with sonic and so on with the whole 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 xbox people because I knew that yes 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 so to speak he only skype on without the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 now dry together and though 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.570
 In any case, the funniest thing to do 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.270
 Gandalf people you have to do that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 reinziehen we have it or has 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.970
 more or less the header 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.009
 without the action in the year 2014 too 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.509
 start 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.340
 incredible one minute took people 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.869
 until he has done that again 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.490
 at fifa so in any case he has the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.840
 presiding maintained very long 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.759
 was definitely going to be on 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.009
 definitely people is one of gandalf 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.930
 People 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.219
 He's just extremely lucky 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.719
 can actually make him happy 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.979
 without shit you go to his name 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.750
 Felder writes him in the comments 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.239
 quite a bit of the latest video 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.310
 you have a lot of luck and hope 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.880
 In any case, he continues to be so lucky 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.050
 will have something like that people could 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.020
 Make comments would definitely 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.310
 very funny and here, by the way, already 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.960
 nuclear with your right I said 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.240
 believe the 150 seconds one 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.370
 fastest douglas and yes as I said 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.410
 Definitely via classic gameplay 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.210
 I do not even know if I have like that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.350
 Bafin spokesman but people the real 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.420
 so funny you have to 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.250
 it is conceivable that this is behind me 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.810
 Really so if someone comments 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:43.000
 behind him is as if the poop 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:44.770
 heimschauauer yes I believe so yes 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.940
 In any case, I do not just have one 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.470
 nuclear means reached at these 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.030
 Gameplay should even have one more 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.150
 second I do not quite know how 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.470
 long the gameplay will go 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.980
 or how many do I get you from it 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.560
 show 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.870
 By the way, the crudest ps3 opponent 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.430
 in fact one of the best 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.560
 Time has given us here 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.300
 but my whole the xbox opponent says 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.610
 Marcel 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.110
 and yes people as I said I'm so often 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.400
 Xbox also played a few days in call 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.410
 of duty calls on the games on the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.870
 xbox black ops 2 I do not want it 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.510
 necessarily xbox opponents talk bad 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.670
 or so people 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.770
 this myth that so much on xbox 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.380
 extremely difficult is a gamepad to 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.140
 maybe i play at least minimal 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.090
 would say ten percent about because 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.770
 I believe in the first round 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.760
 could the big twenty before tricks 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.410
 although I had with these 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.640
 play crappy xbox controller 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.880
 So I have to shit for me 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.320
 not deal with these sticks but now 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.550
 yes, you have to be this 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.780
 do not let it happen in any case 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.890
 running around on xbox only images and what it 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.930
 for kampers in each lobby is over 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.500
 All of this is definitely the case 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.300
 not true 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.980
 and yes I hope people on each of 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.270
 like the short comments like 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.620
 said do not forget in any case 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.870
 I can stop by there 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.160
 I 'm left one time his channel also one 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.840
 description as well as the channel of 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.070
 a protégé of flow and the like 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.630
 In any case, the newest 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.580
 video by gandalf and write yourself 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.230
 the comments happy or he 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.880
 would definitely be happy and yes 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.620
 hotline until the next buy on each 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.810
 If you like this , it has clearly fallen 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.970
 and skin in until next time 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:22.140
 we will not forget 2006 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.140
 So it ok people today 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 Yes
