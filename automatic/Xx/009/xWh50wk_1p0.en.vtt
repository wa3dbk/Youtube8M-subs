video which is why i made it was
definitely<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> connection<00:01:36.110> because<00:01:37.110> i<00:01:37.200> live

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
definitely the connection because i live

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
definitely the connection because i live
in<00:01:37.439> perth<00:01:37.770> western<00:01:38.009> australia<00:01:38.310> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
changed a tactical layout for ages like

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.780 
changed a tactical layout for ages like
I<00:03:25.170> switch<00:03:25.680> back<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:25.920> forth<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.580> just

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
I switch back and forth and just

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.120 
I switch back and forth and just
gradually<00:03:27.630> went<00:03:27.960> back<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.530> normal<00:03:28.950> one

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
gradually went back to the normal one

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.020 
gradually went back to the normal one
all<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.340> time<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:29.880> um<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:32.250> then<00:03:32.460> this<00:03:32.760> time<00:03:33.000> I

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
all the time and um and then this time I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.940 
all the time and um and then this time I
practically<00:03:33.600> stuck<00:03:33.960> with<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.290> tactical<00:03:34.770> out

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950

though you're giving away your knife

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.190 
though you're giving away your knife

better than you know knifing because of

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.900 
better than you know knifing because of
the<00:03:57.540> slow<00:03:57.840> slow<00:03:58.530> paced<00:03:58.830> games<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.580> clan

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
the slow slow paced games in clan

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.810 
the slow slow paced games in clan
matches<00:04:00.770> but<00:04:01.770> because<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.280> lose<00:04:02.430> your<00:04:02.640> knife

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
matches but because you lose your knife

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.420 
matches but because you lose your knife
in<00:04:03.060> public<00:04:03.750> matches<00:04:04.010> your<00:04:05.010> kind<00:04:05.310> of

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
in public matches your kind of

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.840 
in public matches your kind of
disadvantage<00:04:06.150> because<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:08.190> pace<00:04:08.460> is<00:04:08.640> much

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
disadvantage because the pace is much

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.510 
disadvantage because the pace is much
faster<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:10.230> likelihood<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.160> going

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
faster that the likelihood of you going

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.390 
faster that the likelihood of you going
into<00:04:11.850> close<00:04:12.270> range<00:04:12.630> like<00:04:13.400> close-quarter

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
into close range like close-quarter

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.970 
into close range like close-quarter
battles<00:04:15.150> where<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.260> knife<00:04:16.470> will<00:04:16.710> be<00:04:16.799> better

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
battles where the knife will be better

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.099 
battles where the knife will be better
than<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.190> gun<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.790> much<00:04:18.120> higher

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
than the gun is much higher

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.439 
than the gun is much higher
that<00:04:19.259> using<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.069> tactical<00:04:20.549> layout<00:04:20.759> or<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.299> me

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
that using the tactical layout or to me

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.640 
that using the tactical layout or to me
because<00:04:22.439> I<00:04:22.590> don't<00:04:22.830> have<00:04:22.860> fast<00:04:23.159> fingers<00:04:23.310> I

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
because I don't have fast fingers I

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.110 
because I don't have fast fingers I
practically<00:04:25.650> lose<00:04:26.009> about<00:04:26.310> ninety<00:04:26.699> percent<00:04:26.819> of

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
practically lose about ninety percent of

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.700 
practically lose about ninety percent of
my<00:04:27.270> knife<00:04:27.479> battles<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:30.150> know<00:04:30.270> I'm<00:04:31.229> kind

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
my knife battles and you know I'm kind

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.100 
my knife battles and you know I'm kind
of<00:04:31.770> used<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.069> that<00:04:32.250> now<00:04:32.460> so<00:04:32.909> I've<00:04:33.330> practically

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
of used to that now so I've practically

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.830 
of used to that now so I've practically
learned<00:04:34.469> going<00:04:35.189> into<00:04:35.550> public<00:04:35.939> matches<00:04:36.090> trying

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
learned going into public matches trying

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.740 
learned going into public matches trying
not<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.259> get<00:04:37.860> too<00:04:38.069> close<00:04:38.250> with<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.639> enemy

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
not to get too close with the enemy

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.119 
not to get too close with the enemy
because<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.780> know<00:04:40.080> I'm<00:04:40.439> probably<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:41.009> get

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
because I know I'm probably going to get

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.100 
because I know I'm probably going to get
pruned<00:04:41.479> so<00:04:42.479> so<00:04:43.370> yeah<00:04:44.370> that's<00:04:44.580> that's<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.960> way

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
pruned so so yeah that's that's the way

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.540 
pruned so so yeah that's that's the way
it<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:46.289> I<00:04:46.349> mean<00:04:46.620> you're<00:04:46.830> obviously<00:04:46.860> going<00:04:47.430> to

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
it is I mean you're obviously going to

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.290 
it is I mean you're obviously going to
gain<00:04:47.759> something<00:04:48.090> with<00:04:49.460> one<00:04:50.460> thing<00:04:50.699> and<00:04:50.909> losing

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
gain something with one thing and losing

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.330 
gain something with one thing and losing
another<00:04:51.509> so<00:04:52.020> with<00:04:52.319> the<00:04:52.469> tactical<00:04:52.919> layout<00:04:53.099> I've

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
another so with the tactical layout I've

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.429 
another so with the tactical layout I've
got<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.639> drop<00:04:53.879> shot<00:04:54.060> now<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:54.960> I've<00:04:55.080> lost<00:04:55.289> them

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
got the drop shot now but I've lost them
