especially the practical side of things
because<00:02:43.870> we're<00:02:44.140> doing<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.380> lot<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.530> late<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
because we're doing a lot of late the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.479 
because we're doing a lot of late the
first<00:02:46.239> practical<00:02:46.360> thing<00:02:46.780> we<00:02:46.900> did<00:02:47.310> one<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
first practical thing we did one of the

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.009 
first practical thing we did one of the
first<00:02:48.670> practical<00:02:49.030> things<00:02:49.330> we<00:02:49.510> did<00:02:49.660> seeing<00:02:49.870> as

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
first practical things we did seeing as

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.930 
first practical things we did seeing as
we've<00:02:50.170> almost<00:02:50.380> done<00:02:50.860> half<00:02:51.069> half<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.610> far<00:02:51.850> as

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
we've almost done half half as far as

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.150 
we've almost done half half as far as
theory<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.360> practical<00:02:52.660> still<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.560> 20<00:02:53.920> minute

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160

three kilometers and I'm not a runner
I'm<00:02:59.380> not<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> long<00:02:59.799> distance<00:03:00.280> R<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.430> was<00:03:00.700> always

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
I'm not a long distance R I was always

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.430 
I'm not a long distance R I was always
good<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.090> short<00:03:01.360> distance<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:01.930> hate<00:03:02.140> long

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
good at short distance but I hate long

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.740 
good at short distance but I hate long
distance<00:03:02.950> it's<00:03:03.549> just<00:03:03.730> me<00:03:03.880> because<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.540> lift

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
distance it's just me because I lift

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.059 
distance it's just me because I lift
weights<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.680> short<00:03:06.250> distance<00:03:06.670> yeah<00:03:07.450> so

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
weights and I do short distance yeah so
