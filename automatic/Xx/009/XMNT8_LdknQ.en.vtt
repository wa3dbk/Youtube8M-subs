00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:09.570
 to complete knitting in a circle to us 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.550
 it is necessary to close the last row for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.910
 to the chain we had 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:22.730
 continuous and logical to this us 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.930
 it will be necessary to cut off the excess yarn 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 leaving a little ponytail 10 centimeters 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:36.420
 pull a loop pull this thread out 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.390
 loop further we will need knitted 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.140
 needle tread end 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:48.680
 we put in a tail the remaining tail in 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 corner and mimic the loop 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.640
 the final row of needle pull through 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.640
 both edges of the loop 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.239
 do not pull much 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.239
 once 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:16.649
 and then stretch into the second part 2 1 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.869
 we simulated the loop need 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.469
 adjust it to tension 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.000
 It was like all the rest and further we 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:30.270
 start to fix too we do it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.959
 very neat without undue tension 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.379
 so that it is not noticeable so that the product does not 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:43.520
 distorted 

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:50.549
 carefully hide and carefully hide 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:59.369
 the remaining tail is required 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:02:04.099
 pull up and stereo so again not 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.099
 deform products on one side and 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:14.400
 on the other hand so that when using 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:18.090
 it is not . popped not initially after 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.669
 as you carefully hid her 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:29.099
 it needs to be cut off 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:33.410
 kind of loop is basically impossible to be 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.410
 find chains in a common chain
