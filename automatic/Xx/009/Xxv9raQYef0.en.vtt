00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
percent that was a crazy death note that
this<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.969> before<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> an-94<00:00:51.960> nerve<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
this was before the an-94 nerve for the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.110 
this was before the an-94 nerve for the
whole<00:00:52.949> patch<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.399> came<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.730> two<00:00:53.910> days<00:00:54.090> ago

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120

or whatever was um this was before that
came<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:59.160> normally<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.760> get

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
came out and I think normally don't get

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
came out and I think normally don't get
me<00:01:00.030> wrong<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> an-94<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.289> close<00:01:01.500> range

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
me wrong that the an-94 at close range

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.280 
me wrong that the an-94 at close range
and<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.280> pretty<00:01:02.460> close<00:01:02.699> range<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.989> takes

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and this was pretty close range it takes

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.690 
and this was pretty close range it takes
like<00:01:04.379> two<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> three<00:01:04.830> bullets<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.430> maybe<00:01:05.610> even

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
like two to three bullets or maybe even

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
like two to three bullets or maybe even
three<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> four<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> kill<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> guy<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.770> are

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
three to four to kill a guy and this are

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
three to four to kill a guy and this are
in<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.460> instance<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.090> had<00:01:09.270> three<00:01:09.659> bullets

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
in this instance I had three bullets

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.980 
in this instance I had three bullets
dead<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.860> into<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> guys<00:01:11.460> upper<00:01:11.970> body<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
dead on into the guys upper body that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.230 
dead on into the guys upper body that
didn't<00:01:13.290> even<00:01:13.350> kill<00:01:13.680> him<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.070> three<00:01:14.490> shots<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
didn't even kill him in three shots so

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.580 
didn't even kill him in three shots so
maybe<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.780> more<00:01:15.960> would<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.259> finished<00:01:16.380> him

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
maybe one more would have finished him

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.350 
maybe one more would have finished him
off<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:16.950> we'll<00:01:17.100> never<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:18.030> shot

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
off but we'll never know because he shot

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
off but we'll never know because he shot
right<00:01:18.659> next<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> me<00:01:19.290> didn't<00:01:19.619> hit<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:19.920> body<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
right next to me didn't hit my body and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
right next to me didn't hit my body and
he<00:01:21.119> killed<00:01:21.360> me<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.600> let's<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.930> ahead<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> watch

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.649 
he killed me so let's go ahead and watch
a<00:01:22.590> slower<00:01:22.979> version<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.299> happened
