00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.540 
have to worry about getting the thing up
and<00:00:51.210> running<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.230> will<00:00:52.710> work<00:00:52.890> right<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and running this will work right out of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
and running this will work right out of
the<00:00:53.610> box<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:53.969> pull<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.600> even<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:54.989> 16

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the box just pull it out it even has 16

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.520 
the box just pull it out it even has 16
gigs<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> memory<00:00:56.039> built<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.260> already

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
gigs of memory built in so you already

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
gigs of memory built in so you already
have<00:00:58.890> tons<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.430> storage<00:00:59.670> on<00:01:00.030> board<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.780> then

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
have tons of storage on board and then

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.270 
have tons of storage on board and then
if<00:01:00.989> you'd<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.620> add<00:01:01.949> even<00:01:02.129> more

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
if you'd like to you can add even more

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.140 
if you'd like to you can add even more
by<00:01:03.120> adding<00:01:03.600> an<00:01:03.780> SD<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.290> SDHC<00:01:04.530> card<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.880> can

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
by adding an SD or SDHC card so you can

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
by adding an SD or SDHC card so you can
literally<00:01:06.479> expand<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.439> far<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.130> want

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
literally expand this as far as you want

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
literally expand this as far as you want
so<00:01:08.640> once<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> fill<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> memory<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.960> can

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
so once you fill up the memory you can

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
so once you fill up the memory you can
just<00:01:10.229> keep<00:01:10.409> swapping<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.979> SD<00:01:11.400> cards<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
just keep swapping out SD cards so you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.760 
just keep swapping out SD cards so you
never<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> worry<00:01:12.869> about<00:01:13.080> running<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
never have to worry about running out of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.210 
never have to worry about running out of
space<00:01:14.189> ever<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.560> time-lapse

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
space ever it does have a time-lapse

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.710 
space ever it does have a time-lapse
shooting<00:01:17.640> mode<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.119> set<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
shooting mode so you can set this up and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.390 
shooting mode so you can set this up and
get<00:01:18.990> some<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.680> cool<00:01:19.830> time-lapse
