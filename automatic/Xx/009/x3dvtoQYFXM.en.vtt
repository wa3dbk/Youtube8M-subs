00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.040
Today I will be making mathris or salted crackers.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.760
Traditionally in India they are served with pickle.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.290
It’s a very good snack.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.240
Or you can have this with a bowl of soup.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.100
This recipe will make about 40 mathris.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.500
So dough I am going to make in food processor.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.560
Here I have 2 cups of all purpose flour.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.100
1/2 cup of suji or semolina flour

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.660
4 tablespoons of oil

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.109
1 teaspoon of salt

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.840
1 teaspoon of ajwain

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.780
And 1/2 cup of lukewarm water.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:12.640
So I have here 2 cups of all purpose flour.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.960
1/2 cup of semolina flour

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.860
1 teaspoon of salt

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.520
1 teaspoon of ajwain

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.840
And 4 tablespoons of oil.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.680
And I am going to mix this.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.560
Going to add 1/2 cup of lukewarm water.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.240
I think I need about 2 more teaspoons.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.260
Dough is ready.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.980
Just going to knead this dough just for a minute.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.840
So dough should be hard.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.500
I am going to divide this dough in 4 equal parts.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.860
Now divide this in about 10 pieces.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.720
And roll them.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.840
And roll them in about 1.5 inch diameter.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.060
So  now we have to prick them with fork so they don’t puff up.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.980
Instead of doing one at a time.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:56.700
I usually will take about 4-5 and do it.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.740
And from this side.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.880
Heat is on, medium.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.160
So let’s see if this is ready.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.320
Need to put just little piece of dough.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.360
And if you can see the sizzling and coming up

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.360
so oil is ready.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.620
You should have at least 1 inch of oil in your frying pan.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.220
And mathris takes about 7-8 minutes before they are ready.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.720
And after they come up then you can turn them.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.720
Like you see all the mathris are floating on the top of the oil.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.520
So we are going to turn them.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.020
They should be golden brown from both sides.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.100
Don’t use the higher heat otherwise mathris won’t be crisp.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.840
There are going to be soft.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.520
Mathris are looking really good.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.260
Very good color, golden brown.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.360
It’s time to take them out.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.280
Mathris are looking great.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.040
You serve mathris on room temperature.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.210
After they get cold they get very crisp.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.760
I like mathris to serve with pickle.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.800
And this is my favorite food to take for travelling.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.290
Thank you.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.060
I will see you again.
