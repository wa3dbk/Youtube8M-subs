 way too romantic you are real 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.750
 I have met for a long time 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.750
 once again punished in the life 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.880
 and I risked something 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.760
 landau 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.619
 a happy end is completely out of the question 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.310
 As far as the sex is concerned, everything is in it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.210
 You know you've said that to us 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.050
 I almost had such a fear of doing 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.870
 died 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.130
 because of blindfolds too 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.810
 my party died 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.640
 So I hope you wear a mask 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.480
 but never when I stand something 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.320
 fingertip feeling is not exactly 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.320
 her strength is not true
