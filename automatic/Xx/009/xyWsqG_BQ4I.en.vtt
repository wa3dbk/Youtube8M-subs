00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
everything that I do to one side is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.789 
everything that I do to one side is
exactly<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.850> same<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.990> other<00:01:31.020> side<00:01:31.229> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is the same on the other side then you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.160 
is the same on the other side then you
want<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.759> ahead<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> put<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.540> redstone

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
want to go ahead and put the redstone

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.770 
want to go ahead and put the redstone
wire<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.070> Block<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:39.000> top<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> redstone

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
wire on the Block on top of the redstone

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
wire on the Block on top of the redstone
torch<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.009> next<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> left<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
torch and the next one to the left and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.270 
torch and the next one to the left and
like<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.479> said<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> same<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.409> both<00:01:43.470> sides

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
like I said it's the same on both sides

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
then you want to go ahead and dig two

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550 
then you want to go ahead and dig two
blocks<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.689> leading<00:01:48.689> from<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.290> redstone

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
blocks down leading from one redstone

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
blocks down leading from one redstone
torch<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.610> way<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.119> side<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
torch all the way to the other side to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
torch all the way to the other side to
the<00:01:51.960> other<00:01:51.990> redstone<00:01:52.649> torch<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.060> you're

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the other redstone torch and you're

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
the other redstone torch and you're
going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> use<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.290> bottom<00:01:55.950> block<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
going to use the bottom block here to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600 
going to use the bottom block here to
run<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.450> redstone<00:01:57.899> wire<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.009> way<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.159> one

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
run a redstone wire all the way from one

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.789 
run a redstone wire all the way from one
side<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> other<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.590> dot

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
side to the other and then with your dot

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.499 
side to the other and then with your dot
when<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.329> can

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
when you're when you do that you can

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
when you're when you do that you can
then<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.780> ahead<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.960> cover<00:02:04.409> all<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.950> up<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
then go ahead and cover all that up so

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
then go ahead and cover all that up so
you<00:02:05.430> don't<00:02:05.670> need<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> leave<00:02:06.299> out<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> gaps

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you don't need to leave out the gaps

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.839 
you don't need to leave out the gaps
you're<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.310> want<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> cover<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.789> up

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
you're going to want to cover it up

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.889 
you're going to want to cover it up
because<00:02:08.970> you're<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.330> want<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.509> put<00:02:09.690> down

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
because you're going to want to put down

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.260 
because you're going to want to put down
blocks<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.459> pressure<00:02:11.849> plates<00:02:12.180> are

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
blocks here and then pressure plates are

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.140 
blocks here and then pressure plates are
going<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.660> there<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.870> then

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
going to go on there and then

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.670 
going to go on there and then
is<00:02:13.239> what's<00:02:13.420> going<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.569> activate<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.230> redstone

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
is what's going to activate the redstone

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.130 
is what's going to activate the redstone
and<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.549> to<00:02:15.700> allow<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.299> door<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.810> be

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and it's going to allow the door to be

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.559 
and it's going to allow the door to be
opened<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.980> like<00:02:18.189> that<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:19.450> you're

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
opened just like that and then you're

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.880 
opened just like that and then you're
going<00:02:19.659> to<00:02:19.720> want<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.989> do<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.349> same<00:02:20.560> thing<00:02:20.769> on

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
going to want to do the same thing on

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.559 
going to want to do the same thing on
the<00:02:20.950> other<00:02:21.010> side<00:02:21.189> so<00:02:21.730> when<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:21.970> come<00:02:22.150> into<00:02:22.329> the

the other side so when you come into the

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.390 
the other side so when you come into the
house<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.590> doors<00:02:23.769> open<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.250> when

know they open they open and close for

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.490 
know they open they open and close for
you<00:02:28.299> again<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.659> don't<00:02:28.750> want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.019> just<00:02:29.110> go<00:02:29.319> one

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
you again you don't want to just go one

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.530 
you again you don't want to just go one
way<00:02:29.739> so<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.519> do<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:30.939> other<00:02:31.060> side<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.420> want

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
way so to do on the other side you want

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.119 
way so to do on the other side you want
to<00:02:31.659> dig<00:02:31.870> two<00:02:32.079> blocks<00:02:32.319> under<00:02:32.560> again<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:33.040> then

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
to dig two blocks under again and then

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.890 
to dig two blocks under again and then
connected<00:02:33.609> the<00:02:33.670> red<00:02:33.849> stone<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.450> all

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
connected the red stone like this all

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.500 
connected the red stone like this all
the<00:02:35.109> way<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.470> edge<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.180> want<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.420> go

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the way to the edge then you want to go

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.720 
the way to the edge then you want to go
ahead<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.750> put<00:02:37.930> fill<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.799> two<00:02:38.980> blocks<00:02:39.250> space

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
ahead and put fill the two blocks space

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.190 
ahead and put fill the two blocks space
in<00:02:40.000> here<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.540> you're<00:02:40.599> going<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.810> want<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.019> put

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
in here and you're going to want to put

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.319 
in here and you're going to want to put
the<00:02:41.470> pressure<00:02:41.829> plates<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.700> one<00:02:42.849> closest

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
the pressure plates on the one closest

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.420 
the pressure plates on the one closest
to<00:02:43.359> you<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.739> now<00:02:44.920> when<00:02:45.159> you<00:02:45.220> go<00:02:45.340> on

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
to you like that so now when you go on

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.059 
to you like that so now when you go on
one<00:02:45.609> side<00:02:45.879> it<00:02:46.239> will<00:02:46.540> open<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.230> close<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.889> then

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
one side it will open and close and then

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.500 
one side it will open and close and then
it'll<00:02:48.310> do<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.579> same<00:02:48.760> thing<00:02:48.970> when<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.239> go<00:02:49.389> from

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
it'll do the same thing when you go from

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.390 
it'll do the same thing when you go from
the<00:02:49.690> other<00:02:49.810> side<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.409> way<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.099> door<00:02:51.280> will

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
the other side that way the door will

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.009 
the other side that way the door will
open<00:02:51.489> when<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.790> want<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.090> walk<00:02:52.209> in<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.629> it

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
open when you want to walk in and it

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.440 
open when you want to walk in and it
will<00:02:53.170> close<00:02:53.349> behind<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.859> so<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.549> is<00:02:54.909> all<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
will close behind you so that is all the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.960 
will close behind you so that is all the
redstone<00:02:55.959> wiring<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.370> all<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.639> redstone

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
redstone wiring that is all the redstone

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.910 
redstone wiring that is all the redstone
functionality<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.659> is<00:02:58.720> done<00:02:59.079> so<00:02:59.470> everything

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
functionality that is done so everything

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.210 
functionality that is done so everything
that<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.189> do<00:03:00.340> after<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.579> is<00:03:00.700> completely

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
that you do after that is completely

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.819 
that you do after that is completely
cosmetic<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.370> guess<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:04.030> wanted<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:05.560> you

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
cosmetic I guess you just wanted if you

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.289 
cosmetic I guess you just wanted if you
want<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.069> close<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.489> like<00:03:06.639> I<00:03:06.760> do<00:03:06.819> here<00:03:07.150> you

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
want to close it in like I do here you

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.670 
want to close it in like I do here you
can<00:03:07.450> do<00:03:07.569> that<00:03:07.750> make<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.139> look<00:03:08.319> more<00:03:08.470> like<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
can do that make it look more like a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.860 
can do that make it look more like a
door<00:03:08.980> I'm<00:03:09.849> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> cover<00:03:10.239> up<00:03:10.480> all<00:03:10.689> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
door I'm going to cover up all the

make inside my house so this is kind of
a<00:03:25.840> design<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.260> i<00:03:26.470> came<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.919> with<00:03:27.099> you<00:03:27.280> know

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
a design that i came up with you know

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.159 
a design that i came up with you know
you<00:03:27.549> could<00:03:27.790> basically<00:03:28.150> do<00:03:28.540> anything<00:03:28.659> you<00:03:28.989> want

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
you could basically do anything you want

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.210 
you could basically do anything you want
with<00:03:29.199> this<00:03:29.379> you<00:03:29.590> know<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.739> don't<00:03:29.949> even<00:03:30.040> have

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
with this you know you don't even have

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.009 
with this you know you don't even have
to<00:03:30.310> make<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.699> three<00:03:30.970> high<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.750> could<00:03:31.900> even

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
to make it three high you could even

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.479 
to make it three high you could even
just<00:03:32.230> make<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.560> door<00:03:32.709> too<00:03:32.949> high<00:03:33.159> if<00:03:33.370> you

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
just make the door too high if you

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.759 
just make the door too high if you
wanted<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.909> it's<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.780> same<00:03:35.019> function<00:03:35.470> just

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
wanted to it's the same function just

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.280 
wanted to it's the same function just
without<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.220> top<00:03:36.760> piston<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.959> top

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
without the top piston and the top

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.460 
without the top piston and the top
redstone<00:03:39.069> that<00:03:39.790> connects<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.209> piston<00:03:40.470> so

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
redstone that connects to that piston so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.039 
redstone that connects to that piston so
here<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.370> am<00:03:42.459> for<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.849> next<00:03:43.120> part<00:03:43.359> I'm<00:03:43.720> going<00:03:43.959> to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
you can do with lamps so you don't have

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.990 
you can do with lamps so you don't have
to<00:03:48.909> rely<00:03:49.209> on<00:03:49.470> sunlight<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.680> torches<00:03:51.639> if<00:03:51.879> you

you can see what you're doing it's the
same<00:04:19.750> thing<00:04:19.780> here<00:04:20.229> you're<00:04:20.590> using<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.979> switch

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
same thing here you're using a switch

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.190 
same thing here you're using a switch
and<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.729> can<00:04:21.940> turn<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.719> off<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.990> lights

and it can turn on and off the lights
now<00:04:23.409> because<00:04:23.889> that<00:04:24.039> is<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.159> switched<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.639> will

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
now because that is a switched you will

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.590 
now because that is a switched you will
have<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.260> flip<00:04:26.260> it

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600

the house you have to flip it again it
will<00:04:32.150> not<00:04:32.300> go<00:04:32.390> automatically<00:04:32.900> this<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.650> also

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
will not go automatically this is also

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.430 
will not go automatically this is also
good<00:04:34.040> because<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.580> allows<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.450> leave<00:04:36.320> it

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
good because it allows you to leave it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.600 
good because it allows you to leave it
on<00:04:36.560> when<00:04:36.950> you're<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.250> house<00:04:37.400> without

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
on when you're in the house without

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.550 
on when you're in the house without
having<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.030> worry<00:04:38.210> about<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.540> here<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:39.410> this

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
having to worry about it here so this

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.520 
having to worry about it here so this
other<00:04:39.680> redstone<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.370> wire<00:04:40.640> is<00:04:40.850> run<00:04:41.230> it's<00:04:42.230> run

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
other redstone it wire is run it's run

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.910 
other redstone it wire is run it's run
up<00:04:42.770> another<00:04:43.310> stare<00:04:43.850> like<00:04:44.120> step<00:04:44.720> up<00:04:45.020> from<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
up another stare like step up from the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.100 
up another stare like step up from the
block<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.580> switch<00:04:46.820> is<00:04:46.970> on<00:04:47.150> as<00:04:47.480> you<00:04:47.990> can

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
block that the switch is on as you can

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.810 
block that the switch is on as you can
see<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.410> was<00:04:48.560> hidden<00:04:49.040> behind<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.430> wall<00:04:49.580> and

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
see it was hidden behind the wall and

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.870 
see it was hidden behind the wall and
all<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.180> was<00:04:50.450> hidden<00:04:50.660> under<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.590> ceiling<00:04:51.980> um

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
all this was hidden under the ceiling um

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.840 
all this was hidden under the ceiling um
this<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.780> how<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.290> redstone<00:04:55.160> wire<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.610> laid

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
this is how the redstone wire is laid

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.330 
this is how the redstone wire is laid
out<00:04:55.880> on<00:04:56.030> top<00:04:56.510> of<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:57.050> redstone<00:04:57.500> lamp<00:04:57.800> if<00:04:58.010> you

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
out on top of the redstone lamp if you

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.370 
out on top of the redstone lamp if you
were<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.670> add<00:04:58.790> one<00:04:59.120> more<00:04:59.360> row<00:04:59.600> of<00:04:59.870> redstone

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
were to add one more row of redstone

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.580 
were to add one more row of redstone
lamp<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.430> right<00:05:02.090> of<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.420> you<00:05:02.930> will<00:05:03.440> have

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
lamp to the right of that you will have

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.260 
lamp to the right of that you will have
to<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:04.070> would<00:05:04.220> have<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.490> add<00:05:04.640> one<00:05:04.850> more<00:05:05.030> line

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
to you would have to add one more line

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.930 
to you would have to add one more line
of<00:05:05.570> redstone<00:05:06.260> like<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.040> two<00:05:07.220> there<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:07.730> it

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
of redstone like the two there so it

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.470 
of redstone like the two there so it
powers<00:05:08.750> all<00:05:09.310> for<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.550> lines<00:05:10.880> there<00:05:11.150> but<00:05:11.360> you

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
powers all for the lines there but you

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.840 
powers all for the lines there but you
can<00:05:11.630> power<00:05:11.810> three<00:05:12.260> lines<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.710> lamp<00:05:12.920> with<00:05:13.550> only

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
can power three lines of lamp with only

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.020 
can power three lines of lamp with only
two<00:05:14.380> full<00:05:15.380> lines<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:16.040> redstone<00:05:16.430> just<00:05:16.880> like

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
two full lines of redstone just like

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.810 
two full lines of redstone just like
that<00:05:17.240> because<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.440> one<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:19.670> doesn't

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
that because the the one that doesn't

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.430 
that because the the one that doesn't
have<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.150> redstone<00:05:20.480> water<00:05:20.660> on<00:05:20.810> it<00:05:20.930> will<00:05:21.080> carry

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
have the redstone water on it will carry

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.000 
have the redstone water on it will carry
the<00:05:21.590> circuit<00:05:22.010> for<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:23.390> other<00:05:23.540> ones<00:05:23.750> so<00:05:24.170> that's

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
the circuit for the other ones so that's

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.740 
the circuit for the other ones so that's
that's<00:05:25.580> basically<00:05:25.940> it<00:05:26.030> guys<00:05:26.300> that's<00:05:26.570> the

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
that's basically it guys that's the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.500
