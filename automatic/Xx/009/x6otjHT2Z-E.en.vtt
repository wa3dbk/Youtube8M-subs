working of my auto water change system
normally<00:00:26.279> what<00:00:26.460> starts<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> off<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.300> that

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
normally what starts it off is that

seven<00:00:28.560> o'clock<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:29.250> apex<00:00:29.820> unit<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.449> just

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
seven o'clock my apex unit there just

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
seven o'clock my apex unit there just
starts<00:00:31.740> spitting<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.250> an<00:00:32.399> alarm<00:00:32.669> saying<00:00:33.120> hey

a<00:00:33.660> water<00:00:34.410> change<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.950> about<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.309> begin

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
a water change is about to begin

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.119 
a water change is about to begin
it's<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.899> seven<00:00:37.170> o'clock<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:37.950> when

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.700 
it's not seven o'clock right now when
I'm<00:00:38.280> filming<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.790> portion<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> video

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
I'm filming this portion of the video

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
I'm filming this portion of the video
but<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:41.129> basically<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.790> happens<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
but that's basically what happens then I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
but that's basically what happens then I
have<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> opportunity<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.340> want<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.760> run

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
have the opportunity if I want to run

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
have the opportunity if I want to run
into<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> other<00:00:45.480> room<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.750> monitor<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
into the other room the monitor and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
into the other room the monitor and
watch<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.640> only<00:00:47.760> goes<00:00:48.000> off<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> couple

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
watch it it only goes off for a couple

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
watch it it only goes off for a couple
seconds<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> whole<00:00:50.430> system

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
seconds and then then the whole system

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
seconds and then then the whole system
starts<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.390> process<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
starts into process so let's go take a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.510 
starts into process so let's go take a
look<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.399> process<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.399> here<00:00:56.399> we've

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
look at that process now so here we've

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.069 
look at that process now so here we've
got<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> old<00:00:56.910> salt<00:00:57.180> water<00:00:57.390> bucket<00:00:57.870> what's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
got the old salt water bucket what's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.660 
got the old salt water bucket what's
going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.260> happen<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.100> old<00:00:59.219> salt<00:00:59.460> water

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
going to happen is the old salt water

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
going to happen is the old salt water
pump<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> pump<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> water<00:01:01.050> into

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
pump is going to pump the water into

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160 
pump is going to pump the water into
here<00:01:02.359> hopefully<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.449> should<00:01:03.600> hit<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.780> black

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
here hopefully it should hit that black

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.539 
here hopefully it should hit that black
line<00:01:04.500> I've<00:01:04.890> done<00:01:05.129> some<00:01:05.339> tweaking<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> it's

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
line I've done some tweaking and it's

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.370 
line I've done some tweaking and it's
actually<00:01:08.549> starting<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> work<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.960> that's<00:01:12.960> wait

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
actually starting to work so that's wait

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.060 
actually starting to work so that's wait
for<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.950> wait<00:01:14.960> for<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:18.439> any<00:01:19.439> minute<00:01:19.799> now

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.340 

anyway<00:01:23.070> while<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.460> wait<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.350> magical

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
anyway while we wait for this magical

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.670 
anyway while we wait for this magical
occurrence<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> start<00:01:26.479> what<00:01:27.479> I've<00:01:27.960> been

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
occurrence to start what I've been

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.350 
occurrence to start what I've been
getting<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> questions<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:30.119> his

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
getting a lot of questions for his

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
getting a lot of questions for his
rickets<00:01:30.900> why<00:01:31.140> don't<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.860> plumb<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
rickets why don't you just plumb the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700 
rickets why don't you just plumb the
outlet<00:01:32.659> straight<00:01:33.659> into<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> sink<00:01:34.259> since<00:01:34.500> it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
outlet straight into the sink since it's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
outlet straight into the sink since it's
right<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.189> yeah<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.970> obviously<00:01:36.900> have

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
right there yeah and I obviously have

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.170 
right there yeah and I obviously have
thought<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.490> may<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.820> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
thought of that and I may do that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.580 
thought of that and I may do that
eventually<00:01:40.759> but<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.240> reason<00:01:42.659> why<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
eventually but the reason why I got it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
eventually but the reason why I got it
going<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.040> bucket<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.939> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
going into this bucket is because of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.080 
going into this bucket is because of
that<00:01:45.210> phone<00:01:46.079> switch<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:47.189> i<00:01:47.369> plumb<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> outlet

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that phone switch if i plumb the outlet

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.649 
that phone switch if i plumb the outlet
straight<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.560> sink<00:01:50.119> if<00:01:51.119> something<00:01:51.479> goes

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
straight into the sink if something goes

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.710 
straight into the sink if something goes
wrong<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.259> old<00:01:52.560> saltwater<00:01:53.189> pump<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
wrong with this old saltwater pump now I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.830 
wrong with this old saltwater pump now I
say<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.320> doesn't<00:01:55.680> shut<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.640> no

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
say it just doesn't shut off there's no

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.160 
say it just doesn't shut off there's no
redundancy<00:01:58.070> no<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.579> started<00:02:00.180> yeah

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
redundancy no here we go started yeah

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.410 
redundancy no here we go started yeah
there's<00:02:01.380> no<00:02:01.530> way<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> turn<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.759> off<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.210> thing

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
there's no way to turn it off this thing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.719 
there's no way to turn it off this thing
could<00:02:03.659> essentially<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.740> empty<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.250> tank

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
could essentially just empty my tank

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.780 
could essentially just empty my tank
this<00:02:06.509> way<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.380> oh

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
this way it can oh

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.430 
this way it can oh
take<00:02:08.240> out<00:02:08.450> maximum<00:02:09.550> about<00:02:10.780> 25<00:02:11.780> gallons<00:02:12.260> at<00:02:12.410> a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
take out maximum about 25 gallons at a

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.850 
take out maximum about 25 gallons at a
time<00:02:13.240> so<00:02:14.240> that's<00:02:14.420> that's<00:02:14.690> not<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:14.990> bad<00:02:15.230> thing<00:02:15.500> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
time so that's that's not a bad thing I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.100 
time so that's that's not a bad thing I
can<00:02:16.280> actually<00:02:16.490> put<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.060> water<00:02:17.270> back<00:02:17.570> in<00:02:17.840> if<00:02:17.990> it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
can actually put the water back in if it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.390 
can actually put the water back in if it
does<00:02:18.350> somehow<00:02:18.710> get<00:02:19.600> unstuck<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:21.160> pumping<00:02:22.160> out

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
does somehow get unstuck on pumping out

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.750 
does somehow get unstuck on pumping out
and<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:24.110> can<00:02:24.590> set<00:02:24.770> my<00:02:24.920> system<00:02:25.280> right<00:02:25.310> back<00:02:25.640> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
and I can set my system right back to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.090 
and I can set my system right back to
normal<00:02:26.150> real<00:02:26.300> quickly<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.560> that's<00:02:27.710> why<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.010> do

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
normal real quickly so that's why I do

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.210 
normal real quickly so that's why I do
that<00:02:28.430> extra<00:02:29.090> redundancy<00:02:29.800> Jerrica<00:02:30.800> pumping<00:02:31.100> in

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
that extra redundancy Jerrica pumping in

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.060 
that extra redundancy Jerrica pumping in
the<00:02:31.400> sink<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.630> good<00:02:32.810> idea<00:02:33.170> probably

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
the sink is that a good idea probably

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.760 
the sink is that a good idea probably
possibly<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.750> I'd<00:02:35.870> rather<00:02:36.020> have<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.440> extra

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
possibly but I'd rather have the extra

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.940 
possibly but I'd rather have the extra
safety<00:02:36.980> feature<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.110> while<00:02:39.470> I'm<00:02:39.650> at<00:02:39.800> home

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
safety feature and while I'm at home

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.860 
safety feature and while I'm at home
every<00:02:40.310> day<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.460> can<00:02:40.700> just<00:02:40.880> come<00:02:41.090> down<00:02:41.300> here<00:02:41.330> or

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
every day I can just come down here or

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.540 
every day I can just come down here or
every<00:02:42.080> other<00:02:42.110> day<00:02:42.530> just<00:02:42.560> grab<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.130> bucket<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
every other day just grab the bucket and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.410 
every other day just grab the bucket and
check<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.820> out<00:02:44.000> mistake<00:02:44.330> no<00:02:44.540> big<00:02:44.750> deal<00:02:46.210> or<00:02:47.210> if

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
check it out mistake no big deal or if

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.420 
check it out mistake no big deal or if
I'm<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.660> vacation<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.470> take<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.040> little<00:02:49.220> bucket

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
I'm on vacation I take the little bucket

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.570 
I'm on vacation I take the little bucket
out<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.880> it'll<00:02:50.000> fill<00:02:50.270> up<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:51.110> there<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.430> there

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
out and it'll fill up to there so there

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.690 
out and it'll fill up to there so there
we<00:02:52.670> go<00:02:52.700> there's<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> gallon<00:02:53.600> out<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.930> system

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
we go there's a gallon out of the system

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.460 
we go there's a gallon out of the system
now<00:02:55.700> we'll<00:02:56.000> wait<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.240> few<00:02:56.450> seconds<00:02:56.930> come<00:02:57.230> over

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
now we'll wait a few seconds come over

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.760 
now we'll wait a few seconds come over
here<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.450> think<00:02:59.450> it's<00:02:59.900> about<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.170> minute<00:03:00.500> in

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
here I think it's about a minute in

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.900 
here I think it's about a minute in
between<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:02.000> change<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:03.770> can<00:03:03.950> see<00:03:04.220> my<00:03:04.640> water

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
between the change you can see my water

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.870 
between the change you can see my water
level<00:03:05.470> has<00:03:06.470> gone<00:03:06.680> down<00:03:06.860> past<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.730> best

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.250 

what<00:03:13.510> will<00:03:13.690> happen<00:03:13.810> now<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.840> pump<00:03:17.110> in

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
what will happen now is the pump in

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.640 
what will happen now is the pump in
there<00:03:17.500> will<00:03:17.830> pop<00:03:18.010> new<00:03:18.190> saltwater<00:03:19.110> over<00:03:20.110> into

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
there will pop new saltwater over into

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.490 
there will pop new saltwater over into
you<00:03:21.520> see<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.210> can<00:03:23.070> sorry<00:03:24.070> it's<00:03:24.220> an<00:03:24.880> awkward

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
you see if I can sorry it's an awkward

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.670 
you see if I can sorry it's an awkward
into<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.680> pipe<00:03:27.040> there<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:29.170> might<00:03:29.350> be<00:03:29.380> asking

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
into that pipe there you might be asking

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.250 
into that pipe there you might be asking
yourself<00:03:30.070> why<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.120> got<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.600> down<00:03:31.840> spoke

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
yourself why you got that down spoke

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.710 
yourself why you got that down spoke
there<00:03:32.670> well<00:03:33.670> basically<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.240> just<00:03:34.270> a<00:03:34.540> aint

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
there well basically it's just a aint

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.660 
there well basically it's just a aint
keep<00:03:34.960> it<00:03:35.110> quiet<00:03:35.380> can<00:03:36.010> be<00:03:36.160> keep<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.520> from

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
keep it quiet can be keep it from

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.520 
keep it quiet can be keep it from
splashing<00:03:37.180> around<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.870> don't<00:03:37.960> get<00:03:38.230> some

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
splashing around so I don't get some

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.690 
splashing around so I don't get some
creep<00:03:38.770> all<00:03:38.950> over<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.250> place<00:03:39.400> because<00:03:39.580> that's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
creep all over the place because that's

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.980 
creep all over the place because that's
a<00:03:39.820> bit<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.150> drop<00:03:40.450> from<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:41.290> outlet<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:42.010> the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
a bit of a drop from the outlet of the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.920 
a bit of a drop from the outlet of the
well<00:03:43.990> I<00:03:44.020> don't<00:03:44.290> that's<00:03:44.410> also<00:03:44.770> my<00:03:45.060> top<00:03:46.060> off<00:03:46.270> ill

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
well I don't that's also my top off ill

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.690 
well I don't that's also my top off ill
knit<00:03:47.140> from<00:03:47.320> my<00:03:47.440> top<00:03:47.680> off<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.160> for<00:03:48.430> my<00:03:48.550> new

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
knit from my top off and for my new

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.560 
knit from my top off and for my new
saltwater<00:03:50.040> coming<00:03:51.040> down<00:03:51.190> into<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.580> sump<00:03:54.570> I've

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
saltwater coming down into the sump I've

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.340 
saltwater coming down into the sump I've
got<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:58.230> LED<00:03:59.230> light<00:03:59.470> there<00:03:59.740> so<00:04:00.870> far<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.990> systems

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
got a LED light there so far the systems

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.790 
got a LED light there so far the systems
we<00:04:02.500> working<00:04:02.830> flawlessly<00:04:03.430> for<00:04:03.940> Bo<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.800> don't

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
we working flawlessly for Bo I don't

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.960 
we working flawlessly for Bo I don't
know<00:04:05.860> about<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.070> week<00:04:06.790> week<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.870> half<00:04:08.880> at<00:04:09.880> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
know about a week week and a half at the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
know about a week week and a half at the
beginning<00:04:10.270> it<00:04:10.420> took<00:04:10.570> a<00:04:10.600> little<00:04:10.750> bit<00:04:10.900> of

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
beginning it took a little bit of

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.240 
beginning it took a little bit of
tweaking<00:04:11.260> not<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:11.980> big<00:04:12.220> deal<00:04:12.430> one<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.270> done

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
tweaking not a big deal one so it's done

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.710 
tweaking not a big deal one so it's done
everything's<00:04:15.250> been<00:04:15.430> fine

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.880 

now<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.870> did<00:04:20.050> get<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.290> little<00:04:20.650> bit<00:04:20.800> of

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
now it did get a little bit of

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.000 
now it did get a little bit of
evaporation<00:04:21.490> from<00:04:21.700> my<00:04:22.330> new<00:04:23.020> saltwater<00:04:23.470> bucket

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
evaporation from my new saltwater bucket

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.280 
evaporation from my new saltwater bucket
so<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:24.760> figured<00:04:25.090> once<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.930> week

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
so I just figured once a week

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.930 
so I just figured once a week
take<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.710> salinity<00:04:27.100> measurement<00:04:27.730> with<00:04:27.850> the

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
take the salinity measurement with the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.120 
take the salinity measurement with the
refractometer<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:29.200> make<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:29.920> little

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
refractometer and make a little

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.250 
refractometer and make a little
adjustment<00:04:30.520> if<00:04:30.700> I<00:04:30.820> need<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.390> had<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.930> put<00:04:32.170> it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
adjustment if I need to I had to put it

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.880 
adjustment if I need to I had to put it
in<00:04:32.350> half<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.680> gallon<00:04:33.100> of<00:04:33.960> just<00:04:34.960> RO<00:04:35.170> water<00:04:35.470> for<00:04:35.830> my

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
in half a gallon of just RO water for my

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.220 
in half a gallon of just RO water for my
new<00:04:36.040> saltwater<00:04:36.430> bucket<00:04:36.940> after<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.750> week<00:04:37.990> so

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
new saltwater bucket after a week so

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.790 
new saltwater bucket after a week so
that's<00:04:38.320> not<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.590> big<00:04:38.830> deal<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.170> bucket<00:04:41.590> is

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
that's not a big deal and the bucket is

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.560
