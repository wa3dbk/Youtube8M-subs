00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
when I played Major Junior it was

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.319 
when I played Major Junior it was
definitely<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.579> highlight<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:42.090> my<00:02:42.120> career

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
definitely the highlight of my career

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.960 
definitely the highlight of my career
because<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.989> had<00:02:43.140> big<00:02:43.530> crowds<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> five<00:02:44.670> or

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
because we had big crowds up to five or

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.000 
because we had big crowds up to five or
even<00:02:45.030> ten<00:02:45.480> thousand<00:02:46.019> people<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.590> would<00:02:46.920> be

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
even ten thousand people that would be

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.500 
even ten thousand people that would be
in<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.220> stands<00:02:47.670> there'd<00:02:47.879> be<00:02:48.000> national

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
in the stands there'd be national

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
in the stands there'd be national
broadcasts<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.680> knew<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.220> could

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
broadcasts and I knew that if I could

succeed<00:02:50.579> at<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:50.940> level<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:51.599> definitely

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
succeed at that level I would definitely

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.199 
succeed at that level I would definitely
be<00:02:52.200> seen<00:02:52.470> by<00:02:52.590> NHL<00:02:53.010> Scouts<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.819> simply<00:02:54.120> the
