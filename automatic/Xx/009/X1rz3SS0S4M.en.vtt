00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
but also picking up on little things

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.090 
but also picking up on little things
that<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.510> learn<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.649> you're<00:00:40.890> never

that you can learn you can you're never

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
remarkable year so the progress and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.540 
remarkable year so the progress and
development<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
development is it because of the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
development is it because of the
competition<00:00:59.940> who<00:01:00.390> they're<00:01:00.539> playing<00:01:00.570> against

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
competition who they're playing against

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
competition who they're playing against
and<00:01:01.379> width<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:01.920> helps<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.250> develop<00:01:02.370> it's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and width really helps them develop it's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
and width really helps them develop it's
a<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.570> combination<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.229> those<00:01:04.379> things<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
a it's a combination of those things you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890 
a it's a combination of those things you
pick<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.119> things<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> learn

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
pick up on little things that you learn

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
pick up on little things that you learn
you<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.619> Chris<00:01:07.890> Paul<00:01:08.189> talking<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> Kyrie

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you see Chris Paul talking to Kyrie

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.640 
you see Chris Paul talking to Kyrie
Irving<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.900> teaching<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.619> things

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
Irving and teaching them little things

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
Irving and teaching them little things
about<00:01:11.100> footwork<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
about footwork and I think the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
about footwork and I think the
competition<00:01:13.650> level<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.159> mean<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.850> what

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
competition level will mean in what

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
competition level will mean in what
summer<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> play<00:01:15.930> against<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> type<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
summer will you play against the type of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.649 
summer will you play against the type of
competition<00:01:16.950> every<00:01:17.430> day<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> summer

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
competition every day and in the summer

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.550 
competition every day and in the summer
you<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.990> play<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> type<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
you don't play with the type of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.940 
you don't play with the type of
intensity<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.460> well<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.799> think

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
intensity as well so that and I think

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.160 
intensity as well so that and I think
mentally<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:24.210> coming<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
mentally just coming out of this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.950 
mentally just coming out of this
experience<00:01:25.549> you<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.299> confidence

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
experience you just have your confidence

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
experience you just have your confidence
just<00:01:28.140> grows<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.700> where<00:01:29.939> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
just grows and that's really where you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.539 
just grows and that's really where you
can<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> game<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:31.079> game<00:01:31.110> room

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
can see the game your game room

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.649 
can see the game your game room
chemistry<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:32.850> having<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.299> two<00:01:33.509> guys

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
chemistry as well having these two guys

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
chemistry as well having these two guys
you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.110> such<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> tough<00:01:35.220> season<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you know such a tough season in the
