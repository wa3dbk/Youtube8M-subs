photography today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.040> clean<00:00:05.250> lens<00:00:05.730> filters<00:00:06.240> okay

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
about how to clean lens filters okay

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.870 
about how to clean lens filters okay
it's<00:00:06.990> actually<00:00:07.379> very<00:00:07.680> very<00:00:07.799> easy<00:00:08.280> as<00:00:08.519> long<00:00:08.730> as

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
it's actually very very easy as long as

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.640 
it's actually very very easy as long as
you<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> right<00:00:09.360> materials<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
you have the right materials and the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.280 
you have the right materials and the
right<00:00:10.800> materials<00:00:11.280> are<00:00:11.429> crucial<00:00:12.030> lens<00:00:12.809> filters

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
right materials are crucial lens filters

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.340 
right materials are crucial lens filters
lenses<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.130> general<00:00:14.519> CCD<00:00:15.179> chips<00:00:15.480> CMOS<00:00:16.020> chips

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
lenses and general CCD chips CMOS chips

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.870 
lenses and general CCD chips CMOS chips
all<00:00:16.920> these<00:00:17.160> things<00:00:17.369> when<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:17.640> cleaning

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
all these things when you're cleaning

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.670 
all these things when you're cleaning
them<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.330> don't<00:00:18.600> use<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:18.990> fabric

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
them if you don't use the right fabric

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.580 
them if you don't use the right fabric
it<00:00:19.890> will<00:00:20.189> scratch<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.000> surface<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:22.350> when<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it will scratch the surface and when I

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.620 
it will scratch the surface and when I
say<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.070> fabric<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.850> best<00:00:24.390> thing<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
say the right fabric the best thing to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.750 
say the right fabric the best thing to
use<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.050> Egyptian<00:00:25.590> cotton<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.279> very<00:00:26.460> soft

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
use is Egyptian cotton it's very soft

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.900 
use is Egyptian cotton it's very soft
and<00:00:27.590> very<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.800> firm<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.789> many

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and very very firm you can use it many

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.450 
and very very firm you can use it many
many<00:00:30.090> times<00:00:30.859> but<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.009> you're<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> want

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
many times but what you're going to want

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
many times but what you're going to want
to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.940> basically<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> solution<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to do is basically use the solution and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
to do is basically use the solution and
you<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.800> special<00:00:35.040> solution<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:35.940> use

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you get special solution do not use

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
you get special solution do not use
Windex<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.110> lot<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.950> people<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.370> Windex<00:00:38.700> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
Windex a lot of people think Windex is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.220 
Windex a lot of people think Windex is
good<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.180> anything<00:00:39.360> there's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> movie<00:00:40.050> out

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
good for anything there's a movie out

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.680 
good for anything there's a movie out
home<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.129> hilarious<00:00:41.640> movie<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.210> they

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
home that's a hilarious movie but they

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
home that's a hilarious movie but they
use<00:00:42.870> Windex<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.500> everything<00:00:43.890> say<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.250> even

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
use Windex for everything say it's even

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
use Windex for everything say it's even
good<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.730> curing<00:00:45.030> cancer<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.930> true

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
good for curing cancer and it's not true

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529 
good for curing cancer and it's not true
but<00:00:46.920> whatever<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.420> on

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
but whatever you do do not use it on

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.150 
but whatever you do do not use it on
your<00:00:48.750> lens<00:00:49.020> because<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.620> very<00:00:49.800> bad<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
your lens because it's very bad it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
your lens because it's very bad it
actually<00:00:50.520> takes<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> surface<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
actually takes the surface off of the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
actually takes the surface off of the
lens<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> filter<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
lens or off of the filter but what you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.799 
lens or off of the filter but what you
can<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.550> older<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.059> still

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
can get is I this is an older I still

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.270 
can get is I this is an older I still
have<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> older<00:00:58.260> solution<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.770> stuff<00:00:59.010> lasts

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
have the older solution this stuff lasts

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
have the older solution this stuff lasts
forever<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.850> got<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.359> clip<00:01:00.809> solution<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.559> it's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
forever I got a clip solution now it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.160 
forever I got a clip solution now it's
called<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.219> solution<00:01:02.760> basically<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:04.019> what

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
called a solution basically but what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.450 
called a solution basically but what
you're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> want<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> just

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you're going to want to do is it just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
you're going to want to do is it just
you<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.450> take<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> drop<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.470> let<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you want to just take a drop and let it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.890 
you want to just take a drop and let it
fall<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> surface<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> cloth

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
fall right on the surface of the cloth

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.250 
fall right on the surface of the cloth
there<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.799> take<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.130> filter<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:12.170> then<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
there you take your filter and then you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
there you take your filter and then you
turn<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> cloth<00:01:13.799> onto<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.430> filter<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
turn the cloth onto the filter and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
turn the cloth onto the filter and
simply<00:01:15.390> rub<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.869> circular<00:01:16.110> motion<00:01:16.790> some

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
simply rub in a circular motion some

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
simply rub in a circular motion some
people<00:01:18.119> say<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> proper<00:01:18.930> way<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
people say the proper way to do it is to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.890 
people say the proper way to do it is to
start<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.549> side<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> rub<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> other

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
start on one side and rub to the other

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.039 
start on one side and rub to the other
okay<00:01:22.799> that's<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.340> way<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.990> my

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
okay that's one way to do it but in my

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
okay that's one way to do it but in my
opinion<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> does<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> same<00:01:26.430> thing<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
opinion it does the same thing to just

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.160 
opinion it does the same thing to just
go<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> circle<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> hurry<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
go in a circle if you're in a hurry you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.929 
go in a circle if you're in a hurry you
need<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.560> done<00:01:28.710> quick<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.820> like

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
need to get done quick you just go like

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.100 
need to get done quick you just go like
that<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.750> you're<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> switch

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that and then you're going to switch

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
that and then you're going to switch
sides<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> same<00:01:31.950> thing<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.400> soon<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.729> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
sides do the same thing as soon as you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
sides do the same thing as soon as you
do<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> other<00:01:33.360> side<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.650> rub<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
do that other side you rub it with the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.460 
do that other side you rub it with the
solution<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:35.970> move<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> cloth<00:01:37.110> over<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
solution and then move the cloth over a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.810 
solution and then move the cloth over a
little<00:01:37.650> bit<00:01:37.770> until<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:37.979> get<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> dry<00:01:38.490> spot

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
little bit until you get to a dry spot

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
little bit until you get to a dry spot
and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.990> moisture<00:01:40.200> off

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and then just get that moisture off

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.230 
and then just get that moisture off
there<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> should<00:01:41.130> evaporate<00:01:41.369> fairly<00:01:42.000> quickly

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there it should evaporate fairly quickly

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
there it should evaporate fairly quickly
the<00:01:42.390> stuffs<00:01:42.750> alcohol<00:01:43.229> base<00:01:43.409> from<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:43.770> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the stuffs alcohol base from what I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.560 
the stuffs alcohol base from what I
understand<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.149> soon<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> get

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
understand and then as soon as you get

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.090 
understand and then as soon as you get
that<00:01:45.780> off<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.140> want<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> take<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that off you want to take it and put it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.770 
that off you want to take it and put it
on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> lens<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.610> quick<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:47.909> possible<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.479> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
on the lens as quick as possible so you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
on the lens as quick as possible so you
don't<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.079> dust<00:01:49.409> inside<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.130> part<00:01:50.430> because

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
don't get dust inside that part because

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.819 
don't get dust inside that part because
once<00:01:51.390> dust<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> inside<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.680> it's

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
once dust is on the inside then it's

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.170 
once dust is on the inside then it's
always<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.670> until<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.000> take

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
always going to be there until you take

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.260 
always going to be there until you take
that<00:01:54.360> off<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.049> dust<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.149> on

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that off and get that dust out so but on

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.700 
that off and get that dust out so but on
the<00:01:57.360> outside<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.930> basically<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.469> again

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the outside you basically do it again

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
the outside you basically do it again
once<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> just<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.540> make<00:02:00.689> sure

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
once you get it on and just to make sure

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.999 
once you get it on and just to make sure

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
that you didn't get fingerprints when

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.350 
that you didn't get fingerprints when
you<00:02:02.070> were<00:02:02.159> putting<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.820> actual<00:02:03.119> filter
