hey<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.810> all<00:00:01.079> bios<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.650> today<00:00:02.639> i<00:00:02.669> will<00:00:03.149> be

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hey guys all bios here today i will be

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.810 
hey guys all bios here today i will be
comparing<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.140> AEK<00:00:05.009> with<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.359> famas<00:00:07.820> both

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
comparing the AEK with the famas both

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.060 
comparing the AEK with the famas both
are<00:00:09.139> incredibly<00:00:10.139> good<00:00:10.320> at<00:00:10.349> close<00:00:10.679> quarter

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
are incredibly good at close quarter

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.009 
are incredibly good at close quarter
combat<00:00:11.099> because<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.120> how<00:00:12.300> good<00:00:12.570> their<00:00:12.750> fire

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
combat because of how good their fire

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.499 
combat because of how good their fire
rate<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.370> i<00:00:14.400> wanted<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> figure<00:00:15.030> out<00:00:15.269> which

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
rate is so i wanted to figure out which

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.150 
rate is so i wanted to figure out which
one<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.990> better<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.500> close-quarter<00:00:17.130> combat

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
one was better for close-quarter combat

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.550 
one was better for close-quarter combat
now<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.000> course<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.600> thing<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.050> makes<00:00:19.289> these

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
now of course the thing that makes these

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.950 
now of course the thing that makes these
two<00:00:19.890> rifles<00:00:20.160> beasts<00:00:21.150> at<00:00:21.330> close<00:00:21.630> quarter

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
two rifles beasts at close quarter

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.620 
two rifles beasts at close quarter
combat<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> fire<00:00:22.949> rate<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.730> AEK<00:00:24.359> has<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
combat is the fire rate the AEK has a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.589 
combat is the fire rate the AEK has a
900<00:00:25.590> round<00:00:25.830> per<00:00:26.099> minute<00:00:26.400> fire<00:00:26.760> rate<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.180> that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
900 round per minute fire rate and that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720 
900 round per minute fire rate and that
makes<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> best<00:00:28.490> rifles<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
makes it one of the best rifles in the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.020 
makes it one of the best rifles in the
game<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.689> has<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.619> empty<00:00:32.399> reload<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
game for that it has a empty reload of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.400 
game for that it has a empty reload of
3.6<00:00:33.899> seconds<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:35.399> few<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.230> tactical<00:00:37.230> reload

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
3.6 seconds and a few a tactical reload

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.910 
3.6 seconds and a few a tactical reload
of<00:00:37.800> 2.3<00:00:38.610> seconds<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.079> quite<00:00:40.440> slower

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
of 2.3 seconds so it's quite slower

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.910 
of 2.3 seconds so it's quite slower
compared<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> other<00:00:41.910> rifles<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.590> order<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
compared to other rifles now in order to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
compared to other rifles now in order to
use<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.550> rifle<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.930> power

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
use this rifle you really have to power

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
use this rifle you really have to power
through<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.920> first<00:00:47.190> couple<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.670> kills<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
through the first couple of kills so you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.450 
through the first couple of kills so you
can<00:00:48.899> start<00:00:49.140> getting<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.649> attachments<00:00:50.280> for

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
can start getting some attachments for

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.340 
can start getting some attachments for
it<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:51.059> without<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.750> pretty

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it because without them it's pretty

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.610 
it because without them it's pretty
difficult<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.170> getting<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> site<00:00:55.469> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
difficult to use the getting a site is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.470 
difficult to use the getting a site is
important<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.489> upgrading<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
important but then upgrading to the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.439 
important but then upgrading to the
angled<00:00:57.960> foregrip<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.129> compensator<00:00:59.820> make

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
angled foregrip and a compensator make

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
angled foregrip and a compensator make
this<00:01:00.660> gun<00:01:00.899> actually<00:01:01.620> useful<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.399> without

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
this gun actually useful because without

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.299 
this gun actually useful because without
it<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.359> pretty<00:01:03.600> difficult<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.379> use<00:01:04.650> now<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it it's pretty difficult to use now the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
it it's pretty difficult to use now the
thing<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.450> hurts<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.960> rifle<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
thing that really hurts this rifle is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.160 
thing that really hurts this rifle is
the<00:01:07.590> stability<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> accuracy

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the stability so it's not the accuracy

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.000 
the stability so it's not the accuracy
as<00:01:10.260> much<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> m416<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.150> best

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
as much like with the m416 the best

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.109 
as much like with the m416 the best
attachments<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
attachments you can have for that is the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.899 
attachments you can have for that is the
stubby<00:01:15.509> grip<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.439> muzzle<00:01:16.650> brake<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.700> with

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
stubby grip and the muzzle brake so with

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.140 
stubby grip and the muzzle brake so with
the<00:01:18.150> AEK<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> famas<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.490> best<00:01:20.729> bet<00:01:20.970> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the AEK and the famas your best bet is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.999 
the AEK and the famas your best bet is
to<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> angled<00:01:22.049> foregrip<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.799> there

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to get the angled foregrip on there

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
to get the angled foregrip on there
which<00:01:23.460> boosts<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> stability<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.140> rifle

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
which boosts the stability of the rifle

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.980 
which boosts the stability of the rifle
so<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> makes<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.520> useful<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
so it makes it a little more useful and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
so it makes it a little more useful and
also<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> compensator

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
also I also like to have the compensator

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
also I also like to have the compensator
over<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> muzzle<00:01:31.650> brake<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.130> because

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
over the muzzle brake on this because

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.780 
over the muzzle brake on this because
the<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> side-to-side<00:01:34.680> recoil<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the the side-to-side recoil on this is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.270 
the the side-to-side recoil on this is
much<00:01:36.060> more<00:01:36.420> than<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.810> than<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.500> other

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
much more than it than it is on other

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.880 
much more than it than it is on other
rifles<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.509> usually<00:01:39.990> when<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.710> take

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
rifles and so usually when I would take

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.920 
rifles and so usually when I would take
the<00:01:41.100> muzzle<00:01:41.520> brake<00:01:41.820> instead<00:01:42.210> which<00:01:42.390> controls

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the muzzle brake instead which controls

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.460 
the muzzle brake instead which controls
vertical<00:01:43.439> recoil<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.630> case<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
vertical recoil I in this case I like to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.580 
vertical recoil I in this case I like to
use<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.540> compensator<00:01:48.540> which<00:01:48.600> handles<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
use the compensator which handles the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.800 
use the compensator which handles the
side-to-side<00:01:49.890> recoil<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:51.149> after<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.659> unlock

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
side-to-side recoil now after you unlock

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
side-to-side recoil now after you unlock
all<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.500> attachments<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.490> this

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
all of these attachments that make this

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.539 
all of these attachments that make this
rifle<00:01:53.909> much<00:01:54.390> better<00:01:54.770> your<00:01:55.770> best<00:01:56.070> bet<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
rifle much better your best bet is to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
rifle much better your best bet is to
try<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.000> stay<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.570> close<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> enemy<00:01:58.590> as

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
try and stay as close to the enemy as

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.639 
try and stay as close to the enemy as
possible<00:01:59.549> now<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.390> quite<00:02:01.049> difficult<00:02:01.290> at

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
possible now this is quite difficult at

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.999 
possible now this is quite difficult at
times<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.850> you'll<00:02:03.719> see<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.409> when<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
times but as you'll see here when you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.069 
times but as you'll see here when you
get<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.369> further<00:02:05.640> out<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.780> more

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
get a little further out it's much more

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.320 
get a little further out it's much more
difficult<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.649> shoot<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.129> enemy<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:09.000> rifle

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
difficult to shoot the enemy this rifle

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.550 
difficult to shoot the enemy this rifle
is<00:02:09.539> doesn't<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.200> good<00:02:10.379> range<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.979> here<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
is doesn't have good range and here I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.589 
is doesn't have good range and here I
I<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.250> excited<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.819> yes<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.209> get<00:02:13.330> behind

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
I was so excited like yes I get behind

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.440 
I was so excited like yes I get behind
the<00:02:13.690> enemy<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.200> I'd<00:02:14.500> only<00:02:15.099> get<00:02:15.520> two<00:02:15.790> kills<00:02:16.209> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
the enemy and I'd only get two kills I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.260 
the enemy and I'd only get two kills I
was<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.530> upset<00:02:17.680> I'm<00:02:18.099> trying<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.640> get<00:02:18.760> better<00:02:18.940> at

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
was so upset I'm trying to get better at

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.690 
was so upset I'm trying to get better at
target<00:02:20.230> priority<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.069> know<00:02:21.190> who<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> should

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
target priority you know who I should

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.820 
target priority you know who I should
aim<00:02:21.819> at<00:02:21.940> first<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.450> stuff<00:02:22.599> but<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.140> it's

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
aim at first and stuff but it's it's

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.710 
aim at first and stuff but it's it's
quite<00:02:24.340> difficult<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.000> I'm<00:02:25.300> not<00:02:25.450> really<00:02:25.599> used

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
quite difficult and I'm not really used

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.470 
quite difficult and I'm not really used
to<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.319> anyway<00:02:27.040> back<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.520> AEK<00:02:28.000> this

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
to that so anyway back to the AEK this

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.150 
to that so anyway back to the AEK this
is<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> really<00:02:29.110> good<00:02:29.260> rifle<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.739> I<00:02:29.800> do<00:02:29.860> like

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
is a really good rifle and I do like

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.729 
is a really good rifle and I do like
this<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.239> AEK<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.019> famas<00:02:32.380> are<00:02:32.560> quite

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
this the AEK and the famas are quite

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.979 
this the AEK and the famas are quite
similar<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.580> only<00:02:33.760> two<00:02:34.120> assault<00:02:34.599> rifles

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
similar and the only two assault rifles

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.720 
similar and the only two assault rifles
that<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.319> really<00:02:35.590> compare<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.610> know

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
that you can really compare you know

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.670 
that you can really compare you know
that<00:02:37.030> are<00:02:37.150> semi<00:02:37.780> similar<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.370> AEK<00:02:40.170> has<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.200> few

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
that are semi similar the AEK has a few

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.500 
that are semi similar the AEK has a few
advantages<00:02:41.950> over<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.670> famas<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.330> has<00:02:43.480> a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
advantages over the famas it has a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.780 
advantages over the famas it has a
bigger<00:02:43.810> magazine<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.560> got<00:02:44.709> 31<00:02:45.250> rounds<00:02:45.670> in

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
bigger magazine it's got 31 rounds in

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.170 
bigger magazine it's got 31 rounds in
while<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.030> eight<00:02:46.390> famas<00:02:47.260> has<00:02:47.500> 26<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
while the eight famas has 26 but the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.880 
while the eight famas has 26 but the
thing<00:02:49.390> that's<00:02:49.510> most<00:02:49.840> important<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.709> has

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
thing that's most important is it has

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.580 
thing that's most important is it has
less<00:02:51.250> vertical<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.180> horizontal<00:02:52.510> recoil<00:02:53.200> and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
less vertical and horizontal recoil and

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.330 
less vertical and horizontal recoil and
it's<00:02:53.980> quite<00:02:54.280> significantly<00:02:55.090> less<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.630> is

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
it's quite significantly less it is

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.009 
it's quite significantly less it is
sixty-three<00:02:57.340> percent<00:02:57.580> less<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> left<00:02:58.780> for

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
sixty-three percent less to the left for

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.289 
sixty-three percent less to the left for
example<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.040> really<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.549> decide<00:03:01.000> if

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
example so you really have to decide if

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.570 
example so you really have to decide if
that<00:03:01.540> extra<00:03:02.260> 100<00:03:02.769> rounds<00:03:03.040> per<00:03:03.190> minute<00:03:03.310> is

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
that extra 100 rounds per minute is

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.890 
that extra 100 rounds per minute is
worth<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:04.150> now<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.110> famas<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:06.540> don't<00:03:07.540> know<00:03:07.660> what

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
worth it now the famas I don't know what

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.020 
worth it now the famas I don't know what
it<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.140> about<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:09.010> after<00:03:09.700> playing<00:03:09.849> with

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
it is about this but after playing with

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.900 
it is about this but after playing with
both<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.420> them<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> lot<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.500> AEK<00:03:12.250> looks<00:03:12.640> better

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
both of them a lot the AEK looks better

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.750 
both of them a lot the AEK looks better
statistically<00:03:13.840> but<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> famas<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.400> feels

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
statistically but the famas just feels

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.210 
statistically but the famas just feels
so<00:03:16.239> much<00:03:16.480> better<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:17.049> me<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.350> don't<00:03:17.739> know<00:03:17.890> what

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so much better to me I don't know what

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.660 
so much better to me I don't know what
it<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.609> it<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.540> definitely<00:03:19.900> harder<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.769> use<00:03:21.070> but

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
it is it is definitely harder to use but

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.860 
it is it is definitely harder to use but
when<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.269> you're<00:03:22.390> in<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.570> close

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
when you when you're in that close

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.810 
when you when you're in that close
quarter<00:03:23.200> combat<00:03:23.230> I'd<00:03:23.709> rather<00:03:23.950> have<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.430> over

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
quarter combat I'd rather have this over

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.020 
quarter combat I'd rather have this over
the<00:03:24.940> AEK<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.750> that's<00:03:26.350> quite<00:03:26.799> strange<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.579> mean

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the AEK and that's quite strange I mean

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.580 
the AEK and that's quite strange I mean
just<00:03:28.420> looking<00:03:28.630> at<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.840> statistics<00:03:29.019> I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
just looking at the statistics I

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.250 
just looking at the statistics I
wouldn't<00:03:30.160> really<00:03:30.519> get<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.660> feeling

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
wouldn't really get that that feeling

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.530 
wouldn't really get that that feeling
and<00:03:32.380> that's<00:03:33.010> that's<00:03:33.340> because<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:33.850> mean<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
and that's that's because I mean the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.449 
and that's that's because I mean the
feeling<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.109> rifle<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.739> important<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
feeling of the rifle is so important to

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.750 
feeling of the rifle is so important to
gameplay<00:03:36.910> yes<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.019> does<00:03:38.200> have<00:03:38.380> crazy<00:03:38.859> recoiled

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
gameplay yes it does have crazy recoiled

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.539 
gameplay yes it does have crazy recoiled
and<00:03:40.120> vertical<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.780> horizontal<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.799> less

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
and vertical and horizontal and less

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.590 
and vertical and horizontal and less
than<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.970> AEK<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:44.739> also<00:03:44.920> has<00:03:45.600> really

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
than the AEK and it also has really

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.690 
than the AEK and it also has really
really<00:03:46.989> bad<00:03:47.139> reload<00:03:47.620> times<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.400> only<00:03:48.519> has

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
really bad reload times and it only has

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.629 
really bad reload times and it only has
26<00:03:49.690> rounds<00:03:50.139> in<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.260> magazine<00:03:50.560> but<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.579> is

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
26 rounds in the magazine but it is

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.270 
26 rounds in the magazine but it is
still<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.269> still<00:03:52.690> pick<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.019> over<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.380> AEK<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.220> I

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
still I still pick it over the AEK and I

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.809 
still I still pick it over the AEK and I
I<00:03:54.579> had<00:03:55.090> more<00:03:55.299> trouble<00:03:55.630> with<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.200> AEK<00:03:56.819> leveling

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
I had more trouble with the AEK leveling

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.610 
I had more trouble with the AEK leveling
that<00:03:58.000> up<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.389> getting<00:03:59.139> a<00:03:59.319> certain

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
that up and getting a certain

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.080 
that up and getting a certain
attachments<00:04:00.130> for<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.370> then<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.549> did<00:04:00.790> with<00:04:00.910> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
attachments for that then I did with the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.110 
attachments for that then I did with the
famas<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.560> famas<00:04:02.889> you<00:04:03.280> really<00:04:03.819> have<00:04:03.970> to

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
famas and the famas you really have to

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.069 
famas and the famas you really have to
power<00:04:04.359> through<00:04:05.130> because<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.459> almost

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
power through because it is almost

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.170 
power through because it is almost
useless<00:04:08.079> before<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.220> get<00:04:09.400> these<00:04:09.519> attachments

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
useless before you get these attachments

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.270 
useless before you get these attachments
especially<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.049> iron<00:04:11.260> sights<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.859> this<00:04:12.040> thing

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
especially the iron sights on this thing

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.210 
especially the iron sights on this thing
it<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.480> bad<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.290> didn't<00:04:14.769> film<00:04:15.069> it

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
it is so bad and I didn't film it

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.340 
it is so bad and I didn't film it
because<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.670> didn't<00:04:16.570> want<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.780> put<00:04:17.200> myself

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
because I didn't want to put myself

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.620

through that again the iron sights on
the<00:04:19.720> famas<00:04:20.080> are<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:20.709> bad<00:04:21.099> you<00:04:21.640> have<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.909> upgrade

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
the famas are so bad you have to upgrade

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.180 
the famas are so bad you have to upgrade
to<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.750> site<00:04:23.050> which<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.289> think<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.560> need<00:04:23.680> 10

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190

sight<00:04:30.790> for<00:04:30.970> this<00:04:31.090> thing<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.480> that's<00:04:32.320> I<00:04:32.620> mean

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
sight for this thing and that's I mean

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.990 
sight for this thing and that's I mean
you<00:04:32.980> have<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.370> put<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:33.700> there

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
you have to put that on there

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.360 
you have to put that on there
immediately<00:04:34.270> because<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:35.170> improves<00:04:35.950> this

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
immediately because it improves this

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.490 
immediately because it improves this
thing<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.030> much<00:04:37.330> because<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.110> mean<00:04:38.290> the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
thing so much because the I mean the

thing so much because the I mean the
iron<00:04:38.620> sights<00:04:38.890> are<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.160> horrible<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.150> then

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
iron sights are just horrible and then

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.090 
iron sights are just horrible and then
once<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.720> throw<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.080> angled<00:04:41.440> foregrip<00:04:41.890> on

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
once you throw the angled foregrip on

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.900 
once you throw the angled foregrip on
and<00:04:42.840> compensator<00:04:43.840> this<00:04:44.410> thing<00:04:44.710> gets<00:04:45.280> pretty

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
and compensator this thing gets pretty

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.690 
and compensator this thing gets pretty
beastly<00:04:46.600> at<00:04:46.900> close<00:04:47.140> quarter<00:04:47.470> combat<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:48.160> wish

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
beastly at close quarter combat I wish

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.730 
beastly at close quarter combat I wish
it<00:04:48.850> had<00:04:48.880> more<00:04:49.030> magazine<00:04:49.750> or<00:04:50.020> more<00:04:50.350> rounds<00:04:50.650> in

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
it had more magazine or more rounds in

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.060 
it had more magazine or more rounds in
the<00:04:50.770> magazine<00:04:51.040> but<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:53.020> before<00:04:53.800> they

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
the magazine but like before they

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.860 
the magazine but like before they
patched<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:54.580> in<00:04:54.700> battlefield<00:04:55.240> 3<00:04:55.360> this<00:04:55.660> thing

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
patched it in battlefield 3 this thing

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.740 
patched it in battlefield 3 this thing
was<00:04:56.020> an<00:04:56.160> absolute<00:04:57.160> beast<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:58.180> they<00:04:58.390> nerfed

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
was an absolute beast and they nerfed

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.050 
was an absolute beast and they nerfed
the<00:04:59.020> crap<00:04:59.380> out<00:04:59.590> of<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.800> and<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.160> then<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:00.940> was

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
the crap out of it and and then it was

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.120 
the crap out of it and and then it was
useless<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.840> I'm<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.320> glad<00:05:02.530> it's<00:05:02.770> making<00:05:03.070> a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
useless and I'm so glad it's making a

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.610 
useless and I'm so glad it's making a
comeback<00:05:03.160> here<00:05:03.670> in<00:05:03.730> battlefield<00:05:04.390> 4<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:05.050> think

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
comeback here in battlefield 4 I think

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.050 
comeback here in battlefield 4 I think
that<00:05:05.680> might<00:05:05.980> actually<00:05:06.190> be<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.460> reason<00:05:06.880> that<00:05:07.030> I

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
that might actually be a reason that I

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.050 
that might actually be a reason that I
choose<00:05:07.870> this<00:05:07.930> over<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.680> AEK<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:09.970> I

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
choose this over the AEK that and I

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.700 
choose this over the AEK that and I
think<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.390> this<00:05:10.480> rifle<00:05:10.720> looks<00:05:11.170> better<00:05:11.440> and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
think that this rifle looks better and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.160 
think that this rifle looks better and
actually<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.670> rifle<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.150> looks<00:05:13.690> better<00:05:13.930> to

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
actually the rifle that looks better to

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.170 
actually the rifle that looks better to
you<00:05:14.350> you<00:05:14.560> actually<00:05:14.770> kind<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.190> perform<00:05:15.760> better

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
you you actually kind of perform better

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.720 
you you actually kind of perform better
with<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:17.200> may<00:05:17.500> seem<00:05:17.890> kind<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.220> weird<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.640> you

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
with it may seem kind of weird to you

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.370 
with it may seem kind of weird to you
and<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:18.880> might<00:05:19.000> not<00:05:19.150> believe<00:05:19.270> me<00:05:19.450> but<00:05:19.720> in<00:05:20.230> my

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
and you might not believe me but in my

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.320 
and you might not believe me but in my
experience<00:05:20.530> I<00:05:21.160> do<00:05:21.220> think<00:05:21.730> it<00:05:21.850> actually<00:05:22.030> plays

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
experience I do think it actually plays

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.570 
experience I do think it actually plays
a<00:05:22.450> factor<00:05:22.750> okay<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.680> now<00:05:23.890> i'm<00:05:24.100> going<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.310> show

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
a factor okay and now i'm going to show

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.940 
a factor okay and now i'm going to show
you<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:25.210> vertical<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.230> horizontal<00:05:26.380> recoil

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
you the vertical and horizontal recoil

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.600 
you the vertical and horizontal recoil
of<00:05:27.400> each<00:05:27.580> rifle<00:05:27.820> here<00:05:28.240> is<00:05:28.390> the<00:05:28.540> AEK<00:05:29.260> and<00:05:29.610> here

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
of each rifle here is the AEK and here

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.310 
of each rifle here is the AEK and here
is<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:30.850> famas<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.420> can<00:05:31.570> tell<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:31.990> famas

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
is the famas you can tell that the famas

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.460 
is the famas you can tell that the famas
is<00:05:32.530> much<00:05:32.860> worse<00:05:33.340> I<00:05:33.670> mean<00:05:34.170> side-by-side<00:05:35.170> the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
is much worse I mean side-by-side the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.040 
is much worse I mean side-by-side the
AEK<00:05:36.250> just<00:05:36.520> destroys<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.480> that's<00:05:37.900> just

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
AEK just destroys it and that's just

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.200 
AEK just destroys it and that's just
because<00:05:38.260> of<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.530> additional<00:05:38.860> 100<00:05:39.610> rounds<00:05:40.000> per

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
because of the additional 100 rounds per

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.870 
because of the additional 100 rounds per
minute<00:05:40.420> so<00:05:41.260> from<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.560> statistic<00:05:42.250> standpoint

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
minute so from a statistic standpoint

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.170 
minute so from a statistic standpoint
the<00:05:43.180> AEK<00:05:43.810> is<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.320> clear<00:05:44.800> winner<00:05:44.910> but<00:05:45.910> in<00:05:46.090> my

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
the AEK is the clear winner but in my

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.540 
the AEK is the clear winner but in my
opinion<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:47.110> feel<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.860> rifle<00:05:48.010> is<00:05:48.340> more

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
opinion the feel of the rifle is more

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.580 
opinion the feel of the rifle is more
important<00:05:48.910> than<00:05:49.060> statistics<00:05:49.750> obviously<00:05:50.350> and

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
important than statistics obviously and

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.250 
important than statistics obviously and
i<00:05:51.430> think<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.060> famas<00:05:52.390> is<00:05:52.660> actually<00:05:53.110> the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
i think that the famas is actually the

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.530 
i think that the famas is actually the
best<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:53.860> that's<00:05:54.550> totally<00:05:54.970> my<00:05:55.120> opinion<00:05:55.480> i

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
best and that's totally my opinion i

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.720 
best and that's totally my opinion i
mean<00:05:55.690> a<00:05:55.720> lot<00:05:55.930> of<00:05:55.960> people<00:05:56.080> do<00:05:56.740> prefer<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:57.190> AEK

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
mean a lot of people do prefer the AEK

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.300 
mean a lot of people do prefer the AEK
understandably<00:05:58.660> to<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.140> famas<00:05:59.470> but<00:06:00.280> i

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
understandably to the famas but i

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.190 
understandably to the famas but i
definitely<00:06:00.790> recommend<00:06:01.150> trying<00:06:01.720> both<00:06:01.990> of

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
definitely recommend trying both of

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.870 
definitely recommend trying both of
these<00:06:02.290> rifles<00:06:02.680> out<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.040> playing<00:06:03.670> with<00:06:03.850> them

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
and see which one you like the best

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.530 
and see which one you like the best
