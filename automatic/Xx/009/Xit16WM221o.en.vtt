00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.540 
I think is in first half yeah it wasn't
the<00:02:00.450> first<00:02:00.660> step<00:02:00.870> because<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.170> had<00:02:01.260> none<00:02:01.550> they

the first step because I had none they

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.700 
the first step because I had none they
went<00:02:02.760> for<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.180> fourth<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.440> they

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
went for it on fourth and one and they

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
went for it on fourth and one and they
were<00:02:05.000> not<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.210> far<00:02:06.420> away<00:02:06.570> from<00:02:06.990> getting<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
