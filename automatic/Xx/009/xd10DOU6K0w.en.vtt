00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.549
 which is a speculum year step to that is two 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.340
 but you use everything 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.739
 even the same hydration you know you do 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.959

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.239

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.269
 drawing for you a black one year 6 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.300
 oscar blandy dry shampoo but 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.810
 girls 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.900
 I liked it, I paid 25 dollars and I did not like it 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.370
 I bought it because I've heard a lot 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.440
 people talk about the product they know and are not 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.860
 to work for my hair got a spent 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.610
 A little anxious so I really like the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.580
 another that calls bathish and I get 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.250
 he still then this one was a monkey 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.710
 I did not like it, I did not say eight girls. 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.480
 I already knew him from Brazil but never 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.120
 I had the opportunity to buy here. 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.120
 so I bought for there flame unique one 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.090
 It is from Revlon and it is a thermal protector 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.040
 for the hair so it helps not to 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.950
 burn the hair at the time you to 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.410
 to make baby liss is great to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.780
 every moment I'm already using 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.820
 I loved this robot with that the product is 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.940
 I did not know any girls that either 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.590
 is the product of joico can-pack I do not know 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.410
 Speak that right, but I think it's that. 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 even in that little box here and that too 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.330
 I already used this one, I felt that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.690
 my thick hair knows I passed the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.190
 bath for five minutes in the hair after 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.070
 I 've already spent a shampoo one 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.020
 conditioner I passed he is and I felt 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.900
 that my government with thick as well as 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.610
 Great I liked it but I did not like it 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.440
 the smell of him the black smell 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.890
 I found a little weird so sá 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.500
 So I still think it pays 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.080
 make up the purchase and I paid about 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.760
 $ 22 in it 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.630
 so I think you were good with this product 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 here girls are 11 years older and it 's a 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.350
 product also I've met by 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.040
 here but I have never had the opportunity to 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.660
 purchase 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.910
 so it 's a little alone that we went 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.030
 the root of hair is for when people 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.580
 will do a hairstyle and it will 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.860
 give a root volume so I want 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.230
 make a mohawk so I'll pass the 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.220
 with a little beat and with a comb 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.709
 I already do the volume of it it helps a lot and 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.150
 I understand anticipating this one here. 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.990
 girls is a product is masculine it is 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.150

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.060
 trying and I bought it because before 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.450

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.660
 I made a babyliss with a professional and 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.750
 he after the benefit done he passed 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.720
 this folder in his hand did so and went on 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.110
 all the curls and one hair went without 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.810
 no fries in such a beautiful way 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.640

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.530
 God 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.480
 then he went to that head that I reported 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.580

 girls of the products that I am 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.610

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.180
 self-tanning beds

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.000
 that the product is great so it is the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.620
 bronzing he's not makeup for the 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.480

 the box is this one when I open it 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.680
 Scared because it has a brown color and it

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.640
 this is that there is a little bit expensive 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.450
