00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hi girls here we are with the fourth 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.799
 appointment if I remember correctly 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.490
 my column on the top 3 gods divided by 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.980
 category 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.340
 the last video on the top three biotype 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.350
 dates back to 3 4 3 months ago four not me 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.380
 I don't even remember any more you know it 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 don't abandon it, the process takes me 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.500
 always a little bit of time to do 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.960
 let's say the videos because in short it is not 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.859
 always easy to find three 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.280
 same category good vouchers we say 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.100
 so today we will talk about balms and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.360
 very well top 3000 was that of the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.399
 shampoo 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 then we talked about make-up removers 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.780
 after care products 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.120
 lips and now it's time to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.360
 tell you about the balms I finally am 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 especially fixed on the hair 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.850
 balms for many it will always try 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.010
 approved so many and I came to mine 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.729
 top3 dio even if one is to be tested 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 yet to be opened 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.549
 but then maybe I'll tell you about it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.500
 also later as I always tell you 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.720
 I need bassani that are beautiful 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 full bodied nutrients because anyway 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.770
 I have so many hairs fortunately 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 lots of hair e 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.899
 I need bassam the full-bodied nutrients 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.909
 detangling and anyway help to 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.770
 grasp frizz I want to do in this 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.490
 video with a ranking then I leave 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.579
 from the third to then get to the first 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 the third is the balm in the middle and 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:44.079
 fennel of alchemilla and as you see the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.409
 very little to finish is a mass 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.179
 very very full bodied in fact does not make ho 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.429
 since now also thousands 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.179
 changed the packaging made it like 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:59.079
 the one there db Tuscan workshop is better 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.270
 because I really struggle to pull 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.530
 because 20 use this last part 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.479
 because every time you have to throw down the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.569
 product and it really becomes a huge one 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.780
 fatigue however is a full-bodied balm that 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.130
 It helps a lot to untangle the hair 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.840
 it's a good balm 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.150
 I also tried the samples in the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.160
 others of this line but the others do not 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.099
 they thrilled me with my kind of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.880
 hair and I prefer this one here all yields 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.400
 the fennel 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.030
 only negative note in my opinion of this 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.940
 product has the fragrance knows a lot about 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.410
 cedar and fennel which in short is one 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.030
 fragrance that I don't like 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.709
 therefore you know it in short 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.720
 I don't like it though it's on 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.269
 hair does not remain particularly then 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.329
 in the days however it does not make me 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.700
 go crazy and in third place 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.269
 position because precisely it is not is not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.970
 not bad at all though I found of 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.750
 better as you see in second position 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.579
 in fact there is my first love with true 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.919
 and concentrated balm active divi 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.769
 you see a used Tuscan workshop 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.510
 little because this is the second 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.489
 pack because I had the first one 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.730
 already bought some time ago I already had 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.290
 talked long ago and was like that now 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.049
 but I changed it they did this 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.410
 very much more practical packaging 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.450
 this is also a bass but anyway 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.660
 beautiful full-bodied I must say that these two 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.430
 base there are very very similar I have to 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.700
 being honest also like 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.530
 body of the product is true there is a 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.750
 minimum difference between the two mini but 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.209
 perhaps this one manages to take away a 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.900
 pinch more frizz than 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.329
 but this is really a lot 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.010
 similar decline with active concentrate of 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:57.319
 a Tuscan perfume instead a fragrance 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.689
 I don't know too much about this 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:05.139
 call it a par bohza anyway 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:08.510
 this is not particularly good here 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.010
 so anyway yes there is this thing here 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.230
 but even this is not what remains 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.510
 particularly on the hair after you are 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.329
 instead we have the hair conditioner on 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.299
 Melody-detangling detangling melotto 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.919
 nutritious of mater nature also as ne 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.620
 I spoke in a myriad of videos 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.020
 lately but i love man because 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.770
 this in addition to making soft hair 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.960
 like the other two it takes away much more 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.180
 crepe compared to the other two e 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.729
 especially hair lights what 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.199
 that however the other two are not i 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.419
 our hair doesn't do just that 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.180
 nothing while this one also helps 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.270
 to give them nuts and then to a fragrance 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.070
 really in my opinion it is very good too 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.139
 here I heard equal odds 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.449
 discordant on fragrances but you know 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.820
 which are always very subjective 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.560
 I like it because it's a bit difficult 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.570
 however describe the fragrances 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.800
 however it is a bit of a mixed mix between a 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.440
 balsamic in my opinion a bit of flowers e 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.900
 however this also remains a 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.090
 little on the hair is one of the 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.240
 best balsamic I 've ever tried 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.580
 it will be difficult anyway 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.069
 find others at the same second level 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.560
 me this is a higher price than 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.289
 to the other two because it costs 12 euros 80 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.479
 but it is worth all of them, by the way , enough 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.389
 very little because really low one 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.699
 other bassano are also produced 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.349
 But just this here is still less 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.720
 our di pass very little 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.090
 product and the difference you feel from 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.220
 immediately apply to the hair 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.099
 feel immediately that it makes the hair 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.380
 just liscissimi does not weigh down the 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.729
 all three hair is washed away a lot 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.840
 easily 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:58.020
 these were my top3 balms and 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.770
 let me know which ones are yours 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.849
 you have found and how you found us 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.490
 this all guys are coming to me 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.630
 magnetic the crazy so let's go 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.490
 well 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.880
 I hope that video has been useful there 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.880
 let's see to the next
