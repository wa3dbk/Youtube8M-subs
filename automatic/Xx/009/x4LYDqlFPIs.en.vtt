 tracker that will help us track 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.780
 our activity and our dream thanks macabab 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.279
 for giving the sample let's 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.279
 let's start go 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 The description on the site burned out. com want 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.810
 as always start with the price price in america 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 in no fear scrounded $ 50 a 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.690
 Russia now it can be found for 6000 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.300
 rubles yes of course ratios 50 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.760
 dollars and 6000 rubles for the exchange 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.830
 it turns out 110 rubles for 1 dollar 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.140
 but I hope that in the near future this is all 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.580
 Slightly fall in price and you heard that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.089
 soon jabba he misses 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.820
 and the third is a brand new bracelet from here 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.839
 it will happen with this 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 fitness tracker we can track 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.790
 how many steps have we taken in our day 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.820
 distance how many calories we burned and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 track your sleep as we sleep deep 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.729
 night and we woke up let's see 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
 on the box this is a small blister here 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 see separately noted that slept 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.610
 tracking really have no Jabba 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.210
 It turns out very cool and all this in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.340
 colorful app plus there is a function 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 hours yes do not be surprised here no 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 clock display but here 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.310
 present thanks to the LEDs 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.200
 and behind us the addressed application in 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.909
 which we will be sharing with 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.950
 friends of our progress we ourselves will 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.850
 see how much we moved there yesterday 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.759
 today Tomorrow 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.619
 let's get the tracker out of this 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.329
 blister and see what goes in 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.880
 the bundle there actually goes 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.840
 the instruction is generally small and by myself 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.210
 tracker and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.500
 small river type batteries and cr 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.259
 2032 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.210
 and it works on this battery tracker up 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.490
 six months well, you know, if you 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.500
 she sat down and the tracker no longer works then 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.939
 in the nearest shop you can just 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.399
 change battery for six months 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.630
 extend service life included 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.010
 small instruction and box all 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.960
 I already put the battery and give it a look 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.080
 it all looks so small here 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.900
 silicone case which we can 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.770
 attach to your example on clothes or 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 on the bag so it will be tracked by us 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.540
 movement there is a very interesting bracelet 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.970
 just loosed on hand and will 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.769
 see hours it sold separately and in 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.410
 bundled here does not go and accordingly 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.050
 here we insert small tracks 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.670
 into this bracelet and we will already be wearing on 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.920
 arm well and accordingly this little 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.110
 We insert the tracks into this bracelet and we will 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.930
 already wear the whole thing on hand if 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.250
 are you going to track sleep 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.590
 It is recommended to fasten it on pajamas 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.420
 if you sleep excuse me in your underpants then 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.450
 can be attached to the pants but it is not very 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.490
 comfortable and therefore japon advise all the same 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.140
 buy a separate bracelet on hand 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.810
 what do you know when you sleep it will 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.090
 inconvenient to store somewhere but it seems to me 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.970
 Mostly this tracker is still taken for 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.410
 movements for sport for our day 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.960
 spending the night best 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.020
 take ja bon app which is classic and 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.750
 he is very ergonomic on his wrist 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.740
 made it all from nylon like 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.360
 polymer anodized aluminum and 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.240
 polyurethane is such a complicated name 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.690
 as part of this tracker, let's see 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.310
 it works on bluetooth 40 which 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.550
 energy saving and with your phone 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.410
 enough there once a day 1 2 days like you 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.300
 want to look connect after 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.490
 This will all be transferred to the application up 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.070
 this little tracker weighs only 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.470
 six and eight grams but how is she all 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.930
 it shows here is present 12 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.709
 white LEDs they are here 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 here in a circle 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.440
 1 orange and one blue LED give 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.900
 let's see we press once for 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.340
 all day since running man means 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.280
 normal mode and 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.450
 of all nine thousand steps i have gone 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.660
 now 0 and respectively 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.970
 shows interest 5 10 15 45 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.000
 percent half i did 50 percent 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.489
 either 100 if I did 110 then he 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.070
 draws a circle and the cottage flashes you here 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.350
 now, respectively, only but 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.330
 zero percent up to view 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.860
 what time is it now we need to click 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.230
 on the only key she is 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.470
 in the middle 2 times quick after that 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:34.640
 we can understand that now 1111 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.620
 somewhere 55 well let's have the right to 11 52 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.900
 but almost exactly if 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.260
 we will have 10 minutes past one 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.260
 show the hour and will show next 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.449
 one more arrow that is 1:10 that is 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.189
 by so here is the dial but the start date 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.870
 it is worth learning a little and then 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.300
 will the outcome understand how much now 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.289
 time, I understand that at the moment 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.839
 hard to understand that now 52 minutes 12 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.839
 to put the tracker in night mode 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:05.580
 we press the key and hold us 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:07.800
 night mode is on 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.080
 we go to bed and after that the tracker 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.279
 keep track of how much we fell asleep as we 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.589
 they stopped moving there 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.080
 deep sleep light sleep when we 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.999
 woke up within 15 minutes if we 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.809
 we move then he will transfer us to 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.900
 normal mode 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.219
 if we want to do it manually 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.099
 press and hold turns on 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:28.199
 indicators on top ends and we have 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.729
 again the usual mode in which we will 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.370
 count the number of steps that we 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.110
 have done and now it is zero fine 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.240
 fitness tracker we decided 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.879
 looked but he is so small but 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.669
 functional let's go it here and look 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:43.999
 on the application it is called from here 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.810
 Fits all device pattern which 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:48.089
 produces for fitness 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.930
 well, let us go in and see what 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:54.749
 we can add my friends here 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.870
 all there are a lot of children in it my 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:06:00.120
 subscribers but I am now in my prime 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.889
 I donâ€™t use a coat of arms here I exhibit 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.199
 boredom I want to take steps a day 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.050
 for example on average it's 10,000 steps i 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.539
 such an athlete that I will put 20 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.860
 thousand steps after that happens me 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.860
 synchronization and 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.749
 and that fitness tracker you understand that a hundred 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.129
 percent is 20 thousand steps 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.080
 accordingly will be shown in 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.080
 The percentage of the same case 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.449
 things are with sleep ie we are an example 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.589
 we will enter 11 o'clock at the cabony sony 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.569
 or we will sleep for 5 hours and then everything 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.159
 this also translates into a fitness tracker 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.789
 also the sequel to is shown 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:38.699
 The level of charge of your fitness tracker is well 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.909
 and then we can just press the key 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.909
 and connect get information about 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.050
 that as we passed and slept like this all 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:50.430
 will be shown to us 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.469
 this is an example of a night see this is deep 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.199
 sleep well it's a light dream here responsible 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:58.709
 how many have fallen asleep but it is quite me 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.930
 slept some man today 8:15 one hundred 

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:02.220
 seventeen percent that's goals cool 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.070
 let's 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.120
 for example here is a strong move 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.190
 normal result here 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.530
 5000 then ten steps is 4 and 11 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.810
 kilometers target accomplished by 44 percent 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.310
 and accordingly further on there once in and 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.990
 calories and things like that all here 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.560
 You can also enter your 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:25.280
 the statistics that we drank and ate today 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.450
 if you want to share it with everyone 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.110
 In general, the application is very executed 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.280
 beautiful prom and deliver it well,
