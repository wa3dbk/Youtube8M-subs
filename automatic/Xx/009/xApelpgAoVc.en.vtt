00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
of the recurrent nature of this tumor we

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.810 
of the recurrent nature of this tumor we
really<00:01:19.310> needed<00:01:19.549> a<00:01:19.909> safer<00:01:20.840> way<00:01:21.080> of<00:01:21.820> treating

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
really needed a safer way of treating

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.030 
really needed a safer way of treating
the<00:01:22.909> tumor<00:01:23.240> when<00:01:23.390> he<00:01:23.480> comes<00:01:23.720> back<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.260> using

the tumor when he comes back and using

this direct injection model allows us to
do<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.240> what<00:01:30.050> we<00:01:30.170> could<00:01:30.320> actually<00:01:30.470> do<00:01:30.860> is

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
do that what we could actually do is

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.280 
do that what we could actually do is
insert<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.460> very<00:01:31.790> small<00:01:32.150> catheter<00:01:32.390> through

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
normal brain and get to the tumor and

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.080 
normal brain and get to the tumor and
then<00:01:36.380> infuse<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.010> drug<00:01:37.250> into<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.700> tumor

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
then infuse the drug into the tumor

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.910 
then infuse the drug into the tumor
itself<00:01:38.330> without<00:01:38.690> causing<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.409> extensive

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
an MRI is done on the patient so that we

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.490 
an MRI is done on the patient so that we

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
controllers that allow us to make very

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
fine adjustment not unlike a joystick so

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720 
fine adjustment not unlike a joystick so
that<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.110> catheter<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.740> exactly<00:02:43.430> where<00:02:43.700> we

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
that the catheter is exactly where we

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.150 
that the catheter is exactly where we
need<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.330> be<00:02:44.480> as<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.500> catheter<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.010> then

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
need it to be as the catheter is then

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.890 
need it to be as the catheter is then
advanced<00:02:46.670> into<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> region<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> tumor

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.770 
advanced into the region of the tumor
the<00:02:48.500> drug<00:02:48.709> gets<00:02:48.830> infused<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:50.180> infusion

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the drug gets infused and the infusion

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.750 
the drug gets infused and the infusion
of<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.080> drug<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.500> also<00:02:52.010> monitored<00:02:52.490> in

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
of the drug is also monitored in

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.420 
of the drug is also monitored in
real-time<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:54.410> what<00:02:54.560> we're<00:02:54.680> seeing<00:02:54.980> right<00:02:55.370> now

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
real-time so what we're seeing right now

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.330 
real-time so what we're seeing right now
is<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.990> path<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> catheter<00:02:58.070> is

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
is that the path of the catheter is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.970 
is that the path of the catheter is
exactly<00:02:59.120> as<00:02:59.240> we<00:02:59.360> planned<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.990> in<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.530> perfect

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
exactly as we planned it's in a perfect

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.880 
exactly as we planned it's in a perfect
location<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.730> deliver<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.510> virus<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.470> at<00:03:03.739> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
location to deliver the virus and at the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.760 
location to deliver the virus and at the
tip<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.370> catheter<00:03:04.610> we'll<00:03:05.150> see<00:03:05.390> an<00:03:05.690> area<00:03:06.200> of

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
tip of the catheter we'll see an area of

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.340 
tip of the catheter we'll see an area of
brightness<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.640> that's<00:03:08.239> because<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.959> virus

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
brightness and that's because the virus

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.640 
brightness and that's because the virus
is<00:03:09.380> mixed<00:03:09.920> with<00:03:10.160> gadolinium<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:11.650> enhancing

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
is mixed with gadolinium a enhancing

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.699 
is mixed with gadolinium a enhancing
agent<00:03:13.040> something<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.489> looks<00:03:13.700> bright<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.180> MRI

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
agent something that looks bright on MRI

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.410 
agent something that looks bright on MRI
wherever<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.950> see<00:03:16.100> brightness<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.850> where<00:03:17.270> the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
wherever you see brightness is where the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.690 
wherever you see brightness is where the
drug<00:03:17.720> is<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.709> we're<00:03:18.890> infusing<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.489> drug

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
drug is and so we're infusing the drug

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.630 
drug is and so we're infusing the drug
directly<00:03:20.260> into<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.470> tumor<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.489> we're

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
directly into the tumor and we're

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.050 
directly into the tumor and we're
visualizing<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.390> absolutely<00:03:24.260> all<00:03:24.410> time

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
visualizing that absolutely all time

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.660 
visualizing that absolutely all time
because<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.450> blood-brain<00:03:26.810> barrier<00:03:27.670> when

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
because of the blood-brain barrier when

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.760 
because of the blood-brain barrier when
the<00:03:28.760> drug<00:03:29.000> fails<00:03:29.360> we<00:03:29.660> really<00:03:29.959> don't<00:03:30.080> know<00:03:30.380> it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
the drug fails we really don't know it

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.650 
the drug fails we really don't know it
failed<00:03:31.489> because<00:03:31.790> they've<00:03:32.060> never<00:03:32.239> gotten<00:03:32.480> to

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
failed because they've never gotten to

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.140 
failed because they've never gotten to
the<00:03:32.750> brain<00:03:32.989> or<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:34.130> failed<00:03:34.400> because<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.880> drug

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
the brain or it failed because the drug

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.229 
the brain or it failed because the drug
is<00:03:35.360> inadequate<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.170> kill<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.590> tumor<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:37.239> think

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
is inadequate to kill the tumor I think

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.240 
is inadequate to kill the tumor I think
what<00:03:38.360> we're<00:03:38.480> doing<00:03:38.720> here<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.250> revolutionary

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
what we're doing here is revolutionary

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.310 
what we're doing here is revolutionary
in<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.519> we<00:03:40.730> actually<00:03:40.760> know<00:03:41.330> exactly<00:03:42.019> where

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
in that we actually know exactly where

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.039 
in that we actually know exactly where
the<00:03:42.500> virus<00:03:42.890> has<00:03:43.070> been<00:03:43.100> delivered<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:44.600> if<00:03:44.900> the

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
the virus has been delivered so if the

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.990 
the virus has been delivered so if the
tumor<00:03:45.530> comes<00:03:45.739> back<00:03:45.950> in<00:03:46.130> an<00:03:46.250> area<00:03:46.610> where<00:03:46.880> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
tumor comes back in an area where the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.850 
tumor comes back in an area where the
virus<00:03:47.269> was<00:03:47.390> delivered<00:03:47.630> then<00:03:47.989> we<00:03:48.110> know<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.739> we

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
virus was delivered then we know that we

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.320 
virus was delivered then we know that we
have<00:03:49.010> our<00:03:49.130> work<00:03:49.340> cut<00:03:49.370> out<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:49.910> terms<00:03:50.060> of

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
have our work cut out in terms of

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.570 
have our work cut out in terms of
refining<00:03:50.870> our<00:03:50.959> virus<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.310> could<00:03:52.430> work

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
refining our virus so that it could work

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.330 
refining our virus so that it could work
better<00:03:52.790> on<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:54.170> other<00:03:54.290> hand<00:03:54.620> if<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.040> tumor

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
better on the other hand if the tumor

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.250 
better on the other hand if the tumor
comes<00:03:55.519> back<00:03:55.730> outside<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.540> where<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> virus<00:03:56.959> is

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
comes back outside of where the virus is

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.199 
comes back outside of where the virus is
delivered<00:03:57.709> we<00:03:58.400> know<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.790> we<00:03:58.880> have<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.090> work

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
delivered we know that we have to work

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.940 
delivered we know that we have to work
on<00:03:59.360> technologies<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.200> better<00:04:00.380> deliver<00:04:00.799> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
on technologies to better deliver the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.100 
on technologies to better deliver the
virus<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.430> right<00:04:01.579> area<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:02.900> way

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
virus to the right area so in this way

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.500 
virus to the right area so in this way
this<00:04:03.380> trial<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:03.829> really<00:04:04.100> pivotal<00:04:04.280> in<00:04:05.060> defining

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
this trial is really pivotal in defining

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.150 
this trial is really pivotal in defining
what<00:04:05.660> we<00:04:05.900> need<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.320> next<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.799> help<00:04:07.010> our

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
what we need to do next to help our

what we need to do next to help our
patients

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.770 

to<00:04:11.070> qualify<00:04:11.310> for<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.910> clinical<00:04:12.360> trial<00:04:12.630> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
to qualify for this clinical trial the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.630

be more than a three centimeter size in

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.450 
be more than a three centimeter size in
terms<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.150> diameter<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:25.100> ideally<00:04:26.100> this<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.430> a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
terms of diameter and ideally this is a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.360 
terms of diameter and ideally this is a
patient<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.320> has<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.350> tumor<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.800> had

recurred had came back after the surgery

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.130 
recurred had came back after the surgery
in<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:32.340> portion<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:32.970> brain<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.750> does<00:04:33.930> not

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.610 

this<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.250> an<00:04:40.490> absolutely<00:04:41.120> safe<00:04:41.479> surgery<00:04:41.870> just

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
this is an absolutely safe surgery just

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.040 
this is an absolutely safe surgery just
so<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.889> there's<00:04:43.639> a<00:04:43.729> frame<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.240> reference<00:04:44.600> the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
so you there's a frame of reference the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.710 
so you there's a frame of reference the
patients<00:04:45.530> who<00:04:45.590> get<00:04:45.710> this<00:04:45.949> surgery<00:04:46.720> every

because of the aggressive nature of

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.320 
because of the aggressive nature of
glioblastoma<00:04:56.260> is<00:04:56.770> inevitably<00:04:57.460> just<00:04:58.180> about

glioblastoma is inevitably just about
