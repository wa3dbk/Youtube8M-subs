move like this okay in the NBA

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.300 
move like this okay in the NBA
you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.539> they're<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:09.989> more<00:02:10.310> upright

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
you know they're a little more upright

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.759 
you know they're a little more upright
little<00:02:11.849> more<00:02:11.970> come<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> guy<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.079> a<00:02:13.110> saw<00:02:13.439> a

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
little more come like a guy like a saw a

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.039 
little more come like a guy like a saw a
guy<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.700> Nowitzki<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.659> know<00:02:15.810> they're<00:02:16.019> a

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
guy like Nowitzki you know they're a

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.050 
guy like Nowitzki you know they're a
little<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:16.319> awkward<00:02:16.819> however<00:02:17.819> they're

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
little more awkward however they're

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.690 
little more awkward however they're
agile<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:18.720> they're<00:02:18.930> they're<00:02:19.290> not<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
agile but they're they're not as you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.759 
agile but they're they're not as you
know<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.450> they<00:02:21.599> don't<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.170> same<00:02:22.409> style

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
know that they don't have the same style

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.589 
know that they don't have the same style
they<00:02:23.310> say<00:02:23.579> somebody<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.180> an<00:02:24.299> Amar'e

to actually pick some real big men you
know<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:36.299> maybe<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:37.170> know<00:02:37.290> different<00:02:37.530> style

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
know and maybe you know different style

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.000 
know and maybe you know different style
of<00:02:38.159> big<00:02:38.340> men<00:02:38.549> okay<00:02:39.239> now<00:02:40.140> what<00:02:40.409> we're<00:02:40.590> seeing<00:02:40.739> is

of big men okay now what we're seeing is

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.149 
of big men okay now what we're seeing is
2k13<00:02:41.870> okay<00:02:42.870> now<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.470> want<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.769> kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> getting

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
2k13 okay now I want to kind of getting

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.879 
2k13 okay now I want to kind of getting
the<00:02:44.280> reason<00:02:44.670> why<00:02:45.659> I<00:02:45.690> showed<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.290> all<00:02:46.440> three<00:02:46.859> of

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
the reason why I showed you all three of

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.339 
the reason why I showed you all three of
these<00:02:47.159> different<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.819> examples<00:02:51.780> okay

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
these different you know examples okay

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.250 
these different you know examples okay
to<00:02:52.590> k<00:02:52.829> 11<00:02:53.159> to<00:02:53.519> me<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.150> guy<00:02:54.269> was<00:02:54.569> responsive

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
to k 11 to me the guy was responsive

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.589 
to k 11 to me the guy was responsive
which<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:56.010> what<00:02:56.159> i<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.459> however<00:02:56.790> i<00:02:57.150> felt<00:02:57.540> like

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
which is what i like however i felt like

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.410 
which is what i like however i felt like
the<00:02:57.840> momentum<00:02:58.409> was<00:02:59.129> not<00:02:59.340> really<00:02:59.670> respected<00:03:00.299> in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the momentum was not really respected in

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.960 
the momentum was not really respected in
that<00:03:00.629> game<00:03:00.870> because<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.709> guy<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:02.250> speed<00:03:02.639> and

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
that game because the guy the speed and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.680 
that game because the guy the speed and
the<00:03:03.060> momentum<00:03:03.389> was<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> little<00:03:04.079> too<00:03:04.230> fast<00:03:04.609> 2k12

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
the momentum was a little too fast 2k12

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.890 
the momentum was a little too fast 2k12
had<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> nice<00:03:06.989> way<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.319> adding<00:03:07.970> momentum<00:03:08.970> with

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
had a nice way of adding momentum with

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.420 
had a nice way of adding momentum with
the<00:03:09.930> responsiveness<00:03:10.879> okay<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.150> 2k13<00:03:13.049> here<00:03:13.709> I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the responsiveness okay and 2k13 here I

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.890 
the responsiveness okay and 2k13 here I
feel<00:03:14.879> like<00:03:16.430> overdid<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.760> momentum<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.660> little

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
feel like overdid the momentum a little

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.430 
feel like overdid the momentum a little
bit<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.290> all<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.359> animations<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.199> they

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
bit and all all the animations that they

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.420 
bit and all all the animations that they
put<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.859> their<00:03:23.040> kind<00:03:23.669> of<00:03:23.790> forced<00:03:24.209> him<00:03:24.419> in<00:03:24.569> there

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
put in their kind of forced him in there

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.569 
put in their kind of forced him in there
therefore<00:03:26.430> giving<00:03:27.680> awkward<00:03:28.680> moments<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.370> wear

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
therefore giving awkward moments to wear

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.610 
therefore giving awkward moments to wear
when<00:03:30.150> you're<00:03:30.299> trying<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.660> dribble<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.410> as

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
when you're trying to dribble like as

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.020 
when you're trying to dribble like as
you<00:03:31.739> can<00:03:31.889> see<00:03:32.040> when<00:03:32.190> Gortat<00:03:32.549> just<00:03:32.579> came<00:03:33.000> down

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you can see when Gortat just came down

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.569 
you can see when Gortat just came down
there<00:03:33.629> his<00:03:34.139> arm<00:03:34.440> was<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:35.040> know<00:03:35.160> did<00:03:35.370> all<00:03:35.459> this

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
there his arm was you know did all this

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.640 
there his arm was you know did all this
movement<00:03:36.889> but<00:03:37.889> what<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> don't<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
movement but what I don't like is the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.890 
movement but what I don't like is the
extra<00:03:41.030> animations<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.120> they<00:03:42.329> put<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.690> there

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
extra animations that they put in there

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.659 
extra animations that they put in there
sometimes<00:03:43.620> there's<00:03:43.829> some<00:03:44.010> animations<00:03:44.579> that

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
sometimes there's some animations that

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.729 
sometimes there's some animations that
don't<00:03:44.970> need<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> be<00:03:45.359> in<00:03:45.660> there<00:03:45.690> as<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.560> see

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
don't need to be in there as you can see

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.250 
don't need to be in there as you can see
he's<00:03:46.919> running<00:03:47.250> up<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.519> down<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:48.480> arm<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.049> like

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
he's running up and down the arm is like

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.460 
he's running up and down the arm is like
you<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.680> really<00:03:49.889> moving<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.989> know<00:03:52.109> more

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
you know really moving you know more

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.129 
you know really moving you know more
like<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.709> guard<00:03:53.159> with<00:03:53.579> or<00:03:53.879> point<00:03:54.690> guard<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
like a guard with or point guard you

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.009 
like a guard with or point guard you
know<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.260> mean<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:55.829> definitely<00:03:56.730> again<00:03:57.599> the

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
know I mean so definitely again the

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.110 
know I mean so definitely again the
centers<00:03:58.409> are<00:03:58.590> not<00:03:58.799> represented<00:03:59.489> correctly<00:04:00.000> in

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
centers are not represented correctly in

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.869 
centers are not represented correctly in
this<00:04:00.299> game<00:04:00.569> I<00:04:01.409> would<00:04:01.739> have<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.190> go<00:04:02.340> with<00:04:02.639> a

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
this game I would have to go with a

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.039 
this game I would have to go with a
blend<00:04:03.269> between<00:04:03.949> 2k12<00:04:05.239> with<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.419> momentum<00:04:07.079> of

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
blend between 2k12 with the momentum of

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.939 
blend between 2k12 with the momentum of
2k13<00:04:11.569> next<00:04:12.569> video<00:04:12.810> will<00:04:13.049> be<00:04:13.169> dribble<00:04:13.769> moves

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
2k13 next video will be dribble moves

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.750 
2k13 next video will be dribble moves
and<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:15.000> shooting

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
and a shooting

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.819 
and a shooting
