feel<00:01:53.520> sort<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> put<00:01:54.120> upon<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.480> it<00:01:54.660> I<00:01:54.810> think

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
feel sort of put upon by it I think

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.270 
feel sort of put upon by it I think
oddly<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.470> they<00:01:55.620> they<00:01:55.740> feel<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.100> they're

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
oddly don't they they feel that they're

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
oddly don't they they feel that they're
being<00:01:56.310> asked<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.900> react<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:57.930> something<00:01:58.320> or<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
being asked to react to something or to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.650 
being asked to react to something or to
do<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.790> they're<00:01:59.940> really<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> best<00:02:00.510> thing

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
do to and they're really the best thing

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.540 
do to and they're really the best thing
they<00:02:00.780> could<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.650> what

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
they could do is to get on with what

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.440 
they could do is to get on with what
they're<00:02:03.000> doing

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
they're doing

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
they're doing
yeah<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.380> mean<00:02:04.590> happening<00:02:05.100> gigs<00:02:05.370> Carney<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
yeah I mean happening gigs Carney I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.980 
yeah I mean happening gigs Carney I
think<00:02:06.120> if<00:02:06.180> you're<00:02:06.300> doing<00:02:06.360> gigs<00:02:06.690> in<00:02:06.870> there

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
think if you're doing gigs in there

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.160 
think if you're doing gigs in there
someone<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.700> with<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
someone in with a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
someone in with a
it's<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.709> people<00:02:11.099> around<00:02:11.340> them<00:02:11.610> their

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
it's the people around them their

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.720 
it's the people around them their
reaction<00:02:13.019> is<00:02:13.110> what<00:02:13.349> makes<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.980> gig<00:02:14.159> difficult

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
reaction is what makes the gig difficult

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.149 
reaction is what makes the gig difficult
because<00:02:14.909> you're<00:02:15.560> willing<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.709> get<00:02:16.860> offended

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
because you're willing to get offended

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.039 
because you're willing to get offended
on<00:02:17.430> everyone<00:02:17.700> else's<00:02:17.909> behalf<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.930> is

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
on everyone else's behalf and it is

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.660 
on everyone else's behalf and it is
amazing<00:02:19.500> watching<00:02:19.829> people's<00:02:20.159> reaction<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
amazing watching people's reaction to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.280 
amazing watching people's reaction to
things<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:22.019> they<00:02:22.379> just<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
things that really they just just to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.319 
things that really they just just to
kind<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.680> carry<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.159> regardless<00:02:26.310> she<00:02:27.239> have

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
kind of carry on regardless she have

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.630 
kind of carry on regardless she have
things<00:02:27.569> changed<00:02:27.900> at<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.439> do<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.799> think<00:02:28.859> in

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
things changed at all do you think in

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.369 
things changed at all do you think in
terms<00:02:29.939> of<00:02:30.090> people's<00:02:30.359> attitudes<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:33.140> would<00:02:34.140> hope

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
terms of people's attitudes I would hope

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.610 
terms of people's attitudes I would hope
so<00:02:34.769> I<00:02:35.099> guess<00:02:35.879> I<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.030> assume<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.900> people<00:02:37.319> are

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
so I guess I just assume that people are

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.890 
so I guess I just assume that people are
better<00:02:37.799> educated<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:39.150> things<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:39.750> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
better educated because things like this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.500 
better educated because things like this
exist<00:02:40.319> yeah<00:02:40.950> they<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.909> know<00:02:42.030> learn<00:02:42.269> more

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
exist yeah they do you know learn more

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.569 
exist yeah they do you know learn more
at<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> bit<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:43.409> time<00:02:43.739> but<00:02:43.889> maybe<00:02:44.099> not<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.519> do

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
at a bit of time but maybe not what do

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.399 
at a bit of time but maybe not what do
you<00:02:44.670> think<00:02:44.909> I<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.599> it's<00:02:45.720> difficult<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.260> say

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
you think I think it's difficult to say

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.740 
you think I think it's difficult to say
things<00:02:46.709> have<00:02:46.950> improved<00:02:47.069> massively<00:02:47.849> I<00:02:48.359> think

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
things have improved massively I think

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.710 
things have improved massively I think
some<00:02:49.049> people<00:02:49.290> are<00:02:49.590> more<00:02:49.829> educated<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:51.690> I

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
some people are more educated but I

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.539 
some people are more educated but I
think<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.989> huge<00:02:52.290> number<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.859> people<00:02:53.220> are<00:02:53.310> still

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
think a huge number of people are still

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.580 
think a huge number of people are still
ignorant<00:02:54.450> because<00:02:54.870> I've<00:02:55.170> always<00:02:55.319> thought

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
ignorant because I've always thought

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250 
ignorant because I've always thought
that<00:02:55.799> unless<00:02:56.099> for<00:02:56.430> example<00:02:57.049> mental<00:02:58.049> health

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
that unless for example mental health

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.009 
that unless for example mental health
was<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.650> my<00:02:58.799> dad<00:02:59.069> had<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.689> depressive<00:03:00.689> illness

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
was like my dad had a depressive illness

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.470 
was like my dad had a depressive illness
for<00:03:01.230> years<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.189> how<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> kind<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.060> knew

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
for years and that's how I kind of knew

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.270 
for years and that's how I kind of knew
about<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.349> do<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.620> think<00:03:04.799> there's<00:03:04.950> been<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.129> lot

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
about it do you think there's been a lot

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.640 
about it do you think there's been a lot
more<00:03:05.489> focus<00:03:05.879> on<00:03:06.060> mental<00:03:06.930> health<00:03:07.139> issues<00:03:07.530> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
more focus on mental health issues and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.140 
more focus on mental health issues and
things<00:03:07.829> like<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.129> living<00:03:08.340> anything<00:03:08.760> else<00:03:08.939> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
things like that living anything else I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.599 
things like that living anything else I
do<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:10.109> really<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.250> think<00:03:11.310> I'm

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
do I do really and I think I'm

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.330 
do I do really and I think I'm
fortunately<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:13.680> know<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.919> group<00:03:14.160> with

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
fortunately you know the group with

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.830 
fortunately you know the group with
learning<00:03:14.699> disability<00:03:15.359> have<00:03:15.449> been<00:03:15.599> left

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
learning disability have been left

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.349 
learning disability have been left
behind<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.739> bit<00:03:16.919> in<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:17.340> people<00:03:17.790> kind<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.209> care

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
behind a bit in that people kind of care

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.240 
behind a bit in that people kind of care
well<00:03:18.510> Paul<00:03:18.780> Martin<00:03:19.230> well<00:03:19.379> he<00:03:19.530> looks<00:03:19.769> normal

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
well Paul Martin well he looks normal

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.909 
well Paul Martin well he looks normal
and<00:03:20.340> he's<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.579> laugh<00:03:20.879> you<00:03:21.180> know<00:03:21.389> how<00:03:22.049> come<00:03:22.650> he's

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
and he's a laugh you know how come he's

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.610 
and he's a laugh you know how come he's
not<00:03:22.949> running<00:03:23.940> naked<00:03:24.750> around<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:25.290> streets

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
not running naked around the streets

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.289 
not running naked around the streets
waving<00:03:25.919> him<00:03:26.220> acts<00:03:26.400> because<00:03:26.760> surely<00:03:27.120> that's

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
waving him acts because surely that's

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.849 
waving him acts because surely that's
what<00:03:27.569> people<00:03:27.780> would<00:03:27.959> mental<00:03:28.260> health<00:03:28.440> problems

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
what people would mental health problems

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.770 
what people would mental health problems
are<00:03:29.010> like<00:03:29.159> so<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.639> think<00:03:29.879> that<00:03:30.269> sort<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.569> things

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
are like so I think that sort of things

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.319 
are like so I think that sort of things
really<00:03:31.049> valuable<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:32.459> terms<00:03:32.699> of<00:03:32.849> educating

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
really valuable in terms of educating

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.270 
really valuable in terms of educating
people<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.139> yeah<00:03:34.440> it's<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.980> bit<00:03:35.129> more

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
people and yeah it's a bit more

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.159 
people and yeah it's a bit more
difficult<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.760> do<00:03:35.940> isn't<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.419> with<00:03:36.690> with

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
difficult to do isn't it with with

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.770 
difficult to do isn't it with with
learning<00:03:38.010> disability<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.970> think<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.629> way

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
learning disability I think the way

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.899 
learning disability I think the way
forward<00:03:40.199> is<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:41.099> try<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.489> normalize

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
forward is to just try and normalize

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.990 
forward is to just try and normalize
things<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.900> bit<00:03:43.079> more<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:44.069> adults<00:03:44.879> with

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
things a bit more so to have adults with

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.199 
things a bit more so to have adults with
learning<00:03:45.150> disability<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.079> films<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:46.799> example

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
learning disability in films for example

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.360 
learning disability in films for example
to<00:03:48.209> maybe<00:03:48.449> get<00:03:48.870> some<00:03:49.139> well<00:03:49.349> known<00:03:49.590> people<00:03:49.919> who

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
to maybe get some well known people who

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.550 
to maybe get some well known people who
have<00:03:50.579> relatives<00:03:50.790> with<00:03:51.329> learning<00:03:51.750> disability

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
have relatives with learning disability

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.189 
have relatives with learning disability
to<00:03:52.829> almost<00:03:53.519> kind<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.879> introduce<00:03:54.510> them<00:03:54.930> and

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
to almost kind of introduce them and

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.830 
to almost kind of introduce them and
talk<00:03:56.190> about<00:03:56.220> them<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.359> just<00:03:57.389> kind<00:03:57.780> of

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
talk about them and I just kind of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.559 
talk about them and I just kind of
demonstrate<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.879> this<00:04:00.120> kind<00:04:00.510> of

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
demonstrate that that this kind of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.539 
demonstrate that that this kind of
fantasy<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.440> lot<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.680> people<00:04:02.099> have<00:04:02.310> that

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
fantasy that a lot of people have that

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.000 
fantasy that a lot of people have that
they're<00:04:02.760> scary<00:04:03.569> or<00:04:03.989> unpredictable<00:04:04.500> or

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
they're scary or unpredictable or

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.580 
they're scary or unpredictable or
whatever<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.549> just<00:04:05.639> simply<00:04:06.299> wrong<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.379> know

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
whatever it's just simply wrong you know

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.099 
whatever it's just simply wrong you know
so<00:04:08.430> we've<00:04:08.609> sorted<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.000> out<00:04:09.269> then<00:04:09.540> that's<00:04:09.870> all

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
so we've sorted that out then that's all

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.829 
so we've sorted that out then that's all
sorted<00:04:10.590> yeah
