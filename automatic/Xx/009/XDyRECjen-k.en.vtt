00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.680 
down a little bit and you see it closed
on<00:02:52.620> itself<00:02:52.889> but<00:02:53.159> would<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.060> ever<00:02:54.239> use<00:02:54.389> your

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690

phone<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.049> way<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.579> don't<00:02:56.579> think<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.819> would

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
phone that way I don't think you would

so it's not an issue and like I said

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.660 
so it's not an issue and like I said
earlier<00:03:00.769> whenever<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.829> never<00:03:02.129> had<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> problem

think<00:03:16.079> about<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:17.220> know<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> possibility<00:03:18.000> of

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
think about you know the possibility of

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.369 
think about you know the possibility of
people<00:03:18.269> holding<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.569> phone<00:03:18.750> aside<00:03:18.930> down<00:03:19.199> like

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
people holding a phone aside down like

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.589 
people holding a phone aside down like
so<00:03:19.620> or<00:03:19.889> laying<00:03:20.819> down<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
so or laying down with it and the

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.180 
so or laying down with it and the
possibility<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.470> hinge<00:03:22.680> we're<00:03:23.040> not

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
possibility that the hinge we're not

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.699 
possibility that the hinge we're not
staying<00:03:23.400> place<00:03:23.699> fully<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.379> there's<00:03:25.379> no<00:03:25.500> lock

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
staying place fully and there's no lock

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.979 
staying place fully and there's no lock
mechanism<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.400> whether<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:27.329> open<00:03:27.449> or<00:03:27.690> closed

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
mechanism so whether it's open or closed

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.099 
mechanism so whether it's open or closed
the<00:03:28.650> screen<00:03:28.919> is<00:03:28.949> not<00:03:29.250> fully<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.699> place<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.329> if

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
the screen is not fully in place and if

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.449 
the screen is not fully in place and if
you've<00:03:31.260> ever<00:03:31.379> used<00:03:31.470> like<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.799> droid<00:03:32.069> one<00:03:32.250> for

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
you've ever used like a droid one for

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.670 
you've ever used like a droid one for
example<00:03:32.519> when<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.389> open<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.989> get<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> very

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
example when you open it you get a very

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.520 
example when you open it you get a very
reassuring<00:03:35.220> click<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:35.879> it<00:03:36.269> like<00:03:37.230> kind<00:03:37.410> of

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
reassuring click and it like kind of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.589 
reassuring click and it like kind of
snaps<00:03:37.769> into<00:03:37.919> place<00:03:38.060> but<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.359> phone

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
snaps into place but with this phone

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.150 
snaps into place but with this phone
there's<00:03:39.810> no<00:03:39.959> click<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.470> there's<00:03:40.590> no<00:03:40.739> lock

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
there's no click and there's no lock

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.369 
there's no click and there's no lock
mechanism<00:03:41.639> so<00:03:41.819> there's<00:03:42.480> no<00:03:43.019> way<00:03:43.139> for<00:03:43.199> the

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
mechanism so there's no way for the

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.300 
mechanism so there's no way for the
screen<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.859> fully<00:03:44.099> stay<00:03:44.430> open<00:03:44.819> like<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:46.310> it

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
screen to fully stay open like so and it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.830 
screen to fully stay open like so and it
just<00:03:47.489> keep<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.699> in<00:03:47.760> mind<00:03:48.000> please<00:03:48.359> don't<00:03:48.599> base

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
just keep that in mind please don't base

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.720 
just keep that in mind please don't base
your<00:03:48.870> entire<00:03:49.319> decision<00:03:49.799> from<00:03:49.919> this<00:03:50.099> issue<00:03:50.370> and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
your entire decision from this issue and

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.909 
your entire decision from this issue and
that<00:03:50.760> said<00:03:51.510> before<00:03:51.810> it's<00:03:51.930> not<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.049> defect<00:03:52.290> it's

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
that said before it's not a defect it's

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.339 
that said before it's not a defect it's
a<00:03:53.010> design<00:03:53.310> flaw<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.419> still<00:03:54.690> works<00:03:54.900> perfect

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
a design flaw so it still works perfect

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.089 
a design flaw so it still works perfect
it's<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.909> know<00:03:57.060> some<00:03:57.419> scenarios

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
it's just that you know some scenarios

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.099 
it's just that you know some scenarios
you<00:03:59.099> know<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.730> there<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.629> screen<00:04:00.959> it

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
you know like this there the screen it

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.409 
you know like this there the screen it
wasn't<00:04:01.409> meant<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.650> used<00:04:01.859> like<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.489> you

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
wasn't meant to be used like that so you

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.470 
wasn't meant to be used like that so you
know<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:03.659> just<00:04:03.720> doesn't<00:04:04.079> hold<00:04:04.620> up<00:04:04.940> but<00:04:05.940> besides

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
know it just doesn't hold up but besides

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.030 
know it just doesn't hold up but besides
that<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.780> phone<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:06.989> excellent<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.590> very<00:04:07.799> fast

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
that the phone is excellent is very fast

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.240 
that the phone is excellent is very fast
very<00:04:08.159> speedy<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:09.680> they<00:04:10.680> actually<00:04:10.859> leads<00:04:11.159> me

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
very speedy and they actually leads me

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.420 
very speedy and they actually leads me
on<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.340> my<00:04:11.459> next<00:04:11.489> topic<00:04:12.049> my<00:04:13.049> user<00:04:13.319> well<00:04:14.310> he's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
on to my next topic my user well he's

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.300 
on to my next topic my user well he's
not<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.579> user<00:04:14.760> on<00:04:14.849> XDA<00:04:15.209> but<00:04:15.540> i<00:04:15.780> was<00:04:16.620> browsing<00:04:16.799> XDA

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
not a user on XDA but i was browsing XDA

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.370 
not a user on XDA but i was browsing XDA
and<00:04:17.639> i'll<00:04:18.449> actually<00:04:18.599> bring<00:04:18.870> up<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.049> my<00:04:19.139> phone

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
and i'll actually bring up on my phone

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.360 
and i'll actually bring up on my phone
right<00:04:19.409> now<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:21.560> user<00:04:22.560> was<00:04:22.860> following<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
right now and a user was following the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.190 
right now and a user was following the
twitter<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.909> the<00:04:24.060> guy<00:04:24.389> who<00:04:24.450> created<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
twitter of the guy who created the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.780 
twitter of the guy who created the
setcpu<00:04:25.680> app<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.400> if<00:04:26.550> you're

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
setcpu app and if you're

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.050 
setcpu app and if you're
short<00:04:27.000> that<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:28.080> an<00:04:28.230> application<00:04:28.890> that

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
short that is it's an application that

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.540 
short that is it's an application that
allows<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.420> change<00:04:31.320> your<00:04:31.500> cpu's<00:04:32.250> clock

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
allows you to change your cpu's clock

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.860 
allows you to change your cpu's clock
speeds<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.000> if<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.150> want<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.330> underclock<00:04:33.660> it

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
speeds so if you want to underclock it

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.750 
speeds so if you want to underclock it
to<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> preserve<00:04:34.380> battery<00:04:34.560> life<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:35.460> can<00:04:35.610> do

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
to the preserve battery life you can do

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.940 
to the preserve battery life you can do
that<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.150> if<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.930> want<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.140> overclock<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.590> but

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
that and if you want to overclock it but

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.980 
that and if you want to overclock it but
you<00:04:38.040> need<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.190> custom<00:04:38.490> kernel<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.820> do<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.150> we

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
you need a custom kernel to do that we

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.290 
you need a custom kernel to do that we
can<00:04:40.110> overclock<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.500> as<00:04:40.650> well<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.970> can<00:04:42.120> set

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
can overclock it as well and you can set

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.270 
can overclock it as well and you can set
you<00:04:42.510> know<00:04:42.600> different<00:04:42.780> variables<00:04:43.320> so<00:04:43.500> if<00:04:44.070> the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
you know different variables so if the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.890 
you know different variables so if the
battery<00:04:44.610> life<00:04:44.760> gets<00:04:44.970> below<00:04:45.120> half<00:04:45.420> way<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:45.750> can

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
battery life gets below half way you can

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.060 
battery life gets below half way you can
set<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.230> their<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.470> know<00:04:46.530> Laura<00:04:46.830> clock

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
set it to their you know Laura clock

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.510 
set it to their you know Laura clock
speed<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.370> preserve<00:04:47.640> battery<00:04:47.670> life<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:49.520> it's

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
speed to preserve battery life and it's

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.000 
speed to preserve battery life and it's
going<00:04:50.640> to<00:04:50.700> force<00:04:50.880> close<00:04:51.060> here<00:04:51.270> at<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:52.170> XDA<00:04:52.410> egg

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
going to force close here at the XDA egg

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.800 
going to force close here at the XDA egg
the<00:04:53.190> XDA<00:04:53.550> application<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.360> pretty<00:04:54.540> buggy

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
the XDA application is pretty buggy

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.580 
the XDA application is pretty buggy

with<00:06:34.479> the<00:06:34.569> g2<00:06:34.900> when<00:06:35.050> it's<00:06:35.169> over<00:06:35.379> clock<00:06:35.559> and<00:06:35.830> on

with the g2 when it's over clock and on
this<00:06:36.789> Twitter<00:06:37.029> he<00:06:37.180> actually<00:06:37.300> stated<00:06:37.749> that<00:06:37.809> it

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
this Twitter he actually stated that it

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.260 
this Twitter he actually stated that it
could<00:06:38.050> be<00:06:38.169> stable<00:06:38.680> stable<00:06:39.490> you<00:06:39.669> not<00:06:40.059> something

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
could be stable stable you not something

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.700 
could be stable stable you not something
to<00:06:40.330> work<00:06:40.479> stabling<00:06:40.900> but<00:06:41.409> it<00:06:41.499> can<00:06:41.620> be

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
to work stabling but it can be

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.499 
to work stabling but it can be
overclocked<00:06:42.219> at<00:06:42.339> one<00:06:42.460> point<00:06:42.610> 4<00:06:42.849> gigahertz<00:06:43.150> and

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
overclocked at one point 4 gigahertz and

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.619 
overclocked at one point 4 gigahertz and
it'll<00:06:44.050> still<00:06:44.319> be<00:06:44.409> stable<00:06:44.860> so<00:06:45.419> it's<00:06:46.419> gonna<00:06:46.539> be

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:46.629 
it'll still be stable so it's gonna be

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:48.749 
it'll still be stable so it's gonna be
pretty<00:06:46.719> interesting<00:06:47.379> and<00:06:47.529> hopefully<00:06:48.400> we<00:06:48.639> get

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
some we get the permanent roots too

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.939 
some we get the permanent roots too
