phenomenal products out there too and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.960 
phenomenal products out there too and
that<00:02:22.390> I'm<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> connoisseur<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.850> know<00:02:24.940> I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970

that I'm a connoisseur of so you know I
think<00:02:25.210> what<00:02:25.330> sets<00:02:25.510> us<00:02:25.690> apart<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.710> tone

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
think what sets us apart is is the tone

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.400 
think what sets us apart is is the tone
that<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.370> take<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.300> our<00:02:28.540> intent<00:02:28.960> right<00:02:29.260> our

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that we take and our intent right our

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.950 
that we take and our intent right our
intent<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.920> honor<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.480> soldier<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.750> it

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
intent is to honor the soldier and it

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.940 
intent is to honor the soldier and it
says<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.260> know<00:02:32.350> it's<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.620> game<00:02:32.830> about

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
says you know it's not a game about

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.760 
says you know it's not a game about
politics<00:02:33.550> or<00:02:33.880> or<00:02:34.300> any<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.680> know

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
operational planning or procedures is

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.710 
operational planning or procedures is
about<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:38.290> handful<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.100> guys<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.670> are<00:02:40.450> going

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
about a handful of guys that are going

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.140 
about a handful of guys that are going
through<00:02:40.840> an<00:02:41.110> event<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.560> it's<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:43.000> know<00:02:43.030> like

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
through an event and it's you know like

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.900 
through an event and it's you know like
always<00:02:43.660> as<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> historical<00:02:44.470> fiction<00:02:44.910> meaning

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
always as a historical fiction meaning

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.540 
always as a historical fiction meaning
it's<00:02:46.030> inspired<00:02:46.540> by<00:02:46.540> these<00:02:47.530> guys<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.160> they're

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
it's inspired by these guys and they're

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.370 
it's inspired by these guys and they're
fictional<00:02:48.940> characters<00:02:49.420> but<00:02:49.630> they're<00:02:50.050> set<00:02:50.350> in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
fictional characters but they're set in

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.820 
fictional characters but they're set in
a<00:02:50.910> historical<00:02:51.910> event<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.600> think<00:02:53.530> our<00:02:53.620> tone

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
a historical event so I think our tone

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.250 
a historical event so I think our tone
and<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.450> story<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.900> we're<00:02:56.020> trying<00:02:56.200> to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
and and the story that we're trying to

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.810 
and and the story that we're trying to
tell<00:02:56.440> what<00:02:56.650> will<00:02:56.770> set<00:02:56.980> us<00:02:57.070> apart<00:02:57.190> hopefully

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
tell what will set us apart hopefully

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.010 
tell what will set us apart hopefully
yeah<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> middle<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.900> desert

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
yeah I like the middle of a desert

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.570 
yeah I like the middle of a desert
because<00:02:59.320> there<00:02:59.620> isn't<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> cut<00:03:00.070> it's<00:03:00.310> not<00:03:00.430> like

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
because there isn't a cut it's not like

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.070 
because there isn't a cut it's not like
a<00:03:00.640> soundtrack<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.420> through<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:01.900> while

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080
