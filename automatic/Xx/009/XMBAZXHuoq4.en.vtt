00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.950
 O 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 the exhibition of a cover the man is a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.139
 large enterprise between the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.940
 evolutionary studies laboratory 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.080
 here in usp and the weathervane 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.330
 cultural 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.960
 the main objective of the exhibition is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.390
 endow SÃ£o Paulo with a great exhibition 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.789
 on human evolution in a way that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.869
 people who visit the exhibition will 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.839
 get out of there 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.500
 extremely knowledgeable about how to 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:38.370
 was the process of organizing from 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.539
 more or less seven million years ago 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.250
 until the emergence of man is 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.930
 behaviorally modern around 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.679
 40 thousand years ago 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.449
 the last 20 years the laboratory here 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:58.440
 in usp has been importing and forming a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.370
 excellent collection not only of skeletons 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.860
 of prehistoric hominids but also 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.100
 of tools and objects of art that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.909
 have been made up history long ago I already 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.430
 I would like to have socialized this 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.850
 collection with a wider audience 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.299
 but unfortunately only now has this 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.860
 possibility is there in the weathervane that was 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.009
 very welcome 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.970
 so what we did these replicas 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 generally they are made of plaster or 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.450
 resin from the originals in the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.560
 institutions where these originals are 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 are deposited in the case of the exhibition we 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 we made replicas of the replicas that we 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.399
 we have in the laboratory and the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.049
 Exposure main body yet 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.560
 We imported some replicas 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.560
 specifically for the exhibition 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.060
 we started thinking about this exhibition 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.149
 in 2006 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.539
 Initially we had an invitation to 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.619
 make this exhibition at science station 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.400
 from usp 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.450
 and the science station has succeeded 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.310
 some features of cnpq and went with these 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.310
 cnpq resources that we are granting to 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.849
 exposure we did the programming part 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.120
 but the one that took the most time was 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.970
 just to replicate the replicas 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.950
 that we had here in the laboratory alone. 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.200
 This took two and a half years to 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.799
 reconstitution also in appearance 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.040
 some boys took more time to 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.680
 two years to be made and also 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.049
 There was a delay let's say like this 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.650
 because after that everything 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.709
 science station did not get resources 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.299
 for mounting the exposure to the exposure 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.510
 fell into a limbo 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.150
 for a while and then the idea came 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.200
 this invitation to mount the exhibition of the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.440
 and the assembly took about 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440
 one year
