00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
 one two three four! 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.180
 The engine turns! 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.540
 It's Scotty Kilmer channel time now! 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.040
 Today, let me tell you why you want to wax your car. 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.560
 Because if you don't wax your car, it may end up like this, faded or even rusted. 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.350
 This car was originally mine. I sold it to a customer a few years ago, needless to say. 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.450
 In the past few years, he has not played a wax, it may sound a little crazy. 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.930
 The paint of the car is actually flexible. If it is not waxed regularly 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.480
 Keeping its elasticity, the paint will fade and rust once it begins to crack 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.880
 It’s already late, so you should wax regularly. 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.260
 This paint will not crack from the beginning, do not wax the dusty paint. 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.390
 Because the dust will cause scratches, the car wax can not seal the paint well, so you must first wash the car. 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.180
 Put a special car wash, the wax-free soap liquid first washes off the floating soil with water. 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.680
 When using a soapy liquid to clean the car with soap, do not use a sponge. 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.240
 Sponge may scratch the car paint. I use wool car wash gloves. 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.530
 It wipes clean and won't scratch the paint. Now let's start cleaning the car. 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.790
 You may have noticed, I found a cool place to clean the car, don't wash the car under the sun, otherwise there will be many spots when the water is dry. 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.330
 You have to find a shade so that the car does it quickly and the sun does not cause water spots. 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.030
 Wash off soap 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.909
 After scouring, look for a piece of suede to wipe off the water. 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.780
 I use this synthetic suede effect and it is durable. 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.930
 This has been used for five years, and it’s still not bad. 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.570
 Unscrew the water continuously so that there are no water marks 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.210
 Now is the need for patient steps to let the car dry in the shade for about 1 hour. 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.409
 Dry the water thoroughly. If the water is not dry enough, it cannot be waxed. 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.259
 Don't put the car in direct sunlight, because the sun will heat the body too hot, then wax again. 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.209
 The effect will be very poor. After the car is completely dry, take the car wax out and start waxing. 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.519
 There are a variety of car wax solids, liquids, and claims on the market. 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.110
 Never fall off... But to be honest, still use this hard solid wax 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.739
 Although waxing is a little bit awkward but can last longer, in the long run 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.450
 Can make your car look better at the liquid wax sprayed, the adhesion is not so strong 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.519
 After the car has dried, look for a cotton wipe and rub it with wax. 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.450
 Then use a small circular motion to wax the car once a small piece. 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.600
 Because if you have too much area on one time, it will take too long to dry, and it will be done too thoroughly. 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.920
 Not easy to wipe off, so this way: a small hood, the entire hood, wait a few minutes 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.209
 Then polish the first block and then polish another 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.500
 When you see the wax start to dry out, it can be wiped off with a towel like this. 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.970
 Some people who are particular about it must use microfiber cloth for me. 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.299
 I just found an old bath towel and they all used up. My wife would have thrown it away. 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.310
 I washed it with a washing machine. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.510
 They are very soft, they are used for polishing, they are gently polished, and they are also used in circular motion. 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.829
 From time to time, turn the towel over so that the wax does not fill the fiber. 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.280
 This polished finish is just the same. 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.000
 It can be polished one by one to wax the car, and the final gloss will be very good. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.500
 The area that you don't want to go on is too big, so the excess wax is easy to wipe off. 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.859
 If you first wax the entire body, then go back and wipe the wax and it will solidify into a lot of white things. 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.359
 The effect of beauty you will definitely ask: How long should I wax last time? 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.880
 It is best to wax four times a year, once every season. 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.830
 That's right, it's a bit of a hassle. If you are too lazy to do it yourself, you can pay. 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.210
 Give them to the car beauty shop, but think about how they can wax their car like you. 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.850
 On the heart? Yes, I am as lazy as my customer but I am also very cheap. 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.400
 So I do it myself, because really you really want your car to be like this? 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.200
 At least before you sell to the next person? Seriously, who doesn’t want to drive a shiny car 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.100
 Going around? Remember, there are any questions about the car. 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.280
 Please watch the Scotty Kilmer channel. I will answer this cup of "moonlight".
