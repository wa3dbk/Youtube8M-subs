00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello guys with you yes rica and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.150
 today in this issue of mod reviews we 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 again consider the mini fashion that is immediately 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.660
 several small mods do for 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.320
 which separate issue would be 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.970
 illogical 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.520
 that's why I review several 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.769
 small mods in one video Well 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.810
 let's go the first mod that we consider 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.580
 adds just one new ore 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 She looks like this and I think 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.390
 some have already guessed why we 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.980
 need from this ore will not fall out 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.930
 nothing but experience 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 This ore will be useful to those who often 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.250
 enchants things well or for what there 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.260
 more experience is needed nothing more 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 unusual this mod does not add everything 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.210
 only one new ore from which falls 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.640
 Experience, in general, all the mod is very simple 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 useful and small but we turn to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.379
 the second mini mod does not add to the next 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 no function rather limits 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.399
 the usual functions of minecraft look 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.289
 what the world looks like in the first person 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.760
 more precisely, pay attention to the lack 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.250
 some details 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.260
 earlier when you suggested on the block around 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.450
 they had such a black frame and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.470
 accordingly you could understand on what 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 block you aim 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 and you could break it but by installing this 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.729
 mod you won't see this black frame 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.500
 and you can not break the blocks until you 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.450
 You can ask why this is needed 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.520
 mod and this mod is most likely needed for 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 passing different cards you know when 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.320
 you pass the card and you are forbidden 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.150
 break any blocks then this mod you 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 it comes in handy you just put it 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.630
 and you can't accidentally break anything 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.030
 of course you can still 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.400
 interact with buttons and levers 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.619
 there are no restrictions like that 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 do you think a good mod for me so very, 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.420
 the third from no less interesting and useful 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 and and even funny as you see me now 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.950
 I'm hungry and I do n't even know what not 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 fill up hunger but fortunately started 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.540
 rain and i can make one very 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.210
 interesting thing i'm just throwing back 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.600
 head up and now from raining I'm 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.950
 I will replenish hunger as if you know 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.799
 throw back your head and drink some water 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 which falls on top funny mod not 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.729
 is it true to write in the comments what 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.459
 the mod you liked the most and why 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.920
