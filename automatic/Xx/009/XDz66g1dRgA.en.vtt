00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:11.829
 An industry hut for a ranger hut 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:15.429
 you need a suitable area and 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:19.240
 I think this area directly here 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:22.000
 the border between deciduous forest and 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.210
 coniferous a bit higher than that 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.420
 border may seem appropriate 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.660
 because the ranger needs a territory in 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.490
 he'll tell you 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:41.440
 both the bugs of the needle forest as 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.970
 also hunt the creatures of the mixed forest 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.180
 can because that is his task with it 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:58.320
 he denies his livelihood 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:01.780
 hunt wild boar rabbits and row 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.460
 in minecraft I just want to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.479
 this place said there are 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.930
 again boars still hare before marriage 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.880
 this is a shortcoming that as quickly as possible 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.510
 to be corrected 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.130
 this house is very different from all other houses 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.159
 I've ever built 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:28.200
 has a roof here on the left 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 side one a little 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.929
 Steep angle on the right side 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.880
 a stronger pitch angle is there 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.340
 some people may say that's it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.390
 not at all of advantage up here in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 this area with the hard winters and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.350
 whoever has a bit 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.929
 Law 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.909
 in fact it may be that way 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.830
 that the ranger is regularly on the roof 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.710
 increases 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.170
 and the snow slides down the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.590
 whole wall decouple stone wants her 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.590
 can see 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.660
 Of course this has a meaning in 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.240
 At this height it is extremely difficult 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.040
 other valuable materials to come 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.840
 a beautiful were then with an access 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.810
 on the right and here will be too 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.200
 already used the entrance door 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 a wonderful entrance door with a 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.720
 bar the outward advice about it and 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.980
 here windows with wood deposited 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.370
 are there later come this 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.110
 Shutters on top 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.420
 the whole building a wider than 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.610
 originally thought to it then 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.420
 to make everyone a narrower because I 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.140
 thought me that is too broad 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.030
 four times the recording speed 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.500
 This time I think you can do it 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.940
 You can still do it if you want 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.920
 still build 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.600
 but you definitely get one 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.290
 Imagination of how the whole look 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.989
 should and you can always synonymous 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.510
 to modify it as you might 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.650
 like better 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.660
 You can already see it very well 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.989
 after which he will be the first floor 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.110
 and that is the upper floor in the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.709
 the ranger's let's play picks up 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.730
 in the evening when he comes from hunting he comes 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.190
 makes very good clever funny let's play 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.640
 and if you look at one of them 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.769
 Just wanted to go to the link below 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.520
 in the infobox click 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.210
 this window really does look that way 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.260
 it will not be with the ground though 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.030
 compatible 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.800
 That's why I made it higher again 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.730
 maybe I change that again in that 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:51.020
 I pull the floor down 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.090
 right here the windows too and now 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.960
 The ceiling is also in light wood 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.960
 moved in 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:06.450
 I fly around the building and build the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:09.060
 shutters and I think so we 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.370
 maybe by strengthening the person 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.090
 very nice highlights the mountain huts 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.920
 character clearly rows of windows it becomes 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.109
 dark and I find it a very nice 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.420
 Daytime for this building and the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.210
 Of course, ranger needs a little one 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.480
 tower to enter the forest into peeping to 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.940
 You can see where the deer are 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.300
 on the way are the rabbits and the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.300
 wildschweine 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.650
 In addition, this tower is also used as 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.340
 in quotes staircase for 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.830
 It also houses the ladder 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.240
 with the one on the first floor 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:55.550
 I also like to climb 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.550
 This daytime to look beautiful 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.760
 Now you have a problem here the roof 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.050
 is too flat the roof needs to be a bit higher 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.520
 you will be made out of the door 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.310
 you can come out a lot 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.180
 Tried and tried now found that way 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.919
 very nice but I can also 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:20.910
 I also live with the solution afterwards 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:21.450
 it would not have been that way 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.780
 bad 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.550
 well so it has become one can 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.160
 Thank God, everything is always changing 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.470
 by the way, 20 facts are rocking here 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.729
 racks for the cases of bunnies 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.460
 and wild boar 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.159
 These are then to the 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.009
 hung dry 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:45.879
 we should look at how to get this thing off 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.379
 inside and on the other 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.749
 page, I'm thinking like me here 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.180
 a small mini bay window were inside 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:54.430
 You can then see him from the outside like 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.120
 I made it, I think 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.439
 I did not record you write in 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.370
 the comments 4 times 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:04.120
 speed only now 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.439
 Maybe it's double 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.369
 bearable or whether it is outside 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:11.409
 should please not make future 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:14.619
 I will then blot myself with it 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:19.360
 daily blood from a wild sow one 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:20.669
 hare or a deer first floor 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.899
 two beds quite spartan 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:26.319
 set up and then up again 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:30.039
 You can go deep into the forest 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:33.039
 into it right now on the 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:39.580
 fast nothing seen what to hunt 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:42.849
 but they could eat as well 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:47.860
 no matter here beautiful goldener cut so far 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:50.289
 to the left he exactly and with that is also 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:54.029
 made a family and it gets dark 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.029
 Thank you until then bye
