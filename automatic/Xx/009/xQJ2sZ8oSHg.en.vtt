00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
a group or a raid those boxes will show

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.230 
a group or a raid those boxes will show
up<00:04:18.500> with<00:04:19.190> portraits<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.750> other<00:04:20.900> players

it so that I can move it around because

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.840 
it so that I can move it around because
sometimes<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.070> would<00:04:37.220> like<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.550> little<00:04:37.670> bit

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
but I'm sure it was probably something

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.900 
but I'm sure it was probably something
rude<00:07:05.400> since<00:07:05.640> they're<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:05.880> enemy<00:07:07.760> so<00:07:08.760> those

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910
