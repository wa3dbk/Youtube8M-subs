know confusing for the club over the
last<00:01:35.670> few<00:01:36.090> years<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> case<00:01:37.079> of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
last few years is this really a case of

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
last few years is this really a case of
everyone<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.150> chipping<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
everyone you know really chipping in

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
everyone you know really chipping in
together<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.829> big<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.549> think

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
together and going big which I think

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
together and going big which I think
certainly<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.390> squad's<00:01:42.720> capable<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.140> doing

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
certainly the squad's capable of doing

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.310 
certainly the squad's capable of doing
today<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> adding<00:01:44.880> masters<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> adding

galleon and adding right all those three

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.840 
galleon and adding right all those three
