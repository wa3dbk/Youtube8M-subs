make the easiest raised planter there is

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.609 
make the easiest raised planter there is
out<00:00:10.000> of<00:00:10.030> pallets<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:10.719> lot<00:00:11.139> of<00:00:11.230> stuff<00:00:11.440> out<00:00:11.590> there

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:11.619 
out of pallets a lot of stuff out there

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.259 
out of pallets a lot of stuff out there
to<00:00:12.010> make<00:00:12.129> with<00:00:12.309> pallets<00:00:12.730> but<00:00:12.910> you<00:00:13.030> know<00:00:13.120> what

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
to make with pallets but you know what

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.740 
to make with pallets but you know what
pallets<00:00:13.629> are<00:00:13.960> pain<00:00:14.919> they<00:00:15.820> break<00:00:16.119> they<00:00:16.360> split

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
pallets are pain they break they split

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.269 
pallets are pain they break they split
everything<00:00:17.080> they're<00:00:17.380> cheap<00:00:17.619> wood<00:00:17.919> so<00:00:18.099> every

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
everything they're cheap wood so every

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.330 
everything they're cheap wood so every
time<00:00:18.430> you<00:00:18.580> try<00:00:18.759> to<00:00:18.820> take<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:19.060> hammer<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.419> them

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
time you try to take a hammer to them

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.210 
time you try to take a hammer to them
they<00:00:21.340> fall<00:00:21.609> apart<00:00:21.910> so<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.529> easiest<00:00:23.769> way<00:00:23.859> to<00:00:23.949> do

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
they fall apart so the easiest way to do

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.810 
they fall apart so the easiest way to do
it<00:00:24.369> is<00:00:24.849> I<00:00:25.000> just<00:00:25.210> take<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.539> front<00:00:25.720> half<00:00:25.960> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it is I just take the front half and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.070 
it is I just take the front half and
just<00:00:27.820> cut<00:00:28.090> it<00:00:28.210> right<00:00:28.390> after<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.750> first<00:00:28.929> two

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
just cut it right after the first two

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.330 
just cut it right after the first two
boards<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.560> I<00:00:29.590> do<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.830> same<00:00:29.890> thing<00:00:30.189> on<00:00:30.250> the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
boards and I do the same thing on the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:53.640 
boards and I do the same thing on the
back<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:50.710> right<00:00:50.940> there's<00:00:51.940> one<00:00:52.000> part<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:53.530> then

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
back all right there's one part but then

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.649 
back all right there's one part but then
you<00:00:53.739> see<00:00:53.979> the<00:00:54.640> hole<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.180> we'll<00:00:55.269> take<00:00:55.449> care<00:00:55.600> of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
you see the hole and we'll take care of

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:56.520 
you see the hole and we'll take care of
that<00:00:55.809> in<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:55.989> second

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
that in a second

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.229 
that in a second
so<00:00:57.189> we'll<00:00:57.489> do<00:00:57.549> the<00:00:57.640> same<00:00:57.699> thing<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:58.119> the<00:00:58.210> other

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
three pallets and this is what we have

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580 
three pallets and this is what we have
six<00:01:14.140> pieces<00:01:14.380> it's<00:01:14.979> nice<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.490> small<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:17.439> can

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
six pieces it's nice and small you can

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.050 
six pieces it's nice and small you can
actually<00:01:17.710> fit<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.039> lot<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.219> vegetables<00:01:18.850> in<00:01:19.030> it

actually fit a lot of vegetables in it

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.060 
actually fit a lot of vegetables in it
but<00:01:19.869> as<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.020> can<00:01:20.109> see<00:01:20.170> we<00:01:20.439> have<00:01:20.560> holes<00:01:20.829> around

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
but as you can see we have holes around

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.739 
but as you can see we have holes around
the<00:01:21.280> side<00:01:21.490> where<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.700> pallet<00:01:22.030> was<00:01:22.179> where<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
the side where the pallet was where the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.080 
the side where the pallet was where the
for<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.320> holes<00:01:23.469> in<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.649> pallet<00:01:23.920> work<00:01:24.039> so<00:01:24.789> we

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
for the holes in the pallet work so we

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.889 
for the holes in the pallet work so we
have<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.420> piece<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.869> waste<00:01:26.170> leftover<00:01:26.880> and
