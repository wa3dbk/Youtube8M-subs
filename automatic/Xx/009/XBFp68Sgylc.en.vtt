00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.650
 so today we are going to conduct 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.750
 the series is pretty interesting 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 experiments which are called 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.100
 chemical rainbow these are experiments 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 lies in the fact that several 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.830
 solutions get all seven colors 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.779
 rainbows 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.060
 that is, red orange yellow green 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.369
 blue cyan and purple 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.430
 now we have 7 glasses in front of us 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.649
 which are poured various solutions now 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 it's not very much like a rainbow but soon 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.160
 some of the solutions change their 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.379
 color and all colors will be the same 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.200
 what sequence do u rainbow for 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.660
 start make red in the first 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.320
 cups per liter of titan astor 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.230
 potassium 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.059
 to get red color add to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.780
 him a small amount of ferric chloride 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.270
 3 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.109
 with this reaction a theater is formed over 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.390
 iron 3 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.290
 which has a very bright saturated 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.890
 red color in the second cups from us 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.810
 It is potassium dichromate solution it is 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.790
 imagine and so orange so we are with him 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 nothing will do in the third 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 cups we also have a solution 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 potassium dichromate but we have to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.000
 get yellow color for this thread 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 a small amount in a cup 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.009
 sodium hydroxide solution that is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.040
 alkali alkaline medium potassium dichromate 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.259
 goes into potassium chromate and solution 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.650
 turns yellow as chromate 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.049
 potassium so bright yellow and here 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.540
 first got the three colors of the rainbow go 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.509
 next three cups from us 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.790
 there is a solution of copper sulphate 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.490
 different concentrations further we need 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.009
 get green for this to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.710
 the solution of copper sulphate is poured 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.780
 small amount of titian then potassium 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.450
 it forms a rather complicated 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.850
 complex compound of copper and times too 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 becomes green in the fifth cup 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.049
 us solution of copper sulphate 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 in and of itself he is so blue what we 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.099
 we will not do anything to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.300
 cup of us is terminated but 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.010
 vitriol 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.620
 slightly less construction than 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.710
 previous to get bright blue 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.500
 the color lay on the hydroxide solution 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.500
 ammonium in the interruption of hydroxide 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.560
 ammonium complex formed 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.450
 compound ammoniac copper at the same time 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 the solution becomes very bright 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.920
 deep blue well and now 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.900
 finally get purple color in 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.080
 the last seventh cup nose 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.540
 there is a solution of mangano then potassium to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.930
 get purple color welcome to him in 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.360
 sulfuric acid when changing acidity 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.540
 mango natali goes into permanganate 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.960
 potassium and the solution turns purple well 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.360
 But after such interesting experiments 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.990
 got all seven colors of the rainbow here 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.990
 turned out very bright and good 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.990
 pronounced 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.200
 Well, now let's see 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.390
 what happens if you mix all these 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.410
 seven colored solutions in one large 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.950
 the flask will start with a red light 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.640
 killing schools was a solution and titian then 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.400
 iron 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.989
 continue to interrupt you dichromate cake 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:40.069
 potassium open space becomes orange 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:43.750
 gave flush potassium dichromate further 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.030
 we add complex compound of copper 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.380
 green bonfire becomes green 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:55.959
 further simply copper sulphate practically 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.959
 has not changed further copper ammine 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:07.850
 the author is still green well and 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:09.319
 finally potassium permanganate solution us 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.040
 It turned out to be a mod because in it 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.950
 manganese dioxide precipitate formed and i 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.280
 I think iron hydroxide and there maybe 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.289
 so many different variations to 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.709
 make the solution clear add to 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.510
 him 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:29.000
 sulfuric acid with all precipitation 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:33.010
 dissolve and make us transparent 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.010
 a solution of such a brownish color 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.889
 but
