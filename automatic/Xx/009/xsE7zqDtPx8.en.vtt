 Is this related to the disappearance of Chris and Jessica? 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.555
 I beg you not to. 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.271
 Hey, I did not say Chris was dead ... 

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:19.167
 Okay. Let's find him first. 

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.758
 Did not you just close the door? 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.259
 Kris! Kris! 

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.797
 Please, say something! 

00:00:59.697 --> 00:01:01.422
 I found Chris. But he's stuck here now. 

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:03.573
 Can you get him out? 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.403
 No, the door is locked. I think I should look for the key. 

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:10.145
 ok. Let's look for it once. 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.817
 Parker, I found the key. But this is right ... 

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:21.942
 Let's try it. 

00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:24.454
 Let's meet him in the room where Chris was. 

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:08.024
 quality! 

00:05:08.592 --> 00:05:10.376
 Hurry! I have to save Chris. 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.692
 Kris! 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.513
 Kris? 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.192
 What is this? 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.925
 Oh.... 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.979
 Damn it, it was a trap! 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.311
 Let me know the truth ... Ms. Valentine
