00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
very unique engine on it the reason to

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.120 
very unique engine on it the reason to
sound<00:05:58.720> kind<00:05:59.080> of<00:05:59.140> poppy<00:05:59.500> here<00:05:59.800> there's<00:06:00.040> the

sound kind of poppy here there's the

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.850 
sound kind of poppy here there's the
five<00:06:00.370> cylinder<00:06:00.850> engine<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:02.020> this<00:06:02.230> to<00:06:02.650> the

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
five cylinder engine and to this to the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.980 
five cylinder engine and to this to the
cylinders<00:06:03.280> have<00:06:03.310> an<00:06:03.550> exhaust<00:06:03.850> stack<00:06:04.180> to<00:06:04.780> other

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
cylinders have an exhaust stack and then

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.430 
cylinders have an exhaust stack and then
one<00:06:06.880> by<00:06:07.060> itself<00:06:07.330> as<00:06:07.540> an<00:06:07.660> exhaust<00:06:07.930> act<00:06:08.140> so<00:06:08.380> you

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
one by itself as an exhaust act so you

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.050 
one by itself as an exhaust act so you
kind<00:06:08.680> of<00:06:08.710> get<00:06:08.860> that<00:06:08.890> poppy<00:06:09.310> kind<00:06:09.700> of<00:06:09.820> sound

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
have this airplane here there's only

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.700 
have this airplane here there's only
three<00:06:55.090> I<00:06:55.540> believe<00:06:55.960> there<00:06:56.110> are<00:06:56.170> three<00:06:56.500> in<00:06:56.620> the

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
three I believe there are three in the

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.290 
three I believe there are three in the
United<00:06:57.070> States<00:06:57.430> and<00:06:57.670> I<00:06:57.700> think<00:06:57.910> there's<00:06:58.090> only<00:06:58.180> a

United States and I think there's only a
couple<00:06:58.540> in<00:06:58.750> Europe<00:06:59.110> so<00:06:59.380> I'll<00:07:00.220> bet<00:07:00.370> there's

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
couple in Europe so I'll bet there's

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.370 
couple in Europe so I'll bet there's
less<00:07:00.790> than<00:07:01.030> six<00:07:01.480> of<00:07:01.630> these<00:07:01.750> flying<00:07:02.050> in<00:07:02.290> the
