00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
extension cable well I found one I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.930 
extension cable well I found one I
bought<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.260> ebay<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> can

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

see<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.370> certainly<00:00:53.910> longer<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
see it is it's certainly longer than the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you don't have something like this but

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.779 
you don't have something like this but

there's no video of anybody using one

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's no video of anybody using one

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
of such cables of the one that I bought

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.219 
of such cables of the one that I bought
on<00:01:11.340> eBay<00:01:11.460> there's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.450> disclaimer<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.020> says

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
on eBay there's a disclaimer that says

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.899 
on eBay there's a disclaimer that says
it<00:01:13.470> doesn't<00:01:13.500> work<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.040> audio<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.400> video<00:01:14.610> is

it doesn't work for audio and video is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.780 
it doesn't work for audio and video is
charging<00:01:15.330> only<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> simple<00:01:17.400> pen<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
charging only this is a simple pen to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.460 
charging only this is a simple pen to
pin<00:01:18.030> pass<00:01:18.479> through<00:01:18.750> cable<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.439> has<00:01:20.250> no

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
pin pass through cable and has no

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.749 
pin pass through cable and has no
authorization<00:01:22.470> ship<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.250> anything<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.700> that

authorization ship or anything like that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.429 
authorization ship or anything like that
so<00:01:24.119> people<00:01:24.150> reporting<00:01:24.869> because<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
so people reporting because of that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.100 
so people reporting because of that
there's<00:01:26.100> no<00:01:26.280> way<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.670> work<00:01:26.880> well<00:01:27.479> simply

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
there's no way it can work well simply

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.569 
there's no way it can work well simply
the<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> works<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> signal<00:01:29.400> passes

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the way it works is the signal passes

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.179 
the way it works is the signal passes
through<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.030> cable<00:01:30.390> gets<00:01:31.170> decoded<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
through the cable gets decoded from the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.440 
through the cable gets decoded from the
adapter<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> from<00:01:33.240> there

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
adapter and from there

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.859 
adapter and from there
it<00:01:34.840> tells<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.380> phone<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.909> unit<00:01:37.299> it's<00:01:37.479> okay

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
it tells the phone or the unit it's okay

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.389 
it tells the phone or the unit it's okay
to<00:01:37.930> use<00:01:38.049> so<00:01:38.560> there's<00:01:38.770> there<00:01:39.039> should<00:01:39.280> be

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
to use so there's there should be

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.420 
to use so there's there should be
nothing<00:01:39.610> in<00:01:39.880> any<00:01:40.090> extension<00:01:40.689> cable<00:01:40.990> like<00:01:41.170> this

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
nothing in any extension cable like this

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.419 
nothing in any extension cable like this
that<00:01:42.430> would<00:01:42.579> render<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.679> incompatible<00:01:44.679> it's

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
that would render it incompatible it's

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.730 
that would render it incompatible it's
simply<00:01:45.789> just<00:01:45.820> passing<00:01:46.539> a<00:01:46.600> signal<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
simply just passing a signal to the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.859 
simply just passing a signal to the
adapter<00:01:48.250> just<00:01:48.939> as<00:01:49.060> if<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.360> adapter<00:01:49.719> was

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
adapter just as if the adapter was

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.179 
adapter just as if the adapter was
plugged<00:01:50.110> into<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.409> phone<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:50.770> that's<00:01:50.950> why<00:01:51.130> it

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
plugged into the phone so that's why it

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.660 
plugged into the phone so that's why it
does<00:01:51.520> work<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:53.170> anyway<00:01:53.530> I'm<00:01:54.340> going<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.579> go

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
does work so anyway I'm going to go

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.580

when exit out and we'll go to a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.500 
when exit out and we'll go to a
non-supported<00:02:39.160> app<00:02:39.310> here<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.850> am<00:02:40.090> using<00:02:40.270> at

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
non-supported app here so I am using at

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.510 
non-supported app here so I am using at
Radio<00:02:40.810> extensions

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.880

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.850 

all<00:02:53.400> right<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.760> clearly<00:02:54.500> extensive<00:02:55.500> cables<00:02:55.770> do

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
all right so clearly extensive cables do

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.140 
all right so clearly extensive cables do
work

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
work

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.520 
work
the<00:02:57.510> only<00:02:57.660> thing<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.930> would<00:02:57.990> say<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> people

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the only thing I would say to people

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.230 
the only thing I would say to people
that<00:02:59.070> are<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.430> are<00:02:59.550> claiming<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.030> it

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
that are that are claiming that it

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.220 
that are that are claiming that it
doesn't<00:03:00.540> work<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:04.020> all<00:03:04.080> these

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
doesn't work is you know all these

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.230 
doesn't work is you know all these
cables<00:03:04.440> are<00:03:04.680> made<00:03:04.830> in<00:03:04.980> China<00:03:05.060> there's<00:03:06.060> no

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
cables are made in China there's no

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.600 
cables are made in China there's no
brand<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:07.020> any<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.380> these<00:03:07.500> cables<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.430> there's

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
brand on any of these cables so there's

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.800 
brand on any of these cables so there's
no<00:03:08.850> company<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.750> really<00:03:11.330> have<00:03:12.330> any<00:03:12.540> kind<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
no company to really have any kind of

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.410 
no company to really have any kind of
reputation<00:03:13.080> behind<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.550> there<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.060> no<00:03:15.210> real

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
reputation behind so there is no real

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.870 
reputation behind so there is no real
quality<00:03:15.810> standard<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:17.490> could<00:03:17.700> buy<00:03:17.820> two

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
quality standard so you could buy two

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.550 
quality standard so you could buy two
cables<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:18.630> work<00:03:18.900> one<00:03:18.930> won't

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
cables one work one won't

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.260 
cables one work one won't
most<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.190> stuff<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:20.850> coming<00:03:20.910> out<00:03:21.240> of

China that's non Britain is absolutely

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.250 
China that's non Britain is absolutely
garbage<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:24.000> usually<00:03:24.420> recommend<00:03:24.660> against

worked and I've actually got this

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.250 
worked and I've actually got this
installed<00:03:43.890> into<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:46.910> pro<00:03:47.910> clips<00:03:48.209> USA<00:03:48.690> mount

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
connection quite a bit to get it to

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.180 
connection quite a bit to get it to
install<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.830> here<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.299> mean<00:03:57.510> I've

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190

another

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.080 

calls<00:04:04.120> for<00:04:04.420> error<00:04:04.629> if<00:04:04.989> you<00:04:05.290> will<00:04:05.500> by<00:04:06.280> taking

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
calls for error if you will by taking

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.270 
calls for error if you will by taking
the<00:04:07.209> connection<00:04:07.659> apart<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.260> doing<00:04:09.069> my<00:04:09.159> own

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
the connection apart and doing my own

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.020 
the connection apart and doing my own
little<00:04:09.579> little<00:04:10.269> home<00:04:10.540> insulation<00:04:11.260> here<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:13.000> I

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
little little home insulation here so I

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.089 
little little home insulation here so I
mean<00:04:13.209> I've<00:04:13.420> introduced<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.319> possibility<00:04:14.950> for

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
mean I've introduced the possibility for

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.819 
mean I've introduced the possibility for
failure<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.900> even<00:04:16.900> in<00:04:17.049> these<00:04:17.199> cheap<00:04:17.590> garbage

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
failure and even in these cheap garbage

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.719 
failure and even in these cheap garbage
cables<00:04:18.370> made<00:04:18.669> in<00:04:18.789> China<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.979> works<00:04:21.430> just<00:04:21.609> fine

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
cables made in China it works just fine

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.640 
cables made in China it works just fine
for<00:04:21.880> me<00:04:22.180> so<00:04:22.509> I<00:04:22.690> would<00:04:23.080> encourage<00:04:23.259> anybody
