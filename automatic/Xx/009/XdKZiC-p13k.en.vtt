00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.410
 You know my name is Maria. 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.030
 I own the blog of Maria and Maria 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.490
 facebook page things by maria 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.369
 Also this is the first video I made a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.770
 channel on youtube and to inaugurate 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.710
 I decided to do a quick tutorial 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.349
 about passing eyebrow pencils 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.329
 For those who do not know I was a reseller of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.880
 Avon natura the apothecary I stayed for 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.500
 time and over the years I 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.840
 I realized that the greatest fear of my 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.129
 customers was just passing through the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.750
 eyebrow pencil 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.789
 so I thought it would be a tutorial 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.399
 and I hope you like it 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.050
 help you too and I'm holding the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.370
 with my hand because I do not 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.199
 able to position in such a way that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.030
 stay close because if you stay 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.589
 in front of the mirror so I'll stay one 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.719
 a little shaking if you listen to the 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.609
 street noise is because the college that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.309
 is next to my house the staff 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.089
 is leaving now so you ignore in 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.219
 sta 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.400
 Dora just I've been lapse 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.340
 eyebrow in this from here and now I go 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.800
 show you how I did doing 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.550
 Here it is, okay, let's go. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.250
 It's an act that I'm going to use is brunetti da 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.070
 mary kay who is definitely one of the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.430
 best-selling eyebrow sides and 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.670
 According to him it is great eyebrow 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.800
 darker and they adapt various shades 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.300
 eyebrow so it looks natural 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 do not do that thing like that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.030
 It looks like you just passed a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.380
 and that's exactly what we want. 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.470
 Well, let's go then. 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 and I spent a little of this crime in the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.880
 face then it is who passes or knows that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 He ends up doing a little bit to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.130
 eyebrow she gets a little dirty then 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.080
 I'll get a clean swab and I'll go 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.950
 thus go over the eyebrow just to 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.590
 Take off your leaked cycle eyes are 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.300
 seeing as you know who you dirty is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.890
 when we go through dirty people 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.920
 cvt eyebrow that stays longer 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.920
 whitish that we want, right? 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.050
 so just look and cleared the advice not 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.989
 had so much affection 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.700
 this will need two things the lapse 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.010
 eyebrow is very important you 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.620
 pick up a tone similar to your lid 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.220
 because the lighter darker it gets ugly 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.870
 You can see that it's not legal and the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.459
 Small Bill eyebrow also that 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.069
 usually have these two sides 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.670
 one is this little school that is whenever I 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.680
 use and another is this noose comb here 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.890
 Come on, I 'll take pencils and make it 2-1 in 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.500
 low 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:03:01.069
 I apologize if transmit say 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:03:04.099
 my hand supported and one on top of us 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.010
 You do not need to color your eyebrow. 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.870
 sensible, it does not need to be just like this 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.010
 enough I'll show you yourselves then 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.630
 Then you come with the brush and foam 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.040
 The secret eyebrow folks is to vanish. 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.470
 equal agents a shadow being has to 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.260
 to beat the fatigue you have to smoke until 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.150
 tire the same thing with the eyebrow 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.630
 So did the dash you take the side of the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.750
 School and blur playing pencil to 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.750
 inside 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.500
 and here you play next, right? 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.459
 I have the beginning of the eyebrow one 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.530
 Bit of a failure, you see here. 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.140
 so I like to make a dash to you 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.590
 also to hide a little and not 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.799
 make a stroke so ii and smoke brings 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.799
 also 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.790
 frontin are seeing that already 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.060
 filled in saying that he was super 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.420
 Look, look, this is the same from here. 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.790
 end of eyebrow and back with pencil and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.920
 here's another dash a good game down 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.350
 The thinner I just make a dash over 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:30.480
 even though it is not happening who is more 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:35.450
 People ignore everything, it seems like you're coming back. 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.450
 with a vine brush and that too 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.190
 It took me years, people, to learn this. 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.940
 here being that it is such a simple thing 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.040
 It does not look any more then it's ready, look me 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.820
 I'm going to come and give birth to see you 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.710
 as it looks only the size it gives 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.020
 a sharper aspect for the 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.250
 eyebrow and it is filled but 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.530
 she was filled up in a way 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.220
 super natural and that's how I like it 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.020
 at least also 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.790
