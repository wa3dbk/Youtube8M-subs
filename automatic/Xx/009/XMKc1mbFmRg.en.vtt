definitely going on for a lot for

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.910 
definitely going on for a lot for
getting<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.020> lot<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.170> resources<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.649> your<00:01:23.770> way

getting a lot of resources in your way

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.109 
getting a lot of resources in your way
so<00:01:24.420> after<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.630> second<00:01:26.320> place<00:01:26.609> really<00:01:27.609> goes<00:01:27.909> to

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
so after the second place really goes to

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.940 
so after the second place really goes to
a<00:01:28.149> storage<00:01:28.509> ease<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.960> think<00:01:29.350> storages<00:01:29.829> are

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
a storage ease I think storages are

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.410 
a storage ease I think storages are
hugely<00:01:30.310> important<00:01:30.759> I<00:01:30.820> think<00:01:31.090> they're<00:01:31.210> really

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
hugely important I think they're really

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.020 
hugely important I think they're really
really<00:01:31.749> under<00:01:32.499> raid<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:33.429> can<00:01:33.579> only<00:01:33.700> get<00:01:33.880> your

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
really under raid you can only get your

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.660 
really under raid you can only get your
stories<00:01:34.390> up<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.810> certain<00:01:35.079> point<00:01:35.350> when<00:01:35.679> when

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
stories up to a certain point when when

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.849 
stories up to a certain point when when
you<00:01:36.759> get<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.969> the<00:01:37.060> point<00:01:37.380> when<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.409> when<00:01:38.619> I<00:01:38.649> was

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
you get to the point when I when I was

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.730 
you get to the point when I when I was
about<00:01:39.159> 10<00:01:39.549> maybe<00:01:40.390> level<00:01:40.780> 10<00:01:40.990> maybe<00:01:41.200> level

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
about 10 maybe level 10 maybe level

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.230 
about 10 maybe level 10 maybe level
between<00:01:42.130> level<00:01:42.520> 10<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.850> 20

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
between level 10 and 20

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.300 
between level 10 and 20
I<00:01:43.270> was<00:01:43.689> maxing<00:01:44.200> out<00:01:44.289> my<00:01:44.350> stories<00:01:44.859> all<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.100> time

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
I was maxing out my stories all the time

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.679 
I was maxing out my stories all the time
and<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.729> was<00:01:45.850> generating<00:01:46.329> a<00:01:46.359> lot<00:01:46.509> more

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
and I was generating a lot more

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.779 
and I was generating a lot more
resources<00:01:47.079> than<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.469> could<00:01:47.799> hold<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.670> was

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
resources than I could hold and it was

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.219 
resources than I could hold and it was
quite<00:01:48.939> annoying<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.749> I<00:01:49.810> was<00:01:49.929> getting<00:01:50.140> all

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
quite annoying that I was getting all

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.349 
quite annoying that I was getting all
these<00:01:50.380> resources<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.249> I<00:01:51.340> couldn't<00:01:51.609> actually

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
these resources and I couldn't actually

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.300 
these resources and I couldn't actually
I<00:01:52.569> was<00:01:53.229> just<00:01:53.350> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.619> waste<00:01:53.829> so<00:01:54.280> I

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
I was just going to waste so I

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.950 
I was just going to waste so I
definitely<00:01:54.850> recommend<00:01:55.149> upgrading<00:01:55.600> your

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
definitely recommend upgrading your

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
stories because there's nothing worse

to be fair my base is doing pretty well
the<00:02:38.480> moment<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.900> think<00:02:38.960> I<00:02:39.260> think<00:02:39.530> I'm<00:02:39.650> prey<00:02:39.980> I'm

the moment I think I think I'm prey I'm
quite<00:02:41.510> chuffed<00:02:42.230> with<00:02:42.350> my<00:02:42.620> base<00:02:42.830> at<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.070> moment

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
quite chuffed with my base at the moment

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.680 
quite chuffed with my base at the moment
I<00:02:43.490> think<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.000> don't<00:02:44.060> think<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.420> good

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
I think I don't think it's that good

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.360 
I think I don't think it's that good
it's<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:44.960> bad<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.320> whole<00:02:45.890> look<00:02:46.070> at<00:02:46.190> my

it's<00:03:01.730> not<00:03:01.820> that<00:03:01.880> important<00:03:02.570> it's<00:03:02.750> only<00:03:02.900> really

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380

good if you want a stones ice shards and
stuff<00:03:06.860> like<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.130> but<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.460> not<00:03:07.550> that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
stuff like that but it's not that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.690 
stuff like that but it's not that
important<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.900> M<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.830> gets<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.100> next<00:03:10.310> base<00:03:10.550> is

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
important so M the gets the next base is

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.730 
important so M the gets the next base is
actually<00:03:10.910> all<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.510> defense's<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.560> the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
actually all the defense's all the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.200 
actually all the defense's all the
defenses<00:03:13.460> get<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.150> spot<00:03:14.980> M<00:03:15.980> having<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.000> good

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
defenses get the spot M having a good

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.360 
defenses get the spot M having a good
base<00:03:17.450> belt<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.050> good<00:03:18.200> defenses<00:03:18.740> even<00:03:19.160> though

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
base belt and good defenses even though

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.130 
base belt and good defenses even though
it<00:03:19.670> might<00:03:19.820> not<00:03:19.880> when<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.270> attackee<00:03:20.570> actually

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
it might not when the attackee actually

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.500 
it might not when the attackee actually
scares<00:03:21.590> off<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.340> scare<00:03:22.670> off<00:03:22.820> Quayle<00:03:23.060> or<00:03:23.240> people

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
scares off to scare off Quayle or people

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.230 
scares off to scare off Quayle or people
which<00:03:23.690> means<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.080> stalls<00:03:24.380> more<00:03:24.620> time<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.940> then

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
which means it stalls more time and then

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.700 
which means it stalls more time and then
you<00:03:26.270> get<00:03:26.570> an<00:03:26.660> attacked<00:03:26.960> if<00:03:27.320> you're<00:03:27.560> just

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
you get an attacked if you're just

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.660 
you get an attacked if you're just
getting<00:03:27.830> attacked<00:03:28.100> all<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.370> time<00:03:28.550> because

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
getting attacked all the time because

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.490 
getting attacked all the time because
your<00:03:28.820> base<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.150> shet<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.780> know<00:03:30.020> there's<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.290> lot

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.150 
to get the radar level where you can get
the<00:04:28.910> doctor<00:04:29.630> terror<00:04:29.900> volcano<00:04:30.800> that's<00:04:31.070> the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
it's not it's not important at all and

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.390

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
obviously I'm not gonna come the HQ is

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.439 
obviously I'm not gonna come the HQ is
something<00:04:39.729> you<00:04:39.820> need<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:40.000> upgrade<00:04:40.150> because

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
something you need to upgrade because

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.000 
something you need to upgrade because
obviously<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.380> most<00:04:41.560> important

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
obviously it's the most important

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.890 
obviously it's the most important
upgrade<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.550> then<00:04:43.090> want<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.300> put<00:04:43.419> it's<00:04:43.540> my<00:04:43.630> first

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
upgrade I then want to put it's my first

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.530 
upgrade I then want to put it's my first
again<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.889> definitely<00:04:45.490> obviously<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.180> HQ<00:04:46.479> is

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
again so definitely obviously the HQ is

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.210 
again so definitely obviously the HQ is
the<00:04:46.600> most<00:04:46.780> important<00:04:47.199> because<00:04:47.320> it<00:04:47.500> doesn't

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
the most important because it doesn't

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.700 
the most important because it doesn't
vary<00:04:48.430> how<00:04:48.790> good<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.720> attacks<00:04:50.080> are<00:04:50.320> in<00:04:50.500> turn

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
vary how good the attacks are in turn

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.530 
vary how good the attacks are in turn
and<00:04:51.160> like<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.520> if<00:04:51.669> you<00:04:51.760> cannot<00:04:51.970> read<00:04:52.150> your<00:04:52.180> HP

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
and like that if you cannot read your HP

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.700 
and like that if you cannot read your HP
I<00:04:52.570> recommend<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.530> hundred<00:04:54.100> million<00:04:54.490> percent

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
I recommend a hundred million percent

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.320 
I recommend a hundred million percent
definitely<00:04:56.710> upgrade<00:04:56.949> your<00:04:57.070> HQ<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:58.120> hope<00:04:58.270> you

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
definitely upgrade your HQ so hope you

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.150
