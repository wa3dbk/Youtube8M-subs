00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi to all I make this video no 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.690
 how to start in a breeding of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.320
 crickets so with everything I have here 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.460
 so first of all you need a big ferry 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.250
 so of course with a lid that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:26.490
 therefore close with low vents 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:31.439
 high therefore there there there 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.129
 so here she is with a fence 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.700
 have only scrap metal wire mesh or 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.620
 plastic but we hang in fabric because 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.100
 that I had a pub eat it so c 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 passable of the most solid so everything 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 first I'll put so a box has 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.860
 so a support so with a hole there 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.049
 to be able to put the spawning box 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.260
 so will be better on putting a 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.260
 second 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:17.820
 eason the space so after I put the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.680
 account box so I made a tutorial 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.680
 how to account for box 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 nothing 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.890
 this is what a painting is cola 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.700
 wire mesh a slap of the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.700
 toasting a plastic 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.740
 so after that we will put cotton 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.960
 and here with 3 young I'll put 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.960
 in the corner 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.870
 so that's how it is so after we go 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.870
 unify 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.650
 So therefore that's the same in pons box 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.900
 so the egg box it has to she 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.710
 be changed twice a day 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.930
 it is more preferable 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:28.709
 the same cotton so that they are not 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:31.190
 iceq so after I put salad a 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.190
 everywhere 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:47.950
 between two men 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:03.879
 so I go out and side behind the sides 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.040
 so we can put neighborhoods 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:10.120
 of orange but then I do not have any more so I 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.190
 do not buy and soon glitter 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.980
 fish food also he likes 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:21.879
 well they love it so here it is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:27.879
 we see the shirt damage he can 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:31.120
 access to the bread box so here you go 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.519
 so also we can put rollers 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.180
 of empty toilet paper that I do not 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.790
 put but there I have more so here we go 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.510
 so now we will go down to 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.349
 put crickets in the box so 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.640
 but crickets they are there I rather 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.640
 not bad this game put the device 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.040
 so I have quite a lot but he 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.040
 redeem 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:25.480
 So here and everywhere 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.230
 so that's for breeding degree on 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.840
 ended in the next video 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.480
 I will show you my babies that I had 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.970
 from my first shipment that kita not 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.400
 very successful and also I will 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.710
 show an incubator so that I have 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.290
 homemade tutorial we will be over so 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.050
 this is just to show you a 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.490
 more facilities so in fact I have 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.040
 recovered because I work in 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.970
 that of butchery deli j 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.280
 occupied trays like that so a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.990
 like that and there that with the lid 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.280
 so I said disinfect and that's 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:09.910
 the galley have a little dirty it's normal and 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.110
 so with the cover removed covered 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.730
 who showed it so I have a nice make 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.440
 so from this south 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.300
 So there it shows the bottom or Gervais 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:25.960
 like that it's open so between two 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.300
 I put a fence to be able to ask 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.100
 the egg-laying box so it knows 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.540
 interior jean dimond silicone 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:39.190
 indoor outdoors as bastard 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:41.890
 so that's closing tightly and 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.460
 like that there's no heat or steam 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.860
 who without her leaving the box and 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.310
 I had a recover also a box 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.780
 so at my butcher's shop so 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.870
 to be able to put the eggs with the 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.060
 vermiculite exit so it was just for 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.900
 show you like that with the lid 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.280
