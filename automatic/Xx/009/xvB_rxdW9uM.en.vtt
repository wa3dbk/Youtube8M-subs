 on the radio or on TV with the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.290

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.310

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.799
 before his ascension 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.879
 my beloved amazon if you open the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.480

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.370
 the story of Jesus' ascension being 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.909
 therefore meeting them so questioned the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.159
 Sir, now is the time when 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:57.400
 restore royalty in israel that they 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.310
 believed that Jesus was the messiah who 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.190
 in fact they were more the game starts in 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.439
 Jewish view would be one that reigns 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.579
 hero who would install the kingdom of god 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.099
 in the land 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:14.019
 free the people of israel and jesus 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:17.319
 replied that it is not for the voice to know the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.859
 times and the moments that the father 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.250
 their own authority but receive 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.949
 a force of the spirit of God that 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.889
 it will come upon you and you will be my 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:35.260
 witnesses in Jerusalem throughout the 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:39.459
 Judea and to the ends of the earth 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.470
 these were the words of Jesus before 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:49.209
 to light or to rise and then says lucas 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:54.790
 narrates the sp 19 ante that said this was 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:57.849
 taken their sight there is a cloud and the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.190
 cloud the culture your eyes 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.069
 being looking closely at the sky 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.370
 when he went away two men dressed in 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.060
 white women were standing next to them and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.180
 said Galilean men because he is 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.790
 already there looking at the skies 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.989
 this Jesus who was raptured from among you 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.190
 to the sky 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.940
 so turn the same way as seen 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:32.230
 in part to heaven he also come back to 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:37.210
 Christmas is the last mission of Jesus 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:41.020
 among our here on earth to use I 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.720
 I appreciate your doubt, I would just like to 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.860
 remember that the sign gives you the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.890
 implantation of the kingdom jesus in a kingdom 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.780
 material is a spiritual kingdom which 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.290
 according to Jesus promised that he would receive 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.340
 a spiritual world force as it is 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.680
 in acts 18 and that of this force and seriousness 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.920
 about them 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.130
 they would be witnesses of Jesus in 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:14.020
 the foundation of the first 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:18.430
 Christian community in Jerusalem and in all 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.070
 Judea and Samaria and to the ends of 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.950
 earth and if this information of jesus 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.190
 really it happened because formed to 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.460
 great community in jerusalem that 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.090
 then extended to Maria 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:37.300
 mainly carried by the apostle 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.220
 Philip is not the disciple is the apostle 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.970
 the one that was chosen together with 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.410
 they were to be deacons and felipe 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.060
 was to preach in Samaria because the other 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.960
 Filipe said cipullo 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:58.750
 he went to a city in Hierapolis 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:01.660
 there near pamukkale lauricea there 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:05.560
 asia minor and the law he came with the children 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.480
 and the law was martyred and today there 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.900
 and it was the police 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.730
 The monument is beautiful to the king of 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.550
 Felipe and his sons 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.520
 This is what I'm talking about, what I'm betting on. 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.630
 who went to preach in Samaria and then 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:28.180
 the ends of the earth that is this question 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:31.000
 was held by paulo o joão tobar 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:35.310
 nabé and all those joão Marcos 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.050
 those who became disciples became 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.200
 in apostles and those who were not 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.980
 disciples like barnabé with joão Marcos 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.940
 and lucas paulo that ended up 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.630
 transforming 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.540
 in great apostles to spread the word 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.760
 message of jesus in asia minor 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.160
 Thank you rosangela and this one is 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.240

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.170
 of jesus before ascending to the heavens 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:10.420
 when it is narrated in acts a verse 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:13.570
 8 to 1 sorry 6 to 8 did not leave there because 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.790

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.330
