00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
and I've put this on there I run I put

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.820 
and I've put this on there I run I put
the<00:00:03.330> screws<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.629> there<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.410> just<00:00:04.589> run

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
the screws in there and you just run

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.210 
the screws in there and you just run
them<00:00:04.980> up<00:00:05.100> like<00:00:05.310> that<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:06.620> see<00:00:07.620> how<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:07.980> will

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
them up like that and see how this will

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:21.590 
them up like that and see how this will
lose<00:00:08.460> out<00:00:08.960> when<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.080> tighten<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.469> up<00:00:20.390> now<00:00:21.390> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
lose out when you tighten it up now that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
lose out when you tighten it up now that
it<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.810> there<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> bottom<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> three

that has to be perfect because you have

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.830 
that has to be perfect because you have
bearings

might<00:02:19.300> be<00:02:19.420> 60<00:02:19.840> pounds<00:02:20.140> 80<00:02:20.319> pounds<00:02:20.650> they<00:02:20.739> could

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
might be 60 pounds 80 pounds they could

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
be a hundred bins on engines and that

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.320 
be a hundred bins on engines and that
has<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.160> be<00:02:24.310> talked<00:02:24.910> up<00:02:25.090> really<00:02:25.390> well<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:28.180> they

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
has to be talked up really well but they

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.960 
has to be talked up really well but they
do<00:02:28.390> work<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:30.010> quick<00:02:30.220> ones<00:02:30.459> just<00:02:30.610> make<00:02:30.819> it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
do work and the quick ones just make it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.250 
do work and the quick ones just make it
easier<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.510> don't<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.959> look<00:02:32.080> at<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
easier and you don't have to look at a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.140 
easier and you don't have to look at a
gauge<00:02:32.530> all<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.129> do<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.430> listen<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.940> them<00:02:34.060> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
gauge all you do is listen for them to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.720 
gauge all you do is listen for them to
click<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:35.560> see<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.980> lot<00:02:36.160> easier<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.670> use

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
click but see it's a lot easier to use

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.390 
click but see it's a lot easier to use
this<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.330> only<00:02:37.480> do<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.930> 10<00:02:38.170> pounds<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:39.250> was

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
this to only do it 10 pounds like I was

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.140 
this to only do it 10 pounds like I was
saying<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.790> could<00:02:40.000> change<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.420> clicker<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.730> 16

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
saying I could change the clicker to 16

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.539 
saying I could change the clicker to 16
pounds<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.629> 17<00:02:44.019> pounds<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.440> 18<00:02:44.709> pounds<00:02:45.099> what

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
pounds and 17 pounds and 18 pounds what

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.120 
pounds and 17 pounds and 18 pounds what
I<00:02:45.580> did<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.420> used<00:02:47.019> this<00:02:47.260> one<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.739> did

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
I did is I just used this one and did

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.259 
I did is I just used this one and did
them<00:02:48.250> all<00:02:48.370> at<00:02:48.610> 15<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:50.340> once<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.519> showed<00:02:51.730> 15<00:02:52.239> I

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
them all at 15 and once it showed 15 I

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.400 
them all at 15 and once it showed 15 I
went<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.810> next<00:02:53.079> one

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
went to the next one

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.620 
went to the next one
did<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.920> whole<00:02:54.099> pattern<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.819> eight<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.209> then

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
did the whole pattern of eight and then

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.940 
did the whole pattern of eight and then
I<00:02:55.750> put<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.049> clicker<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.650> because<00:02:56.920> I

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
I put the clicker on it because I

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.350 
I put the clicker on it because I
wouldn't<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.489> turn<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.849> more<00:02:58.000> than<00:02:58.209> maybe

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
wouldn't have to turn it more than maybe

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.150 
wouldn't have to turn it more than maybe
a<00:02:58.660> half<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.349> three<00:02:59.530> quarters<00:02:59.829> of<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.010> turn

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
a half to three quarters of a turn

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.220 
a half to three quarters of a turn
before<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.640> will<00:03:00.760> click<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:01.989> quicker

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
before you will click it's just quicker

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.680 
before you will click it's just quicker
than<00:03:03.040> having<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.670> reset<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> clicker<00:03:04.480> each

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
than having to reset the clicker each

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.619 
than having to reset the clicker each
time<00:03:07.260> after<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.410> our<00:03:08.620> teeth<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.819> gasket
