however<00:00:24.750> every<00:00:25.350> time<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> tried<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.949> join<00:00:26.340> one

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.139 
of these I got an error that said they
were<00:00:29.010> already<00:00:29.550> full<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.859> maybe<00:00:31.969> because<00:00:32.969> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
were already full so maybe because it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.319 
were already full so maybe because it's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
gave me two guys I assumed it was a four

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.000 
gave me two guys I assumed it was a four
player<00:00:52.379> mission<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.329> yep<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.570> only<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
player mission but yep I only got two a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.029 
player mission but yep I only got two a
eyes<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:59.750> do<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> controller<00:01:01.710> layout

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
eyes so I do like the controller layout

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
eyes so I do like the controller layout
it's<00:01:02.579> similar<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> black<00:01:03.420> ops<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.170> play

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it's similar to black ops and I do play

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's similar to black ops and I do play
a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.090> nice

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
a lot of that so that was nice

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.250 
a lot of that so that was nice
you<00:01:07.470> can't<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.890> prone<00:01:08.479> however<00:01:09.479> crouching

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you can't go prone however crouching

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.830 
you can't go prone however crouching
seems<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.799> prevent<00:01:11.220> most<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> enemies

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
seems to prevent most of the enemies

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.940 
seems to prevent most of the enemies
from<00:01:12.869> being<00:01:13.380> able<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.920> hit<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.200> hip<00:01:16.200> firing<00:01:16.530> is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
from being able to hit you hip firing is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.590 
from being able to hit you hip firing is
it's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:18.000> weird<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
it's a little weird and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.200 
it's a little weird and
it's<00:01:20.140> actually<00:01:20.620> I<00:01:20.920> think<00:01:21.040> better<00:01:21.520> than<00:01:21.640> aiming

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
it's actually I think better than aiming

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.810 
it's actually I think better than aiming
down<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.390> sights<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:24.100> when<00:01:24.280> I'm<00:01:24.400> when

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
down the sights because when I'm when

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.280 
down the sights because when I'm when
I'm<00:01:24.970> aiming<00:01:25.270> down<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.540> sights<00:01:25.900> unless

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
I'm aiming down the sights unless

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.750 
I'm aiming down the sights unless
they're<00:01:26.560> pretty<00:01:26.770> close

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
they're pretty close

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.620 
they're pretty close
it's<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.990> recoil<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.410> awful<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.940> pain

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
it's the recoil is awful and the pain

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.530 
it's the recoil is awful and the pain
just<00:01:32.080> goes<00:01:32.320> straight<00:01:32.680> up<00:01:32.740> in<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:32.979> air<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.580> it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
just goes straight up in the air and it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.900 
just goes straight up in the air and it
is<00:01:34.570> extremely<00:01:35.440> difficult<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:36.010> stay<00:01:36.400> on<00:01:36.610> target

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
is extremely difficult to stay on target

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.670 
is extremely difficult to stay on target
like<00:01:37.240> this<00:01:37.420> guy<00:01:37.600> right<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.080> had<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.440> kind

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
like this guy right here I had to kind

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.440 
like this guy right here I had to kind
of<00:01:38.940> tap<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.300> trigger<00:01:40.660> to<00:01:41.050> keep<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.530> even<00:01:42.190> that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
of tap the trigger to keep it even that

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.719 
of tap the trigger to keep it even that
you<00:01:43.450> know<00:01:43.600> one<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.710> target<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.190> mean<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.490> was

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
you know one the target I mean it was

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.530 
you know one the target I mean it was
it's<00:01:46.660> pretty<00:01:47.050> bad<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:48.160> guess<00:01:48.940> over<00:01:49.300> time

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
it's pretty bad but I guess over time

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.570 
it's pretty bad but I guess over time
you<00:01:49.780> kind<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:50.170> learn<00:01:50.350> how<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.800> manage<00:01:51.369> the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
you kind of learn how to manage the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.460 
you kind of learn how to manage the
recoil<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.270> guns<00:01:52.539> like<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:53.050> did<00:01:53.259> get

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
recoil and the guns like I did get

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.200 
recoil and the guns like I did get
better<00:01:53.649> even<00:01:54.160> in<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.399> two<00:01:54.580> hours<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:54.970> I've

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
better even in the two hours that I've

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.389 
better even in the two hours that I've
played<00:01:56.190> but<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:58.180> don't<00:01:58.570> know<00:01:58.890> there's<00:01:59.890> there's

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
played but I don't know there's there's

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.460 
played but I don't know there's there's
no<00:02:00.759> knifing<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.479> game<00:02:01.660> however<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.289> can

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
no knifing in the game however you can

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.310 
no knifing in the game however you can
kind<00:02:02.800> of<00:02:02.890> bash<00:02:03.250> them<00:02:03.610> with<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.780> end<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.110> your

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
kind of bash them with the end of your

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.060 
kind of bash them with the end of your
weapon<00:02:05.830> which<00:02:06.039> I<00:02:06.220> guess<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.670> good<00:02:07.300> for<00:02:07.539> Mellie

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
weapon which I guess is good for Mellie

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.520 
weapon which I guess is good for Mellie
but<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.310> only<00:02:09.670> did<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.090> few<00:02:10.300> times<00:02:10.509> within<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
but I only did it a few times within the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.509 
but I only did it a few times within the
