screwdriver<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.540> once<00:02:00.689> they're<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.110> removed

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
screwdriver so once they're all removed

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.740 
screwdriver so once they're all removed
there's<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.549> cap<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.659> your

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
there's a little cap here for your

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.719 
there's a little cap here for your
finger<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.590> get<00:02:04.740> into<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.490> as

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
finger so you just get into there and as

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.390 
finger so you just get into there and as
you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.270> pulls<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.869> quite

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
you can see it just pulls out quite

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.500 
you can see it just pulls out quite
easy<00:02:09.160> now<00:02:10.160> here<00:02:10.430> we've<00:02:10.640> got<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.970> hard<00:02:11.180> drive

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
easy now here we've got the hard drive

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.120 
easy now here we've got the hard drive
the<00:02:12.350> Wi-Fi<00:02:12.710> module<00:02:12.920> BIOS<00:02:13.700> battery<00:02:14.270> memory<00:02:15.200> CPU

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
the Wi-Fi module BIOS battery memory CPU

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.060 
the Wi-Fi module BIOS battery memory CPU
and<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:17.450> looks<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.260> video<00:02:19.660> chip

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
and that looks like it's the video chip

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.670 
and that looks like it's the video chip
so<00:02:22.070> first<00:02:22.520> up<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:23.810> we've<00:02:24.080> got<00:02:24.230> memory

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
so first up here we've got memory

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.620 
so first up here we've got memory
there's<00:02:24.950> two<00:02:25.190> slots<00:02:25.520> this<00:02:26.000> one's<00:02:26.210> only<00:02:26.390> got

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
there's two slots this one's only got

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.450 
there's two slots this one's only got
one<00:02:26.810> slot<00:02:27.110> year<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.710> can<00:02:27.860> put<00:02:28.040> another

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
one slot year so you can put another

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.640 
one slot year so you can put another
memory<00:02:28.820> chip<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.420> top<00:02:29.630> one<00:02:29.840> but<00:02:30.440> if<00:02:30.530> you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
memory chip in the top one but if you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.560 
memory chip in the top one but if you
want<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.890> remove<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.430> one<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:31.970> too<00:02:32.210> little

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
want to remove this one it's too little

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.320 
want to remove this one it's too little
silver<00:02:33.020> clips<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:34.310> sides<00:02:34.580> just<00:02:35.000> pull<00:02:35.210> them

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
silver clips on the sides just pull them

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.880 
silver clips on the sides just pull them
out<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.780> you'll<00:02:35.990> see<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.260> memory<00:02:36.530> module

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
out and you'll see the memory module

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.530 
out and you'll see the memory module
it'll<00:02:37.010> pop<00:02:37.190> up<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:37.910> can<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.270> pull

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
it'll pop up and then you can just pull

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.780 
it'll pop up and then you can just pull
it<00:02:38.570> out<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.590> put<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:39.830> back<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.190> just<00:02:40.220> reverse

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
it out to put it back in just reverse

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.510 
it out to put it back in just reverse
what<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.240> did<00:02:41.420> there<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:42.230> slide<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:42.830> make

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
what we did there just slide it in make

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.760 
what we did there just slide it in make
sure<00:02:43.550> you've<00:02:43.910> got<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.209> little<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:45.020> suppose

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
sure you've got the little I suppose

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.220 
sure you've got the little I suppose
little<00:02:46.220> hole<00:02:46.459> divider<00:02:47.450> there<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.020> right

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230

spot<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:49.730> slides<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:50.600> you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
spot so it just slides in and then you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.440 
spot so it just slides in and then you
can<00:02:51.260> clip<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> down<00:02:51.890> don't<00:02:52.610> try<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:52.940> force<00:02:53.209> it

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
can clip it down don't try and force it

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.150 
can clip it down don't try and force it
in<00:02:53.570> if<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.870> try<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.230> force<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.680> just<00:02:54.709> make<00:02:55.010> sure

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
in if you try to force it just make sure
