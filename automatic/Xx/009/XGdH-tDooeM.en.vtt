00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello, I 'm glad you're back 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.429
 I am nicole 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.469
 from nicoles zuckerberg in my 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.660
 Today's video I show you like me 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.299
 producing a lovely christin mass 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.230
 because this mass is ideal for something 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.810
 larger pies figures for decoration elements 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 So you just do not fondant that much 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 This mass must be used 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.170
 you can be very beautiful as a body 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.149
 use for a figure or for a 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.730
 decor element and can this then 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.719
 of course dress up with fondant and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.480
 decorate 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.660
 I have them among others me 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.700
 made and topped with it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.250
 made of it and have on this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.559
 pies so my minion a mini and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.550
 places on it so that this 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.699
 I will also be a little bit higher 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.590
 I have chocolate now for my mass 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.809
 Christie's taken it for whatever reason 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.239
 I get ripped frisbees here with us 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.760
 worth buying but you can 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.280
 just as easy of course 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.860
 even chocolate chris to forget as well 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.810
 I show you here in this video 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 you need 125 grams of marshmallows 100 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 gram rice christie's and a small one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.770
 we will start with little water first 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.619
 by melting the marshmallows 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.900
 We also add the water here and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.549
 Give the marshmallows for 30 seconds 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 in the microwave 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.960
 that's how it looked to me after the first one 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.630
 30 seconds off then the whole thing 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.729
 stirred and comes a second time in the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.590
 microwave 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.600
 you do all this until the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.960
 marshmallows now properly melted 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.570
 are 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.939
 after the second time they are not 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.240
 so it has to melt with me 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.240
 a third time in the microwave 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.000
 the third time you looked like that when 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.250
 I stir that now also disintegrate 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.950
 the last marshmallows and so is the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.120
 then perfect mass and can to the rice 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.120
 Christie's be stirred 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.980
 please listen to it with one 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.520
 spoon under the marshmallow mass in the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.740
 first moment is still relatively hot 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.540
 if the whole thing is too soft give her 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.150
 Just a few rice christie's 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.250
 as soon as you do that now 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.310
 you have already been able to stir 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.540
 with the shaping of your foundation of yours 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.410
 begin figure 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.140
 I'll make a cake dummy out of it 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.630
 I'll take a bug frame 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.880
 would have been really good with palms soft 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.290
 one so that we the mass later not on 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.290
 bug frame sticking remains 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.110
 in the meantime that's 23 now 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.120
 minutes that have passed now is the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.280
 brazen massa already a bit 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.930
 cooled and you can easily 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.690
 touch with your hands 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.530
 You often give yourself plenty of palmes 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.450
 in the hands 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.459
 the whole thing is really a lot 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.769
 very sticky matter 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.050
 I'm going to press this whole thing in mine now 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.410
 cake frame you can now from it 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.840
 your basic form your figure work out 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.300
 as you of course for your pies 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.130
 Dekko needs the whole then must for 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.230
 a few hours on the side 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.739
 will be depending how big as thick 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 figure is so beautiful 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.010
 can harden if the whole 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.319
 Of course you can cure that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.760
 even with a knife forward 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.760
 and after carving
