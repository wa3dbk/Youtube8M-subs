getting through his radiant through his
progressions<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.420> think<00:00:15.690> having<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.350> plan<00:00:16.560> when

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
progressions I think having a plan when

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.290 
progressions I think having a plan when
the<00:00:16.830> ball<00:00:16.980> snapped<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.760> snapping<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the ball snapped not just snapping and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.120 
the ball snapped not just snapping and
then<00:00:18.510> figuring<00:00:18.869> out<00:00:19.020> what<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> he's

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
then figuring out what to do and he's

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.710 
then figuring out what to do and he's
made<00:00:20.340> strides<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.970> still<00:00:21.240> got<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> long<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
made strides and still got a long way to

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.090 
made strides and still got a long way to
go<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.170> made<00:00:22.380> strides<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.949> that's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
go but made strides so that's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.009 
go but made strides so that's
encouraging<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.820> keep<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.630> progress

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
encouraging if we keep that progress

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.439 
encouraging if we keep that progress
going<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.580> him<00:00:26.760> angling<00:00:27.210> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
everything I don't know if you could

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.610 
everything I don't know if you could
just<00:02:51.040> point<00:02:51.459> out<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:51.790> area<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:53.290> know<00:02:53.410> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
just point out one area and you know the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.590 
just point out one area and you know the
crate<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.430> mean<00:02:54.610> they're<00:02:54.730> top<00:02:54.910> ten<00:02:55.090> everything

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
crate I mean they're top ten everything

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.510 
crate I mean they're top ten everything
every<00:02:56.020> statistical<00:02:56.470> category<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.160> then<00:02:57.310> I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
every statistical category and then I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.970 
every statistical category and then I
guess<00:02:57.820> they<00:02:58.690> only<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.930> one<00:02:59.140> senior<00:02:59.530> starting

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
guess they only have one senior starting

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.030 
guess they only have one senior starting
which<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.400> pretty<00:03:00.940> amazing<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.890> thing

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
which is pretty amazing and the thing

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.920 
which is pretty amazing and the thing
that<00:03:03.100> jumps<00:03:03.459> out<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.910> effort<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.750> one

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
that jumps out is the effort it's one

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.270 
that jumps out is the effort it's one
thing<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.080> have<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.470> type<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.680> talent<00:03:05.980> and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
thing to have that type of talent and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.610 
thing to have that type of talent and

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
around and watch him run I mean they

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.480 
around and watch him run I mean they
they're<00:04:38.409> moving<00:04:38.740> their<00:04:38.860> feet<00:04:38.889> and<00:04:39.310> and

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
they're moving their feet and and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.339 
they're moving their feet and and
getting<00:04:40.060> blocks<00:04:40.300> continuing<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.930> block<00:04:41.139> with

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
getting blocks continuing to block with

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.260 
getting blocks continuing to block with
him<00:04:41.500> running<00:04:41.650> around<00:04:41.889> back<00:04:42.280> there<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.940> think

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
him running around back there so I think

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.600 
him running around back there so I think
to<00:04:44.050> go<00:04:44.199> from<00:04:44.409> how<00:04:44.650> they<00:04:44.680> block<00:04:45.010> last<00:04:45.280> year<00:04:45.520> to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
to go from how they block last year to

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.490 
to go from how they block last year to
this<00:04:45.639> year<00:04:45.789> with<00:04:46.060> him<00:04:46.210> back<00:04:46.389> there<00:04:46.599> and<00:04:47.380> the

the<00:05:54.690> best<00:05:54.960> player<00:05:55.080> when<00:05:55.440> he<00:05:55.590> goes<00:05:55.800> out<00:05:55.920> on<00:05:56.040> the

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
the best player when he goes out on the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.350 
the best player when he goes out on the
field<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.550> he's<00:05:56.640> going<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:56.820> act<00:05:57.000> like<00:05:57.120> he's

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360
