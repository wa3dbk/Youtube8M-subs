defragmenting<00:00:00.870> your<00:00:00.930> hard<00:00:01.290> drive<00:00:01.530> it's<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> lot

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
defragmenting your hard drive it's a lot

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.500 
defragmenting your hard drive it's a lot
like<00:00:02.100> changing<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.639> oil<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:02.970> your<00:00:03.000> sedan

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
like changing the oil in your sedan

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.510 
like changing the oil in your sedan
something<00:00:04.049> everyone<00:00:04.560> has<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.950> do<00:00:05.069> regularly

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
something everyone has to do regularly

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.000 
something everyone has to do regularly
but<00:00:05.790> it's<00:00:05.970> an<00:00:06.270> exciting<00:00:07.020> inconvenient<00:00:07.799> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
but it's an exciting inconvenient and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.700 
but it's an exciting inconvenient and
therefore<00:00:08.490> very<00:00:09.000> easy<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.510> put<00:00:09.690> off<00:00:09.840> at<00:00:10.469> least

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
therefore very easy to put off at least

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
therefore very easy to put off at least
with<00:00:10.920> oil<00:00:11.250> though<00:00:11.580> most<00:00:11.880> people<00:00:12.030> understand

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
with oil though most people understand

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.810 
with oil though most people understand
the<00:00:12.929> purpose<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.710> Windows<00:00:14.280> doesn't<00:00:14.700> really

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the purpose but Windows doesn't really

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.480 
the purpose but Windows doesn't really
tell<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.450> much<00:00:15.630> about<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:16.490> defragmentation

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
tell you much about what defragmentation

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.150 
tell you much about what defragmentation
actually<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.390> other<00:00:18.869> than<00:00:19.320> some<00:00:19.619> vague

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
actually is other than some vague

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.920 
actually is other than some vague
statement<00:00:20.760> about<00:00:20.880> how<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.210> makes<00:00:21.359> your<00:00:21.570> drives

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
statement about how it makes your drives

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.740 
statement about how it makes your drives
faster<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.130> exactly<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> reason

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
faster so what exactly is it the reason

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720 
faster so what exactly is it the reason
that<00:00:24.900> disk<00:00:25.140> defragmentation<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> thing<00:00:26.490> is

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
that disk defragmentation is a thing is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.759 
that disk defragmentation is a thing is
because<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> mechanical<00:00:28.529> hard

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
because of the way a mechanical hard

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.250 
because of the way a mechanical hard
drive<00:00:29.010> stores<00:00:29.490> data<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.779> hard<00:00:31.019> drive

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
drive stores data think of a hard drive

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.620 
drive stores data think of a hard drive
as<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.430> long<00:00:32.969> sheet<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> paper

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
as a really really long sheet of paper

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.540 
as a really really long sheet of paper
when<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.590> install<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.280> operating

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
when you first install your operating

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.910 
when you first install your operating
system<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.210> put<00:00:36.510> things<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:36.960> everything

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
system and put things on it everything

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.979 
system and put things on it everything
is<00:00:38.040> stored<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.430> basically<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.059> straight<00:00:39.719> line

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
is stored in basically a straight line

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.660 
is stored in basically a straight line
starting<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> top<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> working<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.640> way

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
starting at the top and working your way

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.600 
starting at the top and working your way
down<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:43.170> time<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.770> course<00:00:44.100> you'll

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
down but over time of course you'll

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
down but over time of course you'll
start<00:00:44.910> changing<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.539> deleting<00:00:45.570> files<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
start changing or deleting files and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.279 
start changing or deleting files and
adding<00:00:47.309> new<00:00:47.340> ones<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.149> suppose<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
adding new ones so suppose one of the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.380 
adding new ones so suppose one of the
files<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.710> delete<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.190> located<00:00:51.000> closer<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
files you delete is located closer to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.060 
files you delete is located closer to
the<00:00:51.629> top<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> sheet<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> paper<00:00:52.500> say<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the top of the sheet of paper say you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.189 
the top of the sheet of paper say you
don't<00:00:53.190> want<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> play<00:00:53.610> minesweeper<00:00:54.199> anymore

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
don't want to play minesweeper anymore

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
don't want to play minesweeper anymore
now<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.340> some<00:00:56.670> free<00:00:56.910> space<00:00:57.059> there

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
now you have some free space there

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.029 
now you have some free space there
that's<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> middle<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> bunch<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that's right in the middle of a bunch of

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
that's right in the middle of a bunch of
other<00:00:59.250> data<00:00:59.489> instead<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> being<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> very

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
other data instead of being at the very

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
other data instead of being at the very
end<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.500> was<00:01:01.649> when<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.250> started

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
end like it was when you first started

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520 
end like it was when you first started
using<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:03.059> hard<00:01:03.210> drive<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:03.960> happens<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
using your hard drive so what happens to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
using your hard drive so what happens to
this<00:01:04.650> free<00:01:04.949> space<00:01:05.280> well<00:01:05.549> suppose<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.390> put

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this free space well suppose you put

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.570 
this free space well suppose you put
another<00:01:06.840> relatively<00:01:07.619> large<00:01:07.890> file<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.490> your

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
another relatively large file on your

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
another relatively large file on your
hard<00:01:08.640> drive<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.150> maybe<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> filmed<00:01:10.260> speech

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
hard drive like maybe a filmed speech

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
hard drive like maybe a filmed speech
about<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:11.040> much<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> love<00:01:11.520> gave<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.030> or

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
about how much you love gave in or

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
about how much you love gave in or
whatever<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:12.990> into<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:13.920> computer

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
whatever you're into but your computer

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
whatever you're into but your computer
will<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.670> it'll<00:01:14.820> place<00:01:15.000> part<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
will do is it'll place part of that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920 
will do is it'll place part of that
large<00:01:16.590> file<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.600> minesweeper<00:01:18.600> free

explained in this video by the way ahead
of<00:03:30.450> time<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.470> SSD<00:03:31.859> can<00:03:32.069> write<00:03:32.250> new

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
of time so the SSD can write new

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.250 
of time so the SSD can write new
information<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.209> those<00:03:33.329> cells<00:03:33.629> much<00:03:34.019> more

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
information to those cells much more

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.650 
information to those cells much more
quickly<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.769> future<00:03:35.099> trim<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.940> usually

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
quickly in the future trim is usually

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.240 
quickly in the future trim is usually
handled<00:03:36.989> automatically<00:03:37.410> by<00:03:37.620> windows<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
handled automatically by windows so you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.619 
handled automatically by windows so you
don't<00:03:38.430> need<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.639> do<00:03:38.760> much<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.030> keep<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.480> running
