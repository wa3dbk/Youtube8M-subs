difficult<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.620> mean<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.010> last<00:02:12.190> one

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
difficult is that I mean the last one

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.920 
difficult is that I mean the last one
when<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.730> adjusted<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.360> time<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.720> line

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
when we adjusted the time of the line

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
when we adjusted the time of the line
yeah<00:02:14.410> it's<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.860> difficult<00:02:15.400> they've<00:02:15.490> done

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
yeah it's so difficult they've done

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.040 
yeah it's so difficult they've done
studies<00:02:15.820> like<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.270> using<00:02:16.480> computer

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
studies like this using computer

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.360 
studies like this using computer
simulations<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.950> watch<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.250> on<00:02:18.280> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
simulations so you watch it on a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.680 
simulations so you watch it on a
computer<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:18.970> have<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.270> say<00:02:19.420> where<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
computer and just have to say where the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.480 
computer and just have to say where the
balls<00:02:19.870> going<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.410> from<00:02:20.800> them<00:02:21.010> they<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.370> see

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
balls going and from them they can see

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.190 
balls going and from them they can see
that<00:02:21.640> elite<00:02:21.910> athletes<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.810> tell<00:02:22.990> much

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
that elite athletes can tell much

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.990 
that elite athletes can tell much
earlier<00:02:23.590> where<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.890> balls<00:02:24.070> coming<00:02:24.310> from<00:02:24.580> but

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
earlier where the balls coming from but

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.580 
earlier where the balls coming from but
to<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.360> actually<00:02:25.690> produce<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.110> physical

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
to have to actually produce a physical

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.320 
to have to actually produce a physical
response<00:02:26.980> when<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> ball<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.670> flying<00:02:27.820> at<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
response when a ball is flying at you

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.900 
response when a ball is flying at you
then<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.350> really<00:02:29.950> good<00:02:30.100> skills<00:02:30.370> amazing

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
then it's really good skills amazing

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.090 
then it's really good skills amazing
it's<00:02:31.480> not<00:02:31.600> my<00:02:31.750> on<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:31.989> ledge<00:02:32.260> thank<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.800> I'm

face it wondering would that's my worst

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.870 
face it wondering would that's my worst
fear<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:38.320> test<00:02:38.620> proves<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.220> manova<00:02:39.670> can

fear the test proves that manova can

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.620 
fear the test proves that manova can
perform<00:02:40.300> an<00:02:40.570> almost<00:02:40.959> impossible<00:02:41.620> task<00:02:42.450> he<00:02:43.450> can

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
perform an almost impossible task he can

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.810 
perform an almost impossible task he can
make<00:02:43.810> decisions<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.590> quickly<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.280> with

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
make decisions this quickly and with

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.000 
make decisions this quickly and with
such<00:02:46.120> little<00:02:46.330> information<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:47.020> go<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.440> because

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
such little information to go on because

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.250 
such little information to go on because
in<00:02:48.370> his<00:02:48.519> subconscious<00:02:49.030> he's<00:02:49.510> an<00:02:49.660> expert<00:02:50.050> in

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
in his subconscious he's an expert in

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.370 
in his subconscious he's an expert in
the<00:02:50.380> science<00:02:50.590> involved<00:02:51.989> Reynaldo<00:02:52.989> can<00:02:53.170> tap

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the science involved Reynaldo can tap

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.199 
the science involved Reynaldo can tap
into<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.680> knowledge<00:02:53.800> tap<00:02:54.640> into<00:02:54.940> his<00:02:55.030> memory

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
into that knowledge tap into his memory

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.600 
into that knowledge tap into his memory
banks<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.840> he<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.650> then<00:02:56.769> use<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.310> help

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
banks and he can then use that to help

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.610 
banks and he can then use that to help
him<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.360> what<00:02:58.510> you're<00:02:58.660> saying<00:02:58.870> despite<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
him so what you're saying despite the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.750 
him so what you're saying despite the
location<00:03:00.130> because<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> first<00:03:00.519> time

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
location because it's the first time

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.090 
location because it's the first time
being<00:03:01.000> here<00:03:01.299> he's<00:03:01.930> still<00:03:02.320> recalling<00:03:02.950> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
being here he's still recalling the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.949 
being here he's still recalling the
pictures<00:03:03.489> what<00:03:03.670> he's<00:03:03.820> done<00:03:04.000> previous<00:03:04.510> before

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
pictures what he's done previous before

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.320 
pictures what he's done previous before
another<00:03:05.950> location<00:03:06.310> maybe<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.730> matches<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.239> in

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
another location maybe a matches in in

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.300 
another location maybe a matches in in
training<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.870> he's<00:03:08.290> recalling<00:03:08.709> all<00:03:09.100> those

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
training and he's recalling all those

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.190 
training and he's recalling all those
messages<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.880> then<00:03:10.120> his<00:03:10.239> brains<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:10.720> this

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
messages and then his brains then this

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.960 
messages and then his brains then this
is<00:03:11.380> execution<00:03:11.860> exactly<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.579> that's<00:03:12.700> kind<00:03:12.910> of

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
is execution exactly and that's kind of

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.310 
is execution exactly and that's kind of
the<00:03:13.060> whole<00:03:13.180> point<00:03:13.360> of<00:03:13.480> people<00:03:13.780> training<00:03:14.049> even

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
the whole point of people training even

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.449 
the whole point of people training even
though<00:03:14.500> they<00:03:14.620> can't<00:03:14.860> train<00:03:15.100> in<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.280> match

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
though they can't train in a match

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.860 
though they can't train in a match
environment<00:03:16.060> they<00:03:16.150> can<00:03:16.180> still<00:03:16.540> take<00:03:16.720> their

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
environment they can still take their

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.960 
environment they can still take their
experiences<00:03:17.560> from<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.890> training<00:03:18.130> ground<00:03:18.430> put

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
experiences from the training ground put

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.460 
experiences from the training ground put
it<00:03:19.060> into<00:03:19.239> practice<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.750> match<00:03:19.930> take

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
it into practice in the match take

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.410 
it into practice in the match take
things<00:03:20.680> from<00:03:20.799> one<00:03:21.040> match<00:03:21.250> utilize<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.239> in

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
things from one match utilize it in

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.270 
things from one match utilize it in
another<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.959> even<00:03:23.320> utilize<00:03:23.829> things<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.220> a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
another and even utilize things in a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.740 
another and even utilize things in a
really<00:03:24.459> strange<00:03:24.670> situation<00:03:25.360> like<00:03:25.450> we've<00:03:25.600> got

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
really strange situation like we've got

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.630 
really strange situation like we've got
here<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:26.110> terms<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.829> match<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.340> means

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
here in terms of the match this means

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.610 
here in terms of the match this means
that<00:03:28.209> instead<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.660> having<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.959> track<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.470> ball

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
that instead of having to track the ball

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.259 
that instead of having to track the ball
completely<00:03:30.070> onto<00:03:30.190> his<00:03:30.400> foot<00:03:30.640> he<00:03:31.030> could<00:03:31.180> be

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
completely onto his foot he could be

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.910 
completely onto his foot he could be
scanning<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.750> see<00:03:31.780> where<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.110> goalkeeper<00:03:32.380> is

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
scanning to see where the goalkeeper is

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.680 
scanning to see where the goalkeeper is
if<00:03:33.130> there's<00:03:33.519> any<00:03:33.670> movement<00:03:33.880> there<00:03:34.299> so<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.540> can

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
if there's any movement there so you can

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.479 
if there's any movement there so you can
then<00:03:34.840> place<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> shot<00:03:35.590> past<00:03:36.130> where<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
then place a shot past where the

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.600 
then place a shot past where the
goalkeeper<00:03:36.670> might<00:03:37.090> be<00:03:37.440> well<00:03:38.440> as<00:03:38.560> its<00:03:38.980> base<00:03:39.280> of

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
goalkeeper might be well as its base of

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.750 
goalkeeper might be well as its base of
the<00:03:39.970> my<00:03:40.150> success<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.799> improve<00:03:42.100> myself<00:03:42.340> all
