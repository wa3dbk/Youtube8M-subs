00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.330
 hello that such friends as they are I am 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.010
 we left 1050 with a new installment of the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.689
 noticiero league of legends the first 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.939
 in fact I'm not going to talk about what 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.340
 they already know more new house dyn the new 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.900
 launcher 9 skin approaches the fire and 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.520
 kaitlin but from the most recent 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.079
 changes occurred and applied in the 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.210
 pele server 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.530
 so a few days ago scratched left a 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 flange zone skills in the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.219
 they change their mechanics and visualization 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.570
 of these but yesterday was applied 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.309
 a new patch pp server 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.140
 showing those new and improved 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.429
 zone textures that although there 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.289
 champions who need an improvement with 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.359
 greater urgency is not bad at all 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.420
 small improvements details to area both 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.039
 in his hair as in his harp in short 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.359
 following with the most important thing that 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.979
 new patch is that recently 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.809
 implemented this new invoker icon 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.850
 that if we compare it a bit with the skin 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.500
 of yes gallardÃ³n looks a lot like 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.879
 informative differences many are 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.679
 they ask what this icon is about and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.240
 how could you get it well today 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.830
 right did not get out of doubt with these two 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.140
 months kings that very point of view 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.429
 great where it's real and I saw you dress 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.830
 like all gentlemen for 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.810
 conquer the crack of the good summoner 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.130
 already serious although that has many 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.110
 weak skins pulled out a makes 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.670
 relatively little worth noting that they are 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.080
 pretty elaborate skins and even 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.940
 it seems that this is already done 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.729
 visual record not seriously look at the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.049
 difference textures in order now that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.360
 they wait a while for it to see the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.740
 displace final and a little bit more for 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.080
 that they continue to be implemented in the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.879
 other servers good guys and for 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.050
 last I usually do not know a bit a couple of 

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.550
 wheel posts soles 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.840
 in another I found these curious and 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.700
 interesting theories about the new 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.560
 champion and the mysterious bars that 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.960
 have also implemented in that patch 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.910
 tan trump is the name that these receive 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.400
 States parties which are active in 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.770
 calm and danger are believed that which 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.450
 will be used for the non-champion and according to 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.980
 is rumored in reddit is designed to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.500
 the top line is telling you the 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.850
 same person who designed big jake that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.040
 as we know these are champions of the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.270
 software so maybe this champion 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.400
 have some relationship with them 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.930
 who knows there is still much to see 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.250
 we hope that striped shows us a little 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.320
 more about this new champion coming 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.660
 on the way you know that this is nothing 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.950
 official their minds are rating theories 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.180
 well this has been all for today and if you 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.110
