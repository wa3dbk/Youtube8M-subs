00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.970 

all<00:00:03.570> right<00:00:03.750> I'm<00:00:03.929> assuming<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.620> invader

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
all right I'm assuming that invader

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.080 
all right I'm assuming that invader
isn't<00:00:05.460> gone<00:00:05.640> now<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:06.870> at<00:00:07.319> least<00:00:07.440> there's<00:00:07.770> that

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
isn't gone now so at least there's that

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.339 
isn't gone now so at least there's that
although<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.120> never<00:00:09.210> fought<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.809> real<00:00:10.019> invader

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
although I never fought it real invader

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.629 
although I never fought it real invader
before<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.340> would<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.550> been

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
before so that would have been

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.070 
before so that would have been
interesting<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.660> would<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.870> been<00:00:12.929> great

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
interesting and it would have been great

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.580 
interesting and it would have been great
