this is one but i would recommend this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.810 
this is one but i would recommend this
is<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> sig<00:01:40.259> 516<00:01:41.390> but<00:01:42.390> any<00:01:42.960> AR<00:01:43.409> platform<00:01:44.070> rifle

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is a sig 516 but any AR platform rifle

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.410 
is a sig 516 but any AR platform rifle
will<00:01:45.540> probably<00:01:46.020> serve<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.409> well<00:01:47.270> it's<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
will probably serve you well it's got a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.800 
will probably serve you well it's got a
good<00:01:48.600> magazine<00:01:48.990> capacity<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:50.280> looks<00:01:50.780> kind<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
good magazine capacity it looks kind of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.920 
good magazine capacity it looks kind of
scary<00:01:51.930> i<00:01:52.229> guess<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.060> certainly<00:01:54.420> deter

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
scary i guess it would certainly deter

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.459 
scary i guess it would certainly deter
me<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.380> i<00:01:55.530> were<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> writer<00:01:56.899> maybe<00:01:57.899> trying<00:01:58.229> to

would be a good idea kind of the kind of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760 
would be a good idea kind of the kind of
expensive<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.780> get<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.590> about

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
expensive you can get one for about

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.810

seven<00:03:08.160> hundred<00:03:08.190> dollars<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.730> know

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
seven hundred dollars on up to you know

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.850 
seven hundred dollars on up to you know
I<00:03:12.090> think<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.480> average<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:13.470> know<00:03:13.560> for<00:03:13.769> this

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
I think the average you know for this

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.530 
I think the average you know for this
rifle<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:14.280> about<00:03:14.459> thirteen<00:03:14.820> hundred<00:03:15.090> dollars

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
rifle is about thirteen hundred dollars

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.690 
rifle is about thirteen hundred dollars
and<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:16.650> go<00:03:16.769> even<00:03:16.950> more<00:03:17.100> expensive<00:03:17.370> than

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and you can go even more expensive than

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.290 
and you can go even more expensive than
that<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.519> want<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.760> give<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.030> few

family<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.860> definitely<00:03:55.130> puts<00:03:55.430> on<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.640> defensive

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
family it definitely puts on a defensive

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.260 
family it definitely puts on a defensive
stance<00:03:56.890> if<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.100> see<00:03:58.340> somebody<00:03:58.880> holding

something<00:03:59.480> like<00:03:59.720> this<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.910> that's<00:04:02.060> just

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
something like this so that's just

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.410 
something like this so that's just
another<00:04:02.300> option<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.730> think<00:04:04.730> another<00:04:05.000> option

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
another option I think another option

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.380 
another option I think another option
for<00:04:05.450> hunting<00:04:05.870> would<00:04:06.020> be<00:04:06.200> bow<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:06.980> arrow<00:04:07.390> this

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
for hunting would be bow and arrow this

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.160 
for hunting would be bow and arrow this
is<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.810> Martin<00:04:09.140> recurve<00:04:09.530> bow<00:04:10.990> with<00:04:11.990> some

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
is just a Martin recurve bow with some

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
East and carbon arrows it's a lot

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.100 
East and carbon arrows it's a lot
quieter<00:04:16.400> than<00:04:16.790> these<00:04:16.970> options<00:04:17.600> these<00:04:17.989> are

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
quieter than these options these are

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.920 
quieter than these options these are
going<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.260> be<00:04:18.350> really<00:04:18.709> loud<00:04:19.269> if<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.450> just<00:04:20.690> want
