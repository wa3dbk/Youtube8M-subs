00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.940
 hello everyone today in this video I'm going to 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.080
 teach how to correctly draw some 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.720
 feathers to our birds to know if 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.660
 is male or is female mother to send it 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 to the laboratory and that there not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.329
 we excel them and we can know if it is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.329
 male or female good for it we are going to 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:41.520
 need our little note to send 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:44.160
 so that we get the sexage alcohol 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.770
 a nice 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.770
 some tweezers and good 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.710
 Well, I've put this in case 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.840
 stain or something to have it more more 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.290
 hygienic then nothing the first thing that 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.470
 we do is catch our spirit our 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.470
 cotton 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.520
 and we disinfect our tweezers 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.110
 here we have the nymph as you can see 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 you can see the mutation 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.670
 but good but it's tiny then I 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.149
 I want to know if it is male or is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.649
 female and I want to know it through 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.580
 pen I do not want to do it here is my 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.100
 nymph 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.620
 Y 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.700
 many people take out their pen what is 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.700
 from the cloaca 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.940
 from here it is not advisable for two 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.930
 reasons one because the animal suffers the most 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.790
 have more stress because it hurts that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.490
 area hurts and another because it does not have the 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.740
 canyon is very very tiny and does not have 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.380
 enough DNA to know if it's 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.500
 male or female then the best is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.569
 take out a large pen from where the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.600
 big pen as the big pen 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.990
 it is removed just below 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.620
 of the tail this is the tail and this is 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.590
 the sewer is removed from here of these 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.660
 plumitas that are scratched 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.690
 in this case because this nymph 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.690
 Well, you have this mutation then 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.460
 we do this and with the clamp we throw the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.410
 bird does not suffer 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:52.050
 and we have taken out a pen with a cannon 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.540
 quite considerable 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.490
 I do not know if it will be seen there is the witch 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.490
 and that's all that is the canyon 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.300
 we leave it there I will put it with a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.080
 with an untreated crime 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.080
 the Canon 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.190
 and there would be my first feather 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.410
 well here under the tail 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.720
 You see there are some more feather 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.240
 little girls and there are a few little feather 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.700
 more the cracks are worth then we try 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.760
 take out even if they are two but of these 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.700
 long the bird is stressed less 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.360
 that if we took it out of the sewer because 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.360
 it hurts less 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.140
 and for the laboratory it is much more 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:52.040
 comfortable that has the largest stem 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.760
 because that's how DNA gets very good 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.500
 the canyon workshop go then nothing are going to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.439
 take out one you see the little bird has not 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.000
 suffered nothing and here would be the feather 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.200
 with the cannon 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.200
 here I already have 3 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.989
 And with this one, it's done either 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.810
 you have to remove 50,000 feathers 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:25.290
 Take two or three with the cannon 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.210
 big and is more than enough does 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.630
 you need to get these wrinkles down 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.000
 because apart from that they do not have almost 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.630
 almost canyon they do not have almost 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.030
 the bird gets stressed more it hurts more and 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.110
 the laboratory is more complicated 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:48.480
 extract the DNA from these little feathers 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.770
 in exchange for these with him with him 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.110
 with the big enough cannon is a lot 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.230
 easier to extract the DNA much more 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.030
 fast much more comfortable 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:06.240
 and much simpler then for your 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.920
 little bird that does not suffer then good until 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.780
 here is the video of how to extract 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.990
 properly some pens to know 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.290
 that sex is male or is female 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.990
 our little bird and nothing I hope that you 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.290
 has been quite clear and we 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.290
 we see
