00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 there was plasma tour are that kind 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.760
 there is an electrical circuit that you can 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.400
 connect for example to the candle where 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.160
 makes them get a high voltage with 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.489
 few milan will come therefore high voltage is 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 practically so 100 watts has deluded 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.610
 to be able to have energy 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.370
 if I spend the spent uncle concentrated 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.360
 for example a hundred already one of energy 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 because to quantify the difference 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.040
 of the line is already in and out 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.440
 see 600 the convenience of what 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.080
 I spend at the entrance to have with in China 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.580
 you calculate in the classroom you can calculate a 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.500
 ninja already heat energy that can 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.000
 be happy to represent high school 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.020
 ancient that of heat represents 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 almost energy 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.900
 so if it's 21 percent already for javier 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 thousand indexes per thousand gpg sometimes means 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.260
 that interesting because it clear plasma 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.840
 a candle but mutual and unloading and jumping 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.450
 voltage this state risk in 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 that area the lighthouse space goes to get 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.969
 the electrons in the surrounding space 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.009
 so it goes to take surplus electrons 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.340
 out of the circuit that ten times of 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.049
 more than the one who downloads that other one 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.600
 voltage is given only in that heat that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.259
 12 thousand to 10 thousand degrees where to pass the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 therefore makes it simple and sprays a 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.590
 bruise turns itself apart 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.990
 bus command more and more in atoms 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 both at the molecular and gaseous level e 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.200
 increasingly full of energy because 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.820
 clearly this heat is this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.179
 energy is absorbed by things 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.090
 that of the water they expand 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:09.149
 then they arrive in the combustion chamber 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.420
 are already ready gulls fatigue has more 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.580
 energies of what you normally do 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.340
 can contain a normal diesel a 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.090
 normal fuel also succeeds us 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.690
 we did also optimize the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.849
 change even if the difference between 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.500
 from the normal of this the variation qual 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.110
 is the one that does not really say in 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.390
 candle resistance we will ask 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.150
 respected the other classical system 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.519
 of the I played with the engagement that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.680
 this does not explode like that of the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.550
 hydrogen is an expansive gas goes 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.440
 expansion that is when it arrives at xi 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.790
 coluccia crucial mass in the nation it 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.790
 does how the hydrogen affected serves the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.610
 expansion cylinder then works 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.080
 even medium fresh and you can get it 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.060
 to the next assembly in the water but it 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.920
 we are doing now you will also have a 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.920
 way to see it on our site 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.630
 we did just half an hour of practice 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.650
 on a 2-stroke engine by having it connected 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.750
 I didn't know about exports 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.260
 had done the Indian of gas discharge 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.800
 of the motor connected in two containers 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:31.680
 where there will be a measured diesel cleaner 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.470
 with water another world with a scale 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.120
 rea in short practically what happens between 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.970
 the hot gases obtained from the exhaust that 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.700
 along with the diesel with the air it takes to 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:51.660
 these containers create bubbles and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.989
 then it goes to create this further here 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:01.519
 on the way back we noticed that the engine 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.519
 continues to turn does not stop we put 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.459
 that we are trying to do it 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.520
 However 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.170
 now the plasma cellar we have to do 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.950
 a job on will change because we have to 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:25.230
 optimize the relationship between the bike and the 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.250
 cathode that is on the maid because the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:32.010
 today's candid is the case there is a 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.660
 electrode in the center and telethon la 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.330
 of the side that you should find 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.390
 remove the l completely remove the l 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.810
 can thus notice the plasma from the center goes 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.160
 irradiate evenly over too 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.530
 because it gets drained it seems like 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.760
 on the other electrode in the force because 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.270
 then those attached to mass of the 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.240
 so this machine never more me 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.270
 police and a bubble over the career is 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.690
 clearly the water passing steam 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.010
 in that area without a candle 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.690
 framework to absorb energy 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:15.419
 therefore having a fuel 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:19.470
 molded following times I thought of 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.710
 return to heat the water of a 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.720
 radiator has the case in the year if 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.430
 we are united to create a community that 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.000
 will moderate essays to listen if me 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.000
 memory of the eco-sustainable affair e 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
