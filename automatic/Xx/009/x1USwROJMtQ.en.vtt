00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.279 
review with Tom vassal Confucius a game
that's<00:00:16.520> hid<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.730> rage<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.390> suppose<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
that's hid the rage I suppose of the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.650 
that's hid the rage I suppose of the
worker<00:00:20.279> placement<00:00:20.730> games<00:00:21.150> where<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.480> put

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
worker placement games where you put

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720 
worker placement games where you put
your<00:00:21.779> apiece<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> certain<00:00:23.340> spot<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
your apiece on a certain spot on the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.310 
your apiece on a certain spot on the
board<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.180> lets<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.449> take<00:00:24.600> an<00:00:24.779> action<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
board that lets you take an action and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200 
board that lets you take an action and
there's<00:00:25.980> been<00:00:26.160> quite<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.430> few<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:26.880> games

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
there's been quite a few of these games

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.870 
there's been quite a few of these games
that<00:00:27.449> came<00:00:27.599> out<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> past<00:00:28.140> several<00:00:28.410> years

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
that came out in the past several years

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.310 
that came out in the past several years
confucius<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.090> certainly<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> most<00:00:30.869> cerebral

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
confucius is certainly the most cerebral

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.250 
confucius is certainly the most cerebral
those<00:00:31.800> games<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.300> least<00:00:33.570> luck<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.110> i've

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
those games as the least luck that i've

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740 
those games as the least luck that i've
seen<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.860> has<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> lot<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> interaction<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
seen it has a lot of interaction and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.100 
seen it has a lot of interaction and
really<00:00:37.680> has<00:00:38.309> some<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:38.940> difficult<00:00:39.480> paths<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
really has some more difficult paths to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.619 
really has some more difficult paths to
victory<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.219> would<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> hard<00:00:42.480> time

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
victory I think I would have a hard time

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.420 
victory I think I would have a hard time
explaining<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.500> game<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> short<00:00:44.219> time

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
explaining the game in the short time

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
explaining the game in the short time
that<00:00:44.489> I'm<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.000> doing<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.329> video<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
that I'm gonna be doing this video and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.450 
that I'm gonna be doing this video and
I'm<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.410> even<00:00:46.620> sure<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> would<00:00:46.920> attempt<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> do

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
I'm not even sure I would attempt to do

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
I'm not even sure I would attempt to do
so<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.120> much<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> see

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so because so much of it you have to see

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
so because so much of it you have to see
and<00:00:49.530> sometimes<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> play<00:00:50.670> through<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and sometimes have to play through to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
and sometimes have to play through to
understand<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.050> fact<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.590> would<00:00:52.710> say<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
understand in fact I would say that

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.229 
understand in fact I would say that
playing<00:00:53.219> through<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.399> first<00:00:53.670> game<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
playing through your first game of it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
playing through your first game of it
you<00:00:54.360> would<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> best

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you would not really know the best

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.099 
you would not really know the best
action<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> wouldn't<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
action to do you you wouldn't really be

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.500 
action to do you you wouldn't really be
a<00:00:58.140> competitive<00:00:59.070> player<00:00:59.340> until<00:00:59.969> your<00:01:00.120> second

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
a competitive player until your second

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
a competitive player until your second
game<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.710> being<00:01:01.949> said<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.789> like

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
game all that being said I don't like

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.219 
game all that being said I don't like
the<00:01:03.239> game<00:01:04.549> however<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.270> think<00:01:06.869> there's<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the game however I do think there's a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
the game however I do think there's a
certain<00:01:07.409> group<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.799> people<00:01:08.100> who<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
certain group of people who will like it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
certain group of people who will like it
if<00:01:09.210> you'd<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.350> cerebral<00:01:10.850> unforgiving

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
if you'd like more cerebral unforgiving

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.710 
if you'd like more cerebral unforgiving
games<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.540> Age<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.140> steam<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.509> maybe<00:01:15.509> some

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
games like Age of steam and maybe some

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.149 
games like Age of steam and maybe some
more<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.930> those<00:01:15.990> railroad<00:01:16.320> games<00:01:16.740> where<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
more of those railroad games where you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.590 
more of those railroad games where you
have<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:17.939> decisions<00:01:18.420> at

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
have to make the right decisions at

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300 
have to make the right decisions at
certain<00:01:19.140> points<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> games<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.040> will

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
certain points of the games or you will

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.820 
certain points of the games or you will
lose<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:20.939> you'll<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.229> also

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
lose I think you'll like this I also

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.410 
lose I think you'll like this I also
think<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.369> while<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> game<00:01:23.850> says<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
think that while the game says in the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.760 
think that while the game says in the
box<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.930> plays<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.320> three<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> five

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
box that it plays from three to five

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.499 
box that it plays from three to five
players<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> should<00:01:26.970> never<00:01:27.090> play<00:01:27.299> with

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
players that you should never play with

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
players that you should never play with
less<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:27.840> four<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.790> all

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
less than four and and if at all

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
less than four and and if at all
possible<00:01:29.970> play<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.930> five<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.979> game<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.220> very

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
possible play with five the game is very

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.850 
possible play with five the game is very
beautiful<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> game<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.299> looks<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.860> here's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the total is always four so this card

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.630 
the total is always four so this card
has<00:02:57.630> one<00:02:57.870> coin<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.290> three<00:02:58.500> licenses<00:02:59.069> while

this one has three coins in one license

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.229 
this one has three coins in one license
and<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.160> course<00:03:02.190> there's<00:03:02.610> two<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.060> two

and then of course there's two and two

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.020 
and then of course there's two and two
and<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:04.530> keeps<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.980> randomness<00:03:05.519> low<00:03:05.790> but

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and that keeps the randomness low but

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.699 
and that keeps the randomness low but

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
when sending out ships and so there's a

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.349 
when sending out ships and so there's a
usefulness<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:32.069> actual<00:03:32.430> going<00:03:33.239> to

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
usefulness to that the actual going to

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.849 
usefulness to that the actual going to
other<00:03:33.510> countries<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.440> invading<00:03:34.739> countries

other countries and invading countries

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.380 
other countries and invading countries
to<00:03:35.220> me<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.430> little<00:03:35.579> boring<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.180> still

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
to me is a little boring but it's still

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.500 
to me is a little boring but it's still
possible<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:37.019> be<00:03:37.170> done<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.160> think<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.760> most

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
possible to be done but I think the most

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.240 
possible to be done but I think the most
unique<00:03:39.959> mechanic<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.650> game<00:03:40.829> or<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.010> least

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
unique mechanic of this game or at least

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.059 
unique mechanic of this game or at least
certainly<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.510> central<00:03:42.930> mechanic<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.859> the

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
certainly the central mechanic to the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.759 
certainly the central mechanic to the
game<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> gift<00:03:45.359> giving<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.959> that's

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
game is that a gift giving and that's

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.020 
game is that a gift giving and that's
why<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.950> think<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.280> game<00:03:47.430> breaks<00:03:47.700> down<00:03:47.850> with

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
why I think the game breaks down with

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.640 
why I think the game breaks down with
three<00:03:48.239> players<00:03:48.389> because<00:03:48.930> there's<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.440> gift

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
three players because there's the gift

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.559 
three players because there's the gift
giving<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.130> doesn't<00:03:50.400> work<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.700> well<00:03:50.910> but

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
giving just doesn't work as well but

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.970 
giving just doesn't work as well but
over<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> course<00:03:52.139> of<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.319> game<00:03:52.470> you're

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
over the course of the game you're

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.440 
over the course of the game you're
allowed<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.430> give<00:03:53.579> gifts<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:53.970> other<00:03:54.150> players

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
allowed to give gifts to other players

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.900 
allowed to give gifts to other players
and<00:03:54.810> each<00:03:55.139> gift<00:03:55.470> has<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.680> certain<00:03:56.069> value<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.730> it

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
and each gift has a certain value on it

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.640 
and each gift has a certain value on it
and<00:03:57.060> when<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.690> give<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:57.959> gift<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.410> another

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
and when you give that gift to another

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.979 
and when you give that gift to another
player<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.130> player<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.459> basically<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.359> debt

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
player that player is basically in debt

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.259 
player that player is basically in debt
to<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.400> may<00:04:02.549> need<00:04:02.819> their<00:04:03.060> support

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
to you and so you may need their support

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.660 
to you and so you may need their support
when<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> public<00:04:04.590> official<00:04:05.069> goes<00:04:05.220> up<00:04:05.400> for

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
when a public official goes up for

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.759 
when a public official goes up for
election<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.780> may<00:04:06.930> need<00:04:07.139> things<00:04:07.440> from<00:04:07.650> them

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
election you may need things from them

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.670 
election you may need things from them
in<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.069> they<00:04:08.670> are<00:04:09.139> they're<00:04:10.139> doesn't<00:04:10.319> use<00:04:10.560> the

word vassal but that's pretty much what
they<00:04:13.470> are<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:13.889> they<00:04:14.010> can<00:04:14.220> counter<00:04:14.609> your<00:04:14.819> gift
