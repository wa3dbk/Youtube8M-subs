00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.270
 paper wrapper is enough 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.450
 thick cardboard box 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.630

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.559

 the instruction is written in English 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.450
 it is very convenient for some to be 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.790
 also included are vacuum 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.930

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.329
 connecting computers and charging

 Charging pretty nice with 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.760
 Brand logo in the box 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.160
 is the warranty card well and move on 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.560
 directly to the phone the first thing 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.750
 I want to note in this unit 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.689
 its assembly ie the phone looks like 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.870
 very solid very durable nothing anywhere 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.930
 no backlash looks like a single monolith 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.300
 on the bend is very resistant not creaks not 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.220
 crunches everything is very wonderful from the bottom 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.780
 edge we have a microphone hole 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:25.010
 with a particularly tight micro usb membrane input 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.560
 Side of the volume rocker from the other side 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.880
 we have an on / off button that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.340
 very comfortable rear camera and flash 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.890
 wide speaker grill and back cover 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.950
 we have a soft-touch coating and 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.840
 separately I want to note the screen of this 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 phone 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.350
 full hd screen is made according to a gs technology 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.780
 and glass gorilla glass I without display 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.290
 Here you see very wide viewing angles 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.439
 nowhere is any light quality pictures 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.210
 gorgeous 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.960
 whichever way you look 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.920
 color inversion is not observed also 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.410
 succulence of colors is preserved in general 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.410
 the screen is made just fine 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.810
 android 4 2 1 is on board 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.710
 here we put a third-party mihome 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.630
 launcher and despite it all scrolls 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:25.550
 very nice no hesitation 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.110
 no delay the interface is very responsive 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.660
 here is a mihome launcher 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.470
 everything is taken out in separate blocks that is 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.650
 separate 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.000
 there is no separate button for the application 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.970
 the system 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.250
 does not load the RAM handles the way 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.850
 the device is opened is not easy enough 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.490
 as the cap sits very tight but it 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.100
 even well now let's see what he has 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.990
 inside by the way precisely because of this 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.660
 the cap remains 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.700
 strong enough even after removing it 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.890
 inside we have this here 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.910
 batareechka branded with the logo 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.460
 2100 milliamp hour logo this is not 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.240
 so much of course but thanks to 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.280
 this phone was very slim 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.020
 but now let's see what we have 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.380
 is under the battery 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.170
 and under the battery we have two 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.230
 SIM card slots 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:26.780
 the first one is jetsam communication 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:29.810
 w-cdma and 2 only dsm are also next to 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.330
 these slots is a card slot 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.840
 memory and supports this phone 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.410
 memory cards up to 64 gigabytes 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.550
 Well, now let's get the phone 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.410
 put the battery back in 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.780
 close the lid 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.020
 snaps so very well 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.880
 plump after this phone 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.450
 again becomes like a monolith nothing 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.540
 nowhere backlash everything is great now 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.730
 it remains only to enable 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.700
 what's interesting is the phone turns on 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.270
 Here is the saver itself quickly enough 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.959
 but it loads apparently due to the fact that 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.970
 RAM is not so much 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.860
 slowly enough but now we have 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.620
 there is a chance to see 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.560
 how long does it take to complete 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.830
 inclusions 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.380
 let's wait well and while we wait 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.380
 focus on one more detail 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.620
 This phone has a metal 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.910
 base magnesium alloy frame 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.580
 then turned on and have a narrow frame 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.920
 only 2 and 6 millimeters which gives it 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.800
 extra compactness on this we 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.800
 finish the first part of the review bye
