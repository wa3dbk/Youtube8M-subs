a<00:02:09.120> really<00:02:09.540> great<00:02:09.660> experience

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
a really great experience

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
a really great experience
I<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.740> gushing<00:02:11.010> over<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> book<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.940> wanna<00:02:12.150> see

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
I was gushing over the book I wanna see

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.500 
I was gushing over the book I wanna see
if<00:02:12.690> my<00:02:13.110> feelings<00:02:13.530> still<00:02:14.000> remain<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.210> same

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
if my feelings still remain the same

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.690

after<00:02:16.080> reading<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> second<00:02:17.310> time<00:02:17.460> and

after reading it for the second time and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
after reading it for the second time and
that's<00:02:17.850> kind<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.240> fear<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:19.080> might<00:02:19.380> not

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
about and that just doesn't go with the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.170 
about and that just doesn't go with the
good<00:04:10.590> books<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:11.100> could<00:04:11.250> go<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:11.610> books<00:04:11.940> I

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
good books it could go with books I

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.449 
good books it could go with books I
didn't<00:04:12.540> really<00:04:12.840> enjoy<00:04:13.020> as<00:04:13.440> well<00:04:13.650> but<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.220> full

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
of that time was I really unhappy

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.289

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
kind of underwhelming and because I

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.279 
kind of underwhelming and because I

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.040 
if I would feel differently about the
stories<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.819> of<00:05:02.879> course<00:05:03.120> another<00:05:03.419> reason<00:05:03.569> to

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
stories and of course another reason to

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.320 
stories and of course another reason to
reread<00:05:04.650> books<00:05:04.919> is<00:05:05.280> because<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.759> absolutely

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
reread books is because I absolutely

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.300 
reread books is because I absolutely
love<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.960> characters<00:05:07.379> and<00:05:07.590> story<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.009> just

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
love the characters and story I just

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.640 
love the characters and story I just
want<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.669> have<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.270> same<00:05:09.569> experience<00:05:09.750> again

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
want to have that same experience again

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.159 
want to have that same experience again
and<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.490> also<00:05:11.669> think<00:05:12.000> rereading<00:05:12.449> is<00:05:12.780> good

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
and so I also think rereading is good

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.499 
and so I also think rereading is good
because<00:05:13.409> I'm<00:05:13.919> more<00:05:14.219> aware<00:05:14.610> of<00:05:14.669> course<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.360> the

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
because I'm more aware of course of the

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.839 
because I'm more aware of course of the
details<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.199> may<00:05:16.409> have<00:05:16.560> missed<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.280> initial<00:05:17.490> go

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
details I may have missed the initial go

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.459 
details I may have missed the initial go
around<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.509> I<00:05:18.539> think<00:05:18.599> that<00:05:18.870> just<00:05:19.139> helps<00:05:19.379> a

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
around and I think that just helps a

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.860 
around and I think that just helps a
world<00:05:19.770> one<00:05:20.039> I'm<00:05:20.460> reading<00:05:21.000> critically<00:05:21.569> those

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
world one I'm reading critically those

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.110 
world one I'm reading critically those
