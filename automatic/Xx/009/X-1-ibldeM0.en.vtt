00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.090 
getting a Spitfire right next to me the
the<00:02:16.040> airplane<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.640> extremely<00:02:17.390> noisy<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.590> I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
the airplane is extremely noisy and I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.530 
the airplane is extremely noisy and I
wouldn't<00:02:19.460> want<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.640> put<00:02:19.790> him<00:02:19.910> off<00:02:20.030> maybe<00:02:20.450> I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
wouldn't want to put him off maybe I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.680 
wouldn't want to put him off maybe I
would

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.420 

as<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> runway<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.170> quite<00:02:25.380> bumpy<00:02:25.590> I'm<00:02:26.220> gonna

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
as the runway is quite bumpy I'm gonna

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.090 
as the runway is quite bumpy I'm gonna
select<00:02:26.640> dynamic<00:02:27.450> mode<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:28.170> sharpens<00:02:28.770> up<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
select dynamic mode that sharpens up the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.010 
select dynamic mode that sharpens up the
responses<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.850> car<00:02:30.180> I'll<00:02:30.690> probably

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
responses of the car I'll probably

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.540 
responses of the car I'll probably
manage<00:02:31.560> between<00:02:32.310> 20<00:02:32.670> miles<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:34.490> don't<00:02:35.490> know
