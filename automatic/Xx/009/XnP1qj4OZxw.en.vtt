think it has some potential I'm looking

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.840 
think it has some potential I'm looking
forward<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.710> seeing<00:02:01.920> some<00:02:01.980> more<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.730> the

a little bit bigger in bulkier but still

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.410 
a little bit bigger in bulkier but still
a<00:02:17.740> great<00:02:18.160> version<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.670> think<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.060> armor

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
a great version I think the armor

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.540 
a great version I think the armor
choices<00:02:19.810> they<00:02:19.959> did<00:02:20.140> with<00:02:20.319> him<00:02:20.530> look<00:02:21.160> great

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
choices they did with him look great

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.400 
choices they did with him look great
that<00:02:21.819> really<00:02:22.270> fits<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.600> character<00:02:22.780> nicely

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
that really fits the character nicely

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.140 
that really fits the character nicely
you<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.160> his<00:02:24.280> alternate<00:02:24.730> head<00:02:24.910> with<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
you can see his alternate head with the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.600 
you can see his alternate head with the
eyes<00:02:25.330> lit<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:25.830> gonna<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.430> really

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
eyes lit up gonna be a really really

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.059 
eyes lit up gonna be a really really
cool<00:02:27.910> figure<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.300> think<00:02:28.660> again<00:02:29.230> seeing<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
cool figure I think again seeing a

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.650 
cool figure I think again seeing a
painted<00:02:30.400> version<00:02:30.760> would<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:30.970> awesome

hopefully in San Diego we'll get to then
