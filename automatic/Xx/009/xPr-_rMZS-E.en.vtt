that in mind we'll start with making
tahini<00:01:20.730> now<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.110> my<00:01:22.320> secret<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.850> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
tahini now this is my secret is that you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
tahini now this is my secret is that you
got<00:01:24.300> to<00:01:24.330> make<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.870> tahini<00:01:25.260> sauce<00:01:25.740> first

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
got to make the tahini sauce first

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.350 
got to make the tahini sauce first
because<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.260> you<00:01:28.530> put<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> garbanzo<00:01:29.670> beans<00:01:30.150> or

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
because if you put the garbanzo beans or

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.010 
because if you put the garbanzo beans or
the<00:01:30.480> chickpeas<00:01:32.090> together<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.780> tahini

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the chickpeas together with the tahini

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.750 
the chickpeas together with the tahini
paste<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.780> liquid<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> tahini<00:01:38.640> paste

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
paste and the liquid the tahini paste

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.840 
paste and the liquid the tahini paste
doesn't<00:01:39.300> get<00:01:39.860> emulsified<00:01:41.030> as<00:01:42.030> well<00:01:42.660> as<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.850> you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
doesn't get emulsified as well as if you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.780 
doesn't get emulsified as well as if you
would<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.480> separately<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.790> highly

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
would do it separately so highly

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.150 
would do it separately so highly
recommend<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.770> tahini

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
recommend that you first do the tahini

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.840 
recommend that you first do the tahini
sauce<00:01:50.870> then<00:01:51.870> add<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> chickpeas<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.550> let's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
sauce then add the chickpeas so let's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.100 
sauce then add the chickpeas so let's
start<00:01:54.150> with<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:57.510> going<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.810> start

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
start with that so I'm going to start

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.960 
start with that so I'm going to start
with<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:59.540> two<00:02:02.480> tablespoons<00:02:03.480> of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.270 

tahini<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:09.500> thing<00:02:09.679> with<00:02:09.830> tahini<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.459> that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
tahini and the thing with tahini is that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.059 
tahini and the thing with tahini is that
the<00:02:13.280> ratio<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.760> about<00:02:14.000> one<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.600> one<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.680> one

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
the ratio is about one to one so one

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.330 
the ratio is about one to one so one
part<00:02:17.000> tahini<00:02:17.630> paste<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:19.250> part<00:02:19.610> water<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:22.280> I'm

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
part tahini paste one part water so I'm

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.140

and<00:06:46.410> fluid<00:06:46.830> II<00:06:47.130> this<00:06:47.340> thing<00:06:47.640> is<00:06:47.850> a<00:06:49.100> nice<00:06:50.100> creamy

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.180 

and<00:06:55.880> in<00:06:56.880> the<00:06:57.870> next<00:06:58.170> batch<00:06:58.320> if<00:06:58.650> you<00:06:58.770> decide<00:06:59.160> oh

and in the next batch if you decide oh
this<00:06:59.730> was<00:07:00.000> just<00:07:00.510> turned<00:07:00.780> out<00:07:00.960> to<00:07:01.110> be<00:07:01.260> too

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
this was just turned out to be too

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.330 
this was just turned out to be too
liquidy<00:07:01.950> then<00:07:02.340> next<00:07:02.790> time<00:07:03.290> put<00:07:04.290> less<00:07:04.560> liquid

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
liquidy then next time put less liquid

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.250 
liquidy then next time put less liquid
and<00:07:05.760> there<00:07:06.570> you<00:07:06.660> have<00:07:06.840> it

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
and there you have it

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.010
