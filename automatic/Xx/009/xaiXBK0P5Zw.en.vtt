00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.479 
could just have just rotated like that
and<00:03:20.799> that's<00:03:20.980> all<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.219> need<00:03:21.370> for

the<00:04:26.080> plane<00:04:27.070> Armada<00:04:27.460> Starscream<00:04:28.440> from<00:04:29.440> the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
the plane Armada Starscream from the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.890 
the plane Armada Starscream from the
cartoon<00:04:29.889> of<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.219> even<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.789> Voyager<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.360> didn't

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
cartoon of the even the Voyager I didn't

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.709 
cartoon of the even the Voyager I didn't
really<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.199> this<00:04:32.380> design<00:04:32.740> but<00:04:33.639> I<00:04:34.120> think<00:04:34.630> it

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719 
really like this design but I think it

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:36.269 
really like this design but I think it
works<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:35.050> lot<00:04:35.169> better<00:04:35.229> as<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.710> Deluxe<00:04:36.010> than<00:04:36.190> it

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:36.279 
works a lot better as it Deluxe than it

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.790 
works a lot better as it Deluxe than it
did<00:04:36.400> of

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
did of

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.920 
did of
and<00:04:37.220> maybe<00:04:37.940> that's<00:04:38.120> just<00:04:38.210> some<00:04:38.509> of<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.629> design

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
and maybe that's just some of the design

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.570 
and maybe that's just some of the design
how<00:04:39.259> their<00:04:39.440> design<00:04:39.680> aesthetics<00:04:40.099> have<00:04:40.190> changed

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
how their design aesthetics have changed

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.249 
how their design aesthetics have changed
over<00:04:40.759> the<00:04:40.849> years<00:04:41.090> but<00:04:41.270> I'm<00:04:41.750> really<00:04:42.110> really

this<00:05:33.500> is<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.629> complaint<00:05:35.629> I<00:05:35.750> have<00:05:35.900> with<00:05:36.050> a

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
this is the the complaint I have with a

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.200 
this is the the complaint I have with a
figure<00:05:36.319> because<00:05:36.650> each<00:05:37.250> swing<00:05:37.699> hides<00:05:38.030> the

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
figure because each swing hides the

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.909 
figure because each swing hides the
swords<00:05:38.569> they<00:05:39.020> don't<00:05:39.199> the<00:05:39.349> one<00:05:39.560> wing<00:05:39.710> doesn't

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
swords they don't the one wing doesn't

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.170 
swords they don't the one wing doesn't
pop<00:05:40.159> off<00:05:40.310> I<00:05:40.460> can<00:05:40.610> do<00:05:40.699> it<00:05:40.759> on<00:05:40.819> the<00:05:40.880> Voyager

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
pop off I can do it on the Voyager

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.879 
pop off I can do it on the Voyager
version<00:05:41.449> but<00:05:42.080> it's<00:05:42.199> just<00:05:42.319> some<00:05:42.500> clear<00:05:42.740> plastic

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
version but it's just some clear plastic

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.519 
version but it's just some clear plastic
that<00:05:43.219> clips<00:05:43.580> together<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.900> it's<00:05:45.110> real<00:05:45.319> easy

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
that clips together so it's real easy

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:46.930 
that clips together so it's real easy
especially<00:05:45.979> when<00:05:46.279> trying<00:05:46.400> to<00:05:46.490> put<00:05:46.699> it<00:05:46.759> in<00:05:46.849> his

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
especially when trying to put it in his

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.640 
especially when trying to put it in his
hands<00:05:47.150> because<00:05:47.539> it<00:05:47.659> fits<00:05:47.990> really<00:05:48.139> tightly<00:05:48.560> in

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
hands because it fits really tightly in

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.309 
hands because it fits really tightly in
his<00:05:48.740> hands<00:05:49.009> to<00:05:49.969> pop<00:05:50.210> that<00:05:50.449> those<00:05:50.659> pieces<00:05:51.020> apart

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
his hands to pop that those pieces apart

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.339 
his hands to pop that those pieces apart
and<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:53.479> doesn't<00:05:53.900> take<00:05:54.020> a<00:05:54.050> whole<00:05:54.199> lot<00:05:54.259> of

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
and it doesn't take a whole lot of

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.290 
and it doesn't take a whole lot of
effort<00:05:54.529> and<00:05:54.800> thankfully<00:05:55.729> it<00:05:55.849> doesn't<00:05:56.060> take<00:05:56.270> a

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
effort and thankfully it doesn't take a

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.430 
effort and thankfully it doesn't take a
whole<00:05:56.389> lot<00:05:56.599> of<00:05:56.630> effort<00:05:56.750> which<00:05:57.050> means<00:05:57.319> you're

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
whole lot of effort which means you're

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.719 
whole lot of effort which means you're
not<00:05:57.529> stressing<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.099> plastic<00:05:58.460> too<00:05:58.580> much

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
not stressing the plastic too much

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.059 
not stressing the plastic too much
because<00:05:58.940> clear<00:05:59.330> plastic<00:05:59.539> like<00:05:59.840> this<00:06:00.050> if<00:06:00.949> you

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
because clear plastic like this if you

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.620 
because clear plastic like this if you
put<00:06:01.219> too<00:06:01.340> much<00:06:01.460> strain<00:06:01.729> on<00:06:01.849> is<00:06:02.060> really<00:06:02.300> prone

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
put too much strain on is really prone

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.230 
put too much strain on is really prone
to<00:06:02.779> break<00:06:03.130> it's<00:06:04.130> much<00:06:04.550> more<00:06:04.699> fragile<00:06:04.969> than

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
to break it's much more fragile than

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.629 
to break it's much more fragile than
than<00:06:05.509> the<00:06:05.599> solid<00:06:05.779> plastics<00:06:06.379> so<00:06:07.099> it's<00:06:07.460> nice

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
than the solid plastics so it's nice

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.100 
than the solid plastics so it's nice
that<00:06:07.669> it<00:06:08.000> does<00:06:08.150> pop<00:06:08.360> off<00:06:08.539> easily<00:06:08.750> and<00:06:09.020> doesn't

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
that it does pop off easily and doesn't

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.899 
that it does pop off easily and doesn't
appeared<00:06:09.560> like<00:06:09.710> when<00:06:09.889> I<00:06:09.919> popped<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.639> off<00:06:10.699> two

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
appeared like when I popped it off two

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.189 
appeared like when I popped it off two
or<00:06:11.000> three<00:06:11.120> times<00:06:11.270> now<00:06:11.449> even<00:06:11.750> just<00:06:11.900> here<00:06:12.110> the

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
or three times now even just here the

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.290 
or three times now even just here the
video<00:06:12.440> and<00:06:12.740> I'm<00:06:13.460> not<00:06:13.610> seeing<00:06:13.909> any<00:06:14.029> stress

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
video and I'm not seeing any stress

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.360 
video and I'm not seeing any stress
marks<00:06:14.599> in<00:06:14.719> the<00:06:14.900> clear<00:06:15.110> plastic<00:06:15.289> so<00:06:16.099> that's<00:06:16.279> a

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
marks in the clear plastic so that's a

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.899 
marks in the clear plastic so that's a
bonus<00:06:16.699> but<00:06:17.650> but<00:06:18.650> I<00:06:18.680> did<00:06:18.949> they<00:06:19.310> just<00:06:19.490> don't<00:06:19.669> feel

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
bonus but but I did they just don't feel

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.010 
bonus but but I did they just don't feel
super<00:06:20.840> great<00:06:20.990> they're<00:06:21.229> not<00:06:21.349> bad<00:06:21.610> but<00:06:22.870> just<00:06:23.870> the

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
super great they're not bad but just the

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.559 
super great they're not bad but just the
plain<00:06:24.259> clear<00:06:24.650> orange<00:06:25.009> plastic<00:06:25.300> not<00:06:26.300> a<00:06:26.330> lot<00:06:26.539> a

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
he's got two of those weapons that he

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.140 
he's got two of those weapons that he
can<00:06:35.090> use<00:06:36.039> so<00:06:37.039> yeah<00:06:37.159> all<00:06:37.370> in<00:06:37.490> all<00:06:37.580> a<00:06:37.639> much

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
can use so yeah all in all a much

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.570 
can use so yeah all in all a much
surprisingly<00:06:39.110> poseable<00:06:39.650> and<00:06:39.860> a<00:06:40.250> much<00:06:40.550> more

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
surprisingly poseable and a much more

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.339 
surprisingly poseable and a much more
interesting<00:06:41.180> figure<00:06:41.659> than<00:06:41.810> I<00:06:41.900> thought<00:06:42.110> it<00:06:42.259> was

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349 
interesting figure than I thought it was

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.379 
interesting figure than I thought it was
gonna<00:06:42.469> be<00:06:42.580> based<00:06:43.580> on<00:06:43.789> the<00:06:43.879> pictures<00:06:44.210> we've

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
gonna be based on the pictures we've

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.350 
gonna be based on the pictures we've
gotten<00:06:44.690> up<00:06:44.779> until<00:06:45.080> now<00:06:45.259> so<00:06:45.529> I<00:06:46.520> have<00:06:46.940> to<00:06:47.120> say<00:06:47.240> he

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
gotten up until now so I have to say he

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.850 
gotten up until now so I have to say he
really<00:06:47.570> of<00:06:47.899> all<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.169> figures<00:06:48.440> in<00:06:48.589> the<00:06:48.740> way<00:06:48.830> I

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
really of all the figures in the way I

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.620 
really of all the figures in the way I
think<00:06:49.130> he's<00:06:49.399> the<00:06:49.520> one<00:06:49.639> who<00:06:49.729> surprised<00:06:50.210> me<00:06:50.389> them

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
think he's the one who surprised me them

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.670 
think he's the one who surprised me them
most<00:06:50.920> pleasantly<00:06:51.940> so<00:06:52.940> I<00:06:52.970> still<00:06:53.690> think<00:06:53.930> I<00:06:54.170> don't

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
most pleasantly so I still think I don't

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.880 
most pleasantly so I still think I don't
know<00:06:54.830> scoop<00:06:55.160> my<00:06:55.370> twin<00:06:55.660> because<00:06:56.660> of<00:06:57.380> the<00:06:57.560> target

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
know scoop my twin because of the target

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.460 
know scoop my twin because of the target
masters<00:06:58.330> the<00:06:59.330> Minicon<00:06:59.690> team<00:06:59.960> might<00:07:00.140> win<00:07:00.320> just

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
masters the Minicon team might win just

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.690 
masters the Minicon team might win just
because<00:07:00.620> it's<00:07:00.950> a<00:07:01.040> combiner<00:07:01.400> and<00:07:01.640> it's<00:07:01.970> fun<00:07:03.700> but

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700 
because it's a combiner and it's fun but

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.250 
because it's a combiner and it's fun but
I<00:07:04.940> have<00:07:05.210> to<00:07:05.300> say<00:07:05.450> I'm<00:07:05.570> really<00:07:05.600> quite<00:07:06.140> impressed

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
I have to say I'm really quite impressed

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260 
I have to say I'm really quite impressed
with<00:07:06.680> this<00:07:06.770> one<00:07:06.950> and<00:07:07.130> if<00:07:07.790> you<00:07:07.880> see<00:07:08.030> them<00:07:08.150> on<00:07:08.240> a

with this one and if you see them on a

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.120 
with this one and if you see them on a
shelf<00:07:08.480> and<00:07:09.170> you're<00:07:09.500> in<00:07:09.590> your<00:07:09.740> op<00:07:09.860> and<00:07:10.040> you're
