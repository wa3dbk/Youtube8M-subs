00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.719 
cars in his hand on any tumor spells and
so<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:22.900> was<00:05:23.020> like<00:05:23.229> he<00:05:23.650> can't<00:05:23.919> OT<00:05:24.220> came<00:05:24.400> you<00:05:24.520> next

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
so I was like he can't OT came you next

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.040 
so I was like he can't OT came you next
gen<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.910> was<00:05:25.030> pretty<00:05:25.180> pretty<00:05:25.600> confident

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
gen I was pretty pretty confident

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.870 
gen I was pretty pretty confident
couldn't<00:05:26.260> look<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.440> kami<00:05:26.710> next<00:05:26.919> turn<00:05:27.070> so<00:05:27.850> I

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
couldn't look to kami next turn so I

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.580 
couldn't look to kami next turn so I
just<00:05:28.150> did<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.450> move<00:05:28.630> when<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:29.020> was<00:05:29.140> waiting<00:05:29.380> to

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
just did that move when I was waiting to

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.310 
just did that move when I was waiting to
use<00:05:29.680> my<00:05:29.800> dark<00:05:30.040> room<00:05:30.160> dragging<00:05:30.400> next<00:05:30.760> turn<00:05:30.940> and

use my dark room dragging next turn and

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.659

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
so he activates that barrier that

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.510 
so he activates that barrier that
protects<00:05:34.060> his<00:05:34.240> fields<00:05:34.720> both<00:05:34.930> cards<00:05:35.440> I<00:05:35.740> mean
