doubt that I have glued all the bottom
laces<00:00:31.550> together<00:00:31.759> I<00:00:32.270> went<00:00:32.809> ahead<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.079> I<00:00:33.320> test

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
laces together I went ahead and I test

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.139 
laces together I went ahead and I test
fit<00:00:34.600> my<00:00:35.600> pieces<00:00:35.870> making<00:00:36.500> small<00:00:36.800> adjustments

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
fit my pieces making small adjustments

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.860 
fit my pieces making small adjustments
and<00:00:38.469> I<00:00:39.469> want<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.829> take<00:00:40.100> two<00:00:41.090> rivets<00:00:41.360> on<00:00:41.719> the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
end corners I should say I try to align

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.010 
end corners I should say I try to align
it<00:00:49.490> with<00:00:49.520> those<00:00:49.760> two<00:00:49.820> rivets<00:00:50.480> over<00:00:50.810> the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020

crossbar and there's such variation than

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.560 
crossbar and there's such variation than
the<00:00:54.380> angles<00:00:54.739> you're<00:00:54.890> going<00:00:55.040> to<00:00:55.100> find<00:00:55.310> that

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
the angles you're going to find that

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.270 
the angles you're going to find that
find<00:00:56.570> adjustments<00:00:57.320> are<00:00:57.440> needed<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.950> you<00:00:58.070> just

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
find adjustments are needed and you just

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.410 
find adjustments are needed and you just
do<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.550> by<00:01:00.130> tweaking<00:01:01.130> them<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.610> little<00:01:02.030> bit<00:01:02.210> at

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
do that by tweaking them a little bit at

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.719 
do that by tweaking them a little bit at
a<00:01:02.540> time<00:01:02.570> making<00:01:03.320> sure<00:01:03.649> not<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:03.890> over<00:01:04.369> tweak

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
a time making sure not to over tweak

them<00:01:06.820> ready<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.090> go<00:01:12.700> then<00:01:13.700> I<00:01:13.820> tacked<00:01:14.389> them<00:01:14.600> to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
them ready to go then I tacked them to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:23.630 
them ready to go then I tacked them to
just<00:01:16.210> stand<00:01:18.280> carefully
