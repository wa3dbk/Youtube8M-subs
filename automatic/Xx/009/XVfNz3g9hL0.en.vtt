thing<00:00:41.239> about<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.690> cigarette<00:00:42.110> lighters<00:00:42.500> is

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
thing about the cigarette lighters is

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.319 
thing about the cigarette lighters is
that<00:00:43.430> I<00:00:43.930> attempted<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.050> use<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:47.210> know

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
that I attempted to use the you know

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.060 
that I attempted to use the you know
like<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.539> Zippo<00:00:47.989> or<00:00:48.289> something<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.859> actually

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
like a Zippo or something that actually

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.450 
like a Zippo or something that actually
uses<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.989> fuel<00:00:51.289> that<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.649> have<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:51.980> load<00:00:52.160> in

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
uses the fuel that you have to load in

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.920 
uses the fuel that you have to load in
yourself<00:00:52.910> as<00:00:53.210> opposed<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.719> this

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
yourself as opposed to this

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.360 
yourself as opposed to this
self-contained<00:00:56.289> disposable<00:00:57.289> type<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.890> I

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
self-contained disposable type and I

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.750 
self-contained disposable type and I
found<00:00:58.609> that<00:00:59.019> I<00:01:00.019> was<00:01:00.559> having<00:01:00.710> better<00:01:01.309> success

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
found that I was having better success

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.860 
found that I was having better success
with<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.059> disposables<00:01:02.660> in<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:04.750> with<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
with the disposables in that with the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.000 
with the disposables in that with the
ones<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.230> actually<00:01:06.260> have<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.710> feel

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
ones that you actually have to feel

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.600 
ones that you actually have to feel
yourself

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
yourself

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.170 
yourself
I<00:01:07.760> wasn't<00:01:08.180> fueling<00:01:08.570> them<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.650> this<00:01:10.490> having<00:01:11.090> a

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
I wasn't fueling them so this having a

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.880 
I wasn't fueling them so this having a
disposable<00:01:11.660> lighter<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.170> just<00:01:12.410> one<00:01:12.650> less

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
disposable lighter is just one less

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.820 
disposable lighter is just one less
thing<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.250> worry<00:01:13.550> about<00:01:13.910> I<00:01:14.390> know<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:15.350> under

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
thing to worry about I know that under

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.050 
thing to worry about I know that under
most<00:01:16.070> circumstances<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:18.830> will<00:01:19.010> actually<00:01:19.910> work

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
most circumstances it will actually work

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.110 
most circumstances it will actually work
and<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.380> one<00:01:21.590> thing<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.860> won't<00:01:22.160> worry<00:01:22.580> about<00:01:22.670> is

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
and the one thing I won't worry about is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.810 
and the one thing I won't worry about is
not<00:01:23.690> having<00:01:23.930> fuel<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.650> them<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:25.370> has<00:01:25.580> never

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
not having fuel in them that has never

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.790 
not having fuel in them that has never
been<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.030> problem<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:29.030> having<00:01:29.210> my<00:01:29.360> keys<00:01:31.360> just<00:01:32.360> to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
been a problem so having my keys just to

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.540 
been a problem so having my keys just to
make<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:34.720> case<00:01:35.720> for<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:37.420> cigarette<00:01:38.420> lighters

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.250 

I<00:01:41.610> allowed<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.660> battery<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.820> die

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
I allowed the battery in this to die

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.330 
I allowed the battery in this to die
there's<00:01:46.260> actually<00:01:46.620> quite<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.830> few<00:01:46.920> batteries

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
there's actually quite a few batteries

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
there's actually quite a few batteries
in<00:01:47.580> here<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:47.970> there's<00:01:48.300> three<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:49.620> this

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
in here I think there's three and this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.110 
in here I think there's three and this
is<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.090> coastal<00:01:51.660> light<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> I'll<00:01:53.880> just

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
is the the coastal light so I'll just

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.730 
is the the coastal light so I'll just
have<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.450> replace<00:01:54.780> these<00:01:55.050> three<00:01:55.410> batteries

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
have to replace these three batteries

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.350 
have to replace these three batteries
and<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.160> one<00:01:56.370> looks<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:56.910> may<00:01:57.120> actually

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and this one looks like it may actually

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.360 
and this one looks like it may actually
have<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.690> little<00:01:57.900> bit<00:01:58.050> of<00:01:58.320> corrosion<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:59.130> there

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
have a little bit of corrosion on there

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.810 
have a little bit of corrosion on there
and<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.230> you<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.560> maintain<00:02:01.920> things

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and the more you have to maintain things

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.060 
and the more you have to maintain things
the<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.420> things<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.290> go<00:02:04.560> wrong<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.950> them

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
the more things can go wrong with them

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.420 
the more things can go wrong with them
and<00:02:08.070> that's<00:02:08.369> why<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.110> for<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.430> disposable

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and that's why I for the disposable

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.390 
and that's why I for the disposable
lighters<00:02:11.820> over<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.830> think<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> one<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.100> had

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
lighters over the think the one I had

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.840 
lighters over the think the one I had
was<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> Austrian<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.460> more<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.640> than

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
was the Austrian one and more so than

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.030 
was the Austrian one and more so than
the<00:02:18.000> Zippo<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> Zippos<00:02:18.840> were<00:02:19.080> just<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the Zippo the Zippos were just the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.600 
the Zippo the Zippos were just the
collectors<00:02:21.020> for<00:02:22.020> collecting<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.710> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
collectors for collecting and the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.220 
collectors for collecting and the
Austrian<00:02:24.390> one<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> one<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.170> I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
Austrian one was the one that I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.260 
Austrian one was the one that I
attempted<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> use<00:02:26.130> as<00:02:26.460> an<00:02:26.640> everyday<00:02:26.880> carry

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
attempted to use as an everyday carry

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.630 
attempted to use as an everyday carry
but<00:02:27.840> every<00:02:28.320> time<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.530> want<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.830> use<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.490> was

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
but every time I want to use it it was

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.530 
but every time I want to use it it was
out<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.180> fuel<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:31.700> don't<00:02:32.700> use<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.120> much<00:02:33.150> I'm

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
out of fuel I don't use it that much I'm

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.110

don't use the knife for self-defense or
at<00:03:10.620> least<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:10.950> never<00:03:11.340> really<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.760> plan

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
at least that was never really the plan

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.590 
at least that was never really the plan
to<00:03:12.570> use<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.080> self-defense<00:03:14.120> which<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.330> why

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
to use it for self-defense which is why

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.340 
to use it for self-defense which is why
I<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.380> pepper<00:03:16.770> mace<00:03:17.989> be<00:03:18.989> honest<00:03:19.260> with

you I'd rather have the pepper mace than
the<00:03:21.390> knife<00:03:22.670> because<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.910> don't<00:03:24.330> think<00:03:24.750> there's

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
the knife because I don't think there's

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.680 
the knife because I don't think there's
a<00:03:25.590> standoff<00:03:26.040> distance<00:03:26.100> with<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.360> as

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
a standoff distance with this as

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.120 
a standoff distance with this as
compared<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.320> knife<00:03:28.500> if<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.770> have<00:03:29.010> the

compared to the knife if you have the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.800 
compared to the knife if you have the
knife<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.520> mean<00:03:29.670> you're<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:29.910> close<00:03:30.209> proximity<00:03:30.390> I

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
knife I mean you're in close proximity I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.449 
knife I mean you're in close proximity I
mean<00:03:31.080> you're<00:03:31.260> really<00:03:31.590> mixing<00:03:31.800> things<00:03:32.010> up<00:03:32.400> and

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
mean you're really mixing things up and

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.670 
mean you're really mixing things up and
that's<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.570> not<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.080> way<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.230> would<00:03:34.500> like

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
that's really not the way I would like

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.070

it's<00:04:16.600> one<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.870> those<00:04:16.959> things<00:04:17.260> I'm<00:04:17.440> actually

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
it's one of those things I'm actually

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.940 
it's one of those things I'm actually
working<00:04:18.040> on<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.639> become<00:04:18.910> better<00:04:19.090> at<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:20.019> you

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
working on to become better at and you

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.830 
working on to become better at and you
know<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.940> actually<00:04:23.610> step<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:24.760> through

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
know this can actually step you through

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.300 
know this can actually step you through
you<00:04:25.840> want<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.110> go<00:04:26.229> land<00:04:26.620> yard<00:04:26.860> hitch<00:04:27.070> or

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
you want to go land yard hitch or

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.430 
you want to go land yard hitch or
something<00:04:27.610> like<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:29.139> pretty<00:04:29.350> much

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
something like that and it pretty much

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.560 
something like that and it pretty much
shows<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.070> exactly<00:04:30.400> how<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:31.270> go<00:04:31.540> about

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
shows you exactly how you can go about

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.270 
shows you exactly how you can go about
tying<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.330> find<00:04:34.720> that<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.260> be<00:04:35.290> very

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
tying it so I find that to be very

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.370 
tying it so I find that to be very
useful<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:37.389> know<00:04:37.479> it's<00:04:37.660> almost<00:04:37.780> like<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.050> study

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
useful you know it's almost like a study

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.010 
useful you know it's almost like a study
guide<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.520> know<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.880> study<00:04:40.540> guide<00:04:40.720> when

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
guide and you know a study guide when

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.320 
guide and you know a study guide when
you're<00:04:41.169> out<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.650> can<00:04:41.860> actually<00:04:42.330> practice

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
you're out you can actually practice

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.110 
you're out you can actually practice
tying<00:04:43.750> knots<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.830> see<00:04:45.310> exactly<00:04:45.639> how<00:04:45.940> it's

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
tying knots and see exactly how it's

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.990 
tying knots and see exactly how it's
done<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.950> practice<00:04:47.950> makes<00:04:48.190> perfect<00:04:48.460> as<00:04:48.820> they

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
done and practice makes perfect as they
