00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello girls today I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 put on false eyelashes so that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.200
 see super natural besides we are going to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.179
 use lashes that are super 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.610
 cheap that are these that sell on ebay 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.110
 on the Chinese pages and so on 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 first thing we're going to need is to take 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 the tab and with a scissors we are going to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.990
 trim the edges because normally 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.189
 these cheap lashes come with a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 edge that exceeds the tab once 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.619
 that have cut that edge quoted they go to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.019
 have a tab like this and they're going to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.030
 try to chop it in half 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.030
 just in half they will stay 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.700
 two halves and in this way what they are going to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.239
 do is make sure that half more 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.700
 long go in the corner of the eye first 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 for a chance to see what fits them there 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.809
 as you can see it looks perfect and now 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.270
 let's use a little bit of glue me 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.770
 I'm using this revlon stick 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 it comes as a kind of skewers 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.449
 much more comfortable but they can also 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 use the glue duo or any glue 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.359
 for lashes that have the I'm going to leave 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.519
 about 30 seconds it gets a little 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.270
 sticky and then they will apply 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.909
 just in 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 the corner of his eye this kind of 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.780
 Tabs can not be applied complete 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.479
 because it 's a lot harder because 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.070
 they are hard and they take off and finally it's a 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 problem but if you apply it from this 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.439
 way only in the corner of your eye are going to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.179
 see that it looks super natural and what 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.250
 has to do is try to pinch 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.520
 your eyelashes against your eyelashes 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.590
 false and let dry the penalty 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.209
 let's do it from the other side remember 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.490
 that in the longest part always this 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:38.399
 towards the corner of your eye and go to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.429
 try to hit the ones right on top of their 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.099
 natural eyelashes and they will be like 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.439
 these movements like ones that are said 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.110
 pinch maybe but of course without 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.179
 it hurts your lashes against 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.530
 false eyelashes once they have 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.110
 this is going to make sure that both 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.390
 eyelashes are paraditas that do not go 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.280
 down because if they are not nothing and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.229
 they will wait until the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.509
 transparent once they have this go 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.670
 to take your eyelash maker and very 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.009
 they will carefully curl their eyelashes 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.289
 natural against false eyelashes 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.090
 so they look like they're just one 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.690
 tab in this case have to wait 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.690
 that the glue 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.530
 very dry because if you are not going to come 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.240
 the tab when they try to remove the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.540
 Curler make sure that all 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.460
 tabs are inside him the curler and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.960
 they are going to press remember they do not have 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.060
 that be a very strong movement just 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.790
 so that the tab is well pegadito 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.670
 now let's apply a little bit of tab 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.120
 of mascara on your eyelashes 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.020
 natural I usually did not apply 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.760
 eyelash mascara 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.380
 false but I like to apply a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.000
 little bit of mascara tabs 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.680
 tabs on the other side so that this 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.690
 look like the thickest and most 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.790
 natural so good I hope the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.740

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.120
