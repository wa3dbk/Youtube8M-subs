00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.460 
from Cave run lake 14 years old how do
we<00:04:07.280> know

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
we know

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.100 
we know
that<00:04:07.590> we<00:04:08.280> know<00:04:08.460> that<00:04:08.700> because<00:04:08.990> starting<00:04:09.990> in

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
that we know that because starting in

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.330 
that we know that because starting in
1989<00:04:10.740> then<00:04:11.460> concluding<00:04:12.210> in<00:04:12.620> 1997<00:04:13.620> we<00:04:13.770> clipped

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
1989 then concluding in 1997 we clipped

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.319 
1989 then concluding in 1997 we clipped
different<00:04:15.150> fins<00:04:15.480> each<00:04:16.049> year<00:04:16.530> with<00:04:17.160> no<00:04:18.030> clip

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
different fins each year with no clip

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.449 
different fins each year with no clip
being<00:04:18.600> somewhere<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.109> that<00:04:19.170> process<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.920> each

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
being somewhere in that process and each

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.550 
being somewhere in that process and each
clip<00:04:20.790> correspond<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.420> a<00:04:21.510> certain<00:04:21.750> year<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.350> we

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
clip correspond to a certain year so we

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.900 
clip correspond to a certain year so we
could<00:04:22.740> tell<00:04:22.920> that<00:04:23.070> by<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.400> fish<00:04:23.610> where<00:04:23.850> it

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
could tell that by this fish where it

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.120 
could tell that by this fish where it
had<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.240> been<00:04:24.540> clipped<00:04:24.840> generally<00:04:25.740> speaking

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
had it's been clipped generally speaking

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.890 
had it's been clipped generally speaking
in<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.310> lake<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.580> average<00:04:27.030> life<00:04:27.210> man<00:04:27.720> is

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
in the lake the average life man is

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:44.430 
in the lake the average life man is
probably<00:04:28.410> around<00:04:28.710> nine<00:04:29.010> years
