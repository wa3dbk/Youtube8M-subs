Daulton<00:00:29.189> Cupid<00:00:30.080> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> those<00:00:31.890> fakes

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
Daulton Cupid this is one of those fakes

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
Daulton Cupid this is one of those fakes
that<00:00:32.579> people<00:00:33.180> don't<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.719> upset<00:00:33.899> about

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that people don't get so upset about

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.500 
that people don't get so upset about
it's<00:00:34.590> kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> interesting<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:36.059> were<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it's kind of interesting if this were a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's kind of interesting if this were a
Hinderer<00:00:37.079> or<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> fake<00:00:37.980> strider<00:00:38.399> people<00:00:39.390> would

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
Hinderer or a fake strider people would

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.139 
Hinderer or a fake strider people would
be<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:40.379> upset<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.129> video<00:00:41.430> but

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
be really upset about this video but

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.990 
be really upset about this video but
being<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.780> cupid<00:00:43.410> clone<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.520> much

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
being a cupid clone not so much

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.750 
being a cupid clone not so much
I<00:00:45.030> mean<00:00:45.270> maybe<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.899> bring<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.260> but

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
I mean maybe now that I bring it up but

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.340 
I mean maybe now that I bring it up but
generally<00:00:47.760> speaking<00:00:47.789> people<00:00:48.210> accept<00:00:48.960> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
generally speaking people accept this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.619 
generally speaking people accept this
clone<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.980> guess<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:50.820> Rob

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
clone I guess it's just because Rob

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
clone I guess it's just because Rob
Dalton's<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.710> active<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.430> least

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Dalton's not really that active at least

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.020 
Dalton's not really that active at least
in<00:00:54.230> production<00:00:55.230> models<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.129> he's<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.850> as

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
in production models and he's not as

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.770 
in production models and he's not as
well<00:00:57.210> known<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:58.160> hinder<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.460> Chris<00:01:00.210> Reeve<00:01:00.449> or

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
well known as hinder or Chris Reeve or

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170 
well known as hinder or Chris Reeve or
anything<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.520> in<00:01:02.520> fact<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.149> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
anything like that in fact a lot of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
anything like that in fact a lot of
people<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.930> own<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.439> knife<00:01:04.650> don't<00:01:04.830> even

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
people that own this knife don't even

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.450 
people that own this knife don't even
know<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.510> clone<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
know that it's a clone because it's that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640 
know that it's a clone because it's that
obscure<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> guess<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.930> anyway<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.290> we're

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
obscure I guess but anyway so we're

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
obscure I guess but anyway so we're
gonna<00:01:10.770> take<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.189> apart

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
gonna take this apart

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.140 
gonna take this apart
I<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.380> never<00:01:13.680> successfully<00:01:14.520> taken<00:01:14.880> apart

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I have never successfully taken apart

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
I have never successfully taken apart
and<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.390> back<00:01:15.540> together<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.320> single<00:01:17.189> action

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and put back together a single action

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
and put back together a single action
OTF<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> little<00:01:19.740> bit<00:01:20.659> nervous<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:22.049> little

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
OTF so I'm a little bit nervous a little

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.789 
OTF so I'm a little bit nervous a little
bit<00:01:22.320> excited<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.590> should<00:01:25.770> be

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bit excited to do that but it should be

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.920 
bit excited to do that but it should be
pretty<00:01:26.040> cool<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:27.090> I'll<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.390> able<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.750> get

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
pretty cool I think I'll be able to get

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.789 
pretty cool I think I'll be able to get
it<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.140> together<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> am<00:01:29.820> armed<00:01:30.299> with

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
it back together because I am armed with

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.880 
it back together because I am armed with
an<00:01:31.799> arsenal<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.520> knowledge<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.720> guess<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
an arsenal of knowledge now I guess I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770 
an arsenal of knowledge now I guess I
don't<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.220> I've<00:01:35.729> got<00:01:35.970> an<00:01:36.090> idea<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:36.659> I'm

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
don't know I've got an idea of how I'm

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.219 
don't know I've got an idea of how I'm
gonna<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> back<00:01:37.259> together<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:39.299> we're

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
gonna get it back together so we're

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.280 
gonna get it back together so we're
going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> begin<00:01:41.420> well<00:01:42.420> let<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:42.899> talk<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> little

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
going to begin well let me talk a little

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.639 
going to begin well let me talk a little
bit<00:01:43.619> about<00:01:43.770> double<00:01:44.520> action<00:01:44.880> OTF<00:01:45.439> meaning<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bit about double action OTF meaning the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.580 
bit about double action OTF meaning the
button<00:01:47.070> actually<00:01:47.790> deploys<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.869> retracts<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
button actually deploys and retracts the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.520 
button actually deploys and retracts the
blade<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.670> would<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.540> taking

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
blade now you would think that taking

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.580 
blade now you would think that taking
apart<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.070> double<00:01:53.520> action<00:01:53.729> OTF<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:55.020> more

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
apart a double action OTF would be more

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.389 
apart a double action OTF would be more
difficult<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:57.360> scarier<00:01:58.020> task<00:01:58.590> than<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
difficult and a scarier task than a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.459 
difficult and a scarier task than a
single<00:01:59.939> action<00:02:00.119> OTF<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> seems

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
single action OTF right because it seems

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
single action OTF right because it seems
like<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.829> more<00:02:02.640> complex<00:02:03.030> there's<00:02:03.509> more

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
like it's more complex there's more

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.050 
like it's more complex there's more
parts<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.500> Springs<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.640> all<00:02:05.880> very

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
parts more Springs which is all very

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.979 
parts more Springs which is all very
true<00:02:06.829> but<00:02:07.829> ironically<00:02:08.539> taking<00:02:09.539> apart<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
true but ironically taking apart a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.050 
true but ironically taking apart a
double<00:02:10.410> action<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.890> TF<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> actually

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
double action on TF is actually

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.120 
double action on TF is actually
a<00:02:12.090> year<00:02:12.270> or<00:02:12.510> at<00:02:13.110> least<00:02:13.260> rather<00:02:13.470> putting<00:02:14.040> it

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
a year or at least rather putting it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.540 
a year or at least rather putting it
back<00:02:14.220> together<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:15.120> easier<00:02:16.099> mainly<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.250> due

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
back together is easier mainly just due

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
back together is easier mainly just due
to<00:02:17.790> how<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.270> functions

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
to how it functions

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.490 
to how it functions
the<00:02:19.920> main<00:02:20.130> difficulty<00:02:20.580> with<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.810> single-action

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
the main difficulty with a single-action

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.920 
the main difficulty with a single-action
OTF<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:25.069> spring<00:02:26.069> tension<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.730> how<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
OTF is the spring tension and how it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.180 
OTF is the spring tension and how it
kind<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.910> works<00:02:29.910> with<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.800> whole<00:02:31.950> mechanism

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
kind of works with the whole mechanism

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.509 
kind of works with the whole mechanism
and<00:02:32.760> he<00:02:32.880> screws<00:02:33.209> are<00:02:33.800> pretty<00:02:34.800> big<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.280> little

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
and he screws are pretty big a little

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.530 
and he screws are pretty big a little
bigger<00:02:35.700> than<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.940> was<00:02:35.970> expecting

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
bigger than I was expecting

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.070 
bigger than I was expecting
no<00:02:37.260> pun<00:02:37.440> intended<00:02:37.610> well<00:02:38.610> maybe<00:02:38.849> there<00:02:39.000> was<00:02:39.150> so

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
no pun intended well maybe there was so

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.840 
no pun intended well maybe there was so
we're<00:02:40.920> using<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.610> hex<00:02:41.970> driver<00:02:42.720> here<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.850> get

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
we're using a hex driver here to get

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.660 
we're using a hex driver here to get
this<00:02:45.000> apart<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.630> doesn't<00:02:45.660> use<00:02:46.200> Torx<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.489> use

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
this apart it doesn't use Torx just use

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.330 
this apart it doesn't use Torx just use
as<00:02:47.819> your<00:02:47.970> standard<00:02:48.560> hex<00:02:49.560> I'm<00:02:49.920> trying<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.220> be

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
as your standard hex I'm trying to be

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.180 
as your standard hex I'm trying to be
careful<00:02:51.330> because<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.200> lot<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.560> these<00:02:52.650> cheaper

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
careful because a lot of these cheaper

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.150 
careful because a lot of these cheaper
knives

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
knives

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.699 
knives
use<00:02:56.160> softer<00:02:56.700> steel<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:57.989> pretty<00:02:58.200> easy<00:02:58.290> to

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
use softer steel and it's pretty easy to

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.850 
use softer steel and it's pretty easy to
strip<00:02:59.010> out<00:02:59.250> these<00:03:00.030> screws<00:03:00.480> whether<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
strip out these screws whether it's the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.070 
strip out these screws whether it's the
threads<00:03:02.280> or<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.480> actual<00:03:04.760> head<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.540> screw

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
threads or the actual head of the screw

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.539 
threads or the actual head of the screw
itself<00:03:07.880> can<00:03:08.880> get<00:03:09.030> stripped<00:03:09.390> out<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:10.549> cause

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
itself can get stripped out and cause

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.410 
itself can get stripped out and cause
problems<00:03:11.880> okay<00:03:12.690> here<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:12.989> go

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
problems okay here we go

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.340 
problems okay here we go
so<00:03:15.420> there<00:03:15.720> goes<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.140> spring<00:03:16.500> oh<00:03:18.109> here<00:03:19.109> goes

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
so there goes the spring oh here goes

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.930 
so there goes the spring oh here goes
the<00:03:20.269> main<00:03:21.269> part<00:03:21.570> here<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.609> tricky

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the main part here so this is the tricky

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.819 
the main part here so this is the tricky
part<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.329> putting<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.410> stuff<00:03:25.620> back

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
part with putting this stuff back

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.550 
part with putting this stuff back
together<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> spring<00:03:26.880> here<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.359> I<00:03:27.569> have<00:03:28.260> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
together as a spring here but I have a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.650 
together as a spring here but I have a
plan<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.370> have<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> plan

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
plan I have a plan

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.770 
plan I have a plan
so<00:03:31.140> here<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.829> front<00:03:32.040> scale<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:33.329> can<00:03:33.540> see

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
so here is the front scale you can see

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.420 
so here is the front scale you can see
and<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.049> know<00:03:34.319> part<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.799> guy's<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.220> me

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
and you know part of this guy's is me

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.069 
and you know part of this guy's is me
exploring<00:03:36.030> as<00:03:36.150> well<00:03:36.329> because<00:03:36.630> like<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.840> said<00:03:37.049> I

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
exploring as well because like I said I

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.130 
exploring as well because like I said I
haven't<00:03:37.380> taken<00:03:37.709> one<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.010> these<00:03:38.160> apart<00:03:38.220> myself

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
haven't taken one of these apart myself

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.860 
haven't taken one of these apart myself
so<00:03:40.140> I'm<00:03:40.350> pretty<00:03:40.530> curious<00:03:40.889> to<00:03:41.569> take<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.600> look

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
so I'm pretty curious to take a look

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.530 
so I'm pretty curious to take a look
inside<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.680> see<00:03:43.799> how<00:03:43.859> everything<00:03:44.280> works<00:03:44.540> here

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
inside and see how everything works here

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.280 
inside and see how everything works here
is<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.109> button<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:48.299> also<00:03:48.750> locks<00:03:49.049> up<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
is the button that also locks up the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.620 
is the button that also locks up the
blade<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.739> can<00:03:49.799> see<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.130> button<00:03:50.400> actually

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
blade you can see the button actually

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.259 
blade you can see the button actually
goes<00:03:51.630> inside<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.170> middle<00:03:52.470> here<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.269> that

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
goes inside the middle here and that

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.259 
goes inside the middle here and that
what<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.840> what<00:03:55.079> allows<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.709> blade<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.000> lock<00:03:57.000> up

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
what is what allows the blade to lock up

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.849 
what is what allows the blade to lock up
so<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:58.049> see<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.500> lock<00:03:58.680> position

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
so you can see it's in the lock position

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.180 
so you can see it's in the lock position
now<00:03:59.280> when<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.120> press<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.540> button<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:02.130> goes

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
now when you press the button this goes

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.059 
now when you press the button this goes
through<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.540> allows<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:05.519> blade<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.850> travel

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
through and allows the blade to travel

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.340 
through and allows the blade to travel
this<00:04:08.069> way<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.420> why<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.600> need<00:04:10.049> this

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
this way so that is why you need this

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.890 
this way so that is why you need this
groove<00:04:10.950> cut<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.519> middle<00:04:11.850> because<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
groove cut in the middle because the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.650 
groove cut in the middle because the
blade<00:04:13.139> actually<00:04:13.590> travels<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:15.060> between<00:04:15.450> this

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
blade actually travels in between this

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.520 
blade actually travels in between this
button<00:04:16.019> here<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:16.470> when<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:17.579> lock<00:04:17.789> it<00:04:17.970> up<00:04:18.530> this

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
button here and when you lock it up this

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.920 
button here and when you lock it up this
pushes<00:04:20.010> forward

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
pushes forward

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.689 
pushes forward
and<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.590> provides<00:04:24.199> your<00:04:25.199> lockup<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:25.860> pretty

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
and that provides your lockup so pretty

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.260 
and that provides your lockup so pretty
solid<00:04:27.419> lockup<00:04:27.930> compared<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:29.660> like<00:04:30.660> a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
solid lockup compared to like a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.529 
solid lockup compared to like a
single-action<00:04:33.710> OTF<00:04:34.710> we're<00:04:35.100> having<00:04:35.310> a

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
single-action OTF we're having a

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.939 
single-action OTF we're having a
double-action<00:04:36.539> OTF<00:04:37.110> which<00:04:37.350> uses<00:04:37.770> these

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
double-action OTF which uses these

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.939 
double-action OTF which uses these
little<00:04:38.310> gates<00:04:38.639> is<00:04:39.030> what<00:04:39.210> keeps<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.680> blade

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
little gates is what keeps the the blade

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.400 
little gates is what keeps the the blade
open<00:04:41.250> so<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.360> get<00:04:42.479> a<00:04:42.509> little<00:04:42.720> bit<00:04:42.810> more<00:04:42.960> salted

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
open so you get a little bit more salted

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.800 
open so you get a little bit more salted
lockup<00:04:43.800> when<00:04:44.009> you're<00:04:44.330> using<00:04:45.330> one<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.660> these

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.260 
lockup when you're using one of these
here<00:04:46.199> so<00:04:46.740> let's<00:04:46.889> put<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.280> inside<00:04:48.000> here<00:04:50.270> so

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
here so let's put this inside here so

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.129 
here so let's put this inside here so
here<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.840> where<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.410> button<00:04:52.800> goes<00:04:54.139> right

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
here is where the button goes right

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.770 
here is where the button goes right
inside<00:04:55.320> there<00:04:55.919> so<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.699> is<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.539> locked

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
inside there so this is the locked

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.580 
inside there so this is the locked
position

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
position

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.600

so then the button pops out somewhat you
can<00:05:14.820> see<00:05:14.970> right<00:05:15.120> there<00:05:15.389> and<00:05:15.599> this<00:05:16.199> is<00:05:16.259> how<00:05:16.440> it's

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
can see right there and this is how it's

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.450 
can see right there and this is how it's
locked<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:17.340> if<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.030> look<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:20.160> pull<00:05:20.370> this

locked and if you look and pull this
apart<00:05:20.610> that's<00:05:21.330> what<00:05:21.599> this<00:05:21.780> groove<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.830> on<00:05:23.039> this

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
apart that's what this groove is on this

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.779 
apart that's what this groove is on this
side<00:05:23.490> right<00:05:23.759> there<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:25.080> when<00:05:25.199> it's<00:05:25.320> closed<00:05:25.789> the

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
button pushes up into that groove and

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.570 
button pushes up into that groove and
that's<00:05:28.740> what<00:05:28.889> keeps<00:05:29.010> it<00:05:29.190> in<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.340> lock

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
that's what keeps it in the lock

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.670 
that's what keeps it in the lock
position<00:05:29.990> then<00:05:30.990> when<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.289> press<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.650> button

pushes it out

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.899 
pushes it out
can<00:05:33.510> travel<00:05:33.720> forward<00:05:34.340> same<00:05:35.340> thing<00:05:35.550> happens

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
can travel forward same thing happens

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.270 
can travel forward same thing happens
when<00:05:36.060> it's<00:05:36.240> open<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:37.650> yeah<00:05:37.800> pretty<00:05:38.010> cool

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
when it's open so yeah pretty cool

when it's open so yeah pretty cool
pretty<00:05:39.210> stout<00:05:39.539> design<00:05:40.020> I<00:05:40.050> mean<00:05:40.349> you<00:05:40.590> know<00:05:40.710> for

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
pretty stout design I mean you know for

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.610 
pretty stout design I mean you know for
what<00:05:41.130> it<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.419> which<00:05:42.419> is<00:05:42.599> why<00:05:42.720> generally<00:05:43.409> people

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
what it is which is why generally people

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.680 
what it is which is why generally people
say<00:05:43.949> if<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.310> want<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.520> know<00:05:44.639> TF<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.360> you<00:05:45.510> want

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
say if you want to know TF and you want

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.490 
say if you want to know TF and you want
it<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:45.870> be<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:47.220> most<00:05:47.430> reliable<00:05:48.110> version<00:05:49.110> of<00:05:49.409> an

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
it to be the most reliable version of an

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.800 
it to be the most reliable version of an
RTF<00:05:49.949> and<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.460> most<00:05:50.639> powerful<00:05:51.030> with<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.659> non

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
RTF and the most powerful with the non

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.830 
RTF and the most powerful with the non
solid<00:05:52.169> lock<00:05:52.349> up<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:53.490> single<00:05:53.820> action<00:05:54.090> is<00:05:54.630> the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
solid lock up the single action is the

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.080 
solid lock up the single action is the
way<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.020> go<00:05:55.259> because<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:55.919> can<00:05:56.159> have<00:05:56.340> much<00:05:57.060> more

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
way to go because you can have much more

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.839 
way to go because you can have much more
spring<00:05:57.720> tension<00:05:58.169> and<00:05:58.349> then<00:05:58.919> you<00:05:59.039> have<00:05:59.250> the

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
spring tension and then you have the

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.050 
spring tension and then you have the
ability<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.270> have<00:06:00.570> a<00:06:00.599> stronger<00:06:01.550> style<00:06:02.550> lock<00:06:02.820> up

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
ability to have a stronger style lock up

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.399 
ability to have a stronger style lock up
than<00:06:03.650> otherwise<00:06:04.650> now<00:06:05.460> if<00:06:05.580> this<00:06:05.789> had<00:06:06.150> a<00:06:08.030> safety

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
than otherwise now if this had a safety

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.629 
than otherwise now if this had a safety
safety<00:06:10.409> would<00:06:10.500> be<00:06:10.560> right<00:06:10.889> here<00:06:10.919> at<00:06:11.370> wish<00:06:11.490> it

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
safety would be right here at wish it

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.760 
safety would be right here at wish it
did<00:06:11.789> have<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:11.970> safety<00:06:12.270> some<00:06:12.780> versions<00:06:13.199> of<00:06:13.349> the

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
did have a safety some versions of the

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.820 
did have a safety some versions of the
original<00:06:13.889> dalton<00:06:14.669> Cupid<00:06:15.360> have<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.110> safety<00:06:16.590> lady

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
original dalton Cupid have a safety lady

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.700 
original dalton Cupid have a safety lady
later<00:06:17.340> versions<00:06:17.990> basically<00:06:18.990> all<00:06:19.110> it<00:06:19.289> does<00:06:19.470> is

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
later versions basically all it does is

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.100 
later versions basically all it does is
it<00:06:19.740> just<00:06:19.860> slides<00:06:20.310> something<00:06:20.880> underneath<00:06:21.870> this

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
it just slides something underneath this

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.529 
it just slides something underneath this
button<00:06:22.470> which<00:06:22.650> prevents<00:06:23.039> it<00:06:23.099> from<00:06:23.220> being

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
button which prevents it from being

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.320 
button which prevents it from being
depressed<00:06:24.979> so<00:06:25.979> that's<00:06:26.220> it<00:06:26.430> guys<00:06:26.460> this<00:06:27.000> is

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
depressed so that's it guys this is

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.159 
depressed so that's it guys this is
inside<00:06:28.020> of<00:06:28.380> a<00:06:28.500> single<00:06:28.560> action<00:06:29.630> OTF<00:06:30.630> knife<00:06:30.840> I

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
inside of a single action OTF knife I

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.340 
inside of a single action OTF knife I
was<00:06:31.710> thinking<00:06:32.070> about<00:06:32.750> possibly

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
was thinking about possibly

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.510 
was thinking about possibly
doing<00:06:36.350> a<00:06:36.410> little<00:06:36.590> work<00:06:37.070> maybe<00:06:37.310> a<00:06:37.400> little

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
doing a little work maybe a little

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.580 
doing a little work maybe a little
dremel<00:06:37.970> work<00:06:38.120> to<00:06:38.330> it<00:06:38.480> trying<00:06:39.020> to<00:06:39.080> smooth<00:06:39.440> it

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
dremel work to it trying to smooth it

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.060 
dremel work to it trying to smooth it
out<00:06:39.740> it's<00:06:40.520> not<00:06:40.790> the<00:06:41.150> smoothest<00:06:41.480> knife<00:06:42.070> out

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
out it's not the smoothest knife out

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.370 
out it's not the smoothest knife out
there<00:06:43.430> so<00:06:44.330> it's<00:06:44.480> thinking<00:06:44.660> about<00:06:44.780> doing<00:06:45.260> that

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
there so it's thinking about doing that

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.440 
there so it's thinking about doing that
I<00:06:45.650> may<00:06:45.800> do<00:06:45.860> that<00:06:46.100> it<00:06:46.310> may<00:06:46.430> not<00:06:46.580> do<00:06:46.760> that<00:06:46.910> but

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
I may do that it may not do that but

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.710 
I may do that it may not do that but
either<00:06:47.630> way<00:06:47.900> I<00:06:48.160> need<00:06:49.160> to<00:06:49.340> get<00:06:49.910> me<00:06:50.150> a<00:06:50.180> tool

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
either way I need to get me a tool
