maybe what is the best for some of the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.179 
maybe what is the best for some of the
situations<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.509> might<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> photo<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.259> just

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
is a tutorial so with this basically

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.249 
is a tutorial so with this basically
gives<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.579> trims<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.600> how<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> take

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
gives you trims you up on how to take

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.920 
gives you trims you up on how to take
really<00:01:58.710> good<00:01:58.890> photos<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.579> what<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.780> do

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
really good photos and what you can do

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.679 
really good photos and what you can do
is<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.340> click<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.600> not

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
is if you just click on one so it's not

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.690 
is if you just click on one so it's not
an<00:02:03.840> experiment<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.380> exposure<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:05.520> show<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
an experiment with exposure can show you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.449 
an experiment with exposure can show you
the<00:02:05.790> different<00:02:06.240> environment<00:02:06.780> about<00:02:06.869> exposure

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
the different environment about exposure

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.380 
the different environment about exposure
you<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.789> playing<00:02:09.149> around<00:02:09.270> with

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you know so I'm just playing around with

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.790 
you know so I'm just playing around with
it<00:02:09.539> how<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.259> give<00:02:10.410> different<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
it how it can give different and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.930 
it how it can give different and
different<00:02:12.100> look<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.490> photograph<00:02:12.910> you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
different look on the photograph you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.870 
different look on the photograph you
take<00:02:13.240> so<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.590> terms<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.130> camera<00:02:15.340> like<00:02:15.610> even

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
take so in terms of a camera like even

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.430 
take so in terms of a camera like even
if<00:02:15.940> you're<00:02:16.060> not<00:02:16.120> professional<00:02:16.440> definitely

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
if you're not professional definitely

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
here the best shot basically takes a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.340 
here the best shot basically takes a
burst<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.520> photos<00:02:31.000> quite<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> basic<00:02:32.110> feature

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
burst of photos quite a basic feature

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.660 
burst of photos quite a basic feature
that's<00:02:32.560> available<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:33.100> plenty<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.400> smart

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
that's available in plenty of smart

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.240 
that's available in plenty of smart
phones<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.260> see<00:02:35.440> me<00:02:35.590> running<00:02:35.890> there<00:02:36.070> and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
phones you can see me running there and

phones you can see me running there and
what<00:02:36.730> makes<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.000> bit<00:02:37.120> more<00:02:37.270> fun<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
what makes a bit more fun is that the

what makes a bit more fun is that the
action<00:02:39.100> shop<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.980> basically<00:02:41.980> puts

action shop so with this basically puts
them<00:02:42.400> all<00:02:42.550> together<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:43.060> one<00:02:43.090> photo<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.560> we

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
them all together in one photo and we

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.920 
them all together in one photo and we
can<00:02:44.950> even<00:02:45.070> add<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.400> fade<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.090> choose<00:02:46.750> which

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
can even add on a fade and choose which

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.440 
can even add on a fade and choose which
one<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.230> want<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.560> be<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.730> main<00:02:48.970> focus

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
one you want to be the the main focus

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.250 
one you want to be the the main focus
you<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.260> see<00:02:50.590> their<00:02:51.630> overall<00:02:52.630> yeah<00:02:52.930> pretty

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
you can see their overall yeah pretty

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.290 
you can see their overall yeah pretty
cool<00:02:53.560> don't<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.800> think

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
cool don't you think

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.390 
cool don't you think
so<00:02:55.300> as<00:02:55.720> well<00:02:55.870> as<00:02:55.990> that<00:02:56.200> if<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.950> wanna<00:02:57.100> makes<00:02:57.280> it

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
so as well as that if you wanna makes it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.490 
so as well as that if you wanna makes it
yourself<00:02:57.850> look<00:02:58.000> even<00:02:58.210> faster<00:02:58.570> motion<00:02:58.900> focus

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
yourself look even faster motion focus

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.350 
yourself look even faster motion focus
ok<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.250> now<00:03:00.400> knows<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.120> main

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
ok so it now knows that this is the main

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.850 
ok so it now knows that this is the main
you<00:03:01.810> know<00:03:01.960> this<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.380> main<00:03:02.500> thing<00:03:02.740> that's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
you know this is the main thing that's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.920 
you know this is the main thing that's
changing<00:03:03.220> within<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.520> photo<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.630> can<00:03:04.810> make

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
changing within the photo you can make

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.900 
changing within the photo you can make
everything<00:03:05.350> else<00:03:05.500> around<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:06.070> really<00:03:06.580> blurry

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
everything else around it really blurry

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.730 
everything else around it really blurry
or<00:03:07.650> less<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:10.420> for<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.690> quick<00:03:10.990> switch

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
or less so just for that quick switch

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.880 
or less so just for that quick switch
there<00:03:12.630> in<00:03:13.630> sort<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.870> make<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.140> up<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.710> that's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
there in sort of make it up so that's

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.060 
there in sort of make it up so that's
pretty<00:03:15.100> cool<00:03:15.360> as<00:03:16.360> well<00:03:16.570> as<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.930> it's<00:03:17.890> going

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
pretty cool as well as that it's going

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.170 
pretty cool as well as that it's going
through<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.250> features<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:18.940> also<00:03:19.090> have

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
through the features you do also have

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.199 
through the features you do also have
change<00:03:19.630> faces<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.830> I'm<00:03:21.280> basically<00:03:21.790> if<00:03:22.090> is

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
change faces so I'm basically if is

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.210 
change faces so I'm basically if is
group<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.020> photo<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:24.010> sort<00:03:24.190> of

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
group of you in a photo you can sort of

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.400 
group of you in a photo you can sort of
optimize<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.970> using<00:03:25.360> those<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.930> burst<00:03:26.230> of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410
