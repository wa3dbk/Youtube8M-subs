linked it to leech one but I kind of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.330

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
was weird because in this sort of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240 
was weird because in this sort of
midfield<00:02:02.640> bracket<00:02:03.329> guess<00:02:04.079> you'd<00:02:04.290> say<00:02:04.560> he's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
midfield bracket guess you'd say he's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.560 
midfield bracket guess you'd say he's
the<00:02:05.280> only<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.820> high<00:02:05.969> attacking<00:02:06.420> work

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the only one with high attacking work

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
the only one with high attacking work
great<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.869> sometimes<00:02:07.110> he'd<00:02:07.860> push<00:02:08.190> forward

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
great and sometimes he'd push forward

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
great and sometimes he'd push forward
more<00:02:08.759> than<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> strikers<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> was<00:02:10.050> very

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
more than the strikers that it was very

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.809 
more than the strikers that it was very
strange<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:10.920> he's<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> quickest

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
strange because he's not the quickest

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.730 
strange because he's not the quickest
but<00:02:12.270> isn't<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.599> slow<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.200> he<00:02:13.440> was

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
but isn't that slow like he was

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
but isn't that slow like he was
actually<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.190> bad<00:02:14.370> he's<00:02:14.940> shooting

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300

absolutely love this team I think it's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.670 
absolutely love this team I think it's
brilliant<00:03:35.250> but<00:03:35.610> there<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.360> one<00:03:36.390> problem<00:03:37.020> as

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
brilliant but there was one problem as

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.260 
brilliant but there was one problem as
Tim<00:03:37.800> not<00:03:37.950> one<00:03:38.130> major<00:03:38.400> problem<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.850> high

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
Tim not one major problem the high

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.300 
Tim not one major problem the high
attacking<00:03:39.660> work<00:03:39.810> rates<00:03:39.990> being<00:03:40.710> kind<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.160> like

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
attacking work rates being kind of like

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.890 
attacking work rates being kind of like
non-existent<00:03:41.520> that's<00:03:42.450> not<00:03:42.630> really<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> problem

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
non-existent that's not really a problem

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.900 
non-existent that's not really a problem
I<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.290> work<00:03:43.380> around<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.800> can<00:03:44.010> dribble<00:03:44.220> but

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
I can work around that I can dribble but

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.380 
I can work around that I can dribble but
Defoe<00:03:45.840> gets<00:03:46.230> pushed<00:03:46.560> off<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.950> ball<00:03:47.160> far<00:03:48.120> too

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
Defoe gets pushed off the ball far too

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.850 
Defoe gets pushed off the ball far too
much<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.810> guess<00:03:49.080> you'd<00:03:49.230> kind<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.440> expect<00:03:49.770> that

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
much I guess you'd kind of expect that

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.030 
much I guess you'd kind of expect that
like<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.670> was<00:03:50.910> something<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.600> kind<00:03:51.780> of

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
like that was something that I kind of

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.620 
like that was something that I kind of
expected<00:03:53.040> said<00:03:53.310> she<00:03:53.460> was<00:03:53.610> incredible<00:03:54.240> he's<00:03:54.420> so

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
expected said she was incredible he's so

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.450 
expected said she was incredible he's so
so<00:03:54.840> good<00:03:54.960> a<00:03:55.020> reasonable<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.590> phenomenal

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
so good a reasonable for phenomenal

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.730 
so good a reasonable for phenomenal
player<00:03:56.640> very<00:03:57.210> very<00:03:57.450> good<00:03:57.660> at<00:03:57.870> strike<00:03:58.230> as<00:03:58.500> well

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
player very very good at strike as well

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.550 
player very very good at strike as well
so<00:03:58.920> quick<00:03:59.220> finishing<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.180> excellent<00:04:00.810> at<00:04:01.200> his

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
so quick finishing is excellent at his

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.490 
so quick finishing is excellent at his
physical<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.160> just<00:04:03.000> good<00:04:03.270> enough<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.290> hold

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
physical is just good enough to to hold

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.890 
physical is just good enough to to hold
off<00:04:04.620> players<00:04:04.920> but<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.250> FO<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.760> FO<00:04:06.090> really<00:04:06.750> did

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
off players but the FO the FO really did

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.380 
off players but the FO the FO really did
get<00:04:07.080> pushed<00:04:07.320> off<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:08.520> reason<00:04:08.910> why<00:04:09.090> I

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
get pushed off and the reason why I

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.600 
get pushed off and the reason why I
can't<00:04:09.510> say<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> perfect<00:04:11.130> team<00:04:11.310> is

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
can't say this is a perfect team is

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.880 
can't say this is a perfect team is
quite<00:04:12.270> simply<00:04:12.600> because<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.080> foe<00:04:13.290> gets<00:04:13.620> pushed

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
quite simply because the foe gets pushed

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.640 
quite simply because the foe gets pushed
off<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.220> ball<00:04:14.400> far<00:04:15.180> far<00:04:15.540> too<00:04:15.600> much<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.500> is

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
off the ball far far too much and it is

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.260 
off the ball far far too much and it is
genuinely<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.580> problem<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.060> is

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
genuinely a problem like that is

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.479 
genuinely a problem like that is
actually<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.840> problem<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.920> team<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.190> there

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
actually a problem of the team and there

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.790 
actually a problem of the team and there
is<00:04:20.580> really<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> way<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.239> get<00:04:21.570> around<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:22.080> but

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
is really a way to get around that but

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.370 
is really a way to get around that but
the<00:04:23.580> team<00:04:23.970> is<00:04:24.500> really<00:04:25.500> really

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
the team is really really

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.710 
the team is really really
good<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.710> whilst<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.670> is<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.790> problem<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.180> am<00:04:28.420> I'm

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
good and whilst it is a problem I am I'm

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.860 
good and whilst it is a problem I am I'm
being<00:04:29.170> honest<00:04:29.440> it<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.800> problem<00:04:30.580> but<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.240> FIFA

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
being honest it is a problem but on FIFA

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.960 
being honest it is a problem but on FIFA
15<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.500> feel<00:04:32.830> like<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.490> only<00:04:33.670> game

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
15 I feel like this is the only game

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.540 
15 I feel like this is the only game
where<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.300> player<00:04:34.750> like<00:04:34.870> Defoe<00:04:35.500> would<00:04:36.160> actually

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
where a player like Defoe would actually

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.640 
where a player like Defoe would actually
be<00:04:36.790> okay<00:04:37.120> that's<00:04:37.360> not<00:04:37.480> like<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.720> crazy<00:04:38.290> big

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
be okay that's not like a crazy big

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.680 
be okay that's not like a crazy big
problem<00:04:38.890> because<00:04:38.980> if<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.760> get<00:04:39.940> past<00:04:40.270> them

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
problem because if you get past them

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.560 
problem because if you get past them
Defoe<00:04:41.470> is<00:04:41.620> fantastic<00:04:42.250> if<00:04:42.370> you're<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.820> trying

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
Defoe is fantastic if you're like trying

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.540 
Defoe is fantastic if you're like trying
to<00:04:43.720> jostle<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.260> trying<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.070> shrug<00:04:45.220> off<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
to jostle and trying to shrug off the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.520 
to jostle and trying to shrug off the
ball<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:46.120> ain't<00:04:46.480> gonna<00:04:46.630> happen<00:04:46.810> there<00:04:47.170> is<00:04:47.290> no

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
ball it ain't gonna happen there is no

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.590 
ball it ain't gonna happen there is no
way<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.580> foe<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:48.940> going<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.150> shrug<00:04:49.330> someone

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
way the foe is going to shrug someone

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.750 
way the foe is going to shrug someone
off<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.780> ball<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.260> if<00:04:50.500> you<00:04:50.650> get<00:04:50.800> ahead<00:04:51.130> it's

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
off the ball but if you get ahead it's

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.150 
off the ball but if you get ahead it's
gonna<00:04:52.060> be<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> pretty<00:04:52.570> clean<00:04:53.350> break<00:04:53.770> because

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
gonna be a pretty clean break because

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.710 
gonna be a pretty clean break because
it's<00:04:54.550> dribbling<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.090> excellent<00:04:55.540> his

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
it's dribbling is excellent his

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.020 
it's dribbling is excellent his
accelerations<00:04:56.350> really<00:04:56.590> decent<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.160> it's

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
accelerations really decent and it's

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.780 
accelerations really decent and it's
just<00:04:58.450> it's<00:04:58.630> not<00:04:58.810> bad<00:04:59.050> like<00:04:59.320> it<00:04:59.560> can<00:05:00.430> be<00:05:00.760> a

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
just it's not bad like it can be a

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.950 
just it's not bad like it can be a

two<00:05:03.970> games<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.510> did<00:05:04.960> learn<00:05:05.140> how<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:05.500> get<00:05:05.770> around

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.290 
and that's why I think the team is
genuinely<00:05:08.290> really<00:05:08.740> really<00:05:09.160> competitive<00:05:10.000> and
