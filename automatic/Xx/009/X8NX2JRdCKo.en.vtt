you<00:00:00.390> know<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.599> ways<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.989> punch<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.290> hole<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.500> the

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
you know the ways to punch a hole in the

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.740 
you know the ways to punch a hole in the
ice<00:00:01.829> has<00:00:02.070> really<00:00:02.370> changed<00:00:02.760> dramatically

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
ice has really changed dramatically

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.690 
ice has really changed dramatically
throughout<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.410> years<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:05.130> know<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.339> started

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
throughout the years you know we started

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.909 
throughout the years you know we started
out<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.150> chisel<00:00:06.690> design<00:00:07.080> which<00:00:07.740> is

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
out with this chisel design which is

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.740 
out with this chisel design which is
great<00:00:08.189> for<00:00:08.460> early<00:00:08.880> ice<00:00:09.059> or<00:00:09.389> thin<00:00:09.599> ice

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
great for early ice or thin ice

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.360 
great for early ice or thin ice
conditions<00:00:10.019> but<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.620> really<00:00:10.830> gives<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
conditions but it really gives you a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.549 
conditions but it really gives you a
kind<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.849> ragged<00:00:12.150> hole<00:00:12.570> especially<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
kind of a ragged hole especially for the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.860 
kind of a ragged hole especially for the
modern<00:00:13.889> day<00:00:14.040> ice<00:00:14.250> angler<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.450> know<00:00:15.570> then<00:00:15.750> we

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
modern day ice angler you know then we

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.710 
modern day ice angler you know then we
evolved<00:00:16.379> somewhat<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.789> spoon<00:00:18.420> auger

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
evolved somewhat of a a spoon auger

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.099 
evolved somewhat of a a spoon auger
design<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.760> as<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.000> spoon<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> drill

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
design and as that spoon are you a drill

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.290 
design and as that spoon are you a drill
in<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.100> great<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.820> know<00:00:23.910> I've<00:00:24.060> had

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
in it was great and you know I've had

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.480 
in it was great and you know I've had
the<00:00:24.449> pleasure<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.840> using<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.470> spoon<00:00:25.740> auger<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the pleasure of using a spoon auger the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.089 
the pleasure of using a spoon auger the
problem<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> spoon<00:00:27.330> auger<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.769> bits

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
problem with the spoon auger is the bits

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
problem with the spoon auger is the bits
kind<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.490> cumbersome<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:30.750> does

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
kind of cumbersome and it really does

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.040 
kind of cumbersome and it really does
easily<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:32.160> allowing<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> drill<00:00:33.300> several

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
easily not allowing you to drill several

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.130 
easily not allowing you to drill several
holes<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> row

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.650 
Strikemaster company in 1968 actually
imported<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.460> hand<00:00:42.090> drill<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:43.290> Sweden<00:00:43.890> this

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
imported a hand drill from Sweden this

imported a hand drill from Sweden this
design<00:00:45.770> revolutionized<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.100> way<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.430> fish

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
design revolutionized the way we fish

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
design revolutionized the way we fish
today<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.090> allowed<00:00:48.600> us<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:49.079> today's<00:00:49.469> ice

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
today and allowed us as today's ice

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
auger technology you know hand augers

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.140 
auger technology you know hand augers
are<00:01:47.290> great<00:01:47.650> most<00:01:48.640> parts<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.060> country

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
are great most parts of the country

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150 
are great most parts of the country
that's<00:01:49.660> all<00:01:49.810> you<00:01:49.930> need<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:50.260> a<00:01:50.290> hand<00:01:50.590> auger<00:01:50.800> and

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
that's all you need is a hand auger and

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.820 
that's all you need is a hand auger and
that<00:01:51.850> laser<00:01:52.390> hand<00:01:52.750> auger<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.410> ultimate

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
that laser hand auger is the ultimate

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.070 
that laser hand auger is the ultimate
tool<00:01:54.040> now<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.060> northern<00:01:55.480> tier<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.990> the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
tool now in the northern tier of the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.220 
tool now in the northern tier of the
ice-fishing<00:01:56.500> part<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.190> country<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:58.780> really

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
ice-fishing part of country you really

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.850 
ice-fishing part of country you really
need<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.680> gas<00:02:00.010> auger<00:02:00.370> so<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.500> 1969

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
need a gas auger so in 1969

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.530 
need a gas auger so in 1969

the smoke you know everybody loves that
two-stroke<00:02:37.450> motor<00:02:38.380> technology<00:02:39.130> but<00:02:39.310> the

two-stroke motor technology but the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.760 
two-stroke motor technology but the
problem<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.540> smoke<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.620> a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
problem is is it's a smoke this is a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.640 
problem is is it's a smoke this is a
greener<00:02:42.160> motor<00:02:42.520> less<00:02:43.240> smoke<00:02:43.630> allows<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.560> to
