00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.130 
event also on there are some siege
weapons<00:00:40.489> back<00:00:40.760> there<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.300> some<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:42.079> those

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.900 
weapons back there to some of those
cannons<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:42.950> then<00:00:43.280> there's<00:00:43.460> two<00:00:43.640> on<00:00:43.789> that

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
cannons and then there's two on that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.310 
cannons and then there's two on that
side<00:00:43.969> there<00:00:44.360> also<00:00:46.660> so<00:00:47.660> yeah<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.960> mean<00:00:47.989> that's

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
side there also so yeah I mean that's

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.959 
side there also so yeah I mean that's
pretty<00:00:48.530> interesting<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:49.280> guess<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:49.579> is<00:00:49.760> one

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
pretty interesting I guess this is one

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.810 
pretty interesting I guess this is one
of<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.149> Dragons<00:00:50.500> again<00:00:51.500> called<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:52.460> shatter

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
of the Dragons again called this shatter

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.369 
of the Dragons again called this shatter
or<00:00:54.879> shatter<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.030> think<00:00:56.329> would<00:00:56.480> be<00:00:56.870> probably

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
or shatter I think would be probably

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.580 
or shatter I think would be probably
just<00:00:57.829> name<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.070> call<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.570> but<00:00:59.570> um<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.320> see<00:01:00.469> that

you can see the 25 and I I mean he's
still<00:02:09.060> not<00:02:10.060> going<00:02:10.509> down<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:11.370> nature

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.380 

everything<00:02:17.860> that's<00:02:18.190> been<00:02:18.310> animal<00:02:18.730> must<00:02:19.240> be

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
so we'll see it get expired a two-hour

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.960 
so we'll see it get expired a two-hour
special<00:02:25.630> attack<00:02:26.200> here<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.570> what's<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.620> here

pulsing crystal sure that that that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
pulsing crystal sure that that that
yields<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.180> about<00:02:34.450> their<00:02:36.000> my<00:02:37.000> tacking<00:02:37.390> we

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
not even too sure if they're because

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.099 
not even too sure if they're because
what<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> know<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.669> like<00:03:10.359> they<00:03:10.569> didn't<00:03:10.870> really

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
what I know of like they didn't really

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.670 
what I know of like they didn't really
use<00:03:11.290> all<00:03:11.829> of<00:03:12.189> the<00:03:12.310> map<00:03:12.519> space<00:03:12.909> here<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.680> there's

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
use all of the map space here so there's

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.830 
use all of the map space here so there's
lots<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:15.069> Matt<00:03:15.250> space<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.909> not<00:03:16.150> used<00:03:16.540> or

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
lots of Matt space that is not used or

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.539 
lots of Matt space that is not used or
it's<00:03:16.989> me<00:03:17.200> part<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.590> quests<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.219> think<00:03:18.430> this

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
it's me part of quests like I think this

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.520 
it's me part of quests like I think this
area<00:03:18.730> here<00:03:18.969> is<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.359> North<00:03:19.689> dusty<00:03:20.139> Eisen<00:03:20.409> or

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
area here is I the North dusty Eisen or

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.039 
area here is I the North dusty Eisen or
330<00:03:20.949> so<00:03:21.159> there's<00:03:22.030> lots<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.359> places<00:03:22.599> that

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
330 so there's lots of places that

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.709 
330 so there's lots of places that
weren't<00:03:23.230> really<00:03:23.469> used<00:03:23.799> at<00:03:23.980> all<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:24.719> I'm

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:25.719 
weren't really used at all so I'm

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.979 
weren't really used at all so I'm
wondering<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.439> maybe<00:03:26.949> this<00:03:27.129> places<00:03:27.549> will<00:03:27.730> be

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
wondering that maybe this places will be

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.270 
wondering that maybe this places will be
used<00:03:28.989> either<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.409> the<00:03:29.620> future<00:03:29.980> for<00:03:30.010> an

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
used either in the future for an

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.030 
used either in the future for an
expansion<00:03:30.699> or<00:03:31.659> they<00:03:32.620> may<00:03:32.799> add<00:03:33.010> stuff<00:03:33.400> um<00:03:35.040> yeah

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
expansion or they may add stuff um yeah

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.000 
expansion or they may add stuff um yeah
they<00:03:36.250> may<00:03:36.370> just<00:03:36.579> add<00:03:36.760> stuff<00:03:37.060> here<00:03:37.389> come<00:03:38.230> in

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
they may just add stuff here come in

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.619 
they may just add stuff here come in
middle<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.819> bay<00:03:39.969> there<00:03:40.209> might<00:03:40.359> be<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.510> big

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
middle of the bay there might be a big

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.240 
middle of the bay there might be a big
cock<00:03:40.840> coming<00:03:41.230> in<00:03:41.319> like<00:03:41.409> a<00:03:41.530> monkey<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.159> know

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
cock coming in like a monkey so you know

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.729 
cock coming in like a monkey so you know
so<00:03:43.120> I'd<00:03:43.359> skipped<00:03:43.689> over<00:03:43.780> my<00:03:44.019> fan<00:03:44.230> great<00:03:44.500> news

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
too and so the about I'd probably say

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.270 
too and so the about I'd probably say
maybe<00:03:53.349> about<00:03:54.750> ten<00:03:55.750> percent<00:03:55.900> left<00:03:56.349> here<00:03:56.620> so

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
maybe about ten percent left here so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.879 
maybe about ten percent left here so
