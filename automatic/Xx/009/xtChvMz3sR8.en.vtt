00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
bridge to get the Triple H and it's not

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.860

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
another example and that was it's

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.610 
another example and that was it's
something<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.209> crowd<00:03:06.480> wanted<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.200> if

such a big level of anticipation fans

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.449 
such a big level of anticipation fans
are<00:03:28.199> going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.349> give<00:03:28.530> for<00:03:28.769> something<00:03:29.099> before

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
are going to give for something before

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.280 
are going to give for something before
they<00:03:29.669> do<00:03:29.729> somewhat<00:03:30.389> get<00:03:30.540> flat<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.199> when

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
they do somewhat get flat on it and when

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.809 
they do somewhat get flat on it and when
you're<00:03:31.409> doing<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.979> many<00:03:32.159> hours<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.549> television

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819

every week I think the attention span is

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.589 
every week I think the attention span is
that<00:03:35.010> much<00:03:35.189> shorter<00:03:35.579> yeah<00:03:35.939> case<00:03:36.389> in<00:03:36.569> point

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
that much shorter yeah case in point

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.509 
that much shorter yeah case in point
