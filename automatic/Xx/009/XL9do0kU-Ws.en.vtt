00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
sense to have it hang out that way but I

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.830 
sense to have it hang out that way but I
think<00:04:25.310> this<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.610> very<00:04:25.699> very<00:04:26.150> cool<00:04:26.449> I<00:04:26.690> really

very cool and the shoes look great as
well<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:44.120> he<00:04:44.270> does<00:04:44.449> have<00:04:44.570> one<00:04:44.840> peg<00:04:45.110> hole

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320

underneath<00:04:45.560> his<00:04:45.860> right<00:04:46.190> foot<00:04:46.430> here's<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.030> look

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
underneath his right foot here's a look

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.940 
underneath his right foot here's a look
at<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.360> back<00:04:47.510> of<00:04:47.539> the<00:04:47.720> figure<00:04:47.950> consistent

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
at the back of the figure consistent

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.950 
at the back of the figure consistent
paint<00:04:49.130> applications<00:04:49.760> throughout<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.510> think<00:04:50.870> it

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
paint applications throughout I think it

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.330 
paint applications throughout I think it
would<00:04:51.050> be<00:04:51.139> make<00:04:51.349> more<00:04:51.560> sense<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:51.919> have<00:04:52.010> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
would be make more sense to have the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.970 
would be make more sense to have the
hammer

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
hammer

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.920 
hammer
over<00:04:53.280> here<00:04:53.670> but<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.090> doesn't<00:04:54.300> really<00:04:54.390> fit<00:04:54.780> in

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
over here but it doesn't really fit in

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.350 
over here but it doesn't really fit in
there<00:04:55.140> so<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.740> then<00:04:56.430> right<00:04:57.000> here<00:04:57.180> we<00:04:57.330> have

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
there so and then right here we have

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.270 
there so and then right here we have
Joe's<00:04:57.900> garage<00:04:58.380> on<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.710> back

I'm<00:04:59.610> very<00:04:59.850> cool<00:05:00.180> like<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.690> texture<00:05:01.140> of<00:05:01.170> his

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
I'm very cool like the texture of his

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.100
