storage<00:03:36.420> type<00:03:36.870> items<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.859> number<00:03:38.070> 10<00:03:38.250> cans

and<00:03:38.880> all<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:39.750> these<00:03:39.900> things<00:03:40.140> are<00:03:40.410> mighty

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and all but these things are mighty

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.710 
and all but these things are mighty
expensive<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.519> think<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.239> works<00:03:42.480> out

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
expensive so I think it works out

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.620 
expensive so I think it works out
cheaper<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.859> buy<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.040> jiffy<00:03:44.549> blueberry<00:03:45.299> mix

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
cheaper to buy the jiffy blueberry mix

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.110 
cheaper to buy the jiffy blueberry mix
and<00:03:45.989> if<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.709> wanted<00:03:47.040> more<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.489> those<00:03:47.820> pellets

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
and if you wanted more of those pellets

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.099 
and if you wanted more of those pellets
and<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:50.100> gets<00:03:50.400> then<00:03:50.700> it'll<00:03:51.420> probably<00:03:51.840> pay<00:03:52.049> to

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
and this gets then it'll probably pay to

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.080 
and this gets then it'll probably pay to
buy<00:03:52.410> an<00:03:52.560> extra<00:03:52.890> box<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.670> sift<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
buy an extra box and just sift the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.300 
buy an extra box and just sift the
little<00:03:54.329> pellets<00:03:54.780> out<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.590> double<00:03:56.130> up

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
little pellets out of it and double up

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.940

want<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:41.060> make<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.440> wet<00:04:42.440> dough<00:04:42.800> don't<00:04:43.669> overmix

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
want to make a wet dough don't overmix

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.540 
want to make a wet dough don't overmix
this<00:04:44.569> just<00:04:44.930> steer<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.289> until<00:04:45.560> it's<00:04:45.740> all<00:04:45.919> wet

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
this just steer it until it's all wet

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.820 
this just steer it until it's all wet
then<00:04:47.360> turn<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.750> dough<00:04:48.139> onto<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:48.710> floured

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
then turn the dough onto a floured

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.909 
then turn the dough onto a floured
surface<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.970> work<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:50.930> enough<00:04:51.470> until<00:04:51.800> it

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
surface and work it just enough until it

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.610 
surface and work it just enough until it
all<00:04:52.069> holds<00:04:52.490> together<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:53.330> then<00:04:53.569> roll<00:04:54.259> it<00:04:54.470> out

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
all holds together and then roll it out

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.520 
all holds together and then roll it out
to<00:04:54.919> about<00:04:55.039> half<00:04:55.490> an<00:04:55.699> inch<00:04:55.849> thick<00:04:56.229> cut<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.380> out

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
to about half an inch thick cut it out

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.010 
to about half an inch thick cut it out
with<00:04:57.889> your<00:04:58.069> biscuit<00:04:58.460> cutter<00:04:58.699> put<00:04:59.569> it<00:04:59.660> onto<00:04:59.840> a

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
with your biscuit cutter put it onto a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.860 
with your biscuit cutter put it onto a
well<00:05:00.289> buttered<00:05:00.710> baking<00:05:01.069> sheet<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:01.880> then<00:05:02.569> bake

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
well buttered baking sheet and then bake

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.879 
well buttered baking sheet and then bake
it<00:05:03.110> at<00:05:03.289> 450<00:05:04.190> for<00:05:04.220> about<00:05:04.940> nine<00:05:05.330> minutes<00:05:05.860> when<00:05:06.860> I

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
it at 450 for about nine minutes when I

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.770 
it at 450 for about nine minutes when I
took<00:05:07.039> them<00:05:07.370> out<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:07.699> the<00:05:07.819> oven<00:05:07.849> I<00:05:08.330> brushed<00:05:08.660> them

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
took them out of the oven I brushed them

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.499 
took them out of the oven I brushed them
with<00:05:09.080> melted<00:05:09.530> butter

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
with melted butter

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.779 
with melted butter
for<00:05:11.509> the<00:05:11.630> icing<00:05:12.199> I<00:05:12.470> mixed<00:05:12.919> together<00:05:13.009> half<00:05:13.669> a

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
for the icing I mixed together half a

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.999 
for the icing I mixed together half a
cup<00:05:14.000> of<00:05:14.120> confectioner's<00:05:14.330> sugar<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:15.409> teaspoon

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
cup of confectioner's sugar a teaspoon

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.809 
cup of confectioner's sugar a teaspoon
of<00:05:16.370> lemon<00:05:16.580> juice<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.620> enough<00:05:18.620> corn<00:05:18.979> syrup<00:05:19.550> so

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
of lemon juice and enough corn syrup so

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.640 
of lemon juice and enough corn syrup so
that<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.210> was<00:05:20.419> starting<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:20.960> get<00:05:21.229> like<00:05:21.470> an

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
that it was starting to get like an

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.219 
that it was starting to get like an
icing<00:05:22.190> consistency<00:05:22.940> then<00:05:23.419> I<00:05:23.509> added<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.900> little

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
icing consistency then I added a little

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.870 
icing consistency then I added a little
milk<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.590> thin<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:24.979> down<00:05:25.099> some

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
milk to thin it down some

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.719 
milk to thin it down some
I<00:05:26.500> really<00:05:27.500> think<00:05:27.680> their<00:05:27.919> icing<00:05:28.280> has<00:05:28.430> corn

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
I really think their icing has corn

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.159 
I really think their icing has corn
syrup<00:05:29.090> in<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.330> because<00:05:29.479> it's<00:05:29.599> kind<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:29.870> clear

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
syrup in it because it's kind of clear

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.770 
syrup in it because it's kind of clear
and<00:05:30.319> sticky<00:05:30.639> then<00:05:31.639> I<00:05:31.669> drizzled<00:05:32.300> some<00:05:32.539> of<00:05:32.690> the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
and sticky then I drizzled some of the

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.540 
and sticky then I drizzled some of the
icing<00:05:33.259> across<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.800> top<00:05:34.009> and<00:05:34.220> I<00:05:34.250> should<00:05:34.430> have

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
icing across the top and I should have

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.070 
icing across the top and I should have
let<00:05:34.699> these<00:05:34.880> cool<00:05:35.090> down<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.389> little<00:05:35.750> more<00:05:35.900> before

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
let these cool down a little more before

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.439 
let these cool down a little more before
I<00:05:36.229> did<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.430> that's<00:05:37.669> how<00:05:37.880> they<00:05:38.000> turned<00:05:38.240> out

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
I did this so that's how they turned out

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.749 
I did this so that's how they turned out
you<00:05:38.720> end<00:05:38.870> up<00:05:38.990> with<00:05:39.199> 11<00:05:39.560> biscuits<00:05:40.069> for<00:05:40.370> less

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
you end up with 11 biscuits for less

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.860 
you end up with 11 biscuits for less
than<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.060> price<00:05:41.270> of<00:05:41.330> two<00:05:41.599> and<00:05:43.240> they<00:05:44.240> are<00:05:44.509> the

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
than the price of two and they are the

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.409 
than the price of two and they are the
bow<00:05:45.320> berry<00:05:45.590> biscuits<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:46.759> just<00:05:47.000> don't<00:05:47.210> have

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
bow berry biscuits you just don't have

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.760 
bow berry biscuits you just don't have
as<00:05:47.539> many<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:47.870> those<00:05:48.020> little<00:05:48.380> blueberry

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
as many of those little blueberry

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.950 
as many of those little blueberry
pellets<00:05:49.219> in<00:05:49.400> them<00:05:49.729> as<00:05:50.030> what<00:05:50.570> you<00:05:50.690> get<00:05:50.810> from

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
pellets in them as what you get from

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.860 
pellets in them as what you get from
Bojangles<00:05:51.620> but<00:05:52.460> you<00:05:52.699> could<00:05:52.940> buy<00:05:53.180> them<00:05:53.539> and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
Bojangles but you could buy them and

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.740 
Bojangles but you could buy them and
I'll<00:05:53.960> put<00:05:54.169> a<00:05:54.199> link<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.370> pretty<00:05:56.120> day<00:05:56.330> ones

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
I'll put a link to the pretty day ones

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.209 
I'll put a link to the pretty day ones
that<00:05:56.990> I<00:05:57.020> found<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:59.110> like<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.259> said<00:06:00.500> it<00:06:00.800> probably

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
that I found and like I said it probably

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:03.339 
that I found and like I said it probably
even<00:06:01.340> cheaper<00:06:01.610> to<00:06:01.940> just<00:06:02.150> buy<00:06:02.330> it<00:06:02.389> an<00:06:02.630> extra<00:06:03.139> box

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
even cheaper to just buy it an extra box

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.980 
even cheaper to just buy it an extra box
of<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:04.070> blueberry<00:06:04.430> muffin<00:06:04.880> mix<00:06:05.120> and<00:06:05.479> sift<00:06:05.780> the

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
of the blueberry muffin mix and sift the

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.559 
of the blueberry muffin mix and sift the
little<00:06:06.259> pellets<00:06:06.469> out<00:06:06.830> of<00:06:07.009> that<00:06:07.159> one<00:06:07.430> use<00:06:08.330> the

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
little pellets out of that one use the

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.559 
little pellets out of that one use the
mix<00:06:08.780> for<00:06:08.990> something<00:06:09.349> else<00:06:09.530> later<00:06:10.000> so<00:06:11.000> that's

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
mix for something else later so that's

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.290 
mix for something else later so that's
how<00:06:11.870> I<00:06:11.900> made<00:06:12.259> both<00:06:12.800> berry<00:06:13.099> biscuits<00:06:13.729> out<00:06:14.240> of

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
how I made both berry biscuits out of

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.810 
how I made both berry biscuits out of
the<00:06:14.569> hills
