00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.890
 there are five very important things that 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.059
 we must all know when we are going to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 take pictures of some fires 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.730
 artificial the frame always deals 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.040
 to position yourself in a position where 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.190
 have the largest field of vision possible 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.390
 to be able to take the picture 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.690
 imagine that it is windy if there is wind 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.499
 stand in front of him will be less visible 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.199
 the smoke that comes off the fires 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:39.600
 because you already know that the fires 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:43.469
 they give off the smoke and the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.480
 smoke the very important modes I do not know 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.039
 if you noticed when someone 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 take pictures that suddenly jumps the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 flash because it is in a way 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 automatic because the fires 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.519
 artificial materials do not conform to the type of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.489
 Standard lighting mode landscape macro 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.430
 night portrait 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:14.130
 it would be good to put the camera in mode 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.229
 landscape macro night portrait fires 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.680
 artificial if I had it if not 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.259
 were we able to put any of these 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.170
 disables the flash something negative the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.590
 Flash takes a long time to load and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.189
 if there are interesting games we're going 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.280
 to lose it's important to turn it off 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.020
 because we can miss games that we 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 interesting to take out fires that the focus 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.420
 very important the tripod is something 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.080
 essential yes or yes because 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.289
 photographs you will take moves if 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.020
 we do not use the tripod before 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:59.130
 start the fires go making 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.369
 tests and fixes the tripod and the camera 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 before the games begin, go 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.289
 doing tests to check how 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.819
 they are verified that the flash is not 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.959
 activated 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.499
 that's very important important sets the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:22.189
 approach from where the fires are launched 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.819
 and how we set the focus and how 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.090
 we make 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.030
 pressing the fire button until the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.540
 half in order to keep the focus 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.510
 go shifting the goal this is 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.519
 a reflex camera towards the area of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.430
 exposure if it is a camera to be the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.579
 logical pocket mind pocket 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.219
 you can not go moving the goal 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.269
 would be important what is said here of the 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:53.150
 four landscape macro night portrait or 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.819
 Fireworks are four 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.639
 options that you should have put 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.680
 so for the camera to take pictures 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.540
 of the fires and one thing that you should not 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.639
 never despise 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.280
 if you have 15 megas always 15 megas 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.959
 never waste the quality that the 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.090
 camera is giving you 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.669
 remember that we are not professionals of 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.110
 the photograph and surely this video 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.600
 tutorial 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.380
 and many failures but that I have 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.510
 served quite a lot of help to make 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.630
 almost professional photographs of 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.490
 fireworks that we want to make 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.670
 thank you for being there very greetings 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.210
 cordial to all my friends that 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.210
 have a good time
