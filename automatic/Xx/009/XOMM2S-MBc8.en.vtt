00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:03.230 
now obviously we're definitely against
the<00:02:00.569> writing<00:02:01.109> it's<00:02:01.669> it's<00:02:02.669> not<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> good<00:02:03.179> thing

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the writing it's it's not a good thing

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.190 
the writing it's it's not a good thing
that<00:02:03.719> people<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.109> doing<00:02:04.349> that<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.990> fact

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that people are doing that and the fact

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
that people are doing that and the fact
that<00:02:07.349> people<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.799> stealing<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that people are stealing all that the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.460 
that people are stealing all that the
items<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.619> cellphones<00:02:11.099> iPods

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
items like cellphones iPods

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.280 
items like cellphones iPods
keys<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:14.510> definitely<00:02:14.990> not<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
keys and all that just definitely not a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.220 
keys and all that just definitely not a
good<00:02:15.710> thing<00:02:15.980> because<00:02:16.970> people<00:02:17.540> obviously<00:02:17.690> work

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
good thing because people obviously work

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.040 
good thing because people obviously work
for<00:02:18.500> all<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.130> for<00:02:19.850> people<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.510> loot

for all that and for people just to loot

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.310 
for all that and for people just to loot
the<00:02:21.080> stores<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.890> seal<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:23.320> definitely

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
the stores and seal it all definitely

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.620

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630
