00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
orthopedic surgeon and what he pretty

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.789 
orthopedic surgeon and what he pretty
much<00:01:26.040> did<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:27.020> he<00:01:28.020> looked<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.290> my<00:01:28.350> leg<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
much did was he looked at my leg and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.670 
much did was he looked at my leg and
wait<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.759> took<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.060> giant<00:01:30.570> needle<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.530> he

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
wait he took this giant needle and he

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
wait he took this giant needle and he
stuck<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.280> my<00:01:32.310> leg<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.210> sucked

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
stuck it in my leg and he just sucked

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800 
stuck it in my leg and he just sucked
out<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.380> whole<00:01:34.770> bunch<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.159> blood<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.570> know

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
out a whole bunch of blood and I know

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
out a whole bunch of blood and I know
that<00:01:36.990> sounds<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.409> gross

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that sounds really gross

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
that sounds really gross
but<00:01:39.810> pretty<00:01:39.990> much<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.439> means<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
but pretty much what that means is that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.550 
but pretty much what that means is that
I<00:01:41.189> probably<00:01:41.430> tore<00:01:41.850> something<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.530> he

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I probably tore something in there so he

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520 
I probably tore something in there so he
said<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.430> about<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:45.259> 75%<00:01:46.259> chance

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
said that there is about a 75% chance

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.609 
said that there is about a 75% chance
that<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.899> tore<00:01:48.899> my<00:01:49.590> ACL<00:01:50.030> which<00:01:51.229> really<00:01:52.229> sucks

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that I tore my ACL which really sucks

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.850

I<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.829> tried<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.549> kick<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.730> board<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
I I tried to kick the board out and

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.440 
I I tried to kick the board out and
pretty<00:02:50.069> much<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.340> didn't<00:02:50.760> kick<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.090> out<00:02:51.180> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
pretty much I didn't kick it out it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.569 
pretty much I didn't kick it out it
stayed<00:02:51.900> where<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.410> underneath<00:02:52.950> me<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.459> my

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
stayed where it was underneath me and my

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.509 
stayed where it was underneath me and my
feet<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.150> came<00:02:54.540> off<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.519> whenever

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
feet just came off of it and whenever

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.500 
feet just came off of it and whenever
that<00:02:56.760> happened<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:58.430> had<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.609> get<00:02:59.849> my<00:03:00.000> legs<00:03:00.239> out

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
that happened I had to get my legs out

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.390 
that happened I had to get my legs out
of<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.840> way<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.530> pretty<00:03:01.769> much<00:03:01.890> what<00:03:02.069> happened

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
of the way so pretty much what happened

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.479 
of the way so pretty much what happened
was<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:04.819> my<00:03:05.819> leg<00:03:06.140> my<00:03:07.140> legs<00:03:07.440> were<00:03:07.739> really<00:03:08.280> like

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
was I my leg my legs were really like

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.349 
was I my leg my legs were really like
spread<00:03:09.739> trying<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:11.010> avoid<00:03:11.579> landing<00:03:12.000> back<00:03:12.329> on

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
spread trying to avoid landing back on

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:12.949 
spread trying to avoid landing back on
the<00:03:12.629> board

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
the board

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.199 
the board
whenever<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:13.500> happened<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.069> guess<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.030> just

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
whenever that happened I guess I just

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.379 
whenever that happened I guess I just
came<00:03:15.390> down<00:03:15.450> with<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.049> much<00:03:16.200> force<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
came down with so much force that

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.000 
came down with so much force that
whenever<00:03:18.389> my<00:03:18.599> legs<00:03:18.900> were<00:03:19.079> spread<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.590> much<00:03:19.650> it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
whenever my legs were spread so much it

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.030 
whenever my legs were spread so much it
just<00:03:20.190> pushed<00:03:20.700> my<00:03:21.359> left<00:03:21.660> one<00:03:21.870> straight<00:03:22.769> down

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
just pushed my left one straight down

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.370 
just pushed my left one straight down
and<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:24.150> was<00:03:24.209> actually<00:03:24.359> popped<00:03:24.720> at<00:03:24.870> place<00:03:25.109> so

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and it was actually popped at place so

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.550 
and it was actually popped at place so
like<00:03:25.530> my<00:03:25.739> left<00:03:25.980> leg<00:03:26.599> not<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.340> right<00:03:29.489> here

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
leg but other than that I really I'm

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.339 
leg but other than that I really I'm
almost<00:04:17.340> certain<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:18.030> doctor<00:04:18.329> says<00:04:18.570> pretty

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
almost certain the doctor says pretty

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.510 
almost certain the doctor says pretty
much<00:04:19.530> certain<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.370> tore<00:04:20.910> my<00:04:21.299> ACL<00:04:22.520> which

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
much certain that I tore my ACL which

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.000 
much certain that I tore my ACL which
really<00:04:24.210> sucks<00:04:24.599> because<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.890> have

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
really sucks because you have to have

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.720 
really sucks because you have to have
surgery<00:04:26.370> too

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
surgery too

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.260 
surgery too
and<00:04:27.530> first<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.680> all<00:04:28.770> never<00:04:29.580> had<00:04:29.730> surgery<00:04:29.850> in<00:04:30.180> my

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
and first of all never had surgery in my

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.030 
and first of all never had surgery in my
life<00:04:30.450> so<00:04:30.990> that's<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:33.270> kind<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.440> scary

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040
