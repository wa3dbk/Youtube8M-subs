back<00:00:57.769> at<00:00:58.040> Woodward<00:00:58.370> at<00:00:58.549> Copper<00:00:58.579> just<00:00:59.449> started

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
back at Woodward at Copper just started

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.939 
back at Woodward at Copper just started
jumping<00:01:00.019> around<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.409> foam<00:01:00.620> pit<00:01:00.649> and

jumping around in the foam pit and

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.410 
jumping around in the foam pit and
that's<00:01:01.100> when<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.309> realized<00:01:01.670> that<00:01:01.820> backflip<00:01:02.149> was

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
that's when I realized that backflip was

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.539 
that's when I realized that backflip was
possible<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.229> then<00:01:03.769> from<00:01:03.890> there<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.220> natural

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
possible and then from there the natural

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.710 
possible and then from there the natural
progression<00:01:04.640> was<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.210> bring<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.509> onto<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
progression was to bring it onto the

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.510 
progression was to bring it onto the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:37.030 
airbag at black home in the drain park
and<00:01:07.700> then<00:01:08.539> it<00:01:08.659> was<00:01:08.780> on

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.480 

I<00:01:38.320> knew<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.500> deep<00:01:39.680> soft<00:01:39.890> snow<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.280> going<00:01:40.400> to

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
I knew that deep soft snow is going to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.420 
I knew that deep soft snow is going to
leave<00:01:40.640> me<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.880> biggest<00:01:41.090> margin<00:01:41.420> for<00:01:41.750> error

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430
