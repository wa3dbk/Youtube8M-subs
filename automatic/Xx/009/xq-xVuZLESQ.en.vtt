00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.040
 I know why 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 of course but because close to buggiano 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.010
 and therefore very pregnant 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.690
 we seem to be crying different

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
 how big they are 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.040
 if you really exist like that, don't go away

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 be careful how you love 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.709
 because we see 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.709
 now you can even go back, we've seen enough 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.519
 words text 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.509
 but how big are you? 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:08.139
 look at this kind of brontosaurus lisa zulema state of the art 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.609
 that is the equivalent of the 600 men 600 men parma twins area 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.319
 and think that these 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.749
 urbino bus to see 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:19.899
 there are others 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.899
 even bigger 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.009

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.579
 is a year a 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 he is a carnivore 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.009
 well we will have the opportunity to meet the predator bar during our time 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.269
 I travel in particular the next episodes when we will try to observe from 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.139
 close up in the hunting scenes 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.699
 but there is one thing to which it is interesting to pause for a moment and it is 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.699
 the roar of the loggia 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.719
 the dinosaurs turned 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.409
 they emitted apocalypse sounds 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.849
 don't know it 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.060
 of course if the various scenes we have seen so far have been 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.710
 built on destroyed 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.479
 of an interpretation 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.330
 as we said at the beginning these reconstructions not only of fantasy but 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.029
 The expert scientists have been carefully studied with help 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.210
 are based on everything simcity today 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.180
 to discover 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.490
 on dinosaurs 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.030
 as it happens for rest for the drawings for the reconstructions that 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.030
 sundek scientific journals appear 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.369
 to this trip we have also given you have seen a character sometimes it is 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:08.919
 a little bit but fort fimo where to expose the data in a pleasant way not too much 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.039
 naturally 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.939
 many things are still not on the dinosaurs for example 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.430
 if they put vocalizations or not 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.919
 and then no one was there to listen to them, let alone record 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.010
 what you can do today to try to understand through the 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.809
 structures placed in particular of the skull 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.889
 everything that is on the behavior of the dinosaurs has been texted yes 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.299
 some of these animals could allow screaming sounds 

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:40.740
 federica 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.770
 in this regard there is much discussion among the paleontologist 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.050
 you can understand something about the dinosaurs by actually looking at them 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.219
 if we look at the world of reptiles in carpi today 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.569
 one realizes that it is a strangely silent world 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.159
 while among mammals and even among birds there is a huge variety of 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.969
 forward barry tvg monica vitti mood gt5 t peeps etcetera 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.629
 the only thing that the Sufi celebrations are tonight 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.360
 of sites 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.590
 it is also true however that the current reptiles generally do not live in 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:30.330
 organized groups while dinosaurs seem to have had a social life 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.569
 and when you have a social life, the calls are important 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.139
 and in fact the crocodiles that live in groups 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.449
 they make sounds 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.139
 both producing noises and muji 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.449
 which can also be heard 100 200 meters away 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:01.629
 ginosa brands 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.869
 they were smart enough to develop calls 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.909
 because many researchers today tend to consider the real gentleman who certain 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.210
 dinosaurs dress vowels 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.409
 as it happens in birds 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.409
 with which the dinosaurs are related comedy 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.449
 underwire certain rapper t boston of the bone structures that you feel retro organs 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:25.330
 hearing 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.559
 especially read everything 

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:32.189
 however, perhaps research will allow us to understand things better in the future 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:36.839
 we think of the mass of information that paleontology was able to provide i 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:39.879
 only 100 years is really an extraordinary thing
