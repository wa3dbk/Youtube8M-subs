00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.570
 good good good people of youtube 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.300
 We are here in a new video of how 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:11.049
 trolling in McKinsey for playstation 4 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.039
 in ultimate English because the player who 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.039
 we will use 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:22.170
 is the arsenal player alex oxlade 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.510
 chamberlain in the position of ml the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.110
 method that I use is the change of 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:33.690
 m position of air ok we put in the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.570
 filter as maximum price 1600 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.850
 Y 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.780
 the maximum bid we are going to make for 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:47.300
 this player has to be 1700 ok 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.250
 and statistics 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.680
 then we go to the market objective 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.760
 musician we look for example this is already 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.860
 expired is already to send to the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.300
 active template 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.200
 we go through transfers 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.550
 consumables change of position and it would be 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.550
 from md 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:16.880
 par excellence the maximum price for 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:20.360
 this equal would be one thousand 700 thousand 800 the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.440
 trade 1700 because it has only the most 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.190
 approach up to thousand 700 thousand 801 to buy 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.060
 because also many 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.060
 in my club 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.340
 n 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.299
 we are going to apply consumables 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:51.810
 and we go to the positioning card 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:56.100
 here you are bmw you must apply consumables 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.880
 ok between the two cards between the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.680
 player and the change card go 3500 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 but go 3000 for 300 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.110
 everyone and match cards and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 how is the market because that can 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.590
 raise and lower necessary or that there are 3500 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.630
 more or less 3,000 patients and the player 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.880
 can be seen at a final price of four 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.150
 thousand let's get to the list 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.150
 transferable 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.190
 we go to the list of transfers 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.670
 and to confirm here we already have some 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.910
 come days 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.780
 as initial price 3.900 final price 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.319
 4000 when I look if I have a player it 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.069
 sell well with hot bread 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.749
 do trade and take advantage of it because if not 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.200
 know and expressed it to take advantage of what 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.780
 what is food 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.250
 yes 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:00.840
 that we do not look we can go out 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.840
 three initials 3,900 to 4,000 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.010
 ok and not necessarily this method just 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.370
 puts with this player the truth from 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.110
 that started this ultimate I liked 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.170
 three players to be able to create with this 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.800
 meters is always the same the equator 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.500
 of this team theo walcott is going 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.780
 luxury the truth people like a lot 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.600
 that player like this one because you're 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.560
 super treated super fast they have a lot 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.989
 dribble good and finally with the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.930
 that I have been working on is also the 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.050
 Bundesliga player Borussia 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.860
 normal that aubameyang 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.340
 I recommend total they have 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.780
 what to see in this method is to earn 500 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.190
 records 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.600
 the minimum so that it can yield the 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.720
 money because if they are not going to take 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.370
 much in being able to raise money so 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.600
 Well, that's all I hope you have 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:13.410
 liked and any doubt less in my 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.410
 comments and I like you as regards
