00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.480 
resilient yeah I mean I've adapted into
a<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.380> when<00:01:34.620> I<00:01:34.680> first<00:01:34.920> started<00:01:35.130> workout<00:01:35.400> I'm

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
a bit when I first started workout I'm

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
a bit when I first started workout I'm
like<00:01:35.670> oh<00:01:35.940> I<00:01:36.330> felt<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> shape<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
like oh I felt so out of shape with the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.620 
like oh I felt so out of shape with the
intensity<00:01:38.760> in<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.940> fast<00:01:39.150> pace<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> our

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
intensity in the fast pace of our

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.950 
intensity in the fast pace of our
workouts<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.890> um<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.400> lot<00:01:42.120> of<00:01:42.240> our<00:01:42.330> back<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
workouts but um a lot of our back you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.570 
workouts but um a lot of our back you
know<00:01:43.020> movements<00:01:43.470> you'll<00:01:43.950> notice<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.310> video

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
know movements you'll notice the video

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.870 
know movements you'll notice the video
or<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.330> rows<00:01:45.480> you<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.520> hit<00:01:47.520> more<00:01:47.700> back

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
or a lot of rows you know hit more back

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
or a lot of rows you know hit more back
thicknesses<00:01:48.300> especially<00:01:48.870> for<00:01:49.050> me<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> need

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
thicknesses especially for me I need

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.290 
thicknesses especially for me I need
more<00:01:50.070> thickness<00:01:50.310> being<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> little

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
more thickness being you know a little

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.230 
more thickness being you know a little
bit<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.480> smaller<00:01:51.720> guy<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.400> mean<00:01:53.550> as<00:01:54.000> far

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
bit of smaller guy and so I mean as far

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.200 
bit of smaller guy and so I mean as far
as<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.479> go<00:01:54.720> Mike<00:01:55.050> also<00:01:56.060> what's<00:01:57.060> your

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
as you go Mike also what's your

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
as you go Mike also what's your
philosophy<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.720> know<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.080> on<00:01:58.229> four<00:01:58.470> straps

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
philosophy you know like on four straps

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.400 
philosophy you know like on four straps
the<00:01:59.610> idea<00:01:59.970> that<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:01.050> might<00:02:01.380> have

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
the idea that you know you might have

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.140 
the idea that you know you might have
someone<00:02:01.770> spot<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.370> like<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.700> last<00:02:02.850> couple

someone spot you like the last couple

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.730 
someone spot you like the last couple
you<00:02:03.510> know<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.050> push<00:02:04.320> yourself

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you know just really push yourself

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.710 
you know just really push yourself
beyond<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> point<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.670> fatigue<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.360> mean<00:02:06.630> do

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
beyond the point of fatigue I mean do

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.570 
beyond the point of fatigue I mean do
you<00:02:06.780> believe<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.229> any<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:08.010> there<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> room

you believe in any is there is room
really<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.510> a<00:02:09.540> good<00:02:09.959> path<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.229> growth<00:02:10.709> or

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
really is that a good path for growth or

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.949 
really is that a good path for growth or
most<00:02:11.550> most<00:02:11.820> definitely<00:02:12.270> Christian<00:02:12.600> honestly

as<00:02:13.110> long<00:02:13.260> as<00:02:13.350> you're<00:02:13.440> trained<00:02:13.650> smart

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
as long as you're trained smart

as long as you're trained smart
intelligent<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:15.240> course<00:02:15.540> reps<00:02:15.810> definitely

play<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> role<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.040> our<00:02:17.130> training<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
play a role in our training all the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.610 
play a role in our training all the
intensity<00:02:18.360> techniques<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.440> he'll

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
intensity techniques do you know he'll

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.500 
intensity techniques do you know he'll
notice<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.010> our<00:02:20.070> training<00:02:20.459> we<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.910> force<00:02:21.209> reps

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
notice in our training we do force reps

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.890 
notice in our training we do force reps
we<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.260> continuous<00:02:22.709> sets<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:24.240> we<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> lot<00:02:24.870> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
we do continuous sets so we do a lot of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.100 
we do continuous sets so we do a lot of
super<00:02:25.140> sets<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.459> rhythm<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.060> there's<00:02:27.900> many

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
super sets the rhythm so there's many

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.810 
super sets the rhythm so there's many
different<00:02:28.500> technical<00:02:28.769> intensity<00:02:29.400> techniques

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
different technical intensity techniques

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.490 
different technical intensity techniques
we<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.239> up<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> intensity<00:02:30.600> our<00:02:30.989> cream<00:02:31.230> take

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
we do to up the intensity our cream take

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.979 
we do to up the intensity our cream take
us<00:02:31.620> past<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.010> point<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.430> failure<00:02:32.690> get<00:02:33.690> extra

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
us past that point of failure get extra

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.960 
us past that point of failure get extra
blood<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.100> stress<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.430> muscle

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
blood there to really stress that muscle

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.670 
blood there to really stress that muscle
fashion<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> growth<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.230> honestly

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
fashion and get the growth so honestly

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.740 
fashion and get the growth so honestly
just<00:02:38.130> about<00:02:38.280> every<00:02:38.580> intensity<00:02:39.269> technique

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
just about every intensity technique

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.600 
just about every intensity technique
there<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:39.989> at<00:02:40.350> one<00:02:40.560> point<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:40.920> another<00:02:41.190> which

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
there is at one point in another which

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.040 
there is at one point in another which
were<00:02:41.820> want<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> work<00:02:42.180> out<00:02:42.360> nothing<00:02:42.630> with<00:02:42.930> you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
were want to work out nothing with you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.570 
were want to work out nothing with you
we<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.620> never<00:02:43.800> do<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.070> same<00:02:44.100> workout

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
we do is we never do the same workout

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.520 
we do is we never do the same workout
twice<00:02:44.820> we<00:02:45.360> don't<00:02:45.540> give<00:02:45.630> our<00:02:45.750> body<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.080> chance<00:02:46.140> to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
twice we don't give our body a chance to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.170 
twice we don't give our body a chance to
adapt<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.130> workouts<00:02:47.519> you'll<00:02:47.910> hear<00:02:48.030> some

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
adapt the workouts you'll hear some

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.580 
adapt the workouts you'll hear some
people<00:02:48.510> say<00:02:48.660> well<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> got<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.110> great<00:02:49.260> faculty

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
people say well I got a great faculty

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.199 
people say well I got a great faculty
well<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.519> routine<00:02:50.790> that's<00:02:51.030> not

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
well if you have a routine that's not

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.240 
well if you have a routine that's not
good<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> muscle<00:02:52.019> grows<00:02:52.290> by<00:02:53.010> not

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
good because the muscle grows by not

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.650 
good because the muscle grows by not
being<00:02:53.489> used<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.790> something<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.150> body<00:02:54.300> has<00:02:54.510> to

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
being used to something the body has to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.479 
being used to something the body has to
adapt<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.959> something<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:55.440> not<00:02:55.620> used<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.070> so

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
adapt to something that's not used to so

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.490 
adapt to something that's not used to so
we<00:02:56.610> stimulate<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.360> stimulate<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.019> but<00:02:58.410> we've

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
we stimulate we stimulate it but we've

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.199 
we stimulate we stimulate it but we've
been<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:58.769> keep<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.160> guessing<00:02:59.610> so<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.000> body

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
been we keep it guessing so the body

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.479 
been we keep it guessing so the body
feels<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.690> has<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.410> death<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.100> grow<00:03:02.280> to

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
feels like it has to a death and grow to

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.830 
feels like it has to a death and grow to
handle<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.790> workout<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.420> change<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.750> up

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
handle the workout then we change it up

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.390 
handle the workout then we change it up
again<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.440> we're<00:03:04.560> constantly<00:03:04.769> changing

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
again so we're constantly changing

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.830 
again so we're constantly changing
workouts<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.150> adding<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.540> different

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
workouts and adding in different

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840 
workouts and adding in different
intensive<00:03:07.260> techniques<00:03:07.620> some<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.519> noticed

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
intensive techniques some and I noticed

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.920 
intensive techniques some and I noticed
you<00:03:08.970> guys<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.480> work<00:03:09.660> on

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
you guys in this work on

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.110 
you guys in this work on
bent<00:03:10.560> over<00:03:10.680> rows<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.519> guess<00:03:11.790> I'm<00:03:11.939> pretty

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
bent over rows and guess I'm pretty

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240 
bent over rows and guess I'm pretty
heavy<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.510> think<00:03:12.780> he<00:03:12.870> looked<00:03:13.079> like<00:03:13.290> someone<00:03:14.159> or

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
heavy I think he looked like someone or

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.149 
heavy I think he looked like someone or
315<00:03:14.730> 405<00:03:15.329> some<00:03:15.989> pretty<00:03:16.200> heavy<00:03:16.409> listed<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.129> you

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
315 405 some pretty heavy listed and you

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.979 
315 405 some pretty heavy listed and you
guys<00:03:17.459> never<00:03:17.730> really<00:03:18.030> compromised<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.719> form

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
guys never really compromised the form

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.929 
guys never really compromised the form
so<00:03:19.319> they<00:03:19.829> think<00:03:19.890> that's<00:03:20.159> really<00:03:20.489> important<00:03:20.879> to

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 
so they think that's really important to

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.849 
so they think that's really important to
you<00:03:21.060> know<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> lot<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.450> guys<00:03:21.629> out<00:03:21.900> there<00:03:21.959> might

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
you know a lot of guys out there might

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.920 
you know a lot of guys out there might
you<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.040> left<00:03:23.219> 405<00:03:23.760> or<00:03:24.030> even<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.329> know<00:03:24.359> 485

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
you know left 405 or even you know 485

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.809 
you know left 405 or even you know 485
wherever<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.349> your<00:03:25.530> form<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.890> dog<00:03:26.099> so<00:03:26.579> I

wherever but your form is dog so I

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.429 
wherever but your form is dog so I
mean<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.329> think<00:03:27.659> it's<00:03:27.900> pretty<00:03:28.079> important<00:03:28.379> to

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
mean I think it's pretty important to

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.199 
mean I think it's pretty important to
keep<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.859> keep<00:03:29.189> it<00:03:29.310> consistent<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:29.909> keep<00:03:30.060> it

proper form right for sure graded on the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.740 
proper form right for sure graded on the
bottom<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.730> mean<00:03:32.909> what<00:03:33.000> do<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.480> have<00:03:33.629> to

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
bottom I mean what do you you have to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.270 
bottom I mean what do you you have to
train<00:03:33.959> happy<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.319> get<00:03:34.439> big<00:03:34.620> thick<00:03:34.829> muscle<00:03:35.189> no

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
train happy to get big thick muscle no

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.899 
train happy to get big thick muscle no
doubt<00:03:35.489> about<00:03:35.609> it

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
doubt about it

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.399 
doubt about it
to<00:03:36.090> go<00:03:36.239> hand<00:03:36.480> again<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.379> you're

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
to go hand again but if you're

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.959 
to go hand again but if you're
compromising<00:03:38.069> your<00:03:38.159> form<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.670> you're<00:03:38.760> using

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:38.969 
compromising your form and you're using

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.550 
compromising your form and you're using
momentum<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.810> using<00:03:40.109> all<00:03:40.230> these<00:03:40.379> other

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
momentum and you using all these other

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.170 
momentum and you using all these other
stabilizer<00:03:41.159> muscles<00:03:41.310> instead<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.879> your<00:03:41.970> back

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
stabilizer muscles instead of your back

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.000 
stabilizer muscles instead of your back
you're<00:03:42.689> really<00:03:42.870> defeating<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> purpose<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.950> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
you're really defeating a purpose so you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.979 
you're really defeating a purpose so you
need<00:03:44.189> to<00:03:44.280> go<00:03:44.370> heavy<00:03:44.609> to<00:03:45.060> build<00:03:45.299> back<00:03:45.540> thickness

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
need to go heavy to build back thickness

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.539 
need to go heavy to build back thickness
to<00:03:46.109> build<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.439> density<00:03:46.829> we<00:03:46.950> need<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.250> build<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
to build a density we need to build the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.339 
to build a density we need to build the
size<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.090> need<00:03:48.239> what<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.200> use

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
size that we need what you have to use

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.869 
size that we need what you have to use
good<00:03:49.530> enough<00:03:49.769> form<00:03:50.099> where<00:03:50.639> you're<00:03:50.760> working

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
good enough form where you're working

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.280 
good enough form where you're working
the<00:03:51.150> targeted<00:03:51.569> muscle<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.900> you're<00:03:52.049> looking

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
the targeted muscle that you're looking

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.750 
the targeted muscle that you're looking
to<00:03:52.319> work<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.739> we<00:03:52.859> try<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.099> combine<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.579> ball

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
to work so we try to combine the ball

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.640 
to work so we try to combine the ball
and<00:03:54.419> one<00:03:54.569> thing<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.810> like<00:03:55.079> about<00:03:55.109> your

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
and one thing I like about your

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.039 
and one thing I like about your
philosophy<00:03:55.829> as<00:03:56.370> well<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.730> training<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> lot

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
philosophy as well the training is a lot

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.869 
philosophy as well the training is a lot
of<00:03:58.169> guys<00:03:58.290> will<00:03:58.530> train<00:03:58.919> in<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.069> primary<00:03:59.519> muscle

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
of guys will train in a primary muscle

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.339 
of guys will train in a primary muscle
on<00:03:59.939> a<00:04:00.000> secondary<00:04:00.450> like<00:04:00.659> they'll<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.870> chests

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
on a secondary like they'll do chests

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.220 
on a secondary like they'll do chests
and<00:04:01.469> buys<00:04:01.680> or<00:04:02.099> back<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.969> tries<00:04:03.180> but<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:04.109> guys

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
and buys or back and tries but you guys

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.289 
and buys or back and tries but you guys
will<00:04:04.439> only<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.799> arms<00:04:05.129> on<00:04:05.250> one<00:04:05.430> day<00:04:05.639> right<00:04:05.939> but

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
will only do arms on one day right but

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.059 
will only do arms on one day right but
its<00:04:06.419> back<00:04:06.629> it's<00:04:06.930> only<00:04:07.200> back<00:04:07.560> right<00:04:07.859> that's

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
its back it's only back right that's

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.459 
its back it's only back right that's
what<00:04:08.219> you<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:09.090> focus<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.629> the<00:04:09.810> major<00:04:10.049> muscle

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
what you you focus on the major muscle

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.319 
what you you focus on the major muscle
group<00:04:10.650> for<00:04:10.799> them<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.069> know<00:04:11.099> arms<00:04:11.639> like<00:04:11.909> it's

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
group for them you know arms like it's

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.000 
group for them you know arms like it's
on<00:04:12.450> there<00:04:12.689> whatever<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.530> that's<00:04:13.829> correct

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
on there whatever that that's correct

Christian<00:04:14.579> we<00:04:15.030> trade<00:04:15.299> one<00:04:15.479> muscle<00:04:15.840> group<00:04:15.870> a

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
Christian we trade one muscle group a

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.479 
Christian we trade one muscle group a
day<00:04:16.260> that's<00:04:16.470> tough<00:04:16.650> very<00:04:16.829> intensely

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
day that's tough very intensely

day that's tough very intensely
you<00:04:18.389> know<00:04:18.479> maybe<00:04:18.659> 25<00:04:19.229> sets<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:19.680> at<00:04:19.799> muscle

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
you know maybe 25 sets but at muscle

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.250 
you know maybe 25 sets but at muscle
group<00:04:20.250> we<00:04:20.370> totally<00:04:20.729> annihilate<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.389> so<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:21.900> mean

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
group we totally annihilate it so I mean

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.779 
group we totally annihilate it so I mean
after<00:04:22.590> doing<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.979> with<00:04:23.220> intense<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.669> we

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
after doing that with intense that we

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.310 
after doing that with intense that we
use<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.240> amount<00:04:24.389> of<00:04:24.510> volume<00:04:24.690> Nick's<00:04:25.169> would

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
use in the amount of volume Nick's would

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.420 
use in the amount of volume Nick's would
have<00:04:25.440> your<00:04:25.560> weight<00:04:25.680> there's<00:04:26.039> no<00:04:26.130> way<00:04:26.250> we'd

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
have your weight there's no way we'd

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.270 
have your weight there's no way we'd
have<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.760> energy<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.360> put<00:04:27.690> in<00:04:27.870> an<00:04:28.800> extra<00:04:28.979> body

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
have the energy to put in an extra body

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.189 
have the energy to put in an extra body
part<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.820> give<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.090> one<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.240> Dean<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:30.780> we

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
part and give it one a Dean so we

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.870 
part and give it one a Dean so we
trained<00:04:31.470> just<00:04:31.590> about<00:04:31.800> every<00:04:32.099> day<00:04:32.250> one<00:04:32.639> body

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
trained just about every day one body

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.850 
trained just about every day one body
part<00:04:33.090> really<00:04:33.510> intense<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.380> think<00:04:34.620> and

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
part really intense and I think and

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.320 
part really intense and I think and
there's<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.280> student<00:04:35.760> when<00:04:35.849> you<00:04:35.940> sense<00:04:36.180> you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
there's a so student when you sense you

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.450 
there's a so student when you sense you
because<00:04:36.630> when<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:37.320> said<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:38.250> wouldn't

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
because when you said that you wouldn't

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.770 
because when you said that you wouldn't
have<00:04:38.669> much<00:04:38.909> energy<00:04:39.120> for<00:04:39.479> another

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
have much energy for another

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.260 
have much energy for another
they<00:04:40.230> think<00:04:40.290> what<00:04:40.560> happens<00:04:40.920> is<00:04:41.100> for<00:04:41.820> people

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
they think what happens is for people

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.860 
they think what happens is for people
that<00:04:42.420> I've<00:04:42.600> spoken<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.290> they'll<00:04:44.100> actually

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
that I've spoken to they'll actually

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.379 
that I've spoken to they'll actually
sort<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:45.930> steal<00:04:46.440> back<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:47.130> major<00:04:47.700> body<00:04:48.060> part

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
sort of steal back the major body part

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.000 
sort of steal back the major body part
so<00:04:48.870> they<00:04:48.960> have<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.139> little<00:04:49.260> bit<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.530> energy<00:04:49.650> left

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
so they have a little bit of energy left

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.830 
so they have a little bit of energy left
in<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> secondary<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.389> there's<00:04:51.600> screw

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
in the secondary and so there's screw

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.240 
in the secondary and so there's screw
themselves<00:04:52.290> out<00:04:52.380> of<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.530> good<00:04:52.680> back<00:04:52.830> workout

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
themselves out of the good back workout

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.860 
themselves out of the good back workout
and<00:04:53.700> they're<00:04:53.880> also<00:04:54.060> screw<00:04:54.240> themselves<00:04:54.450> out<00:04:54.780> of

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
and they're also screw themselves out of

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.950 
and they're also screw themselves out of
a<00:04:54.930> good<00:04:55.020> arm<00:04:55.200> workout<00:04:55.260> right<00:04:55.830> just<00:04:56.630> as<00:04:57.630> far<00:04:57.870> as

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
a good arm workout right just as far as

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.690 
a good arm workout right just as far as
nutrition<00:04:58.139> goes<00:04:58.440> sort<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.100> just<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.340> wrap<00:04:59.520> it

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
nutrition goes sort of just to wrap it

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.190 
nutrition goes sort of just to wrap it
up<00:04:59.790> like<00:05:00.090> obviously<00:05:00.570> we're<00:05:00.750> not<00:05:00.810> eating<00:05:00.960> right

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
up like obviously we're not eating right

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.700 
up like obviously we're not eating right
now<00:05:01.260> but<00:05:01.440> after<00:05:02.130> typical<00:05:02.820> workout<00:05:03.710> what's

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
now but after typical workout what's

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.080 
now but after typical workout what's
your<00:05:04.860> rule<00:05:05.040> on<00:05:05.130> nutrition<00:05:05.520> for<00:05:05.639> yourself<00:05:05.970> and

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
your rule on nutrition for yourself and

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.370 
your rule on nutrition for yourself and
also<00:05:06.150> for<00:05:06.330> all<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.660> clients<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.200> have

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
also for all the clients that you have

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.020 
also for all the clients that you have
well<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:07.770> really<00:05:07.889> depends<00:05:08.280> where<00:05:08.460> we're<00:05:08.610> at<00:05:08.760> in

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
well it really depends where we're at in

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.159 
well it really depends where we're at in
our<00:05:09.060> training<00:05:09.480> if<00:05:09.540> we're<00:05:09.660> prepping<00:05:09.900> for<00:05:10.110> a

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
our training if we're prepping for a

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.370 
our training if we're prepping for a
show<00:05:10.350> how<00:05:10.560> close<00:05:10.740> we<00:05:10.950> are<00:05:10.980> to<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.340> show<00:05:11.520> but

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
show how close we are to a show but

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.650 
show how close we are to a show but
generally<00:05:13.380> we<00:05:13.500> try<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.800> time<00:05:14.150> our<00:05:15.150> nutrition

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
generally we try to time our nutrition

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.610 
generally we try to time our nutrition
through<00:05:15.810> outer<00:05:15.960> nutrition<00:05:16.230> or<00:05:16.500> on<00:05:16.590> our

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
through outer nutrition or on our

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.770 
through outer nutrition or on our
workouts<00:05:17.100> so<00:05:17.250> we'll<00:05:17.460> get<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:17.640> meal<00:05:17.970> I'm<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.419> good

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
workouts so we'll get a meal I'm a good

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.870 
workouts so we'll get a meal I'm a good
meal<00:05:18.990> at<00:05:19.169> about<00:05:19.320> an<00:05:19.410> hour<00:05:19.530> core<00:05:19.860> workout<00:05:20.310> and

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
meal at about an hour core workout and

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.300 
meal at about an hour core workout and
then<00:05:21.290> right<00:05:22.290> before<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.710> workout<00:05:23.100> we'll

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
then right before the workout we'll

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.770 
then right before the workout we'll
throw<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.520> some<00:05:23.669> extra<00:05:23.760> carbs<00:05:24.300> are<00:05:24.419> some<00:05:24.570> extra

simple carbs we're throwing some aminos

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.550 
simple carbs we're throwing some aminos
