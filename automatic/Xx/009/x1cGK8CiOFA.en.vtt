 sleeve 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 or siren used by systems 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.130
 security and fire alarm for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.480
 filing 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.030
 on in alarm when triggered 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 A security device siren is needed on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.029
 any production 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.920
 at factories factories increased 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.320
 noise just can't do without industrial 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.640
 calls or acoustic sirens 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
 alarm devices are an important link 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.810
 occupational safety and health systems 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.939
 producing using a siren sound 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.220
 only measure out the span of a worker 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 time but also warn workers about 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.850
 hazardous operations in the area 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.680
 situations are sometimes the only 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 way to warn people at risk 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.559
 it give you a sound emitter signal 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.510
 and 0 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.610
 Our range includes sirens 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.090
 production company with the neutron series 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.710
 sas 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.540
 in this series are presented 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.340
 electromagnetic small light 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.590
 piezoceramic models without and 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.600
 ceramic models are used where 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 need a small frame size sound and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.840
 little power consumption and so 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.180
 Electromagnetic series Wait 325 and maybe 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.309
 be tuned in to 6 different tones 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 sound this model have a high level 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.070
 output signal comes in to one hundred and twenty 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.820
 five decibels easily attached by 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.039
 universal bracket garden series 87 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 this piezo ceramic is strong and 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.420
 designed to be installed on the ceiling and 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.310
 serve as an immediate alert very 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.569
 with a loud signal the sound of the siren reaches 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.920
 one hundred twenty two decibels and 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:31.170
 accompanied by flashes of light 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 attracting the attention of these sirens 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.789
 are used as fire protection 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.939
 warning and so forth cop 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.740
 Siren Wait 81 this little goat 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.899
 chronic siren emits low frequency 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.990
 very loud signal at low 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990
 power consumption 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.980
 it can be used for installation 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.430
 on motorcycles and other vehicles 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.990
 siren warning ssrr 72 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.130
 miniature piezoelectric siren with 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.130
 low and soft sound 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.280
 used as an alarm 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.200
 informing them of closed doors and other 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.030
 dangerous situations in cars and vehicles 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.610
 moving residential areas and so 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.350
 further from 2154 and now 2835 2 times 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.239
 small electric sirens 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.239
 with a strong aggressive sound signal 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.250
 they differ in that fewer of them 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.260
 has a horn and has a capacity of 105 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.610
 decibel more 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.860
 has an additional emphasis and 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.860
 respectively 5 dB louder than 110 db 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.180
 used in various automatic 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.130
 fire protection systems 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.750
 anti-theft equipment for 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.370
 car these sirens manufacture 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.989
 will become ron made in dust and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.989
 waterproof their enclosures
