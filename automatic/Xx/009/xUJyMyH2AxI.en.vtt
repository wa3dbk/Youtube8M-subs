00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
on our cob mixture but I think then it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.880 
on our cob mixture but I think then it
gives<00:01:44.870> it<00:01:45.020> texture<00:01:45.260> here<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.770> it's

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
gives it texture here and it's

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.200 
gives it texture here and it's
definitely<00:01:46.220> holding<00:01:46.310> up<00:01:46.550> it's<00:01:46.730> raining<00:01:47.060> right

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210
