report<00:01:12.180> came<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.510> which<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.080> don't<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.619> what

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
happened or anything and but it worked

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.749 
happened or anything and but it worked
fine<00:01:16.439> after<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.070> let<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
fine after that so I just let it for the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.670 
fine after that so I just let it for the
automatic<00:01:18.650> spawning<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> right

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
automatic spawning so this is right

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.240 
automatic spawning so this is right
there<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> wine<00:01:24.090> updating

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
there actually that's the wine updating

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
there actually that's the wine updating
so<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> leave<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
so you just want to leave that it's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
so you just want to leave that it's
right<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.470> see<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.369> off

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.429 
I'm just gonna set my graphics hardest I
like<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.469> that<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:13.739> but<00:02:17.930> whatever<00:02:18.930> you're<00:02:19.109> you

like it that way but whatever you're you
found<00:02:19.680> out<00:02:19.829> that<00:02:19.859> your<00:02:21.019> basic<00:02:22.040> set<00:02:23.040> thing<00:02:23.640> was

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
found out that your basic set thing was

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.240 
found out that your basic set thing was
so<00:02:24.359> it's<00:02:24.450> gonna<00:02:24.569> mess<00:02:25.349> up<00:02:25.500> here<00:02:25.709> for<00:02:25.859> a<00:02:25.920> second

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
so it's gonna mess up here for a second

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.330 
so it's gonna mess up here for a second
but<00:02:26.549> you'll<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.849> that<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.150> gets<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:28.739> now<00:02:28.890> you

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
but you'll see that it gets so now you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.149 
but you'll see that it gets so now you
can<00:02:29.459> see<00:02:29.579> it's<00:02:29.760> full<00:02:29.939> screen<00:02:30.120> obviously<00:02:31.159> you

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
can see it's full screen obviously you

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.259 
can see it's full screen obviously you
can't<00:02:32.340> really<00:02:32.579> see<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.000> cropped

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
can't really see because it's cropped

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.149 
can't really see because it's cropped
again<00:02:33.569> but<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.290> frame<00:02:37.590> rates<00:02:37.799> down<00:02:37.950> to

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
again but the it the frame rates down to

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.949 
again but the it the frame rates down to
one<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.639> it's<00:02:39.500> not<00:02:40.500> very<00:02:40.849> good<00:02:41.849> but<00:02:42.120> yeah<00:02:42.780> it's

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
one and it's not very good but yeah it's

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.869 
one and it's not very good but yeah it's
I<00:02:43.290> thought<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.739> bought<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.310> anyways<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.780> that

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
I thought I bought that anyways so that

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.160 
I thought I bought that anyways so that
should<00:02:47.879> fix<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.239> obviously<00:02:48.599> it<00:02:48.689> doesn't<00:02:48.840> fix

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
should fix it obviously it doesn't fix

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.780 
should fix it obviously it doesn't fix
the<00:02:49.590> FPS<00:02:50.340> issue<00:02:50.579> but<00:02:51.419> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.810> sort<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.790> change

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the FPS issue but you can sort of change

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.300 
the FPS issue but you can sort of change
that<00:02:54.030> by<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:54.389> turning<00:02:54.689> your<00:02:55.010> video<00:02:56.010> settings

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
that by just turning your video settings

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.920 
that by just turning your video settings
really<00:02:56.459> low<00:02:56.669> as<00:02:57.000> low<00:02:57.569> as<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:57.720> can

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
really low as low as you can

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.789 
really low as low as you can
it<00:02:58.500> makes<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.799> better<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.129> your<00:02:59.700> FPS<00:03:00.799> lasts

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
it makes it better in your FPS lasts

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.149 
it makes it better in your FPS lasts
longer<00:03:02.569> also<00:03:03.569> at<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.959> end<00:03:04.379> of<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.829> video<00:03:05.040> you

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
longer also at the end of the video you

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.440 
longer also at the end of the video you
don't<00:03:05.310> actually<00:03:05.430> see<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.700> cut<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.299> out

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
don't actually see this cut it out

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.349 
don't actually see this cut it out
because<00:03:06.629> it<00:03:06.840> was<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.049> really<00:03:07.349> long<00:03:07.700> clip<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:09.120> if

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
because it was a really long clip but if

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.319 
because it was a really long clip but if
you<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:09.989> use<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.590> command<00:03:11.069> enter<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:12.180> they

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
you do use the command enter like they

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.289 
you do use the command enter like they
say<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:13.019> on<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:14.129> forms<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.639> will

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
say to in on the forms that will

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.629 
say to in on the forms that will
actually<00:03:15.780> bring<00:03:16.199> you<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> white<00:03:16.949> screen<00:03:17.220> or

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
actually bring you to a white screen or

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.610 
actually bring you to a white screen or
a<00:03:17.819> black<00:03:18.090> screen<00:03:18.359> depending<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.109> don't<00:03:19.349> really

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
a black screen depending I don't really

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.809 
a black screen depending I don't really
know<00:03:19.799> what<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:20.669> problem<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.030> with<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.530> but

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
know what the problem is with that but

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.920 
know what the problem is with that but
that<00:03:23.819> won't<00:03:23.940> work<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:25.280> if<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.669> try<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.780> you're

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
that won't work so if you try if you're

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.819 
that won't work so if you try if you're
on<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.049> laptop<00:03:28.199> maybe<00:03:28.590> try<00:03:29.659> closing<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:31.260> screen

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
on a laptop maybe try closing the screen

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.259 
on a laptop maybe try closing the screen
and<00:03:32.040> then<00:03:32.220> opening<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.609> back<00:03:32.760> up<00:03:32.909> again<00:03:33.000> that

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
and then opening it back up again that

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.879 
and then opening it back up again that
might<00:03:33.510> work<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.019> do<00:03:34.109> not<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:36.409> say<00:03:37.409> if<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.739> want

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
might work I do not know say if you want

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.110 
might work I do not know say if you want
to<00:03:37.979> get<00:03:38.069> back<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.310> your<00:03:38.370> desktop<00:03:38.729> you<00:03:38.970> could

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
to get back to your desktop you could

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.960 
to get back to your desktop you could
try<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.709> otherwise<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:41.010> you're<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.430> a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
try that otherwise if you're on a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.420 
try that otherwise if you're on a
desktop<00:03:42.720> then<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:44.190> could<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:45.329> think<00:03:45.629> it's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
desktop then you could just I think it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.729 
desktop then you could just I think it's
alt<00:03:47.430> command<00:03:47.849> eject<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:49.019> should<00:03:49.319> put<00:03:49.590> your

computer into sleep and then depending

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.349 
computer into sleep and then depending
on<00:03:52.470> what<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.370> your<00:03:53.459> settings<00:03:53.699> is<00:03:54.000> I
