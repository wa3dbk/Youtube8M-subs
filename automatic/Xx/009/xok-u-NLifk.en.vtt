00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980 

so<00:00:00.900> let's<00:00:01.079> compare<00:00:01.560> Intel's<00:00:02.520> Haswell

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990 
so let's compare Intel's Haswell

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.519 
so let's compare Intel's Haswell
processors<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.200> seven<00:00:04.859> dash<00:00:05.100> 0<00:00:05.339> 5<00:00:05.910> 10<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.810> I

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
processors I seven dash 0 5 10 you and I

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.350

seven<00:00:08.130> dash<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.700> 710<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:10.010> so<00:00:11.010> basically<00:00:11.360> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
seven dash for 710 and so basically the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.430 
seven dash for 710 and so basically the
most<00:00:12.719> important<00:00:13.440> difference<00:00:13.889> if<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.599> 74<00:00:15.599> 74<00:00:16.199> 5

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
most important difference if I 74 74 5

or something wrong here for 7 1 0 and Q

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.310 
or something wrong here for 7 1 0 and Q
it's<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.859> crack<00:00:26.189> core<00:00:26.609> processor<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.990> because

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it's a crack core processor just because

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.519 
it's a crack core processor just because
the<00:00:28.410> process<00:00:28.949> number<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.849> curved<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.990> double

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the process number of curved a double

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.069 
the process number of curved a double
you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.160> expect<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.790> least<00:00:32.850> double<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you can expect at least double the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.010 
you can expect at least double the
performance<00:00:36.079> it's<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.899> number<00:00:39.899> of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
performance it's just not the number of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.860 
performance it's just not the number of
code<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.059> base<00:00:42.360> clock

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
code we also see that the base clock

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260 
code we also see that the base clock
frequency<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.710> force<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.730> Q<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
frequency for force and one go and Q is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.260 
frequency for force and one go and Q is
also<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.739> than<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> base<00:00:47.340> clock<00:00:47.640> frequency

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
also more than the base clock frequency

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.310 
also more than the base clock frequency
or<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.629> Python<00:00:49.320> 0<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.730> also<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.870> terms<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
or for Python 0 so and also the terms of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.939 
or for Python 0 so and also the terms of
God<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.860> much<00:00:53.309> higher<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.640> case<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.440> 471<00:00:55.440> 0<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
God is much higher in case of 471 0 and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.349 
God is much higher in case of 471 0 and
Q<00:00:56.750> ha<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.430> reflected

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
Q ha and that's what we it's reflected

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.990 
Q ha and that's what we it's reflected
in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> past<00:01:00.899> market<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.859> almost<00:01:02.039> more

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
in the past market but it's almost more

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.950 
in the past market but it's almost more
than<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.780> BB<00:01:04.379> performance<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.780> are

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

master<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.850> occupancy<00:02:31.540> was<00:02:32.350> active<00:02:32.890> wrong<00:02:33.160> in

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
master of occupancy was active wrong in

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370 
master of occupancy was active wrong in
this<00:02:33.550> but<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.720> point<00:02:34.960> when<00:02:35.200> these

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
this but here it is the point when these

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.430 
this but here it is the point when these
are<00:02:35.530> for<00:02:35.830> sexy<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.400> pi<00:02:36.580> pika<00:02:36.820> but<00:02:37.780> nothing<00:02:38.020> is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
are for sexy for pi pika but nothing is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.730 
are for sexy for pi pika but nothing is
the<00:02:39.160> i<00:02:39.190> seven<00:02:39.940> dash<00:02:40.650> 471<00:02:41.650> 0<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.160> Q<00:02:42.490> at<00:02:42.790> higher

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
the i seven dash 471 0 and Q at higher

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.080 
the i seven dash 471 0 and Q at higher
l3<00:02:44.740> cache<00:02:46.830> against<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.130> price<00:02:48.430> point<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.910> view

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
l3 cache against the price point of view

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.250 
l3 cache against the price point of view
well<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.590> icer<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.760> put<00:02:52.090> seven<00:02:52.570> fundamental

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
well the icer that put seven fundamental

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.050 
well the icer that put seven fundamental
is<00:02:53.950> even<00:02:54.190> cheaper<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.830> price<00:02:57.160> points<00:02:57.880> you

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
is even cheaper so the price points you

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.530 
is even cheaper so the price points you
get<00:02:58.239> more<00:02:58.600> performance<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.440> low<00:02:59.800> price<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.390> if

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
get more performance of low price so if

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.720 
get more performance of low price so if
you<00:03:01.780> are<00:03:01.930> looking<00:03:02.110> for<00:03:02.290> performance<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.489> you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
you are looking for performance and you

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.690 
you are looking for performance and you
are<00:03:03.850> not<00:03:04.060> into<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.690> good<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.890> rely<00:03:06.310> for

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
are not into the good that rely for

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.060 
are not into the good that rely for
light<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.300> conductor<00:03:07.840> well<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.440> send<00:03:08.890> that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
light and conductor well I send that

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.910 
light and conductor well I send that
force<00:03:09.310> n1<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.910> n2<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.900> obvious<00:03:11.020> choice

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.090 

there<00:03:14.920> are<00:03:15.100> other<00:03:15.160> differed<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.970> differences

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
there are other differed the differences

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.789 
there are other differed the differences
you<00:03:18.100> also<00:03:18.280> get<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.670> pci<00:03:19.299> express<00:03:19.630> 3.0<00:03:19.799> with

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
you also get a pci express 3.0 with

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.120 
you also get a pci express 3.0 with
Iceland<00:03:21.310> at<00:03:21.459> 47<00:03:21.970> minus<00:03:22.120> NQ<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.920> would

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
Iceland at 47 minus NQ and that would

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.350 
Iceland at 47 minus NQ and that would
point<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.790> go<00:03:25.330> with<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:28.060> basically

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
point to go with it so that basically

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.600 
point to go with it so that basically
covers<00:03:28.780> most<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.709> differences<00:03:30.250> leave

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
covers most of the differences leave

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.200 
covers most of the differences leave
your<00:03:30.760> comment<00:03:31.150> thanks<00:03:31.720> for<00:03:31.870> looking
