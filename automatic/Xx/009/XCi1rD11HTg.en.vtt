00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
first I really didn't understand and

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.710 
first I really didn't understand and
didn't<00:04:32.850> really<00:04:32.940> know<00:04:33.150> what<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.300> was<00:04:33.509> because

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
didn't really know what it was because

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.420 
didn't really know what it was because
it<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.050> my<00:04:34.199> first<00:04:34.410> time<00:04:34.590> competing<00:04:34.919> in<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.280> but

it is my first time competing in it but

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.540 
it is my first time competing in it but
now<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.699> understand<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.139> submission<00:04:37.979> is<00:04:38.310> 10

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
now I understand that a submission is 10

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.640 
now I understand that a submission is 10
points<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.570> know<00:04:39.690> pinfall<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.259> seven

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
points and you know pinfall is seven

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.230 
points and you know pinfall is seven
points<00:04:40.979> but<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.220> got<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.910> figure<00:04:42.090> out<00:04:42.210> a

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
points but I got to figure out a

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.689 
points but I got to figure out a
submission<00:04:42.600> man<00:04:42.960> if<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:44.039> don't<00:04:44.100> figure<00:04:44.340> out<00:04:44.520> one

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699

title was at stake I think men that guy
could<00:05:10.199> have<00:05:10.289> some<00:05:10.500> crazy<00:05:11.099> good<00:05:11.400> matches<00:05:11.849> so

could have some crazy good matches so

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.610 
could have some crazy good matches so
hopefully<00:05:12.509> that's<00:05:12.810> going<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.320> be<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.440> part<00:05:13.590> of
