root<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.510> negative<00:02:53.810> 25<00:02:54.760> minus<00:02:55.760> negative<00:02:56.510> 9<00:02:57.310> we

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
root of negative 25 minus negative 9 we

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.150 
root of negative 25 minus negative 9 we
see<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.550> negative<00:02:58.850> 9<00:02:59.270> in<00:02:59.570> parentheses<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.560> a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
see a negative 9 in parentheses and a

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.460 
see a negative 9 in parentheses and a
negative<00:03:01.640> sign<00:03:01.940> outside<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.870> parenthesis

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
negative sign outside the parenthesis

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.220 
negative sign outside the parenthesis
with<00:03:04.400> parentheses<00:03:05.120> whenever<00:03:05.870> there<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.140> a

negative sign outside and a negative
sign<00:03:08.600> inside<00:03:08.900> we<00:03:09.620> can<00:03:09.770> combine<00:03:09.950> them<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.730> make

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
sign inside we can combine them to make

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.479 
sign inside we can combine them to make
a<00:03:10.940> positive<00:03:11.209> on<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.350> other<00:03:12.470> side<00:03:12.800> we<00:03:13.250> have<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
a positive on the other side we have the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.240 
a positive on the other side we have the
square<00:03:13.820> root<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:14.150> negative<00:03:14.360> 25<00:03:15.140> from<00:03:16.070> our

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
square root of negative 25 from our

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.370 
square root of negative 25 from our
previous<00:03:16.700> example<00:03:17.330> we<00:03:17.720> learn<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.170> this

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
previous example we learn that this

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.229 
previous example we learn that this
equals<00:03:18.830> 5<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.239> our<00:03:20.360> answer<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.110> 5i<00:03:21.980> plus<00:03:22.850> 9

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
equals 5 I so our answer is 5i plus 9

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.580 
equals 5 I so our answer is 5i plus 9
let's<00:03:24.200> do<00:03:24.500> one<00:03:24.830> last<00:03:24.860> problem<00:03:26.290> suppose<00:03:27.290> we

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
let's do one last problem suppose we

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.229 
let's do one last problem suppose we
have<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.830> square<00:03:28.100> root<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.489> negative<00:03:28.730> nine

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
have the square root of negative nine

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.160 
have the square root of negative nine
minus<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:30.320> negative<00:03:30.500> 25<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:32.239> time<00:03:32.570> we<00:03:32.989> see

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
minus a negative 25 this time we see

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.199 
minus a negative 25 this time we see
brackets<00:03:33.709> surrounding<00:03:34.280> negative<00:03:34.730> 9<00:03:35.000> and

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
brackets surrounding negative 9 and

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.710 
brackets surrounding negative 9 and
negative<00:03:35.750> 25<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.489> tells<00:03:37.790> us<00:03:38.000> we<00:03:38.420> have<00:03:38.450> to

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
negative 25 so this tells us we have to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.330 
negative 25 so this tells us we have to
solve<00:03:38.900> what's<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.470> brackets<00:03:39.680> first

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
solve what's in the brackets first

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.699 
solve what's in the brackets first
before<00:03:40.970> we<00:03:41.360> can<00:03:41.540> try<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.930> find<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.350> square

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
before we can try to find the square

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.940 
before we can try to find the square
root<00:03:43.120> once<00:03:44.120> again<00:03:44.510> we<00:03:45.019> have<00:03:45.200> two<00:03:45.440> negatives

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
root once again we have two negatives

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.810 
root once again we have two negatives
and<00:03:46.250> we<00:03:46.850> know<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.269> equals<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.900> positive<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:49.640> we

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
and we know that equals a positive so we

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.610 
and we know that equals a positive so we
are<00:03:49.940> looking<00:03:50.150> at<00:03:50.510> negative<00:03:51.260> 9<00:03:51.769> plus<00:03:52.280> 25<00:03:53.620> 25

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
are looking at negative 9 plus 25 25

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.350 
are looking at negative 9 plus 25 25
minus<00:03:55.430> 9<00:03:55.459> equals<00:03:56.080> 16<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:58.130> are<00:03:58.280> now<00:03:58.489> left<00:03:58.850> with

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
minus 9 equals 16 we are now left with

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.130 
minus 9 equals 16 we are now left with
the<00:03:59.390> square<00:03:59.660> root<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.350> 16<00:04:01.239> what<00:04:02.239> number<00:04:02.690> times

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
the square root of 16 what number times

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.050 
the square root of 16 what number times
itself<00:04:03.410> equals<00:04:04.000> 16<00:04:05.000> that's<00:04:05.989> right<00:04:06.560> 4<00:04:07.340> times<00:04:07.730> 4

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
itself equals 16 that's right 4 times 4

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.560 
itself equals 16 that's right 4 times 4
equals<00:04:08.480> 16<00:04:09.080> so<00:04:09.830> 4<00:04:10.190> is<00:04:10.430> our<00:04:10.670> answer

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
equals 16 so 4 is our answer

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.800 
equals 16 so 4 is our answer
