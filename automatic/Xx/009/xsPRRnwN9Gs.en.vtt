00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.529
 hey 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.880
 the function of a locked is an extra 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.529
 security for the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.200
 in this case the cabin part of one 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.360
 motorhome comes in two 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.860
 different variants 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.570
 a variant without a key in one 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.960
 variant with key 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.120
 the key variant is also 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.970
 still available with extra travel time key 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.890
 for example for the home selden 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.930
 or a hatch on a motorhome that there with 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.050
 one key can all be operated 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.050
 to become 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.609
 Hi 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.359
 the lock can be built in yourself 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.789
 there are versions that fall under the 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.369
 existing bolts and mine 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.020
 be placed in their door locks 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.789
 there are also versions such as these where 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.829
 for some holes in it in the 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.890
 cabin door must be born 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.319
 to which the lock is attached 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.659
 we confirm such locks then it is 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.119
 about half an hour's work and then 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.149
 there would be a 35 euros in assembly costs 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.399
 we come without the key 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.770
 is at 130 euros 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.770
 the version with key is 150 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.490
 no with this type of locks that has none 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.490
 influence on the insurance premium
