the lobby to do it all over again we
took<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.850> different<00:00:50.120> approach<00:00:50.329> with<00:00:50.719> global

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
took a different approach with global

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.680 
took a different approach with global
events<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.860> means<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.460> lot<00:00:52.820> more<00:00:53.000> playing<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.629> a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
events it means a lot more playing and a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.810 
events it means a lot more playing and a
lot<00:00:53.870> less<00:00:53.899> sweet<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:55.129> way<00:00:55.160> global<00:00:55.610> of<00:00:55.700> us

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
lot less sweet the way global of us

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.520 
lot less sweet the way global of us
works<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:56.390> there's<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.750> constant<00:00:57.170> ongoing

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
works is that there's a constant ongoing

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
in-game currency and SSX and the way

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.350 
in-game currency and SSX and the way
they<00:01:18.830> work<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.340> some<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.030> global

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
they work is that some of the global

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.330 
they work is that some of the global
events<00:01:20.750> actually<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.380> drop<00:01:21.650> cost<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.130> join

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
events actually have a drop cost to join

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.160 
events actually have a drop cost to join
some<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.700> them<00:01:22.820> are<00:01:22.910> free<00:01:23.120> some<00:01:23.690> have<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:23.960> very

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
some of them are free some have a very

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.780 
some of them are free some have a very
low<00:01:24.350> drop<00:01:24.650> cost<00:01:24.920> like<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.190> few<00:01:25.370> hundred<00:01:25.490> credits

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
low drop cost like a few hundred credits

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.370 
low drop cost like a few hundred credits
and<00:01:26.120> then<00:01:26.510> there's<00:01:26.690> even<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.990> few<00:01:27.110> exclusive

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380
