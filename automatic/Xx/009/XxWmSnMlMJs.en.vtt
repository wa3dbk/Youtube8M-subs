of the year that are just better to be

of the year that are just better to be
out<00:00:57.890> than<00:00:58.250> other<00:00:58.460> times<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:59.720> know<00:00:59.870> birding<00:01:00.290> is

out than other times you know birding is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.830 
out than other times you know birding is
exactly<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.400> same<00:01:01.579> way<00:01:01.879> one<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.570> very

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
exactly the same way one of the very

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.049 
exactly the same way one of the very
best<00:01:03.260> seasons<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.369> year<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:04.820> be<00:01:04.940> out

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
best seasons of the year to be out

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.450 
best seasons of the year to be out
birding<00:01:05.449> is<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.170> spring<00:01:06.619> just<00:01:07.040> as<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
birding is in the spring just as the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.120 
birding is in the spring just as the
trees<00:01:07.759> are<00:01:08.119> beginning<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:08.780> leaf<00:01:08.960> out<00:01:09.170> there's

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
trees are beginning to leaf out there's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.969 
trees are beginning to leaf out there's
two<00:01:10.340> reasons<00:01:10.580> for<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.150> one<00:01:11.660> is<00:01:11.990> that's<00:01:12.590> about

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
two reasons for that one is that's about

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.370 
two reasons for that one is that's about
the<00:01:13.220> time<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.700> migratory<00:01:14.450> birds<00:01:14.810> start<00:01:15.320> to

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
the time that migratory birds start to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.100 
the time that migratory birds start to
return<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.250> an<00:01:16.369> area<00:01:16.820> giving<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
return to an area giving you the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.469 
return to an area giving you the
potential<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.070> seeing<00:01:19.340> those<00:01:19.729> particular

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
potential of seeing those particular

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.340 
potential of seeing those particular
species

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
species

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.060 
species
another<00:01:22.220> reason<00:01:22.550> is<00:01:23.410> dependent<00:01:24.410> upon<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
another reason is dependent upon the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.760 
another reason is dependent upon the
foliage<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:26.780> I<00:01:26.810> mean<00:01:27.050> by<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.440> is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
foliage and what I mean by that is

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.460 
foliage and what I mean by that is
that's<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.610> time<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.060> year<00:01:29.390> when<00:01:30.020> there's<00:01:30.289> not

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
that's the time of year when there's not

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.160 
that's the time of year when there's not
so<00:01:30.680> much<00:01:30.830> foliage<00:01:31.399> in<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.700> way<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.450> your<00:01:32.690> view

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
so much foliage in the way of your view

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.330 
so much foliage in the way of your view
of<00:01:33.470> particular<00:01:34.250> birds<00:01:34.580> for<00:01:35.570> example<00:01:35.950> if<00:01:36.950> I

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
of particular birds for example if I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.719 
of particular birds for example if I
have<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:37.970> little<00:01:38.509> fluttering<00:01:39.500> birdie<00:01:40.100> over

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
have a little fluttering birdie over

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.219 
have a little fluttering birdie over
here<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:42.080> perches<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.880> bush<00:01:44.300> where<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
here that perches in this bush where the

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.740 
here that perches in this bush where the
leaves<00:01:45.440> are<00:01:45.800> pretty<00:01:46.369> well-developed<00:01:46.940> it's

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
leaves are pretty well-developed it's

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.560 
leaves are pretty well-developed it's
pretty<00:01:48.110> hard<00:01:48.380> for<00:01:48.679> you<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.160> that<00:01:49.340> bird<00:01:49.670> but

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
pretty hard for you to see that bird but

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.840 
pretty hard for you to see that bird but
if<00:01:50.929> he<00:01:51.200> goes<00:01:51.440> flying<00:01:51.800> across<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:54.340> decides<00:01:55.340> to

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
if he goes flying across and decides to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.830 
if he goes flying across and decides to
a<00:01:56.360> light<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.590> limb<00:01:57.829> of<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.610> tree<00:01:58.720> where<00:01:59.720> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
a light in a limb of a tree where the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.649 
a light in a limb of a tree where the
leaves<00:02:00.079> aren't<00:02:00.470> very<00:02:00.740> far<00:02:01.400> developed<00:02:02.090> it's

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
leaves aren't very far developed it's

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.219 
leaves aren't very far developed it's
much<00:02:03.020> much<00:02:03.320> easier<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.920> see<00:02:04.329> that<00:02:05.329> factor

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
much much easier to see that factor

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.949 
much much easier to see that factor
makes<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.070> much<00:02:07.280> easier<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.970> spot<00:02:08.299> birds<00:02:08.690> in

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
makes it much easier to spot birds in

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.259 
makes it much easier to spot birds in
the<00:02:09.110> spring<00:02:09.530> right<00:02:10.130> as<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.610> leaves<00:02:10.850> are

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
the spring right as the leaves are

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.110 
the spring right as the leaves are
beginning<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:12.170> bud<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.220> great<00:02:13.489> time<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.820> be

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
beginning to bud it's a great time to be

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.330 
beginning to bud it's a great time to be
in<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.329> outdoors<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.079> it<00:02:15.410> might<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.860> very

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
in the outdoors and it might be the very

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.850 
in the outdoors and it might be the very
best<00:02:16.549> season<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.780> year<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.590> out
