00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
pretty impressive 27 games 226 and a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.610 
pretty impressive 27 games 226 and a
third<00:02:45.580> innings<00:02:45.790> pitched<00:02:46.210> only<00:02:46.540> gave<00:02:47.020> up<00:02:47.170> 32

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980

that craziness um he's not doing that
well<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:53.890> year<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.250> think<00:02:54.550> he's<00:02:54.640> lost<00:02:54.850> his

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
well this year I think he's lost his

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.870 
well this year I think he's lost his
first<00:02:55.540> couple<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.900> games<00:02:56.140> but<00:02:56.530> his<00:02:57.250> era<00:02:57.490> is<00:02:57.670> not

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
first couple of games but his era is not

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.270 
first couple of games but his era is not
not<00:02:58.120> too<00:02:58.360> bad<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.840> guess<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.770> look<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.190> guy
