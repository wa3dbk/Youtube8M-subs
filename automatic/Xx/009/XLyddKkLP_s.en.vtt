00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.740
 read not seduced shared some facts 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.019
 highlights of this device the crj1000 which 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.360

 crj1000 letters last born of the family 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.610
 crj in planes of 100 places 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.440
 we also recorded 100 and 977 90 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.020
 places in it's a plane that was 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.789
 developed on a minimum change we have 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.110
 naturally lengthen the cabin for 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.719
 to be able to carry more 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.640
 passengers and with a larger cabin 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.289
 the peas of operations have asked so 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 we have one too is a bit more 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.820
 great and we took the opportunity to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.640
 develop the product by adding 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.589
 carbon brakes on the plane so some 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 relatively simple changes and a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.920
 high- performance aircraft and there I you 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.580

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.160
 interior 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.600
 so before joining jean guy who 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.390
 waiting for us inside the cabin 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.880
 the CRJ1000 company garuda 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.590
 I would like to introduce two 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.590
 edge happens live 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:57.460

 so hello good come a silly mistake 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.170
 crj in a few words 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 improvements made or its origins 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 and helps make my job easier 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.800
 as a pilot and also improve the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.360
 security but personally that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.489
 will do a lot of the device if its 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.319
 maneuverability that combines a small 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.989
 sports car we end up in the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.819
 new generation cabin of crj1000 and 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.500
 we made three points change 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.690
 a notebook with this model 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.340
 previous we have a new office 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.420
 which is much bigger and so 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.010
 leave a lot more light 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.890
 natural enter the cabin 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.810
 we have enlarged volume for 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 luggage compartments are behind and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.390
 we changed everything entirely 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.980
 the lighting guess with the becoming so 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.790
 we will always be a super cabin 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:55.260
 modern super comfort before writing I 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.060
 would like us with silva it's already done 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.700
 two days that we are at the show of 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.290

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.410
 20 years of experience in 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.750
 anti-poor cergy programs move it 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.040
 goes on how but I find that 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.400
 many visitors who come to see 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.680
 our products they are very curious are 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.380
 eager to answer for me it's very 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.980
 motivating and rewarding to talk to them about 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.980
 crj 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.909
