00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.800
 Sandvik Coromant's Coromant EH modular system is constantly growing 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.280
 and currently includes a wide range of interchangeable inserts 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.400
 boring heads 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.960
 solid carbide heads, but also different types of stopwatches 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.720
 and integrated machining adapters. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.160
 Customers interested in smart tool solutions and cutters 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.000
 with indexable inserts 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.080
 clamped with the EH coupling, the following two things might be of interest. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.040
 On large machining centers, it has milling cutters for milling 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.640
 10 to 32 mm diameter with longer tooling 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.600
 choosing the shank material and its external dimensions is of utmost importance. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
 Our G Type Reduced Shanks Made of Heavy Metal 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 allow for the creation of a sufficiently large working clearance along the length of the stem. 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.640
 Small and medium-sized machining centers 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.840
 It is extremely important to ensure that the length of the tool assembly 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.240
 does not exceed the critical distance of the measuring point.
