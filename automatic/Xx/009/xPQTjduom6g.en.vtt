00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello welcome to a new vive lesson from 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 blame this time to look at 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.550
 diagnostic test of chapter 6 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.840
 devices and this time I am reporting per 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.519
 statement off 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.080
 first question was ridden without 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.520
 calculator lane in between steps 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 and then the question is 6 times 5 squared 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.750
 and 6 times 5 squared 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.730
 you can write it down as 6 times 25 and 6 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:38.100
 25 times that is one hundred and fifty 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.690
 by going to task b48 minus 5 times 3 in the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.379
 square 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.239
 48 min 5 times 3 thinking squared 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.260
 squares take precedence over the calculation order 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:55.230
 so everything as 48 min 5 times 3 in it 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:03.030
 squared is 9 so we come to 58 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:07.200
 min 5 times 9 5 times 9 is 45 48 min 45 is 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.770
 3 assignment 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.270
 c 15 min 3 squared min 80 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.729
 divided by 4 squared 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:23.130
 open the parenthesis 15 min 3 squared 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:24.780
 minus 80 divided by 4 squared 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.250
 parentheses take precedence so I'm going to be real 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.060
 step by step 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.939
 15 min 3 is 12 and I only take one step 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.939
 So keep it for a while per line 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.960
 144 is still over 12 in square 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.000
 always one step the line 144 minus 80 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.689
 divided by 4 squared 80 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.619
 divided by 16 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:02:00.750
 so that is 144 minus 80 divided by 16 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:02.460
 5 so they come out at 139 and the last one 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.110
 of the series and then we go through after 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 problem d160 divided by 8 minus 7 in the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.940
 so squared 160 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.090
 divided by 8 min 7 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.940
 the square that is 160 divided by 8 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.000
 minus 7 that is a square to go yet 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.420
 always for one squared is 1 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.130
 the answer is one hundred and sixty 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.710
 this was assignment 1 thanks for looking 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.710
 and until I assume assignment 2
