00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
on the gateway laptops of our motherland

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.600 
on the gateway laptops of our motherland
notice<00:01:17.750> where<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.860> have<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.100> temperature

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
notice where you have the temperature

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.250 
notice where you have the temperature
set<00:01:20.090> already

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
set already

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.050

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
minutes after we keep the video chipper

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.560 
minutes after we keep the video chipper
should<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.050> good<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> go

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
should be good to go

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the computer on to see if the reflow

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.720 
the computer on to see if the reflow
worked<00:01:36.480> so<00:01:37.440> if<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> worked<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.250> lights<00:01:38.460> should

should<00:01:44.730> have<00:01:45.020> power<00:01:47.090> okay<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.480> we<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.950> let

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
should have power okay there we go let

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:59.290 
should have power okay there we go let
