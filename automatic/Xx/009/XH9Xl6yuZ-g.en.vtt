out at the top of the bell housing where
I<00:00:35.650> got<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:36.070> advented<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.700> bell<00:00:36.850> housing<00:00:37.030> the

I got to advented the bell housing the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.620 
I got to advented the bell housing the
clutch<00:00:37.630> is<00:00:37.840> so<00:00:38.050> hot<00:00:38.730> even<00:00:39.730> with<00:00:40.030> my<00:00:40.180> modified

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
clutch is so hot even with my modified

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.470 
clutch is so hot even with my modified
clutch<00:00:40.930> this<00:00:41.640> I've<00:00:42.640> got<00:00:42.850> to<00:00:42.969> let<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:43.239> thing

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
clutch this I've got to let this thing

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.430 
clutch this I've got to let this thing
cool<00:00:43.660> down<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.969> gonna<00:00:46.809> give<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.109> a<00:00:47.170> few<00:00:47.289> minutes

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
cool down so gonna give it a few minutes

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.130 
cool down so gonna give it a few minutes
to<00:00:47.769> cool<00:00:47.890> off<00:00:48.219> here<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:49.539> then<00:00:49.660> I'm<00:00:49.780> gonna<00:00:49.929> try

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
to cool off here and then I'm gonna try

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.990 
to cool off here and then I'm gonna try
get<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.530> further<00:00:50.829> up<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.100> mountain<00:00:51.129> I<00:00:51.699> guess

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
get and further up the mountain I guess

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.490 
get and further up the mountain I guess
we<00:00:52.149> if<00:00:52.359> we<00:00:52.510> can<00:00:52.660> get<00:00:52.809> another<00:00:53.019> couple<00:00:53.410> hundred

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
we if we can get another couple hundred

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.970 
we if we can get another couple hundred
feet<00:00:53.829> of<00:00:53.949> elevation<00:00:55.019> that<00:00:56.019> we<00:00:56.410> can<00:00:56.589> get<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.890> the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
feet of elevation that we can get to the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.740 
feet of elevation that we can get to the
snow<00:00:57.219> and<00:00:57.670> that's<00:00:58.239> where<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.539> road<00:00:58.719> is

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
snow and that's where the road is

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.220 
snow and that's where the road is
impassable<00:00:59.710> at<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.550> point<00:01:00.929> so<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.050> game

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
impassable at that point so the game

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:22.010 
impassable at that point so the game
plan<00:01:02.530> now<00:01:02.800> is<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:03.160> try<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.370> get<00:01:03.609> to<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.850> snow

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:50.120 

40<00:01:23.020> degrees
