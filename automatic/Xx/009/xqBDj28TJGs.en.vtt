00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.870
 Hi, I'm Linda, I'm a nice gamer . 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.990
 new video about the league of legends 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.389
 this time it's about driver and then see 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.160
 what will come soon 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.410
 surely next week I will 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.980
 teach your animations 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:25.320
 your skills and good for you to see 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:30.590
 how is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.590
 this is the first animation without winning 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.480
 + 2 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.760
 it was a kind of dance let's go 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.520
 and well this is the fourth 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.390
 a kind of mockery 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.390
 agatha 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.210
 let's catch some random object more 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 that nothing is going to prove the hero is da 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 same 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.729
 is now teaching us the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.890
 skills the passive the impacts 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.910
 Critics of training and additional damage 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.979
 and his first skill also does it and without 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.780
 have done criticized the first skill 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.600
 rotating ax in the next attack 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.460
 dry additional physical benefit throws 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.070
 bounces towards the goal and if it returns 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.020
 to catch it the cord is reduced to zero 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.479
 adrenaline rush the solution a 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 interest will increase dry well 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.530
 reducing over time and it becomes 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.640
 take the ax we're going to the koldo 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.640
 followed an adrenaline 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.990
 that is, the third skill aside 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.000
 thrown off the ax and drives the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.490
 enemies and reducing your speed 1 and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.780
 the last thrown in three huge that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.330
 inflict physical damage on units 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.680
 reached here and good is changing from 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.600
 direction little by little until it returns to 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.330
 driver 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.270
 and after hitting the enemy champion 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.590
 good the ability of the ultimate too 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.480
 can be activated 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.730
 after having used it also 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.850
 it can be reactivated to return to 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.290
 Andrew 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.030
 spears of these dates and return 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.280
 that less damage per unit reached 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.680
 obviously so 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.970
 Many years ago 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.660
 transform directly 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.660
 on the contrary 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.840
 because if not the damage 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.470
 good as you see the hero attacks from afar 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.120
 it's something unexpected at least for me to know 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.500
 what would it be to talk 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.500
 undeserved darius 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.930
 and the truth is that it looks pretty 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.950
 good 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.950
 I liked it a lot 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.100
 quite 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.540
 is bouncing and can not continue using 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.230
 until 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.230
 they waited for me 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.220
 a stability 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.220
 this life 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.489
 It is a 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.489
 the separated ones 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.670
 it's a life of the same 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.910
 but it's pretty bad 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.040
 Y 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.220
 well let's move on to the part that 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.220
 solve 6 our 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.460
 good this level 6 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.460
 I'm going to spend the last 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.489
 the vote that I put against me in the game 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.670
 although the use against it 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.670
 Thank you 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.199
 well I did not set to continue as you see above 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.199
 24 degrees 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.650
 it does not seem like it took away too much 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.300
 I really do not know 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.080
 but good to movistar enough in 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.669
 come back like this 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.669
 can activate for when before 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.120
