00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.080
 Hmm 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.080
 Hematopoiesis and red blood cells where blood is made 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.039
 Hematopoiesis 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.039
 Red bone marrow 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.460
 Increased application for blood in bone marrow and lymphatic tissues 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:29.440
 Is called 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:32.099
 Red blood cell production occurs in any bone marrow until the age of 5 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:39.079
 Sternum in adults 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:45.550
 It is done with red bone marrow such as rib vertebral body 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.550
 Take out the lumbar spine and see the cross section of the market noodles 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.520
 You can see the bone marrow in the cross section of the vertebral body 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 All bones of infants 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 It is the red bone marrow, but in together and aging 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.000
 Replaced with fat tissue by Shirai 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:13.690
 Changes to yellow marrow 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:19.260
 Sternum ribs in adults is carried out in any bone marrow production up to 5-year-old red blood cells 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.260
 This has been done by then barrier kid, such as decline 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.550
 Hematopoietic stem cells and culture 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.550
 Red blood cells 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 I will try to expand the bone marrow 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:41.280
 There is totipotent stem cells in the red bone marrow 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:45.420
 Myeloid cells differentiated from there are not only red blood cells 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.530
 From white blood cell platelet search 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.080
 Differentiates into macrophages 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.540
 Next, as a process to differentiate into red blood cells 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.600
 Become an erythroid stem cell 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:07.890
 It is a glycoprotein at this time 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:12.290
 Elie slope works to promote red blood cell proliferation and maturation 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:18.560
 All seats will be 9 from there 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:21.610
 It can be combined with oxygen molecules when from all seat baseball become erythroblasts 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.320
 Hemoglobin is incorporated 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.430
 The horn is gone and it is young red blood cell 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.260
 Become reticulocytes 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.260
 It matures and becomes red blood cells and is sent out to blood vessels 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 Let's check the next country 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.980
 Bone marrow 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.470
 Totipotent stem cells 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.470
 ips cellular hemoglobin 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:03:02.310
 Let's search with search engines such as Yahoo! and Google 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:02.310
 In addition, let's look at books such as library medical encyclopedia or biological chemistry
