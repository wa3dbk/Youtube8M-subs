00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.490
 today we talked about leadership and 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.459
 coaching applied to small businesses to 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.020
 family businesses and autonomous indeed 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.140
 part of the attendees who have come 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.780
 they pose the question for example of 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.690
 how can i improve 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.090
 in the roles he served as chief 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.670
 or responsible and my company who I 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.100
 can help improve the management of my 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 clients of my team to improve the 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.010
 relationship with others and even with me 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 same too and these are questions that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.880
 we have worked here that we have given 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 some answer and that helps a lot 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.470
 the coaching processes to get 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.620
 in fact we have focused on three 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.930
 great aspects is one to have clarity 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.250
 of objectives to be very clear who 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.800
 I want to become more of that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 eternal question that we all ask ourselves of 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.730
 where I want to be tomorrow that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.989
 I want to get that at the end of the year 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.610
 where I want my company or me to be 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.850
 as a professional throughout 2015 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.310
 another question that we have worked hard 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.380
 is the whole issue of self leadership 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.690
 because the first person that one 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.820
 must lead is himself 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.960
 we are too demanding and above all 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.610
 this profile is very enterprising very 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 self-employed to set up their own businesses 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.260
 they are very responsible people who 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.550
 they charge a lot and they have to 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.100
 learn also to give reinforcements 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.720
 positive to themselves and a third 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.910
 question that we have worked on this 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.220
 environment is the subject of the skills of 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.200
 communication to improve relationships 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.630
 with others in the environment well of 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.050
 clients 20 institutions well of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.820
 work teams or with ourselves 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.930
 we have done some practices that also 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.430
 to be fun that have also been 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.530
 in people it has taken good 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.850
 conclusions and even some 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.580
 Attendees at the end of the day 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.780
 said because today I realized how 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.110
 important that is to make a small 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.510
 pause to think or reflect order 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.970
 and give clarity or priority to my 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.340
 objectives and about all these issues 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.910
 have been those that we have worked in 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.910
 today's talk
