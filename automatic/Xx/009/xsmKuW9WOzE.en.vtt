00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.459 

next<00:00:00.359> up<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.599> want<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.870> show<00:00:01.050> you<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.199> little

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
next up I want to show you a little

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.059 
next up I want to show you a little
trick<00:00:01.820> about<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.210> loop<00:00:03.629> mode<00:00:03.929> if<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.770> take

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
trick about the loop mode if you take

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.299 
trick about the loop mode if you take
the<00:00:05.400> ratio<00:00:06.299> delay<00:00:07.020> time<00:00:07.319> knob<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.980> move<00:00:08.189> it

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the ratio delay time knob and move it

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.580 
the ratio delay time knob and move it
all<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.730> way<00:00:08.910> clockwise<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:10.170> now<00:00:10.380> are

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
all the way clockwise you now are

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.039 
all the way clockwise you now are
entered<00:00:10.950> into<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.309> loop<00:00:11.519> mode<00:00:11.849> if<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.660> press

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
entered into the loop mode if you press

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.440 
entered into the loop mode if you press
and<00:00:13.320> hold<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.040> tap<00:00:14.370> button<00:00:14.670> you've<00:00:15.210> begun

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
and hold on the tap button you've begun

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.080 
and hold on the tap button you've begun
recording<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.529> loop<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.070> soon<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.850> let

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
recording your loop as soon as you let

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.689 
recording your loop as soon as you let
go<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.690> loop<00:00:19.109> repeats<00:00:19.500> itself<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.340> let's<00:00:20.550> take

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
go the loop repeats itself so let's take

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:36.990 
go the loop repeats itself so let's take
a<00:00:20.760> listen<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.720> lay<00:00:21.960> down<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.410> loop

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.750 

now<00:00:38.000> that's<00:00:38.330> my<00:00:38.570> loot<00:00:39.070> but<00:00:40.070> I<00:00:40.100> can<00:00:40.340> take<00:00:40.580> that

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
now that's my loot but I can take that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.330 
now that's my loot but I can take that
lube<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:42.020> can<00:00:42.230> sweep<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.770> knob<00:00:42.980> from

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
lube and I can sweep the knob from

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.090 
lube and I can sweep the knob from
digital<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.940> analog<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:44.990> then<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.740> loop

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
digital to analog and then the loop

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.210 
digital to analog and then the loop
passes<00:00:47.030> through<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.390> bucket<00:00:47.750> brigade<00:00:48.110> if<00:00:48.890> i

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
passes through the bucket brigade if i

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.130 
passes through the bucket brigade if i
put<00:00:49.490> modulation<00:00:50.060> on<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.450> bucket<00:00:50.780> brigade

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
put modulation on the bucket brigade

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.440 
put modulation on the bucket brigade
you'll<00:00:51.800> hear<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.340> loop<00:00:52.610> now<00:00:52.940> becomes

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
you'll hear that the loop now becomes

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:10.660 
you'll hear that the loop now becomes
chorused<00:01:08.229> now<00:01:09.229> because<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.830> loop<00:01:10.040> is<00:01:10.190> chorus

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
chorused now because the loop is chorus

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.550 
chorused now because the loop is chorus
and<00:01:11.170> because<00:01:12.170> i'm<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.650> loop<00:01:12.950> mode<00:01:13.900> if<00:01:14.900> i<00:01:15.170> play

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
and because i'm in loop mode if i play

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.890 
and because i'm in loop mode if i play
over<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.010> top<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:16.580> it's<00:01:17.210> not<00:01:17.510> going<00:01:17.840> to

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
over the top of this it's not going to

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.040 
over the top of this it's not going to
have<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.710> delay<00:01:19.490> or<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:20.000> modulation<00:01:20.510> on<00:01:20.840> it

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
have the delay or the modulation on it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.520 
have the delay or the modulation on it
let's<00:01:21.530> take<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.740> listen

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.600 

Oh

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.470 

hey

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.310 

Oh

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.700 

Oh

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:04.500 

No

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.640 

I<00:02:09.180> can<00:02:10.180> also<00:02:10.360> take<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.900> loop<00:02:11.080> entirely

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
I can also take the loop entirely

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.370 
I can also take the loop entirely
through<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.220> bucket<00:02:12.520> brigade<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:14.200> have

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
through the bucket brigade and not have

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.320 
through the bucket brigade and not have
any<00:02:14.530> modulation<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:15.820> warms<00:02:16.090> up<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
any modulation and it just warms up the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:36.190 
any modulation and it just warms up the
sound

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:46.400 

you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.810 

couple<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.500> quick<00:02:47.680> taps<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.310> now<00:02:48.460> we're<00:02:48.640> right

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
couple of quick taps and now we're right

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:58.780 
couple of quick taps and now we're right
back<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.210> regular<00:02:49.390> delay

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.590
