00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.740
 the winner of the Sanremo ipt is a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.050
 regular on pokerstars.it is called 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.619
 alessandro de fenza and won the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.240
 picca and 137 thousand euros of the first coin 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.009
 beating 609 opponents 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.009
 then the final table was 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.780
 very closed and in any case not standard 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.060
 They were aggressive actions, however you 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.030
 opens at some point from a phase of 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.420
 standoff began 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.129
 the shorts started to push us 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.850
 were four players out in a 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.660
 moment for nothing left in six 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.339
 I play a lot of the sam ax discipline 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.199
 fortunately the aggression increased 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.110
 then we got up to 3 left where 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.759
 there was a coinflip prey 2 that got me 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.470
 worn for the legs 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.299
 has been playing poker for three years 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.180
 professionally I am super ship the IT 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.500
 on pokerstars.it I play the discipline 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.450
 of zap cash games and that's it 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.740
 that in the last three years has done me 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.790
 have all the greatest satisfactions 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.140
 of my life 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.720
 introduced me to a lot of 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.260
 people allowed me to travel 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.380
 have so much gratification even from the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.900
 other people however started from 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.510
 nothing from 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 from a few euros paid into the account be 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.240
 then managed to take 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.350
 a house the car and being able to travel 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.170
 dislocating pt was not planned 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.310
 how I never thought I 'd win them 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.970
 all and therefore now the desire is great 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.830
 or a trip booked for a long time 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.830
 I'll see it move
