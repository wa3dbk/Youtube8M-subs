00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.779
 today I'm going to explain something to you 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.070
 mentioned very often at the time of 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.680
 perform as much as a treatment 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.439
 intensive or a simple maintenance that 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.850
 I'm talking about pollution 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.010
 contamination is said to an agent 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.090
 external of the painting that is not part 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.760
 of the painting 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.850
 that can be tar pitch sap from 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.400
 trees or zinc of the daily management or 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.410
 even paint spray this makes 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.170
 the soup paint that loses shine and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.700
 with the passage of time it is lost as 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.829
 we realize if our painting is 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.660
 contaminated in a really way 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.590
 easy as long as the car is 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.360
 cleansed 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.400
 we are going to pass our hands through 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.230
 area of ​​the painting and we will feel that 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 It has rough edges and is not smooth 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.420
 even when we pass the hand we go to 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.220
 hear the characteristic noise of a 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.680
 contaminated paint if by hand not 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.720
 we managed to realize we can use a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.730
 end of cigarette case shiga 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.110
 we are going to pass it in the same way and 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.640
 let's notice that it feels much more 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.850
 all the pollution that this stone in 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.920
 the painting 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.200
 this is not a big problem and it has a 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.490
 solution let's use kleiber the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.350
 translation in Spanish is mud 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.229
 clay is made of a compound 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.920
 polylactic is really flexible and 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.920
 searched thing 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.950
 This is the power of kleiber notice 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 that stays stuck and costs to get out of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.970
 over this same thing when going through the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.980
 paint is going to take off all the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.530
 pollution staying stuck in the 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.990
 kleiber leaving the paint soft and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.630
 decontaminated remember that always 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.830
 to work in painting we do not have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.990
 have any kind of ring or 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.010
 watches bracelets that can scratch the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.400
 paint while we are working 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.100
 let's knead it kleiber making it 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.480
 make an album that covers more or less 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.090
 almost the entire surface of the fingers 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.800
 leaving only the tips free for 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.360
 when we go, let's go 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.580
 decontaminating feeling will be the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.270
 paint we have three degrees of clay bar 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.370
 high medium and fine while higher is 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.050
 the degree of decline more rays is going to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.110
 generate so always paint 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.700
 advisable to choose in this case a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.220
 middle grade since it has a balance 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.740
 perfect between power removal 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.750
 contamination leaving a minimum 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.330
 number of stripes to use kleiber 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.550
 We are going to need a good lubricant in 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.440
 this case we have place is a lubricant 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.400
 specially designed to pass it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.720
 kleiber 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.580
 they are giving 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.400
 at the time of using the lubricant we have 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.510
 to be very generous since this is going to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.910
 fulfill the function of lubricating the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.910
 surface preventing the clear generate 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.650
 stripes because between the paint and the clay 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.810
 war the only thing that will be in between 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.330
 is going to be lubricant making the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.150
 kleiber slips smoothly and does not 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.680
 generate stripes when we're passing 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.870
 doing short movements in a way 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.760
 straight let's go going over the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.010
 paint and we're feeling how it's going 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.600
 releasing all the contamination 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.720
 leaving the surface more and more smooth 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.720
 and soft 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.920
 in the case that the calibration happens 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.750
 excessively 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.700
 what we are going to do is knead it to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.380
 leave it in a uniform color so we can 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.250
 keep working 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.250
 I want 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.150
 The kleiber can be used in 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.180
 any smooth surface of the car like 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.790
 make the optic chromed paint 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.730
 rim paint glasses but can not 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.200
 be used in rough plastics a 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.850
 caution when using it 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.890
 kleiber is that you do not have to fall 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.380
 to the floor since the floor contains dirt 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.330
 very thick and the nail is going to catch her and 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.280
 in the case that we want to use it for 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.200
 use the paint once the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.100
 surface we feel is clean 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.520
 let's use our microfiber to 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.260
 dry the entire surface and check that 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.260
 the paint was free of contaminants 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.080
 once the contaminated surface 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.690
 we can choose to start making a 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.280
 correction treatment or pass it a 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.260
 sidewalk or sealer so you do not 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.770
 pollute again let's check 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.240
 if tribes an effective decontamination 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.160
 As you can see, you can not hear 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.990
 absolutely nothing we recover our 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.120
 life we ​​even improve much more 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.650
 Realism of painting as any 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.060
 query about clarity or any 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.919
 another product send us an email 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.270
