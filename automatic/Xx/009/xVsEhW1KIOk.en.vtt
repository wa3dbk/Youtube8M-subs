navy indigo blue color and I cannot wait

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
navy indigo blue color and I cannot wait
to<00:01:24.780> try<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> definitely<00:01:25.979> recommend<00:01:26.490> this

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
to try it so I definitely recommend this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
to try it so I definitely recommend this
now<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> randomly<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> Deborah<00:01:29.159> Lippmann

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
now I randomly have a Deborah Lippmann

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
now I randomly have a Deborah Lippmann
color<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> million-dollar<00:01:30.990> mermaid

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
color and this is million-dollar mermaid

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.580 
color and this is million-dollar mermaid
and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.400> sparkly<00:01:33.329> orangish<00:01:33.960> color<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and it is a sparkly orangish color and I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.050 
and it is a sparkly orangish color and I
think<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.520> work<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.909> really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
think this this would work really really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.899 
think this this would work really really
well<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> fall<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.670> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
well for the fall it's like it's a it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.609 
well for the fall it's like it's a it's
a<00:01:39.060> different<00:01:39.479> color<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.020> subtle<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
a different color but it's subtle at the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.530 
a different color but it's subtle at the
same<00:01:40.829> time<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.490> orange<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.180> halloween

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
same time so it's orange for halloween

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
same time so it's orange for halloween
and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.340> really

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and then I don't know it's just really

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.130 
and then I don't know it's just really
pretty<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.149> worked<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.509> summer<00:01:45.750> but

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pretty I think it worked for summer but

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
pretty I think it worked for summer but
it<00:01:46.259> also<00:01:46.409> works<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.950> fall<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.430> my<00:01:47.880> opinion<00:01:48.180> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
it also works for fall in my opinion so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
it also works for fall in my opinion so
i<00:01:48.509> will<00:01:48.780> probably<00:01:48.930> most<00:01:49.470> definitely<00:01:49.920> be

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
i will probably most definitely be

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
i will probably most definitely be
wearing<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.450> point<00:01:51.689> or<00:01:51.930> another

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
wearing this at one point or another

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.139 
wearing this at one point or another

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
know if it's still available so i chose

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.080 
know if it's still available so i chose
a<00:02:00.240> different<00:02:00.799> creamy<00:02:01.799> color<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> my

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
available and this one is so good i was

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.600 
available and this one is so good i was
thinking<00:02:07.290> today<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.770> i<00:02:07.860> had

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
thinking today that if i had

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.609 
thinking today that if i had
have<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.210> same<00:02:09.450> color<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.930> my<00:02:10.080> toes<00:02:10.320> for<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
have the same color on my toes for the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.050 
have the same color on my toes for the
rest<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.830> my<00:02:10.950> life<00:02:11.070> would<00:02:11.370> probably<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.910> this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
rest of my life would probably be this
