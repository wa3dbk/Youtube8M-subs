00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.770
 the inverted class salutes the win 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.150
 today we are going to live our 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:17.570
 first class capsule and pour the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.460
 inverse class what is this the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.340
 cup and poured is not dangerous 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.880
 it is another way of learning I 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.880
 explain to you 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.800
 the traditional classroom at school the 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.170
 new subject is taught to 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.640
 all the students in the class in 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.350
 same time the inverted place at home 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.809
 the new material to watch on 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.149
 computer at home when you 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.129
 sense willing to learn I can listen 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:54.760
 the capsule as many times as you 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:57.640
 want here I do not have a computer 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.320
 there is no problem toc toc will be 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.760
 given in class to view the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.619
 capsules you're falling do you say and if I 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.420
 do not look at what the capsules I'm going to 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.580
 you answer very frankly who did not 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.470
 the choice to view the map capsules 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.399
 will be a small sheet to complete on 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.170
 your understanding 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.200
 a return will be made in class the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.800
 next day the next day after 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.240
 discussed the capsule in big fat the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.680
 students who understood the capsule 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.429
 will start activities 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.740
 learning 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.670
 some students will be able to view 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 new capsule 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 students in need 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.510
 additional explanations may be 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.510
 meet the teacher 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.470
 so why the class reversed because 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.690
 it's a more active mode of teaching 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.640
 it decreases the magisterial teaching in 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.259
 great crook it increases the autonomy of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.940
 students and their application time 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.680
 accompanying students with 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.680
 difficulties and more 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:01.500
 good luck try debut with the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.610
 class is paid been retained from the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.610
 reverse class
