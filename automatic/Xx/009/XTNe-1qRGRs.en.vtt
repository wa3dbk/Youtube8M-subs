 installed on your computer only 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 you have to open it to start a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.340
 new account you give the button 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.790

 etcetera I have mine release them well 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 this is the server interface like 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.239
 can see has a menu where you can 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 see the arms servers friends 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.370
 rooms and what you have in your plan those 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.930
 are the rooms that are already inside the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 server that are already starting 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.570
 games because these are the rooms where 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.399
 you can change the different parts 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.799
 of the world depending where you live all 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.730
 logically he has a chat and you can see 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 the players 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.370
 this is connected the box 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.420
 reservation of games not then 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.760
 choose to be the endowment mode and you give 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 register with other people who 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.180
 you have to get to the number 10 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.410
 people ready to start a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.300
 negotiation within the local area 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.610
 so what you have to do is 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.420
 explain where it says to be game to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.800
 start what is being world drum 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.330
 similar automatically but you have 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.220
 that from the beginning you have to 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.870
 specify where you have the game if 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.760
 you have it by default no matter the 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.950
 server has already been marked as 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.050
 defect when starting worker you have to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.730
 go to the local area network because what 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.340
 ago is the video of throwing a network lan 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.650
 so to speak the blue is the one you finish 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.300
 to reserve and the others are those who do not 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.920
 book this but you can not enter 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.460
 after a minute that they did not enter 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460
 people 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.460
 and here we can see all the rooms that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.800
 There are from South America from Asia Europe 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.040
 etcetera then as you can see in 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.930
 Brazil there are 139 people connected 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.220
 very large number but it does not compare to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.590
 other places like you can simply 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.270
 making argentina which is a country of 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.420
 But 305 people and so on 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.690
 different countries have their 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.740
 people do not study liked this video we 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.740
