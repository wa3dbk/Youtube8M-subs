00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.370 

quite<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> bit

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380

again<00:03:08.160> I'll<00:03:08.310> go<00:03:08.340> back<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.849> side

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.520
