our granddaughter and her mother flew in

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.719 
our granddaughter and her mother flew in
about<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.380> state<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.040> we<00:01:33.250> had<00:01:33.369> some<00:01:33.520> time

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
about of state and so we had some time

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.749 
about of state and so we had some time
with<00:01:33.880> them<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.360> was<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:35.290> using<00:01:36.220> money<00:01:36.520> for

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
with them I was just using money for

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.510 
with them I was just using money for
enjoyment<00:01:37.530> yeah<00:01:38.530> so<00:01:38.830> I<00:01:38.860> don't<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.710> agree<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.430> I

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
enjoyment yeah so I don't I agree and I

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.330 
enjoyment yeah so I don't I agree and I
think<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:43.149> powerful<00:01:43.810> thing<00:01:44.049> about<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:45.100> is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
think the powerful thing about this is

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.930 
think the powerful thing about this is
the<00:01:45.820> context<00:01:46.390> because<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.710> this<00:01:48.039> context<00:01:48.700> he

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940
