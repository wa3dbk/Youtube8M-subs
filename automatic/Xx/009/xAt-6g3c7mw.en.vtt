00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
World's Biggest Matryoshka doll!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When we ware taking photos of trains in Manzhouli,
 the borderland of China and Russia,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We hear that there is the big Russian doll in the city.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
... Why Russian doll in China ?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We aren't in Russia,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Off course, not in USA !

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes, Here must be in China.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Many geniuses of the world waited for us.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we found the big lady wearing Chinese dress.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the sign shows "Matryoshka shop &amp; Restaurant"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The doll-building may contains 6 floors inside.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and it is 100 feet(30m) tall!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Look, cute Russian girl is drawn behind doll.
I think she is very shy.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There are statue of chinese legend 12 animals
and "Easter egg" in Russia,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They create inexplicable harmony of Russian and Chinese culture.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In addition, they try to fuse the culture of United States.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but they made a failure to fuse Japanese Manga culture....

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Access to this park :
The train takes 28 hours from Beijin to Manzhouli.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Access to this park :
and you must walk 1 hour. I recommend to take a taxi.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
