whole way leave a little fibrous pulp

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
whole way leave a little fibrous pulp
around<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> allows<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.020> another<00:00:43.350> tip

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
is when you're chewing each bite of your

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.619 
is when you're chewing each bite of your
smoothie<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.250> allows<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> digest<00:00:48.539> that

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
smoothie it allows you to digest that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.250 
smoothie it allows you to digest that
easier<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:50.329> it's<00:00:51.329> getting<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:51.870> saliva

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
easier because it's getting your saliva

going<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.070> otherwise<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.449> just

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
going you know otherwise if you just
like<00:00:54.809> chug<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.320> back<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> gut<00:00:56.219> bomb

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
like chug that back it's like a gut bomb

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400 
like chug that back it's like a gut bomb
your<00:00:56.940> belly<00:00:57.120> wasn't<00:00:57.480> ready<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.870> all<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> you

your belly wasn't ready for all that you
know<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.190> chew<00:00:59.520> each<00:00:59.550> bite<00:01:00.170> mimicking<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
know so chew each bite mimicking the to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
know so chew each bite mimicking the to
mention<00:01:02.039> which<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.250> easier<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.030> you're<00:01:03.180> not

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
mention which is easier if you're not

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
mention which is easier if you're not
used<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.660> doing<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.409> there's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> little

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
used to doing that when there's a little

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.719 
used to doing that when there's a little
fibrous<00:01:05.970> pulp<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.729> another

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
fibrous pulp in there do you see another

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.030 
fibrous pulp in there do you see another
thing<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.560> something<00:01:10.830> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
thing if you want just something that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
thing if you want just something that
like<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:12.030> gonna<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.420> exercise<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
like I'm gonna go exercise right now and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.270 
like I'm gonna go exercise right now and
I've<00:01:13.740> got<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> run<00:01:14.340> many<00:01:14.640> errands<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.710> am

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
I've got to run many errands so I am

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.510 
I've got to run many errands so I am
trying<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.119> place<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.310> we'll<00:01:20.310> talk

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
trying out this place and we'll talk

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
trying out this place and we'll talk
about<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> later<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.350> gonna<00:01:22.500> say

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
about it later but what I was gonna say

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.410 
about it later but what I was gonna say
is<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.130> creates<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:25.850> very<00:01:26.850> high<00:01:27.090> energy

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
is it creates like a very high energy

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.550 
is it creates like a very high energy
drink<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.240> juice<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
drink not as if it was juice because the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.190 
drink not as if it was juice because the
wheatgrass<00:01:32.070> powder<00:01:32.759> doesn't<00:01:33.600> give<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> so

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
wheatgrass powder doesn't give you so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.920 
wheatgrass powder doesn't give you so
much<00:01:34.380> bulk<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:35.759> oranges<00:01:36.360> give<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
much bulk the oranges give you the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.899 
much bulk the oranges give you the
thinking<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> you're<00:01:37.740> looking<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
thinking is you're looking for the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
thinking is you're looking for the
hydration<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> water<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.470> coconut

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
hydration and the water the coconut

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.910 
hydration and the water the coconut
water<00:01:41.100> replenishing<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:41.970> electrolyte

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
water replenishing your electrolyte

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.340 
water replenishing your electrolyte
and<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.520> cheese<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.820> giving<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.540> balance<00:01:45.140> I

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
and the cheese is giving you a balance I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.520 
and the cheese is giving you a balance I
find<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.790> be<00:01:46.970> very<00:01:47.000> energizing<00:01:47.960> but<00:01:48.320> not

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
find it to be very energizing but not

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.130 
find it to be very energizing but not
waiting<00:01:48.979> me<00:01:49.159> down<00:01:49.400> when<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.729> really<00:01:50.300> want<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.990> be

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
waiting me down when I really want to be

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.430 
waiting me down when I really want to be
high-energy<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:52.280> lot<00:01:53.180> like<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.659> used<00:01:54.020> would<00:01:54.290> do

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
high-energy a lot like it used would do

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.740 
high-energy a lot like it used would do
except<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:54.979> don't<00:01:55.220> find<00:01:55.490> juices<00:01:56.090> particularly

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
except I don't find juices particularly

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.810 
except I don't find juices particularly
sustainable<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.680> me<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:57.860> feel<00:01:58.250> like<00:01:58.369> I'm<00:01:58.550> hungry

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
sustainable to me I feel like I'm hungry

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.840 
sustainable to me I feel like I'm hungry
and<00:01:59.330> I<00:01:59.600> end<00:02:00.320> up<00:02:00.500> eating<00:02:00.740> four<00:02:01.280> times<00:02:01.610> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
and I end up eating four times the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.270 
and I end up eating four times the
produce<00:02:02.360> throwing<00:02:03.290> away<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.650> fiber<00:02:03.920> and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
produce throwing away the fiber and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.730 
produce throwing away the fiber and
still<00:02:04.580> feeling<00:02:04.850> slightly<00:02:05.659> off<00:02:05.840> balanced

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
still feeling slightly off balanced

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.790 
still feeling slightly off balanced
because<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:08.270> know<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.420> over<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.050> years<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.649> used

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
because you know I over the years I used

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.330 
because you know I over the years I used
to<00:02:10.399> think<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:10.729> much<00:02:11.239> as<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.600> therapeutic

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
to think so much as a therapeutic

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
to think so much as a therapeutic
situation<00:02:13.340> years<00:02:14.120> ago<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.630> now<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.140> really
