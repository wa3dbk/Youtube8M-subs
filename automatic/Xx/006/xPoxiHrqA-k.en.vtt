look at that it does freakin nothing
well<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.360> does<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> lot<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.400> considering<00:02:18.400> at

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
well it does a lot but considering at

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.940 
well it does a lot but considering at
the<00:02:18.549> Bandit<00:02:18.879> stabbed<00:02:19.120> let's<00:02:19.900> gone<00:02:20.049> back<00:02:20.260> yeah

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
the Bandit stabbed let's gone back yeah

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.929 
the Bandit stabbed let's gone back yeah
but<00:02:21.159> he<00:02:21.250> has<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> switch<00:02:21.579> with<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.760> other

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
but he has a switch with the other

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.819 
but he has a switch with the other
defense<00:02:22.180> drop<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.569> predict<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.230> go<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.739> the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
defense drop I predict that go for the

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.850 
defense drop I predict that go for the
payback<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.340> kill<00:02:25.000> Chandelure<00:02:25.750> cuz<00:02:26.049> I'm<00:02:26.230> you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
payback and kill Chandelure cuz I'm you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.280 
payback and kill Chandelure cuz I'm you
know<00:02:27.010> pretty<00:02:27.189> good<00:02:27.519> at<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.700> game<00:02:28.109> at<00:02:29.109> least

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
know pretty good at the game at least

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.500 
know pretty good at the game at least

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
usually kind of hacks is Mila I guess

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.979 
usually kind of hacks is Mila I guess
but<00:02:36.790> anyway<00:02:37.239> predicting<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.689> clothes<00:02:37.840> come

with<00:02:46.659> better<00:02:46.870> wave<00:02:47.079> but<00:02:47.379> I<00:02:47.530> can't<00:02:47.829> so<00:02:48.750> he<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
with better wave but I can't so he is

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.509 
with better wave but I can't so he is
scarfed<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.650> don't<00:02:50.799> read<00:02:50.920> any<00:02:51.099> speed<00:02:51.370> is

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
scarfed but I don't read any speed is

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.539 
scarfed but I don't read any speed is
just<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.819> trick<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.829> yeah<00:02:53.829> that's<00:02:54.129> why<00:02:54.310> I

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
just for trick so yeah that's why I

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.729 
just for trick so yeah that's why I
tried<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:55.000> Hass<00:02:55.090> p<00:02:55.269> but<00:02:55.389> I<00:02:55.420> didn't<00:02:55.599> work<00:02:55.720> um<00:02:55.989> now

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
tried it Hass p but I didn't work um now

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.710 
tried it Hass p but I didn't work um now
I<00:02:56.769> know<00:02:56.920> he's<00:02:57.189> afraid<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.970> didn't<00:02:58.389> want<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.599> risk

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
I know he's afraid I didn't want to risk

pretty much as death fodder and my punch

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.479 
pretty much as death fodder and my punch
will<00:03:07.030> tak<00:03:07.299> out<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:07.959> that's<00:03:08.859> you<00:03:09.129> can't<00:03:09.340> really

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489

predicting<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.560> power<00:03:11.739> hacks<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.129> don't<00:03:12.280> get

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
predicting the power hacks I don't get

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.940 
predicting the power hacks I don't get
it<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.780> figured<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.439> know<00:03:14.560> what<00:03:14.709> it's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
it like I figured you know what it's

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.409 
it like I figured you know what it's
worth<00:03:15.159> a<00:03:15.310> shot<00:03:15.340> because<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.849> have<00:03:15.970> priority

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
worth a shot because I have priority

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:21.180 
worth a shot because I have priority
anyway<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:18.900> that's<00:03:19.900> going<00:03:20.199> to<00:03:20.379> be<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.680> for<00:03:20.709> the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
anyway and that's going to be it for the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.129 
anyway and that's going to be it for the
heat<00:03:21.370> ran<00:03:21.579> now<00:03:22.419> he<00:03:22.569> wants<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> let<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.019> die

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
heat ran now he wants to let it die

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.420 
heat ran now he wants to let it die
because<00:03:23.470> he<00:03:23.650> can't<00:03:23.889> bring<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.160> heat<00:03:24.280> ray

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
because he can't bring in heat ray

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.210 
because he can't bring in heat ray
infernape<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.389> switch<00:03:25.599> and<00:03:29.220> that's

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
infernape on the switch and that's

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.399 
infernape on the switch and that's
pretty<00:03:30.519> much<00:03:30.639> it<00:03:30.760> right<00:03:31.150> there<00:03:31.299> he<00:03:31.930> goes<00:03:32.319> for

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
pretty much it right there he goes for

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.629 
pretty much it right there he goes for
the<00:03:32.470> mac<00:03:32.680> punch<00:03:32.919> and<00:03:33.069> doesn't<00:03:33.310> kill<00:03:33.459> me<00:03:33.489> cuz

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
the mac punch and doesn't kill me cuz
