all<00:00:00.329> right<00:00:00.450> guys<00:00:00.599> so<00:00:00.810> lately<00:00:01.079> I've<00:00:01.230> been

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
all right guys so lately I've been

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.809 
all right guys so lately I've been
working<00:00:01.589> on<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:02.330> Blackmagic<00:00:03.330> 4k<00:00:03.720> ATM<00:00:04.140> switch

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:04.819 
working on a Blackmagic 4k ATM switch

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.820 
working on a Blackmagic 4k ATM switch
basically<00:00:05.819> what<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.509> multi<00:00:07.350> camera

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
basically what that is is multi camera

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.680 
basically what that is is multi camera
angle<00:00:08.220> life<00:00:08.880> switching<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:09.450> we're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.630> to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
angle life switching so we're going to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.060 
angle life switching so we're going to
have<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> bunch<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.230> cameras<00:00:10.590> set<00:00:10.769> up<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
have a bunch of cameras set up to the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950 
have a bunch of cameras set up to the
switch<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.820> then<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.450> can<00:00:12.540> control<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.929> from

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
switch and then we can control it from

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.959 
switch and then we can control it from
our<00:00:13.170> iPhone<00:00:13.530> or<00:00:13.679> iPad<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.549> cut

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
our iPhone or iPad and we can cut

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.390 
our iPhone or iPad and we can cut
cameras<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.929> real<00:00:16.139> time<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.770> we're<00:00:17.279> actually

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
cameras in real time and we're actually

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.800 
cameras in real time and we're actually
going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.699> send<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.000> feed<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
going to send that feed out to the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
going to send that feed out to the
Internet<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.230> broadcast<00:00:19.650> live<00:00:19.949> as<00:00:20.220> well<00:00:20.400> so

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
Internet and broadcast live as well so

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.640 
Internet and broadcast live as well so
it's<00:00:21.330> been<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> little<00:00:21.630> bit<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.900> work<00:00:22.080> putting

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it's been a little bit of work putting

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.200 
it's been a little bit of work putting
that<00:00:22.800> together<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.430> I'll<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.910> more<00:00:24.150> into

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
that together and I'll get more into

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630 
that together and I'll get more into
that<00:00:24.420> later<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:26.160> thought<00:00:26.279> I'd<00:00:26.430> share

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
that later but I just thought I'd share

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.339 
that later but I just thought I'd share
a<00:00:26.670> little<00:00:26.820> tip<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.960> things<00:00:28.230> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
a little tip one of the things that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.599 
a little tip one of the things that
we're<00:00:28.470> running<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> type<00:00:29.460> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
we're running into is the type of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.669 
we're running into is the type of
cameras<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> operate<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> switch

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
cameras we want to operate with a switch

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.090 
cameras we want to operate with a switch
now<00:00:32.600> HDMI<00:00:33.600> cameras<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.739> typically

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
now HDMI cameras which are typically

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
now HDMI cameras which are typically
your<00:00:35.309> DSLR<00:00:35.880> or<00:00:35.910> mirrorless<00:00:36.180> cameras<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
your DSLR or mirrorless cameras have a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
your DSLR or mirrorless cameras have a
limitation<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:38.910> far<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.079> run<00:00:40.230> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
limitation of how far you can run that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.530 
limitation of how far you can run that
HDMI<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.340> lucky<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> good<00:00:42.090> HDMI

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
HDMI if you're lucky with a good HDMI

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
HDMI if you're lucky with a good HDMI
cable<00:00:42.899> maybe<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:43.649> looking<00:00:43.739> about<00:00:44.070> 40<00:00:44.460> feet

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
cable maybe you're looking about 40 feet

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.119 
cable maybe you're looking about 40 feet
that<00:00:45.180> might<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.140> cover<00:00:46.379> everything<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.039> we

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that might not cover everything that we

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
that might not cover everything that we
need<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.480> were<00:00:48.539> looking<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.899> get

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
need to do so we were looking to get

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.450 
need to do so we were looking to get
some<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.379> cameras<00:00:49.739> run<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> little<00:00:50.280> bit

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
some of these cameras run a little bit

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
some of these cameras run a little bit
further<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.480> could<00:00:51.899> invest<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> more

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
further now we could invest in more

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
further now we could invest in more
expensive<00:00:53.129> cameras<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> SDI

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
expensive cameras that have the SDI

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
expensive cameras that have the SDI
output<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:54.989> will<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.680> 150

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
output and that will get you about 150

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
output and that will get you about 150
foot<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> cable<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
foot on a cable but but that's going to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470 
foot on a cable but but that's going to
cut<00:00:58.890> into<00:00:59.010> our<00:00:59.100> budget<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
cut into our budget and then the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
cut into our budget and then the
Blackmagic<00:01:00.930> Cinema<00:01:00.960> Camera<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.100> we

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
Blackmagic Cinema Camera is here if we

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.260 
Blackmagic Cinema Camera is here if we
wanted<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> use<00:01:02.640> something<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
wanted to use something like this

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.750 
wanted to use something like this
obviously<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> SSD<00:01:05.189> drive<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
obviously the the SSD drive is going to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
obviously the the SSD drive is going to
be<00:01:05.850> more<00:01:05.970> expensive<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.900> minimum<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.380> ProRes

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
be more expensive the minimum is ProRes

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
be more expensive the minimum is ProRes
those<00:01:08.220> file<00:01:08.400> sizes<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.060> huge<00:01:09.390> on

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
those file sizes are going to be huge on

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
those file sizes are going to be huge on
a<00:01:09.689> dh3<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:10.799> able<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.100> run<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.400> five<00:01:11.729> hours

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
a dh3 we're able to run about five hours

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.840 
a dh3 we're able to run about five hours
on<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> 64<00:01:12.960> gig<00:01:13.200> card<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.860> that's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> lot<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> time

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
on a 64 gig card so that's a lot of time

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
on a 64 gig card so that's a lot of time
on<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.210> cheap<00:01:15.360> cards<00:01:15.750> plus<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> battery<00:01:16.740> can

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
on some cheap cards plus the battery can

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.219 
on some cheap cards plus the battery can
run<00:01:17.189> pretty<00:01:17.460> much<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.970> day<00:01:18.240> very<00:01:18.600> inexpensive

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
run pretty much all day very inexpensive

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.980 
run pretty much all day very inexpensive
so<00:01:19.259> we're<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> looking<00:01:20.670> towards<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> gh3

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
so we're kind of looking towards the gh3

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.550 
so we're kind of looking towards the gh3
right<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:22.700> but<00:01:23.700> again<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> has<00:01:24.600> HDMI<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.409> we're

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
right now but again it has HDMI so we're

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.859 
right now but again it has HDMI so we're
limited<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> how<00:01:26.130> far<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.570> one

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
limited to how far we can take it so one

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
limited to how far we can take it so one
of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> things<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> invested<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
of the things that we invested in was a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.050 
of the things that we invested in was a
cheap<00:01:30.110> HDMI<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.829> SDI<00:01:32.310> converter

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
cheap HDMI to SDI converter

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.800 
cheap HDMI to SDI converter
now<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.630> SDI<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> HDMI<00:01:34.740> HDMI<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:36.210> SDI

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
now this is not SDI to HDMI HDMI to SDI

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
now this is not SDI to HDMI HDMI to SDI
and<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> we've<00:01:38.070> converted<00:01:38.400> our<00:01:38.640> HDMI

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and now that we've converted our HDMI

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.319 
and now that we've converted our HDMI
signal<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.630> SDI<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> run<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> 150<00:01:41.640> feet<00:01:41.820> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
signal to SDI we can run it 150 feet we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.760 
signal to SDI we can run it 150 feet we
have<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> hundred<00:01:42.720> foot<00:01:43.049> cable<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.619> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
have a hundred foot cable here that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
have a hundred foot cable here that
we've<00:01:43.890> tested<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.369> works<00:01:44.909> perfectly<00:01:45.420> fine

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
we've tested out works perfectly fine

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.300 
we've tested out works perfectly fine
and<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.619> I'm<00:01:46.829> running<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.159> all

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and as you can see I'm running it all

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
and as you can see I'm running it all
the<00:01:47.399> way<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:48.000> my<00:01:48.149> IPS<00:01:48.899> monitor<00:01:49.290> over

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the way back into my IPS monitor over

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.389 
the way back into my IPS monitor over
here<00:01:49.710> there's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.369> Jake<00:01:50.970> over<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> then

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
here there's a Jake over there and then

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.969 
here there's a Jake over there and then
to<00:01:54.000> run<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.930> monitor<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to run it back into this monitor I got a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.039 
to run it back into this monitor I got a
cheap<00:01:56.280> $30<00:01:57.920> SDI<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.040> HDMI<00:01:59.729> converter<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.930> this

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
cheap $30 SDI to HDMI converter so this

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.530 
cheap $30 SDI to HDMI converter so this
is<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.829> way<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.399> fairly<00:02:02.939> cheap<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.450> when

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
is the this way is fairly cheap but when

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
is the this way is fairly cheap but when
you're<00:02:03.659> doing<00:02:03.869> HDMI<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> SDI<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> little

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
you're doing HDMI to SDI it's a little

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
you're doing HDMI to SDI it's a little
bit<00:02:05.490> more<00:02:05.610> expensive<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
bit more expensive this one is the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.540 
bit more expensive this one is the
cheapest<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.409> could<00:02:07.560> find<00:02:07.799> about<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.160> hundred

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
cheapest I could find about a hundred

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940 
cheapest I could find about a hundred
and<00:02:08.580> twenty<00:02:08.759> hundred<00:02:09.000> thirty<00:02:09.360> dollars<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.709> it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and twenty hundred thirty dollars but it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.290 
and twenty hundred thirty dollars but it

looking for something like that
you<00:02:13.830> want<00:02:13.980> longer<00:02:14.310> runs<00:02:14.730> from<00:02:15.150> your<00:02:15.300> HDMI

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
you want longer runs from your HDMI

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750 
you want longer runs from your HDMI
cameras<00:02:16.200> all<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.860> need<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.370> plug<00:02:17.610> it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
into an HDMI to SDI converter and then

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.450 
into an HDMI to SDI converter and then
you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.880> run<00:02:21.060> about<00:02:21.180> 150<00:02:22.170> feet<00:02:22.380> one<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.370> the

you can run about 150 feet one of the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.160 
you can run about 150 feet one of the
other<00:02:23.610> things<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.000> we've<00:02:24.120> tried<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.540> we

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
other things that we've tried is we

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.260 
other things that we've tried is we
actually<00:02:25.320> ran<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.950> hundred-foot<00:02:26.550> cable<00:02:27.090> all

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
actually ran this hundred-foot cable all

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.080 
actually ran this hundred-foot cable all
the<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:28.020> across<00:02:28.350> our<00:02:28.590> studio<00:02:29.070> out<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.820> front

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the way across our studio out the front

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.600 
the way across our studio out the front
door<00:02:30.360> now<00:02:31.230> at<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> end<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.920> cable<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.400> put

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
door now at the end of the cable we put

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.010 
door now at the end of the cable we put
on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> radiant<00:02:33.360> Pro<00:02:33.600> receiver<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:36.330> we

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
on the radiant Pro receiver and then we

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.870 
on the radiant Pro receiver and then we
have<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> radiant<00:02:37.800> Pro<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.340> from<00:02:38.520> camera

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
have the radiant Pro this is from camera

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.600 
have the radiant Pro this is from camera
motion<00:02:39.180> research<00:02:39.950> wireless<00:02:40.950> transmitter<00:02:41.460> on

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
motion research wireless transmitter on

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.360 
motion research wireless transmitter on
our<00:02:41.760> G's<00:02:41.970> 3<00:02:42.270> here<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.900> what<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.920> were<00:02:44.040> able<00:02:44.190> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
our G's 3 here so what we were able to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.120 
our G's 3 here so what we were able to
do<00:02:44.580> was<00:02:44.910> basically<00:02:45.200> bring<00:02:46.200> our<00:02:46.500> receiver

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
do was basically bring our receiver

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.520 
do was basically bring our receiver
closer<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.390> where<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> camera<00:02:48.750> operator<00:02:49.320> is

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
closer to where the camera operator is

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.920 
closer to where the camera operator is
and<00:02:50.370> running<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.850> hundred<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.390> fifty<00:02:51.690> or<00:02:51.720> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and running it a hundred and fifty or a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.260 
and running it a hundred and fifty or a
hundred<00:02:51.990> feet<00:02:52.440> away<00:02:52.650> from<00:02:52.950> our<00:02:53.250> switch<00:02:53.580> so

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
hundred feet away from our switch so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.210 
hundred feet away from our switch so
we're<00:02:54.450> getting<00:02:54.570> extra<00:02:55.020> distance<00:02:55.260> through

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
we're getting extra distance through

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.250 
we're getting extra distance through
Wireless<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.480> doesn't<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.840> transmit

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
Wireless so it doesn't have to transmit

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.840 
Wireless so it doesn't have to transmit
all<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.680> way<00:02:58.770> back<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> switch<00:02:59.520> so<00:02:59.670> that's

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
all the way back to the switch so that's

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.220 
all the way back to the switch so that's
been<00:03:00.030> working<00:03:00.330> out<00:03:00.420> for<00:03:00.630> us<00:03:00.690> as<00:03:00.870> well<00:03:01.050> so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
been working out for us as well so

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.020 
been working out for us as well so
that's<00:03:01.740> just<00:03:01.890> kind<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> little<00:03:02.640> tip<00:03:02.850> of

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that's just kind of a little tip of

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.250 
that's just kind of a little tip of
something<00:03:03.330> we're<00:03:03.450> working<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.110> are

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
something we're working on if you are

looking<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.490> your<00:03:05.580> cameras<00:03:05.970> further<00:03:06.300> away

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
looking to get your cameras further away

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.130 
looking to get your cameras further away
from<00:03:06.720> your<00:03:07.620> monitoring<00:03:08.250> solution<00:03:09.050> instead<00:03:10.050> of

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
from your monitoring solution instead of

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.200 
from your monitoring solution instead of
going<00:03:10.380> Wireless<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.950> cheap<00:03:11.160> way<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.880> get<00:03:12.030> one

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
going Wireless a cheap way is to get one

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.750 
going Wireless a cheap way is to get one
of<00:03:12.300> these<00:03:12.390> HDMI<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.320> SDI<00:03:13.650> switches<00:03:14.130> which<00:03:14.640> is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
of these HDMI to SDI switches which is

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.090 
of these HDMI to SDI switches which is
about<00:03:14.910> 120<00:03:15.540> hundred<00:03:15.780> $30<00:03:16.290> I'll<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:16.950> more
