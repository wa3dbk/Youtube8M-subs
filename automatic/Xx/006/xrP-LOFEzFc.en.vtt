 for example with a diamond effect 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.300

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.320

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.869
 It was also a new method of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.240

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.369

 The enchanted books can be added 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.819
 villiger nerz be traded or in 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.390
 rare boxes found in dungeons 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.390
 become 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.129
 it is now possible in creative mode 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 really every item one 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:43.019
 to get enchantment there is also 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.420
 a little christmas surprise who 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.430
 would have thought 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.530
 but I'll get you in two or 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.359
 three four screenshots at the end of the video 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.940
 let show because I unfortunately 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.889
 I could not find it myself, I hope so 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.370
 I liked you until the next one 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.829
 video here on the screenshot you can 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.989
 see that the three little changes 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.419
 or two changes to 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.549
 Christmas time the left turns into 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:13.440
 red rimmed yes so I do not know 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.650
 what you should do not believe 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.690
 Skiing a bit can be good 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.639
 then you see the red single box 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.609
 The red design has and the double 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:26.790
 crate has a green design i should 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.709
 believe this quadrangle division should 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.900
 I believe a loop surrendered 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.629
 I think that's cool 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.750
 raussuchen from the folders is a 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.590
 So a little bit hides people 1000 to 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.590
 to the next video
