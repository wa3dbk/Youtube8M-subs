definitely cool just because at one

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.649 
definitely cool just because at one
point<00:01:12.920> we<00:01:13.190> all<00:01:13.340> were<00:01:13.700> in<00:01:13.880> college<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
point we all were in college in the

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.510 
point we all were in college in the
pac-10<00:01:15.080> together<00:01:15.470> when<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:15.799> was<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.009> freshman

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
pac-10 together when I was a freshman

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.090 
pac-10 together when I was a freshman
Alex<00:01:17.330> was<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.539> sophomore<00:01:17.780> Cheney<00:01:18.350> was<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> junior

Alex was a sophomore Cheney was a junior

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.789 
Alex was a sophomore Cheney was a junior
and<00:01:19.330> amy<00:01:20.330> was<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.630> senior<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:21.289> think<00:01:21.440> it's

our job is to put the ball in the back

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.530 
our job is to put the ball in the back
of<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.500> net<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:52.000> doesn't<00:01:52.210> really<00:01:52.330> matter

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
of the net and it doesn't really matter

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.760 
of the net and it doesn't really matter
you<00:01:52.840> know<00:01:52.990> how<00:01:53.020> old<00:01:53.260> we<00:01:53.410> are<00:01:53.530> There<00:01:53.740> is

you know how old we are There is

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.320 
you know how old we are There is
obviously<00:01:53.950> pressure<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.820> goes<00:01:54.970> along<00:01:55.120> with

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
obviously pressure that goes along with

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.790 
obviously pressure that goes along with
