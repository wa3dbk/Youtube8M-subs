00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 it's all good and all these sky on 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.319
 finds himself today for a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.629
 new video talk to you a little bit 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.250
 of gta 6 yes I was sitting you go 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.550
 tell me it's a bit early to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.050
 speak 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.370
 it's true I agree with you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.469
 because I was single is not even 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.730
 not released yet on pc we have moreover 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.260
 no news remember gta5 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.830
 rockstar had talked about it there's a 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.109
 or two months or so saying that if 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.570
 the next gen console was no problem 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.660
 worked quite well 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.960
 he would like to release the game gta 5 on it 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.200
 so that will also be the case for gta 6 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.200
 after we do not know yet if it's on pc 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.090
 or not in any case we know that the date 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.370
 Exit will be October or November 2016 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.350
 maybe even 2017 that's not sure 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.640
 like all video games it's likely to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.680
 take a little longer than expected 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.079
 as titanium flights a year that was 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.200
 pushed back so in any case it's 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.020
 really to take 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.540
 Oh 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.230
 really lightly with tweezers 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.340
 because I can not tell you that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.400
 it's true anyway I'll put you 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.870
 the link in the description 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.500
 because it's still I'm on 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.270
 the website be geek and it's a pretty website 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.360
 well reputed it's a pretty good site to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.890
 listen anyway so I make him 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.190
 trust after I know that all 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 sites is trying to make their little buzz 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.320
 to recognize himself and his dishes but I 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 think it's a pretty good info 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.369
 then after we will have information by 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.470
 the rest is normal 2016 we are not there 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.560
 not yet 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.200
 or 2017 as I tell you I do not know and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.430
 then and then and so here is like I 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.690
 you say you take tweezers 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.180
 but do not believe me on my word because 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.420
 I do not believe it either 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.440
 really just a small indication 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.860
 before the release but a game all 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.420
 and just then and that's at all 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.160
