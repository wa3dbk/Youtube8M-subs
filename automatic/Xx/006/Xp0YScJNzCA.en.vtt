think they're intentionally included

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.550 
think they're intentionally included
over<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:00.740> they<00:02:00.950> do<00:02:01.780> like<00:02:02.780> shut<00:02:03.020> down<00:02:03.229> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
power chip sound chip or whatever so I

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.340 
power chip sound chip or whatever so I
would<00:02:10.700> be<00:02:10.819> wise<00:02:11.030> not<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.390> do<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.810> that's<00:02:12.080> just

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
would be wise not to do that that's just

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.660 
would be wise not to do that that's just
from<00:02:12.709> what<00:02:12.890> I

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670
