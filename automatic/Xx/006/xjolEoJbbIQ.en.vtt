it's<00:00:12.360> pero<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.750> 2009<00:00:13.619> i'm<00:00:13.769> here<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.010> jeff<00:00:14.369> sams

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
it's pero I 2009 i'm here with jeff sams

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.609 
it's pero I 2009 i'm here with jeff sams
from<00:00:14.969> linate<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.510> find<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:15.930> about<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.230> process

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
from linate to find out about a process

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.210 
from linate to find out about a process
that<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.859> guys<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.340> got<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:17.699> which<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.060> very

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
that you guys have got now which is very

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.980 
that you guys have got now which is very
technologically<00:00:20.220> advanced<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.090> sounds<00:00:21.420> yes

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
technologically advanced it sounds yes

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.310 
technologically advanced it sounds yes
it<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.769> pulsed<00:00:23.400> plasma<00:00:23.550> nitriding

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
it is it's a pulsed plasma nitriding

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.109 
it is it's a pulsed plasma nitriding
we've<00:00:25.320> introduced<00:00:25.860> it<00:00:26.010> onto<00:00:26.220> our<00:00:26.250> crankshafts

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
we've introduced it onto our crankshafts

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.720 
we've introduced it onto our crankshafts
due<00:00:28.020> to<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> temperature<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.280> we're<00:00:29.550> able

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
due to the temperature that we're able

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.720 
due to the temperature that we're able
to<00:00:29.970> eat<00:00:30.270> the<00:00:30.390> crankshaft<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
to eat the crankshaft to is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.369 
to eat the crankshaft to is
substantially<00:00:32.730> lower<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.870> when<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.109> do<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
substantially lower so when we do the

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:35.840 
substantially lower so when we do the
nitriding<00:00:35.039> we<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.309> lose<00:00:35.460> our<00:00:35.609> through

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
nitriding we don't lose our through

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
nitriding we don't lose our through
hardness<00:00:36.270> where<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.289> this<00:00:37.379> benefit<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.980> it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
hardness where does this benefit you it

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.209 
hardness where does this benefit you it
benefits<00:00:38.820> us<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.600> ways<00:00:39.979> the<00:00:40.979> through

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
benefits us in two ways the through

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.649 
benefits us in two ways the through
hardness<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> crankshaft<00:00:41.969> makes<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
hardness of the crankshaft makes it

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.439 
hardness of the crankshaft makes it
stronger<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:44.159> lubricity<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.269> adds

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
stronger and the lubricity that it adds

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.709 
stronger and the lubricity that it adds
to<00:00:45.749> the<00:00:46.229> bearing<00:00:46.710> surfaces<00:00:47.219> makes<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.729> more

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
to the bearing surfaces makes it more

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.629 
to the bearing surfaces makes it more
user-friendly<00:00:49.129> this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> fairly<00:00:50.460> new

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
user-friendly this is a fairly new

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.329 
user-friendly this is a fairly new
process<00:00:51.030> isn't<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.359> yes<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.199> us<00:00:52.339> you're

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
process isn't it yes it is for us you're

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.189 
process isn't it yes it is for us you're
also<00:00:53.489> applying<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.299> technique<00:00:54.479> to<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:54.989> cam

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
also applying this technique to your cam

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
also applying this technique to your cam
shafts<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.620> well<00:00:55.769> yes<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.549> are<00:00:56.729> it<00:00:56.969> helps<00:00:57.479> in

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
shafts as well yes we are it helps in

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.279 
shafts as well yes we are it helps in
the<00:00:57.719> longevity<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.339> flat<00:00:59.819> tappets<00:01:00.299> and<00:01:01.139> we

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the longevity of the flat tappets and we

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
the longevity of the flat tappets and we
find<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.769> very<00:01:01.889> user-friendly<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.179> well

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
find it to be very user-friendly as well

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
find it to be very user-friendly as well
in<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.659> area<00:01:03.929> what<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in that area what have you got on the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390 
in that area what have you got on the
spy<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.850> new<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> year<00:01:06.180> Iver<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.400> we

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
spy that's new this year Iver it not we

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.090 
spy that's new this year Iver it not we
have<00:01:08.580> some<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.940> our<00:01:09.060> lifters<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.950> also

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
have some of our lifters and we also

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.260 
have some of our lifters and we also

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have our bare bones line it's a new line

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.660 
have our bare bones line it's a new line
that<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.540> brought<00:01:15.750> out<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.440> more<00:01:17.400> cost

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that we brought out it's more cost

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.720 
that we brought out it's more cost

racer and it also we can use them in the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.720 
racer and it also we can use them in the
street<00:01:24.090> strip<00:01:25.020> applications<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.890> well<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730

it<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.640> actually<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.530> designing<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.710> new

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it is we actually are designing a new

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.820 
it is we actually are designing a new
crankshaft<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> four-inch<00:01:33.660> crank<00:01:34.020> with

our night writing process with a
two-inch<00:01:37.230> crank<00:01:37.530> pin<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.300> able<00:01:39.480> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
two-inch crank pin and we are able to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.550 
two-inch crank pin and we are able to
downsize<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.620> OD<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> rod<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.810> eliminate

lot of products on display at pero why

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.420 
lot of products on display at pero why
we<00:01:47.880> choose<00:01:48.120> linate<00:01:48.540> over<00:01:48.840> some<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.170> rest

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
we choose linate over some of the rest
