have a video capture device what I use
is<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:20.090> pinnacle<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.300> also<00:00:21.990> know<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.920> couple

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
is a pinnacle I also know of a couple

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.509 
is a pinnacle I also know of a couple
other<00:00:25.580> systems<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.730> work<00:00:27.920> all<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
other systems at work all it is is a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.790 
other systems at work all it is is a
video<00:00:29.849> capture<00:00:30.269> device<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> also<00:00:31.500> an

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
video capture device there is also an

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.139 
video capture device there is also an
easycap<00:00:32.279> video<00:00:32.850> capture<00:00:33.630> device<00:00:33.660> which<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
easycap video capture device which is

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.959 
easycap video capture device which is
fairly<00:00:36.149> cheap<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.980> only<00:00:38.190> thing<00:00:38.370> about

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
fairly cheap the only thing about

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.869 
fairly cheap the only thing about
capturing<00:00:39.629> video<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.350> your<00:00:40.500> computer<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
capturing video on your computer is that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.350 
capturing video on your computer is that
it<00:00:42.059> cannot<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.629> HD<00:00:43.230> due<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> processor<00:00:44.789> speed

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it cannot be HD due to processor speed

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.590 
it cannot be HD due to processor speed
and<00:00:45.660> everything<00:00:47.149> computers<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.360> aren't

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and everything computers just aren't

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.110 
and everything computers just aren't
fast<00:00:48.780> enough<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> yet<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.730> only

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
fast enough to do that yet and the only

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.299 
fast enough to do that yet and the only
way<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.050> buy<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:53.070> really

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
way to do it is to buy a really really

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.729 
way to do it is to buy a really really
expensive<00:00:53.820> video<00:00:54.719> capturing<00:00:55.320> device<00:00:56.239> anyways

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
expensive video capturing device anyways

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
expensive video capturing device anyways
so<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.100> use<00:00:59.340> just<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.149> component

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
so you can use just your component

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.240 
so you can use just your component
cables<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:03.690> came<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> Xbox<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cables that came with the Xbox as you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
cables that came with the Xbox as you
can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:06.140> here<00:01:07.140> I've<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.189> red<00:01:09.060> white

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
can see right here I've got red white

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
can see right here I've got red white
and<00:01:09.420> yellow<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.880> only<00:01:12.119> thing<00:01:12.299> about<00:01:13.130> doing

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and yellow the only thing about doing

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.740 
and yellow the only thing about doing
the<00:01:14.280> video<00:01:14.549> capture<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.119> your<00:01:15.299> computer

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the video capture on your computer

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.130 
the video capture on your computer
screen<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.920> cannot<00:01:17.479> hear<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> audio

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
screen is that you cannot hear the audio

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.440 
screen is that you cannot hear the audio
while<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.700> doing<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:22.040> screen

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
while you're doing it with your screen

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.749 
while you're doing it with your screen
so<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> suggest<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.619> taking<00:01:26.520> your

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
so what I suggest is taking your

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
so what I suggest is taking your
red-and-black<00:01:27.000> cables<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.900> audio<00:01:28.140> cables

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
red-and-black cables your audio cables

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
red-and-black cables your audio cables
and<00:01:29.509> hooking<00:01:30.509> them<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.470> stereo<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.430> such

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and hooking them up to a stereo or such

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.010 
and hooking them up to a stereo or such
like<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:35.310> yellow<00:01:35.700> cable<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
like that but your yellow cable what you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.130 
like that but your yellow cable what you
do<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.619> hook<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:39.140> audio

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
do is you hook it up to your audio

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.319 
do is you hook it up to your audio
capture<00:01:40.560> device<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.799> i<00:01:43.829> have

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
capture device this one that i have

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.880 
capture device this one that i have
actually<00:01:45.329> has<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:47.960> component<00:01:48.960> cables<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
actually has the component cables and it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
actually has the component cables and it
also<00:01:50.040> has<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.579> s-video<00:01:51.030> port<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:53.689> whichever

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
also has an s-video port so whichever

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.830

some<00:02:13.890> video<00:02:14.700> capturing<00:02:15.269> studios<00:02:16.970> will<00:02:17.970> not

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
some video capturing studios will not

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.809 
some video capturing studios will not
actually<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> screen<00:02:19.290> big<00:02:19.560> enough<00:02:19.819> for

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
actually have a screen big enough for

actually have a screen big enough for
you<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.030> play<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:24.360> very<00:02:24.540> difficult<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
you to play on it's very difficult and

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.449 
you to play on it's very difficult and
you<00:02:25.590> actually<00:02:25.769> have<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.220> record<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:28.250> put<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> to

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
you actually have to record to put it to

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.460 
you actually have to record to put it to
full<00:02:29.610> screen<00:02:30.500> now<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.530> did<00:02:32.010> find<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:33.470> video

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.270 
full screen now I did find a video
capturing<00:02:35.250> studio<00:02:36.379> right<00:02:37.379> here<00:02:37.799> it's<00:02:38.010> called

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
capturing studio right here it's called

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.839 
capturing studio right here it's called
the<00:02:38.489> view<00:02:38.819> video<00:02:39.629> capture<00:02:40.140> studio<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.950> I
