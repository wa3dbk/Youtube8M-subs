this and the original story but there

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
this and the original story but there

wasn't so it's a little disappointed on

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.680 
wasn't so it's a little disappointed on
that<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.579> intend<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.120> picking<00:00:48.480> up

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that so if you do intend on picking up

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.970 
that so if you do intend on picking up
this<00:00:48.840> book<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.649> something<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this book I think that's something you

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.380 
this book I think that's something you
should<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> title

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
should know because just from the title

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
should know because just from the title
alone<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.230> make<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.890> assumption

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
alone you kind of make that assumption

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.430 
alone you kind of make that assumption
to<00:00:53.489> begin<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.850> okay<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.210> continuing<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:55.020> with

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
to begin with okay so continuing on with

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.680 
to begin with okay so continuing on with
that<00:00:55.500> strain<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.250> thought<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.699> went<00:00:57.239> into<00:00:57.449> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that strain of thought I went into this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
that strain of thought I went into this
knowing<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.010> be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
knowing that it was going to be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
knowing that it was going to be
different<00:00:59.489> from<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> expected<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
different from what I expected because I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.039 
different from what I expected because I
had<00:01:01.230> heard<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.219> book<00:01:02.520> wasn't<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
had heard that this book wasn't what you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.570 
had heard that this book wasn't what you
thought<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.430> much

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
thought it was going to be pretty much

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940 
thought it was going to be pretty much
everyone<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.600> had<00:01:07.020> read<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> book<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
everyone that had read the book that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
everyone that had read the book that
talked<00:01:08.340> about<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.760> mentions<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:10.049> some

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
talked about it mentions this at some

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.230 
talked about it mentions this at some
point<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:10.830> even<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.280> into<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> expecting

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
point but even going into this expecting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.359 
point but even going into this expecting
to<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:13.140> surprised<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.710> suppose<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
to be a little surprised I suppose it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.730 
to be a little surprised I suppose it
was<00:01:14.549> still<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.360> too<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.619> my

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
was still a little too out there for my

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
was still a little too out there for my
taste<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.369> terms<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> actual

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
taste in terms of what the actual

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
taste in terms of what the actual
zombies<00:01:18.990> were<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.530> they're<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.830> what

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
zombies were because they're not what

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
zombies were because they're not what
you<00:01:20.820> typically<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.720> when<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.170> hear<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
too hard to be unique and different this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
too hard to be unique and different this
book<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> high<00:01:38.220> school<00:01:38.460> setting

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
which is very hit-or-miss for me

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.960

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
raised a lot of questions that didn't

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.630 
raised a lot of questions that didn't
seem<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.110> answered<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> lot<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
seem to be answered I know that a lot of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.540 
seem to be answered I know that a lot of
these<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.060> answered<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
these will be answered in

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.100 
these will be answered in
books<00:02:12.880> but<00:02:13.090> some<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.360> them<00:02:13.450> just<00:02:13.600> didn't<00:02:13.960> seem

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
books but some of them just didn't seem

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.350 
books but some of them just didn't seem
to<00:02:14.260> quite<00:02:14.440> make<00:02:14.800> enough<00:02:15.250> sense<00:02:15.610> sometimes<00:02:16.240> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
to quite make enough sense sometimes you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.390 
to quite make enough sense sometimes you
can<00:02:16.480> kind<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.720> guess<00:02:16.960> what's<00:02:17.560> going<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:18.010> behind

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
can kind of guess what's going on behind

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.820 
can kind of guess what's going on behind
it<00:02:18.610> or<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.960> kind<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.260> makes<00:02:20.320> sense<00:02:20.710> with

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it or it it kind of makes sense with

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.110 
it or it it kind of makes sense with
thoughts<00:02:21.010> happening<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:21.580> some<00:02:21.790> things<00:02:22.000> just

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
thoughts happening but some things just

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.020 
thoughts happening but some things just
seemed<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.690> there<00:02:23.140> were<00:02:23.260> included<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.190> add

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
seemed like there were included to add

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.880 
seemed like there were included to add
tension<00:02:25.510> or<00:02:25.930> kind<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.200> move<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> story<00:02:26.770> along

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
tension or kind of move the story along

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.350 
tension or kind of move the story along
it's<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.610> hard<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.880> say<00:02:28.030> at<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.180> point

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
it's really hard to say at this point

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.300 
it's really hard to say at this point
because<00:02:28.900> obviously<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.500> lot<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.710> things<00:02:29.950> should

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
because obviously a lot of things should

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.580 
because obviously a lot of things should
be<00:02:30.430> answered<00:02:30.850> later<00:02:31.330> on<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.840> series<00:02:32.260> but

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
be answered later on in that series but

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.120 
be answered later on in that series but
at<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:32.950> point<00:02:33.250> I'm<00:02:33.520> left<00:02:33.850> kind<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.240> like<00:02:34.390> ye

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
at this point I'm left kind of like ye

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.620 
at this point I'm left kind of like ye
you<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.640> while<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:36.850> did<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.300> quite<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.570> few

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
you so while I did have quite a few

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.630 
you so while I did have quite a few
problems<00:02:38.140> with<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:38.620> story<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> plot

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
problems with this story and the plot

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.770 
problems with this story and the plot
these<00:02:39.880> were<00:02:40.060> things<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.420> definitely

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
these were things that I definitely

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.770 
these were things that I definitely
noticed<00:02:41.020> while<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> was<00:02:41.530> reading<00:02:41.710> but<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.780> didn't

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
noticed while I was reading but I didn't

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.420 
noticed while I was reading but I didn't
really<00:02:43.900> think<00:02:44.200> too<00:02:44.560> much<00:02:44.680> about<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:45.100> until<00:02:45.370> I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
really think too much about it until I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.520 
really think too much about it until I
put<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> book<00:02:46.060> down<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:46.840> reflect<00:02:47.290> back

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
put the book down and then reflect back

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.900 
put the book down and then reflect back
ting<00:02:47.710> kind<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.070> like<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:48.250> didn't<00:02:48.820> really

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
ting kind of be like I didn't really

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.580 
ting kind of be like I didn't really
like<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.360> about<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.810> guess<00:02:50.050> while<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.380> was

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
like that about it I guess while I was

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.410 
like that about it I guess while I was
reading<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.010> there<00:02:51.160> was<00:02:51.280> something<00:02:51.580> keeping

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
reading it there was something keeping

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.480 
reading it there was something keeping
me<00:02:52.540> pulled<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.320> little<00:02:53.440> bit<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:54.070> I'm<00:02:54.340> not

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
me pulled in a little bit and I'm not

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.190 
me pulled in a little bit and I'm not
sure<00:02:54.700> what<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.030> was<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.450> be<00:02:55.570> honest<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.930> can't

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
sure what it was to be honest I can't

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.500 
sure what it was to be honest I can't
pinpoint<00:02:56.530> what<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.550> was<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.030> think<00:02:58.240> it<00:02:58.330> might<00:02:58.480> be

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
pinpoint what it was I think it might be

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.330 
pinpoint what it was I think it might be
the<00:02:58.750> main<00:02:58.930> character's<00:02:59.380> voice<00:02:59.590> she's<00:03:00.100> quite<00:03:00.310> a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
the main character's voice she's quite a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.580 
the main character's voice she's quite a
snarky<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.150> humorous<00:03:01.870> character<00:03:02.110> which<00:03:02.470> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
snarky and humorous character which I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920 
snarky and humorous character which I
always<00:03:02.890> loved<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:04.030> might<00:03:04.210> have<00:03:04.330> been<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
always loved so that might have been the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.080 
always loved so that might have been the
thing<00:03:05.110> keeping<00:03:05.500> me<00:03:05.650> reeled<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.280> however<00:03:06.580> it

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.340 
thing keeping me reeled in however it
took<00:03:07.210> a<00:03:07.270> little<00:03:07.480> getting<00:03:07.570> used<00:03:08.050> to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
took a little getting used to

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.380 
took a little getting used to
her<00:03:08.620> voice<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.370> writing<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.150> book

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
her voice and the writing of this book

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.880 
her voice and the writing of this book
as<00:03:10.510> well<00:03:10.630> when<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.020> first<00:03:11.260> started<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.650> book<00:03:11.740> I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
as well when I first started the book I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.980 
as well when I first started the book I
was<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> bit<00:03:12.190> iffy<00:03:12.700> about<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.750> definitely

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
was a bit iffy about it but I definitely

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.720 
was a bit iffy about it but I definitely
started<00:03:14.440> getting<00:03:14.860> used<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.400> think<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
started getting used to it I think the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.280 
started getting used to it I think the
main<00:03:15.880> thing<00:03:15.910> was<00:03:16.270> that<00:03:16.330> at<00:03:16.660> some<00:03:16.840> points<00:03:17.200> the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
main thing was that at some points the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.380 
main thing was that at some points the
character<00:03:17.650> could<00:03:17.830> be<00:03:17.890> quite<00:03:18.160> melodramatic<00:03:18.640> at

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
character could be quite melodramatic at

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.260 
character could be quite melodramatic at
times<00:03:19.860> but<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.160> definitely<00:03:21.580> liked<00:03:21.790> her<00:03:22.000> snack

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
times but I definitely liked her snack

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.729 
times but I definitely liked her snack
apart<00:03:22.750> from<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.020> don't<00:03:23.110> have<00:03:23.380> too<00:03:23.590> much

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
apart from that I don't have too much

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.710 
apart from that I don't have too much
else<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.100> say<00:03:24.340> about<00:03:24.370> her<00:03:24.910> apart<00:03:25.330> from<00:03:25.480> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
else to say about her apart from I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.590 
else to say about her apart from I
wasn't<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.110> huge<00:03:26.350> fan<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.620> her<00:03:27.430> fixation<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:28.270> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
wasn't a huge fan of her fixation on the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600 
wasn't a huge fan of her fixation on the
love<00:03:28.810> interest<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:30.160> love<00:03:30.370> interest

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
love interest and the love interest

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.300 
love interest and the love interest
himself<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.480> wasn't<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.050> big<00:03:32.380> fan<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.650> he<00:03:33.160> was

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
himself I wasn't a big fan of he was

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.610 
himself I wasn't a big fan of he was
kind<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.850> stereotypical<00:03:34.630> alpha<00:03:35.410> male

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
kind of that stereotypical alpha male

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.590 
kind of that stereotypical alpha male
character<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.700> didn't<00:03:36.940> really<00:03:37.150> see<00:03:37.390> any

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
character and I didn't really see any

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.360 
character and I didn't really see any
chemistry<00:03:38.200> between<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.650> two<00:03:38.680> characters<00:03:39.250> so

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
chemistry between the two characters so

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.860 
chemistry between the two characters so
I<00:03:39.400> didn't<00:03:39.610> really<00:03:39.760> understand<00:03:40.270> why<00:03:40.570> they<00:03:40.810> were

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
I didn't really understand why they were

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.630 
I didn't really understand why they were
developing<00:03:41.410> some<00:03:41.620> kind<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:42.010> relationship

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
developing some kind of relationship

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.979 
developing some kind of relationship
because<00:03:42.940> there's<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.450> weird<00:03:43.690> thing<00:03:43.930> that

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
because there's this weird thing that

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.170 
because there's this weird thing that
happens<00:03:44.920> between<00:03:45.130> them<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:45.940> you've<00:03:46.060> read

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
happens between them and if you've read

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.430 
happens between them and if you've read
the<00:03:46.300> book<00:03:46.450> you'll<00:03:46.630> know<00:03:46.900> what<00:03:47.020> I'm<00:03:47.110> talking

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
the book you'll know what I'm talking

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.199 
the book you'll know what I'm talking
about<00:03:47.470> but<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.520> was<00:03:48.640> one<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:48.970> main

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
about but that was one of the main

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.930 
about but that was one of the main
things<00:03:49.570> that<00:03:50.290> raised<00:03:50.500> questions<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:51.459> my<00:03:51.730> mind

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
things that raised questions in my mind

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.449 
things that raised questions in my mind
and<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:52.660> didn't<00:03:53.050> make<00:03:53.080> much<00:03:53.650> sense<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.160> me<00:03:54.280> it

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
and that didn't make much sense to me it

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.500 
and that didn't make much sense to me it
didn't<00:03:54.670> seem<00:03:54.820> like<00:03:55.030> there<00:03:55.180> was<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.390> unique

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
didn't seem like there was that unique

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.720 
didn't seem like there was that unique
basis<00:03:56.050> behind<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:56.770> it's<00:03:57.070> very<00:03:57.130> hard<00:03:57.400> to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
basis behind it it's it's very hard to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.880 
basis behind it it's it's very hard to
explain<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.420> without<00:03:58.690> explicitly<00:03:59.530> saying

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
explain this without explicitly saying

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.470 
explain this without explicitly saying
what<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.580> don't<00:04:00.640> spoil<00:04:01.150> anything<00:04:01.420> so

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
what it is and I don't spoil anything so

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.910 
what it is and I don't spoil anything so
yeah<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.690> was<00:04:04.810> my<00:04:04.870> terrible<00:04:05.530> terrible

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
yeah that was my terrible terrible

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.830 
yeah that was my terrible terrible
explanation<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:07.000> think<00:04:07.209> for<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.390> most<00:04:07.540> part<00:04:07.660> I

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
explanation I think for the most part I

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.180 
explanation I think for the most part I
was<00:04:07.930> just<00:04:08.080> really<00:04:08.200> disappointed<00:04:08.380> in<00:04:09.070> this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
was just really disappointed in this

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.350 
was just really disappointed in this
book<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:10.230> honestly<00:04:11.230> would<00:04:11.620> have<00:04:11.709> loved<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.730> so

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
book I honestly would have loved this so

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.270 
book I honestly would have loved this so
much<00:04:13.390> more<00:04:13.900> if<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.290> wasn't<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:15.010> particular

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
much more if it wasn't in the particular

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.890 
much more if it wasn't in the particular
setting<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.000> was<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.359> think<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.720> would<00:04:16.810> have

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
setting it was I think it would have

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.170 
setting it was I think it would have
been<00:04:16.930> super<00:04:17.410> awesome<00:04:17.859> if<00:04:18.160> that<00:04:18.700> was<00:04:18.850> kind<00:04:19.120> of

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
been super awesome if that was kind of

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.360 
been super awesome if that was kind of
like<00:04:19.330> a<00:04:19.390> Zombieland<00:04:20.049> like<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.799> go<00:04:20.979> into

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
like a Zombieland like you go into

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.100 
like a Zombieland like you go into
Zombieland<00:04:21.850> like<00:04:22.090> Alice<00:04:22.570> would<00:04:22.690> go<00:04:22.870> into

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
Zombieland like Alice would go into

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.659 
Zombieland like Alice would go into
Wonderland<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:24.010> then

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
Wonderland and then

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.150 
Wonderland and then
crazy<00:04:25.060> she's<00:04:25.449> had<00:04:25.690> happened<00:04:26.020> there<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.949> had

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
crazy she's had happened there it had

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.100 
crazy she's had happened there it had
turned<00:04:27.370> all<00:04:27.580> dark<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:27.940> gloomy<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.449> infested

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
turned all dark and gloomy and infested

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.570 
turned all dark and gloomy and infested
with<00:04:29.320> zombies<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.800> think<00:04:29.979> in<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.130> back<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.400> my

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
with zombies I think in the back of my

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.520 
with zombies I think in the back of my
mind<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.970> was<00:04:31.210> hoping<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:31.690> that's<00:04:31.990> what<00:04:32.229> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
mind I was hoping that that's what the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.290 
mind I was hoping that that's what the
story<00:04:32.680> would<00:04:32.889> be<00:04:32.949> like<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:33.729> it<00:04:33.820> really<00:04:34.000> wasn't

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
story would be like but it really wasn't

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.820 
story would be like but it really wasn't
and<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:36.130> was<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.250> bit<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.490> letdown<00:04:36.669> for<00:04:36.850> me

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
and that was a bit of a letdown for me

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
and that was a bit of a letdown for me
unfortunately<00:04:38.830> but<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.130> lot<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.400> people<00:04:39.669> do

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
unfortunately but a lot of people do
