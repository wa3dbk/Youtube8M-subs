00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.089
 now we will leave the buttonhole we will go up 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.970
 with a chain we turn our fabric and 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:14.330
 we will make the first half point 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.690
 we'll make a chain and we'll go to the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.750
 last half point and we make 1 and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:26.140
 remember that we only have to stay 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:29.840
 with 3 we make a chain we rotate and 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.659
 we made our first half point and 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.569
 now in the chain we will only do a half 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.569
 point and finally 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.789
 the last half point and it's already like 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.090
 we finished making our mask and 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:50.780
 now let's do around 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.310
 let's weave a chain and here you 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.880
 we want a half crochet like this 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:03.920
 and we're going to go around the contour 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:08.660
 of our masks weave an average 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.780
 just go to the part where more or 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.450
 less to this part 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.450
 we want you half a vareta 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.690
 I'm already getting to the most part 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.690
 wide of my mask and look 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.380
 and here I'm going to start doing alone 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.460
 means points this way I'm not going to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.930
 Now I'll just do stockings 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.710
 half points 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.200
 until this part of here 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.400
 more or less here I'm going to start 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.400
 knit stockings varetas 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.190
 here I'm going to start knitting socks 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.520
 varetas 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.640
 I'm going to knit stockings all around 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.430
 contour to the same height where the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.950
 we started doing and from here we will leave 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.319
 half point 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.840
 up to the height where we started doing 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.769
 the half ends and the rest is 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.769
 stockings varetas 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.880
 look here and I already turned around and already 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 I will knit at the same height 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.360
 to continue weaving stockings until 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.960
 the same height where I will start 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.760
 with the midpoints 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.180
 I have finished doing in my outline 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.210
 now I can only close with point 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.770
 slipped in the first half vareta 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.770
 We made this vareta 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.720
 we make a chain and cut our 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.290
 thread and we have stayed this way 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.980

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.650
