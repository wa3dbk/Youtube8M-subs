00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.130 
once we get everything back up and
running<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:32.270> think<00:04:32.510> right<00:04:32.660> now<00:04:32.870> we're<00:04:33.110> just

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
running and I think right now we're just

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.469 
running and I think right now we're just
trying<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.530> sort<00:04:33.710> everything<00:04:33.800> out<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.880> I

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
trying to sort everything out and I

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.420
