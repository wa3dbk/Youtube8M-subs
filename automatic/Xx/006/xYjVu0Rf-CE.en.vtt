the brush I mean this visualizing a top
exactly<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:48.930> whole<00:02:49.380> idea<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.950> supposed<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
exactly this whole idea is supposed to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.790 
exactly this whole idea is supposed to
be<00:02:50.850> left<00:02:51.150> natural<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.780> soft<00:02:51.959> that's<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
be left natural and soft that's the

be left natural and soft that's the
thing<00:02:52.980> people<00:02:53.130> get<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.580> coddle<00:02:54.030> should<00:02:54.360> we

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
thing people get to coddle should we

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.540 
thing people get to coddle should we
spend<00:02:54.630> Washington<00:02:55.230> language<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.800> see<00:02:56.010> yeah

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
spend Washington language and see yeah

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.370 
spend Washington language and see yeah
we<00:02:56.730> see<00:02:56.850> anybody<00:02:57.209> knock<00:02:57.420> those<00:02:57.600> Toria<00:02:58.080> when

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
kind of over to the side side swept look

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.130 
kind of over to the side side swept look
as<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.910> all<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.300> rage<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.780> moment<00:03:04.080> is

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
trying to get symmetry right and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.800 
trying to get symmetry right and
everything<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.239> going<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.690> the
