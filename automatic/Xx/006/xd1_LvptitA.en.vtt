00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 so hello and come to another 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 show video today how you order 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 can do about a book like that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.550
 I want you to work after that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.550
 show up to the same 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.960
 so hello and cordially too 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.520
 this further video 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.160
 Today I want to show you how to do it 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.600
 It's like commanding a book 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.809
 tax may in addition I can for example 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.500
 type in the day and a new one will hang 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.559
 tomorrow 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.220
 I can rain here, for example 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.920
 enter 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.160
 and it starts raining I can now 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.650
 but also enter the sun and the sun 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.610
 seems again so see the command 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.979
 she's just workouts since she's still monster 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.570
 should I kill fast times makes 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.369
 they will come into play soon 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.750
 so now we have to such a 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.000
 adventure neff so that's pretty much 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.860
 ideas for an adventure here is one 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.750
 Door where you do not actually come in 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.310
 that no lever is just there 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.299
 shield gives you the book into a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.869
 thanks to the head to the 1 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:20.930
 if we are here now door to door 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:24.159
 open enter value thought the door 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.640
 opens when we open the door 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.869
 close enter so not written 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.369
 finally the door again 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.749
 Incidentally, I always get new book 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.729
 so I do not always have to explain that 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:38.350
 I have everything set myself so justly 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.929
 or in the adventure matt o even here 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.539
 I believe this is on page 115 54 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.280
 to hire the unit even so I 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.479
 never seen of it matter we are 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.929
 by the way, in snapshots 14 02 10 in 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.159
 regard to the 1.8 for example 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.679
 we must fall monster now 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.909
 This will simply kill monsters 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:08.859
 Of course I can kill the slices 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.859
 monster finished breath 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.380
 So you are all monster stars 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:24.170
 Besides , that was not a monster 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:28.280
 his snout you do everything makes everything 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 broken so next example 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.330
 somehow knows how to become them 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.870
 I then have to teleport quickly 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.000
 rescue 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.680
 like now when you react the air 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.780
 just have the book we have to completely 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.210
 act quickly and give easy help 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.700
 a channel the real write help so 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.330
 I believe and here is already a slime 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.870
 blockes pont this year since 1.8 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.400
 Now stop in snapshot there and that 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.370
 is now a beastly one more time 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.990
 go save the whole 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.209
 That's not that hard 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.620
 I can do that right away 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.800
 times short insight purely makes my book 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.300
 flies away but this is how it works 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.650
 If you do not get a case hurt like that 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.320
 bit bypasses again automatically 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.530
 game mode or gave hunger and can 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.230
 from distances here eg the halo 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.110
 resources is then, so to speak , was 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.810
 of course that wlan too, so to speak 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.030
 choose redstone for example we have 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.019
 hunger then we give one hungry one 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.580
 I can so much of the slices of hunger 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.769
 and as you can see the potatoes are 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.769
 our munich rounded off a chest 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.930
 yes it may take forever so now 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 that would have to come now 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.569
 actually close immediately 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.880
 probably that's just now like 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.510
 or even to the last example 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.709
 I show you for example end 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.090
 this is more of a fan now i hope so 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.569
 my whole web it is not in the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.900
 there you will fall south below us 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.080
 explode or even the last block 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.650
 and ignited i hope you fly her 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.010
 Not everything in the air 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.989
 After all, it was clear I can not now 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.329
 Just look in here again 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.450
 I have a scoreboard for this 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.919
 creates scoreboard objectives and then 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.680
 I have given the name that we 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.970
 Now fireworks and criteria is type 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.280
 actually, I do not care if anything 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.110
 taken and then the first over here 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.729
 so if you press the button is 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.060
 here a weblog sat down 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.610
 the first is scoreboard players fmc 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.860
 ends up on fireworks on the score one 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.500
 the other makes me in game mode and 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.330
 then he raises all the one scoreboard 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.520
 Coins of yore have gone up by 2 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.910
 by 4 up and 6 up and 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.910
 always so on 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.260
 I can show that here 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.720
 with the monsters that it just test 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.770
 before the order here all the time 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.110
 executed test before 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.380
 all players in the radius of blablabla 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.030
 if that is true is in 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.780
 command block of a combo just 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.350
 spawn two blocks take over with the 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.260
 door 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.910
 Here is a rescue blog responder 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.690
 he opens the door then he will as well 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.450
 away now yes I'll give it now 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.260
 just kill 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.180
 monz monster one way and one to 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.639
 to die 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.010
 some commands since the 1.8 are too 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.930
 Incidentally, the extremely cool clock 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.580
 is not that my card the the 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.760
 whole block sits down here and the 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.630
 remove it again as close to it 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.370
 to watch the rhine 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.550
 so is the command that is also in the 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.070
 description climate so the book explains 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.680
 in my inventory but only if on the 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.470
 Sun stands for example when he is 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.930
 that has done successfully gives that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.060
 signal on and stop command weather 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.050
 climate and up here I show the same 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.650
 why that is the same half day 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:15.440
 behind it value share z1 door open set 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:21.180
 blog redstone block then kill monster.de 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.580
 type zombie then clearly it would help 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.440
 worse too 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.300
 we would also put a hungry 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.270
 blog 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.310
 therefore the recipe block first the 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:36.630
 regulate 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.730
 Red Rain In the end , a doctor put down 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.420
 the blog executes that whole 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.460
 falling from the sky then closing the door 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.920
 We would have received the block now 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.460
 remove 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.940
 what the top is always for z blog that is 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:58.910
 for being here somewhere after him 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:02.010
 look where it is here somewhere 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.830
 yes, now it had to be here too 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.150
 oh there it is so if the signa 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.940
 is delivered here in red for 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.370
 signal down blog sat down first 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.510
 you will be cleared inventory then get 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.340
 new book and then again micro lz it 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.750
 He continued instead of the red 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.220
 blog a mix out that for example 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.410
 One day we could see the sun 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.680
 make it because you have very short in local 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:28.010
 scene under day there you have it again 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.540
 seen and it is triggered there 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.880
 So that was a little bit to me 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.860
 hope so it can be really cool 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.090
 do things i hope you find in there 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.680
 Use for or on 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.780
 anyway, that's cool too 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.930
 then times to know so I thank you 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.990
 ever look for if we still 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.890
 have more such command tutorials 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.060
 I want to say 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.400
 then write that twice in the 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.180
 comments do not subscribe to licon 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.500
 to forget 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.500
 until next time bye
