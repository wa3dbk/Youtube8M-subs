00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello people I declare this today 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.809
 set of pythagoras the square + b 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.360
 square equal c square is so 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.690
 this formula is true, it is important 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.300
 that the triangle is a right-angled one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:25.279
 triangle is and the c is the hypothesis of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.990
 Dreiecks is the longest side 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:36.540
 Let's label the other two 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:38.899
 pages with a and b around the formula something 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.050
 to understand better 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:49.079
 square + b square slightly c-square 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.140
 We can also squares to the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.690
 side imagine if the area of ​​ah 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 square and the area of ​​b square 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.850
 together , the same area as c 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:08.720
 square, so now we're paying for 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:12.180
 and b a, say, 3 and 4 b 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.479
 then we get the formula 3 x 3 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:24.830
 gives 9 + 4 x 4 are 16 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.830
 and that gives c square equal to 25 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.680
 if now know the route of ca 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.840
 want and not just his square sal 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.259
 then you can easily do that now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 The root of the goal, therefore , is the roots 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:50.159
 from 25 and that's five we know 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.810
 so all sides the 3 6 as three to 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.869
 four which was already given 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.390
 with the help of the sentence of pythagoras 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.399
 we could now also the side c 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.469
 calculate 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.869
 I hope my back has you a little bit 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.610
 helped and you have now 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.610
 understood set of pythagoras
