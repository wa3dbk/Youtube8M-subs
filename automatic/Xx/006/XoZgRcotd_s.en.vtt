00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
you how it works yeah hold on I'll

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:35.970 
you how it works yeah hold on I'll
fast-forward<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:22.790> part

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.300 

yep<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.090> that's<00:02:37.720> how<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.140> works<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:39.099> walls

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
yep so that's how it works the walls

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.300 
yep so that's how it works the walls
started<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.480> drop<00:02:40.780> already<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:41.950> said<00:02:42.010> they

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
started to drop already like I said they

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.920 
started to drop already like I said they
don't<00:02:42.400> drop<00:02:42.760> all<00:02:43.000> together<00:02:43.269> like<00:02:43.629> on<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
don't drop all together like on the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.440 
don't drop all together like on the
computer<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:44.980> they<00:02:45.159> do<00:02:45.220> they<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.000> drop

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
computer but they do they do drop

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.020 
computer but they do they do drop

had<00:03:01.299> redstone<00:03:01.840> lamps<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.470> they<00:03:02.860> had

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
had redstone lamps and they had

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.569 
had redstone lamps and they had
glowstone<00:03:04.329> with<00:03:05.170> redstone<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:06.040> top<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.430> them
