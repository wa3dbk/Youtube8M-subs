00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
the iPad and how simple it is and how
the<00:00:39.629> two<00:00:40.260> units<00:00:40.980> work<00:00:41.850> together<00:00:42.590> what's<00:00:43.590> very

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the two units work together what's very

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.549 
the two units work together what's very
important<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.340> well<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> xdj<00:00:45.329> arrow<00:00:45.600> can

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
important as well as the xdj arrow can

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.270 
important as well as the xdj arrow can
use<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> four<00:00:48.270> different<00:00:48.960> connections<00:00:49.920> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
use up to four different connections so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.080 
use up to four different connections so
you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.700> four<00:00:51.300> separate<00:00:51.899> entities

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
you can have four separate entities

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.110 
you can have four separate entities

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.029 
being able to play music directly to the
hardware<00:00:57.570> software<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.350> coming<00:00:58.680> from<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
hardware software is coming from of

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
hardware software is coming from of
course<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.820> Android<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> iPad<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> the
