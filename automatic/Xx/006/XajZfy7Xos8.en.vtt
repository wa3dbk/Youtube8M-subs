00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:13.880
 in this video i will show you how i am 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:18.210
 Fuck down a very effective method 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:22.070
 growing this culture in standard 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 landing option is used 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:32.510
 awakening seeds and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.510
 poles which distributes the area and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.390
 By this method, the game itself was called, I will do 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 it is with the help of such a construction 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 which i do so in the corners 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:58.710
 equilateral triangle 1 meter i 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 making a hole in the ground 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.850
 iron scrap to a depth there let's say 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.400
 25 and 20 centimeters 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 then I insert these holes into this 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:19.020
 wood energy and on top 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 Well, the height should be two and a half 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.990
 three can and more meters at a height of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 land two and a half meters two two with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.890
 half how do i get them 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.890
 bind 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.240
 using there scotch wire 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 anything can be linked and we 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 it turns out such a pyramid then 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:59.530
 after each pole I land 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:03.960
 10 can be a little more than 12 about living rooms 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:11.860
 be sure to seed here in this circle 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:17.160
 diameter 30 40 centimeters all by nir 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:22.290
 idiot once or twice a season after 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.200
 germination of our plants necessarily 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.200
 such a standing weeding because the roots 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.540
 and the ambassador they are practically at 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.660
 on top 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:43.320
 winter and we must necessarily so weed 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:50.470
 so that our plants grow well but so 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:55.780
 incoming all that's all practically 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:00.430
 options and landing than this good method 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:06.160
 he saves us a landing square 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:09.520
 meter of land here let's say for a family of 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.290
 three or four people is enough 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.350
 Here we make these 2 3 and designs 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.120
 What else is good this method is that the structure 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.570
 very stable she practically 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.660
 there is no longer looking else 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.410
 advantage 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:39.180
 conditions of settling of plants improve 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.900
 insects and the third option than it 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:48.500
 Good thing in this design 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.500
 goes cross task itself plants 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.080
 the only drawback of this method 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:02.100
 what's the time when we do this 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:06.930
 design and when harvesting we must 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:10.530
 use a stool or let's say there 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.710
 a ladder but i think that's a comparison 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.940
 so that we save land 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:21.590
 we get a much better yield well 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:26.910
 many more advantages are nonsense 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.420
 so use apply to everyone 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.420
 success
