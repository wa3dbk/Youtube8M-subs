00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.280
 the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.289
 so 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.249
 but after they are active 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.249
 I am one of the two female master chefs in the Netherlands 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.679
 I have my own company that first came to this site 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.460
 and it is easier for starters to inspire people about everything on taste 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 area 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939
 experience there 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 authenticity 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.300
 and so I give and then multi-headed 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.890
 inspiration sessions good football players 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.270
 and i have a a beach 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.719
 the only restaurant in a balloon only in the world 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 and that has the circle times 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.180
 but we are now my taste studio 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.260
 and taste of the race in inspiring space 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.220
 where people can brainstorm and know things during a brainstorm 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.460
 techniques to say a kind of thinking how to get into blankets faster 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.310
 to generate 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.740
 inspiration from my field 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.210
 because the natural thing you do the rest differently in the kitchen is after all 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.790
 can give people there is great fun 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.160
 but is also very limited is a very small world 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.870
 and I actually wanted to 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.510
 and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.110
 the conditions and tell about the stories behind taste 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 and therefore really give the people an experience 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 water klien year is speed 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.780
 precisely because I am not my own at diagnosis largest 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.320
 often the project is what I am there and what I have done 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.170
 and the players proof 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.590
 that are at times 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.000
 have a crush 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.880
 then very often the fantasies and ideas that ended up in the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.100
 fridge say 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.750
 do they think it is crazy or the triumph woman 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.570
 that is the trunk arm to do or 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 people think that time is not before and you name it 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.000
 yes, I had an eye on my loved one of course all the exercises 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.589
 developments 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.309
 not only 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.339
 from the Netherlands of course from all over the world 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.379
 he possessed all preparations of alcohol techniques 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.639
 the acquisition also includes the bicycle 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.239
 Celebrate the F16 with head and shoulders and 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.139
 ball for the culinary but want to spend money 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.599
 he was already very close to couture of countries 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.559
 especially attracted to the Japanese as well but also agreements between 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:38.889
 countries like 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.990
 faith no more parliament 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.389
 Laos 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.159
 the dissolved in it how much 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.590
 that happens in the sense of preparedness 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.999
 and also fortis time and 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.459
 individuality the purity 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.519
 the 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.589
 but more important is to discover your own identity 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.490
 because is actually greatest power 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.229
 that companies and people have in them 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:06.029
 to be distinctive in order to renovate and 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.010
 and invisible and to excite people around you 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.459
 If your imagination you just don't leave 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.929
 but do something with it 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.759
 and the moment you finish when you take action 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.379
 it turns out eventually 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.680
 a lot is possible
