00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.660 

so<00:00:06.930> there's<00:00:07.140> roughly<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> billion<00:00:08.010> people

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
so there's roughly a billion people

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.850 
so there's roughly a billion people
to<00:00:09.940> clean<00:00:10.390> and<00:00:10.570> safe<00:00:10.690> drinking<00:00:11.230> water<00:00:11.410> and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
to clean and safe drinking water and

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.980 
to clean and safe drinking water and
because<00:00:12.220> of<00:00:12.250> that<00:00:12.370> many<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:12.850> them<00:00:13.030> get<00:00:13.719> sick

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
because of that many of them get sick

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.870 
because of that many of them get sick
get<00:00:14.650> diarrhea<00:00:14.920> and<00:00:15.130> would<00:00:15.250> even<00:00:15.490> die<00:00:15.639> from

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
get diarrhea and would even die from

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.750 
get diarrhea and would even die from
some<00:00:16.240> pathogens<00:00:16.750> within<00:00:16.990> water<00:00:17.230> and<00:00:17.800> so<00:00:18.010> for

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
some pathogens within water and so for

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.730 
some pathogens within water and so for
years<00:00:19.150> people<00:00:19.510> have<00:00:19.660> been<00:00:19.840> looking<00:00:19.990> for<00:00:20.349> very

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
years people have been looking for very

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.890 
years people have been looking for very
cost<00:00:21.160> effective<00:00:21.640> methods<00:00:22.029> of<00:00:22.270> treating<00:00:22.660> water

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
cost effective methods of treating water

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.690 
cost effective methods of treating water
and<00:00:23.260> one<00:00:23.770> of<00:00:23.890> the<00:00:24.099> most<00:00:24.400> cost-effective

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
and one of the most cost-effective

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.000 
and one of the most cost-effective
method<00:00:25.300> is<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.720> Saudis<00:00:26.080> method<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.680> Saudis

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
method is the Saudis method the Saudis

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.290 
method is the Saudis method the Saudis
method<00:00:27.310> stands<00:00:27.580> for<00:00:27.789> solar<00:00:28.029> water

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
method stands for solar water

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.369 
method stands for solar water
disinfection<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.920> use<00:00:30.190> clear<00:00:31.180> plastic

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:31.379 
disinfection you use clear plastic

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.570 
disinfection you use clear plastic
bottles<00:00:32.379> like<00:00:32.529> this<00:00:32.680> fill<00:00:33.340> them<00:00:33.430> up<00:00:33.520> with

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
bottles like this fill them up with

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.790 
bottles like this fill them up with
water<00:00:33.730> about<00:00:34.270> 3/4<00:00:34.750> full<00:00:34.780> shake<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.680> put

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
water about 3/4 full shake it to put

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.590 
water about 3/4 full shake it to put
some<00:00:35.949> oxygen<00:00:36.070> in<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.580> water<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:36.970> then<00:00:37.480> place

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
some oxygen in the water and then place

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.780 
some oxygen in the water and then place
them<00:00:37.870> in<00:00:37.930> direct<00:00:38.320> sunlight<00:00:38.530> for<00:00:38.890> 6<00:00:39.129> hours<00:00:39.400> on

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
them in direct sunlight for 6 hours on

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.410 
them in direct sunlight for 6 hours on
their<00:00:39.970> side

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
their side

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.320 
their side
and<00:00:40.720> as<00:00:41.410> long<00:00:41.739> as<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.100> water<00:00:42.339> is<00:00:42.640> clear<00:00:43.150> enough

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
and as long as the water is clear enough

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.750 
and as long as the water is clear enough
it<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.989> combination<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.650> UV<00:00:45.010> radiation<00:00:45.159> the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
it the combination of UV radiation the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.920 
it the combination of UV radiation the
thermal<00:00:46.059> radiation<00:00:46.150> that<00:00:46.540> kills<00:00:46.809> the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
thermal radiation that kills the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.270 
thermal radiation that kills the
pathogens<00:00:47.409> and<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.559> water<00:00:47.710> it<00:00:47.830> makes<00:00:47.860> it<00:00:48.129> safe

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
pathogens and the water it makes it safe

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.829 
pathogens and the water it makes it safe
to<00:00:48.430> drink<00:00:48.460> so<00:00:49.059> this<00:00:49.210> has<00:00:49.330> already<00:00:49.510> been<00:00:49.690> rolled

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
to drink so this has already been rolled

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.660 
to drink so this has already been rolled
out<00:00:50.080> to<00:00:50.620> millions<00:00:50.830> of<00:00:50.979> people<00:00:51.070> all<00:00:51.309> over<00:00:51.339> the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
out to millions of people all over the

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.100 
out to millions of people all over the
world<00:00:51.699> it's<00:00:52.510> very<00:00:52.600> effective<00:00:53.229> if<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.400> have

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
world it's very effective if you have

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.020 
world it's very effective if you have
relatively<00:00:56.110> pure<00:00:56.530> relatively<00:00:57.489> transparent

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
relatively pure relatively transparent

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.719 
relatively pure relatively transparent
water<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.690> begin<00:00:58.989> with<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.100> what<00:01:00.699> our

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
water to begin with and so what our

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.910 
water to begin with and so what our
research<00:01:01.180> looked<00:01:01.479> at<00:01:01.629> is<00:01:01.839> what<00:01:02.140> about<00:01:02.379> for<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
research looked at is what about for the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.289 
research looked at is what about for the
people<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.250> don't<00:01:03.610> have<00:01:03.699> clear<00:01:04.000> water<00:01:04.180> that

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
people that don't have clear water that

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.140 
people that don't have clear water that
have<00:01:04.510> turbid<00:01:04.869> water<00:01:05.049> that's<00:01:05.290> dirty

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
have turbid water that's dirty

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.010 
have turbid water that's dirty
particularly<00:01:07.150> in<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.270> developing<00:01:07.630> world<00:01:07.690> in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
particularly in the developing world in

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.090 
particularly in the developing world in
tropical<00:01:08.320> regions<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:09.549> have<00:01:09.580> areas<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:11.100> clays

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
tropical regions you have areas of clays

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.099 
tropical regions you have areas of clays
high<00:01:12.369> activity<00:01:12.580> clays<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.000> get<00:01:13.450> suspended

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
high activity clays that get suspended

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.499 
high activity clays that get suspended
in<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.439> water<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:15.100> make<00:01:15.369> it<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:15.969> that<00:01:16.180> this

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
in the water and make it so that this

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.940 
in the water and make it so that this
method<00:01:16.840> doesn't<00:01:16.960> work<00:01:17.079> so<00:01:17.469> you<00:01:17.560> can<00:01:17.680> think<00:01:17.799> of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
method doesn't work so you can think of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.380 
method doesn't work so you can think of
the<00:01:18.100> pathogens<00:01:18.609> is<00:01:18.729> sort<00:01:18.909> of<00:01:18.939> hiding

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
the pathogens is sort of hiding

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.749 
the pathogens is sort of hiding
underneath<00:01:19.630> dirt<00:01:19.960> particles<00:01:20.409> a<00:01:20.619> UV<00:01:21.280> radiation

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
underneath dirt particles a UV radiation

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.249 
underneath dirt particles a UV radiation
can't<00:01:21.969> hit<00:01:22.090> them<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.359> so<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.719> just<00:01:22.960> doesn't

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
can't hit them and so it just doesn't

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.349 
can't hit them and so it just doesn't
function<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:24.520> our<00:01:24.609> research<00:01:24.759> looked<00:01:25.210> at

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
function and so our research looked at

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.440 
function and so our research looked at
another<00:01:25.840> cheap<00:01:26.649> highly<00:01:27.640> deploy<00:01:28.149> of<00:01:28.329> all

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
another cheap highly deploy of all

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.330 
another cheap highly deploy of all
highly<00:01:28.840> generalizable<00:01:29.439> method<00:01:29.799> i've<00:01:30.219> been

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
highly generalizable method i've been

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.889 
highly generalizable method i've been
able<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.609> reduce<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.329> turbidity<00:01:31.570> in<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
able to reduce the turbidity in the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.179 
able to reduce the turbidity in the
water<00:01:32.079> so<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.439> people<00:01:32.679> could<00:01:32.799> use<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:33.070> so

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
water so that people could use the so

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.819 
water so that people could use the so
ease<00:01:33.310> method<00:01:33.609> and<00:01:34.149> what<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.170> specifically

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
ease method and what we specifically

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.789 
ease method and what we specifically
looked<00:01:36.100> at<00:01:36.219> was<00:01:36.579> using<00:01:36.939> salt<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:37.990> salt<00:01:38.350> to

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
looked at was using salt so salt to

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.649 
looked at was using salt so salt to
common<00:01:39.189> everyday<00:01:39.369> table<00:01:39.729> salt<00:01:39.909> you<00:01:40.149> have<00:01:40.270> some

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
common everyday table salt you have some

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.529 
common everyday table salt you have some
at<00:01:40.780> home<00:01:40.990> when<00:01:41.890> added<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.579> water<00:01:42.939> with<00:01:43.270> high

fallout<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.289> suspension<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:51.100> then<00:01:51.460> you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
fallout of the suspension and then you

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.160 
fallout of the suspension and then you
can<00:01:52.030> kind<00:01:52.299> of<00:01:52.359> take<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.600> clean<00:01:52.780> water<00:01:52.929> off<00:01:53.109> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
can kind of take the clean water off the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.959 
can kind of take the clean water off the
top<00:01:53.409> put<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.100> Saudis<00:01:54.460> bottle<00:01:54.789> and

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
top put it in the Saudis bottle and

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.330 
top put it in the Saudis bottle and
you're<00:01:55.450> gonna<00:01:55.539> go<00:01:55.749> and<00:01:56.109> so<00:01:56.289> our<00:01:56.499> research

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
you're gonna go and so our research

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.700 
you're gonna go and so our research
showed<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.060> absolutely<00:01:58.270> works<00:01:59.170> first<00:01:59.560> of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
showed that it absolutely works first of

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.039 
showed that it absolutely works first of
all<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.039> we<00:02:00.759> also<00:02:00.939> wanted<00:02:01.359> the<00:02:01.630> salt<00:02:01.869> content

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
all and we also wanted the salt content

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.840 
all and we also wanted the salt content
of<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.350> water<00:02:02.409> afterwards<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.310> our<00:02:03.399> goal<00:02:03.819> was

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
of the water afterwards and our goal was

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.580 
of the water afterwards and our goal was
to<00:02:04.030> try<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.329> get<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.689> absolute<00:02:04.990> minimal

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
to try to get the absolute minimal

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.840 
to try to get the absolute minimal
amount<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.829> salt<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.159> you'd<00:02:06.310> have<00:02:06.429> to<00:02:06.579> add<00:02:06.700> to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
amount of salt that you'd have to add to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.609 
amount of salt that you'd have to add to
the<00:02:06.939> water<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.749> specific<00:02:08.170> type<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.319> clay<00:02:08.560> in

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
the water of a specific type of clay in

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.100 
the water of a specific type of clay in
a<00:02:08.830> specific<00:02:09.069> kind<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.700> density<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.479> order<00:02:10.929> to

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
a specific kind of density in order to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.170 
a specific kind of density in order to
not<00:02:11.830> only<00:02:12.010> reduce<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.370> cost<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.000> want<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
not only reduce the cost so you want to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.580 
not only reduce the cost so you want to
use<00:02:13.270> as<00:02:13.420> much<00:02:13.510> salt<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:13.990> also<00:02:14.140> make<00:02:14.410> sure<00:02:14.440> that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
use as much salt but also make sure that

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.530 
use as much salt but also make sure that
the<00:02:14.860> salt<00:02:15.160> content<00:02:15.370> was<00:02:15.730> safe<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.300> human

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the salt content was safe for human

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.610 
the salt content was safe for human
consumption

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
consumption

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.400 
consumption
the<00:02:17.950> good<00:02:18.129> news<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.459> we<00:02:18.640> found<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:19.690> several<00:02:20.200> of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
the good news is we found in several of

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.650 
the good news is we found in several of
the<00:02:20.530> different<00:02:20.830> samples<00:02:21.450> depending<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.540> what

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the different samples depending on what

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.420 
the different samples depending on what
type<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.810> clay<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.200> was<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.680> how<00:02:23.860> much<00:02:23.920> there

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
type of clay it was and how much there

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.339 
type of clay it was and how much there
was<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.849> water<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.720> salt<00:02:26.110> concentration

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
was in the water the salt concentration

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.470 
was in the water the salt concentration
was<00:02:26.890> less<00:02:27.040> than<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.400> Gatorade<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.269> it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
was less than that of Gatorade so it's

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.320 
was less than that of Gatorade so it's
safe<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.900> drink<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:30.280> makes<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:30.700> method

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
safe to drink and it makes this method

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.240 
safe to drink and it makes this method
of<00:02:31.420> cleaning<00:02:31.660> drinking<00:02:32.080> water<00:02:32.260> actually<00:02:32.830> fine

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
of cleaning drinking water actually fine

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.699 
of cleaning drinking water actually fine
there's<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.910> very<00:02:34.480> easy<00:02:34.810> method<00:02:35.049> to<00:02:35.379> determine

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
there's a very easy method to determine

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.710 
there's a very easy method to determine
the<00:02:36.010> Trinity<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.459> water<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.299> makes<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.569> safe

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
the Trinity of water that makes it safe

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.990 
the Trinity of water that makes it safe
enough<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.230> drink<00:02:38.590> with<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.950> with<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.700> Saudis

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
enough to drink with the with the Saudis

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.420 
enough to drink with the with the Saudis
method<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.260> terminating<00:02:41.950> test<00:02:42.160> by

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
method and that's a terminating test by

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.979 
method and that's a terminating test by
reading<00:02:42.879> through<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.180> water<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:43.930> you

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
reading through the water and so you

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.500 
reading through the water and so you
place<00:02:44.440> your<00:02:44.980> water<00:02:45.220> bottle<00:02:45.610> over<00:02:45.970> top<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.180> say

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
place your water bottle over top of say

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.059 
place your water bottle over top of say
a<00:02:46.540> newsprint<00:02:46.989> if<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.379> can<00:02:47.500> read<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.769> headline

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
a newsprint if you can read the headline

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.460 
a newsprint if you can read the headline
then<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.849> means<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.630> turbidity<00:02:50.230> is

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
then that means that the turbidity is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.809 
then that means that the turbidity is
low<00:02:50.650> enough<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.160> Saudis<00:02:51.400> method<00:02:51.670> will<00:02:51.790> work

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
low enough the Saudis method will work

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.630 
low enough the Saudis method will work
and<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.690> can<00:02:53.049> do<00:02:53.440> experiments<00:02:53.950> with<00:02:54.160> water

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
and so you can do experiments with water

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.370 
and so you can do experiments with water
in<00:02:54.790> your<00:02:54.880> own<00:02:55.000> community<00:02:55.390> having<00:02:55.870> different

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
in your own community having different

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.289 
in your own community having different
levels<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.739> salt<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:57.910> working

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
levels of salt to it and then working

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.940 
levels of salt to it and then working
with<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.540> minimum<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.200> gives<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.560> enough

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
with a minimum one that gives you enough

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.009 
with a minimum one that gives you enough
clearness<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.760> make<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.180> method<00:03:01.840> work

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
clearness so to make the method work

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.110 
clearness so to make the method work
it's<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.769> very<00:03:03.010> simple<00:03:03.220> technology<00:03:03.549> but<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.030> a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
it's a very simple technology but it's a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.150 
it's a very simple technology but it's a
technological<00:03:04.420> solution<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.410> really
