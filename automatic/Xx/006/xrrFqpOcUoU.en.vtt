00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.280

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.120
 joe bring another different video to 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.790
 you 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.920
 in the last video is a tip of the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.080
 different there about the game I brought 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.279
 combinations to start the video only 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.950
 I had a cold 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.840
 So I think this is something like the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.020
 of the recording asks for forgiveness and also 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.700
 I'm going to explain is the whole Saturday will have 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.399
 there he is, I will not do it online 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.120
 during the week because the 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.800
 online 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.870
 It's very unstable, but you can play. 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.390
 usually I need some time to 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.739
 bring a cool tip for you guys is just 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.090
 the online mode 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.239
 then you might paint during the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:54.219
 week but Saturday will be the focus of 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.109
 tip I'm formaçã team that you're 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.269
 will play the team different then all 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.600
 Saturday to itabom online mode from 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.760
 Olympics has returned to the focus of video today 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.809
 I'll bring pre-defined tactics to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.930
 you 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.690
 before you start just to simplify 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.300
 talca pre- defined tactics here 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.060
 in fact it speaks there that this rate 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.770
 predefined in the middle of the game you can 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.710
 change your training 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.280
 your strategy and team styles 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.530
 so I mean you can from the water pro 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.320
 wine during the ii during the same game 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.330
 is for example cited took five and not 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.120
 made a goal that was in the car is a 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.040
 difficult opponent you want booms and 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.680
 want to keep possession of the ball then you can 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.750
 You change it during the game, there you 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.500
 it says you can use up to 4 in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.100
 time is to set presets such as you 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.930
 you can use one at a time in the course 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.120
 you can toggle to change change is 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.620
 to switch freely between the tactics I 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.050
 explain to you too 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.080
 but away and optimally apply and 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.150
 that I found and that I think more 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.530
 valid for you to use this type of 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.660
 function of the ball 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.960
 the first pre-defined tactic I 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.569
 put 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.330
 Is this rate any tactic you can? 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.270
 but the first one I think has to be 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.300
 all to attack or against quick attack 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.980
 because the first is the first 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.970
 initiative and is scared to your 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.500
 adversary 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.720
 so you have to put everyone 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.140
 for beauty front 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.940
 tactical psychologist puts the strategy 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.319
 and you can change something that 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.360
 I can not move that more to 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.430
 front kick a video showing if this 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.980
 really change something not 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.959
 the first tactic of ours is going 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.800
 be all to attack the training you 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.900
 choose 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.390
 I put one with three attackers two 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.330
 to be well for the same agent attack 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.120
 scare the opponent in the beginning beauty at 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.820
 second tactic will be the same as me 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.209
 I went to attack and managed to score a goal 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.790
 but I realized that the guy is hit 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.650
 I realized that the guy plays well so I go 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.780
 do what I'm going to dominate the ball then 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.390
 which congested the midfield there 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.120
 leave only one striker in front and 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.820
 I used the ball to try to play 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.220
 the ball in the middle field is fooling him 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.760
 there in the kitchen in the game such that I know 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.390
 that a counter attack he can kill me is 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:26.690
 o can kill the game to tie or even turn 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.100
 It's good and the last one is 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.130
 you can use during the game 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.269
 person that I'm going to show only those three 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.269
 defense methods 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.480
 You went to the attack and sent everything 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.959
 world 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.730
 the attack did not resolve was for example the 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.010
 from the message was noticed in the attack 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.870
 not resolved or you just scored and if 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.519
 realized that the car is very good face if 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.160
 did that goal need to hold 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.620
 if you're going to keep touching the ball 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.180
 or getting painted on the attack does not go away 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.829
 take a goal anyway 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.780
 Everyone else to defend, then put 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.510
 all in the defense remembering that it can be 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.090
 different in your Portuguese no 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.450
 portugal is in the European game 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.160
 and all the defense obviously when you 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.580
 send everyone to the defense you have to 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.500
 change the tactic and here's the one 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.780
 tactic that puts everyone in defense 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.880
 It even rains here, I'll give you it here. 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.180
 congestion defense there the maximum 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.729
 possible of this was that the pre set 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.620
 so stay put like this made a good fast game 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.389
 all attacking my first to 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.860
 try to make a goal already impose my game 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.830
 against the opponent 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.840
 I made the goal I want to control him and that 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.720
 or else I've already done two to zero I want 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.770
 control I will command to dominate 2 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.360
 ball possession 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:47.330
 all the time I hit a goal I want it 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.550
 draw everyone to defense 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.260
 Beauty that is already congested and white 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.020
 fan made and congested in fact I 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.380
 I put six players inside the area 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.690
 just to get a possible contract 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.280
 one that will almost not happen and 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.810
 possession of the ball and dominate possession of the ball 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.470
 You have to have the most amount in the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.560
 midfield is good and all attack 23 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.080
 attacker is or you can fix to you 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.030
 put two half-attackers that's where it ends 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.880
 your choice the chemist that really matters 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.610
 This is it, folks, the strategy is okay. 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.070
 well come on then in the game now I will 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.440
 show already defined already put the pre 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.660
 Pro ball game settings to show the 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.660
 you how changes is simple're 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.830
 in fact for you to switch di from one 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.450
 strategy for another you only need 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.560
 push where you ask up and down 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.870
 for example 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.000
 I started to play standing again in case it is 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.190
 the analogue is there depends how you 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.500
 uses throws in the store game asks 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.220
 ask those who do not know the crisis then 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.590
 beauty 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.630
 I started the game there, I put two 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.020
 times in store already start at 1 is 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:02.020
 obviously a beauty I'm going to pro 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.420
 attack and that kind of thing I already noticed passed the 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.010
 playing time I already realized that I will have 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.920
 that hold the ball this guy has to 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.620
 to play in the middle 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.950
 already changed for two are focused because the 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.510
 shop down where it asks down 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.580
 remembering it depends on your 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.090
 beauty settings 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.070
 I already scored a goal is already taking our 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.080
 focus of the guy I want to hold the tie 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.380
 because if I lose we will lose a lot 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:33.490
 point sends three analog down 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:36.460
 there everything is already in the boom if you can 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.450
 See that after you press start 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.710
 now I'm going to push star to the boom 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.020
 can see that the tactic changes 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:48.310
 automatically during the game is all in 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.340
 real - time okay I'll move to second 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.640
 tactic that is in possession of ball returned in the 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.590
 second back you can see how the 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.470
 player is already starting to move 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.330
 That's it, I think it will take a little bit 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.700
 for it to fit right into position 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.610
 chosen but you come here plan of 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.510
 game to the already changed to dominate the possession 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.700
 ball 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.750
 there too with a good attack if I 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.810
 back to one 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.460
 if I press start now it has already changed 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.330
 for everyone to attack everyone 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.320
 attack 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.610
 just wait for your team to stand 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.740
 The beauty of the tip is when you have 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.140
 changing from a strategy to 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.940
 another tries to return the ball from the goalie to 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.280
 everybody fit or take the ball 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.770
 outside, do not play ball out 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.030
 everybody's back in their place 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.820
 there in the field 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.510
 beauty then personal this was the video of 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.669
 today 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.040
 I hope you are enjoying it. 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.600
 of that 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.670
 tips I've been bringing to the channel 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.290
 will paint much more about the game 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.080
 put the comments if you want to see 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.850
 something different from some different theme 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.320
 I have not yet approached, I have a lot of 

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.160
 something to bring about the lousy thing 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.780
 talk about goalkeepers foul penalties 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.900
 I know it is improving throughout the 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.610
 time and konami make sure it goes 

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.010
 launch new updates there to let 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.380
