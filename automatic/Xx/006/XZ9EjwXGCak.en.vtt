 proposals today I bring you reviews of a 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.810
 I play a very good game I liked 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.670
 at stake I think it's the most 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.130
 free redeemable from the beach storm 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.600
 I just got out does not have much maybe 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.260
 It has a few hours but good 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.900
 designs got not now not good it 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.270
 llama smash valdez rising this game of 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.520
 what it's about is like a guy need for speed 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.110
 I do not know if they have played it but good what 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.850
 try to make your desmadre and flee 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.920
 You can also do careers 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.260
 chaos and flee or whatever it is all about 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.430
 make chaos and run away so good to 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.650
 see let's see 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.070
 well here are this is how like the menu 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.170
 this is the one of challenges that is the things 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.960
 what you have to do here are all 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.280
 your cars that according to some the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.629
 blocking bases make up the level 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.629
 others with money 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 to see in this case I will take up 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.559
 the fucking truck is 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.199
 these 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.820
 and well in game modes what are 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.799
 destruction that is obviously destroying 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.590
 my career you make a race against 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.299
 other other cars and you have to get to 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.799
 the goal without your car being destroyed 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.860
 it's a total runaway van flavors of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.110
 description give you 3 this as two items 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 that help you just so one at the beginning 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 you have to unlock the other two 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.280
 what you see there are what are the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.299
 also so to speak the missions and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.979
 nobody gives them with the description of 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.299
 video the game because I know that many 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.759
 you will like it has very good 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.820
 graphics as you see the joke is to do your 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.119
 Desmadre not try and do not destroy you 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.710
 the car ai wei make up the crashes and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.240
 you are taking life but what more you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.399
 Take away life are the shocks you make 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.119
 against the retaining walls when 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.729
 you hit cars or the same 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.319
 policemen who are following you almost not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.700
 they take away life as I tell them what they 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.380
 it removes life more than anything are the walls of 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.630
 containment if your car is reached 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 destroy will give them an option to steal a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.800
 car that is something very good not for 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.929
 follow if you stay a ravine there if 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.579
 you are mothers because you die there if you no longer 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.120
 you can climb you can not run away from the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.370
 death 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.770
 but in circus I will not kill 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.140
 but if he kills me key in hand I do not 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.840
 kill or destroy the car the mate already 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.790
 have a choice that mother 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.239
 then they give you or they have no forgiveness of salt and 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.530
 have a choice to steal another 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.019
 car because it prevents me from stealing a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.720
 armored vehicle and so you follow your 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.730
 level two missions that is if it is destroyed 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.129
 your car is not fart 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.170
 you continue with him and that 's what 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.970
 you have to do is steal a car and 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.349
 right there appears what is not no 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.849
 works on the side of the car 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.769
 they simply make the option to steal 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.599
 wayne a car stolen cars and then 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.730
 continue in your chaos now realize 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.110
 and a little arrow and the beginning touch a 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.180
 point of color where mothers although of 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.140
 colors of blue now that point of color 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.769
 blue is how he is like I do not say like 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.769
 a point d 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 of ends 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.130
 it's like the little arrow is the last one down 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.080
 flechita that turning around 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.110
 me that's the place where they have to not 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.820
 it's like your spam point or something or for 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.600
 save a text in more than anything 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.600
 to my mother 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.750
 see we can steal one for yes 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.550
 we have to go to that place nothing more 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.040
 Band-aid I'm here in this mother 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.210
 I do not know how to get out the problem that if 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.920
 you get lost in the city you have to 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.990
 look for the exit and sometimes you are very very 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.840
 away from her but good the joke is to go 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.320
 that little arrow touch the blue dot or 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.820
 you have powers you can destroy cars in 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.890
 the cops when they approach you and everything 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.360
 is very good game even though 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.820
 it's by screen stop as well as it 's 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.520
 also dorita I also loved 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.460
 for the same reason they will not see the time and 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.390
 I think it's going to be until 11 here 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.040
 not here in 1080p I think but badly 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.510
 agreement but it's a game that's going 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.100
 entertain not more than anything by the prick 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.200
 destruction that it makes is almost almost 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.430
 destroy all we go for some things 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.140
 as the containment fences that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.940
 I say this if you can not destroy 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.440
 make the cake but it is that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.790
 arrows indicates me backwards but if 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.250
 I'm going backwards I'm going back to the 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.660
 city and in the city I will not be able 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.310
 destroy nothing good is that there is water 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.530
 they have the police pinches of nothing 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.690
 as you go destroying or if you go up 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.240
 star finally I have this right now 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.150
 police that is how I think that 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.039
 it's not police it's like that of government of 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.419
 there arrive the freed ones of her it leaves 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.580
 a helicopter and which one will start you 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.690
 shoot and all that I hope to see and 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.520
 it's because my career is going to destroy 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.210
 and I think it's the last car that I 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.080
 let them grab when you hit the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.080
 center a few fences of containment 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.190
 automatically destroys all 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.190
 cars that are around 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.349
 let's crash against stones or something like that 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.990
 around here it should be possible stable 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.789
 containment if I play for the center 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.090
 disoriented you have to also be 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.169
 Master I is not down holiness 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.270
 the point arrived 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.949
 to the shit ah already arrived armored 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.760
 came the miners those are the 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.360
 armored 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.360
 and today 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.540
 shit 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.680
 from black general black literally 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.080
 we are a black because here is the point 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.690
 that they have to the next point where 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.690
 it is no longer 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.820
 with the description of the video appear 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.710
 the team that is a movie I do not know 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.110
 because I really did not read when I saw the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.700
 I had with the van that I bought but 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.810
 well the game is totally free in 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.890
 the projector I leave the link to 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.690

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.260
 recommendation of the week a game 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.090
 also apart from spider-man that good 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.220
 I hope you like it, you know if you want 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.169
 I always form a chain on the beach 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.000
 store when they enter agree 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.919
 comment on whoever comes not for me 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.600
 on the beach to be there in the game if 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.820
 they like they can comment and make a 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.680
 chain in those games not because you should 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.540
 be successful when they always put the 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.610
 same person but good I am the grime 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.720
 try to say goodbye see you until the 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.139
