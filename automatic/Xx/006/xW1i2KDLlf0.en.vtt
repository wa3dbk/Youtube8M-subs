00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.470
 good afternoon dear friends on the review 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.899
 today is a knife from accomplishing 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.860
 the model is called the crown there is another model 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.099
 called crown 2 but smaller is 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.929
 more model they are the same in their 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.220
 so let's say the appearance of the contours 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.840
 just vary in size but this is something 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 what can be called a style made but 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.230
 the style of such a gentlemanly folder on 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 whom unlike in general 13 vile 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.570
 folder usually does not assume 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.399
 clips here she is but she only 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.140
 one position is not rearranged only 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:47.090
 in a position generally to the right with the tip up 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.379
 in the right pocket point up materials 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.850
 here we have a bolster such from 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:02.550
 stainless steel and black mykarta 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:06.330
 the main part of the handle 8 chrome 13 on 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.180
 Toast standard stands for Chinese 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.240
 Kirsch ie we're such small 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.710
 little letters are not very so bashfully written 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.869
 Chayna 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:26.119
 he has a model number of 30 to 60 kopecks well 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:30.090
 here the cache is a blade like drop point 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.250
 concave descents almost ours 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.880
 somewhere may be 80 percent by 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.270
 height there is such a fake blade and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.049
 gets a round tip so very 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.049
 elegant 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.470
 that is, such a disi leg action 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.200
 lack of it could be that but apart 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 the fact that there is enough ordinary steel 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.310
 is that it is quite hefty Well 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.770
 how is it easier for example than the gut edge 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.840
 weighs less weighs but here he has 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 two stainless steel blaster and liners in 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.430
 principle not very fat but they are not present 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:20.570
 no sampling of any of these therefore 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:23.120
 they are also not lightweight well there is 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.770
 such a dark hole than here in 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.080
 general well that is remarkable in that the knife 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.200
 This is his price. He costs 15 on our site. 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.080
 dollars he comes in such here 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.340
 such blisters 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.020
 it is at once all information is extremely 30 and 60 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.940
 x it means the blister packaging 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:49.220
 because there are just 30 and 60 this in 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.730
 box 3 feet basic as though it is 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.040
 that it opens manually that is 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.270
 no safe is sleeping there is no assistant 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 liner lock 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.420
 clip in one position well here 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.640
 written steel 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.900
 that 8 chrome 13 satin finish and on 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.170
 grip 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:20.610
 kusakina satin finish steel also 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:23.189
 polyp polished mikarta 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.709
 copy I took him to the Crimea because 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:30.870
 that my younger brother had him 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.959
 also inexpensive kershaw knife 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.819
 nerves he lost his general somewhere he 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.890
 asked me to fuck 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:43.739
 how if some inexpensive 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.290
 legs you lay it to me that while he 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.700
 did not give you walked without a knife and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.959
 ok he had u now lost a mouse 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.519
 and now as if 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:56.010
 The proposal may be generally such 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.409
 the knife below will be in the description will be 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.359
 a reference to the page in principle for such 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.859
 small money can be obtained 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.700
 quite attractive looking 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.099
 looking if anyone can, in principle, not 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.000
 will scare others 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.000
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
