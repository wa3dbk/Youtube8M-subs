important<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.060> class<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.450> definitely<00:02:48.870> good

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
important this class is definitely good

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.839 
important this class is definitely good
for<00:02:49.049> capturing<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.950> being<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.400> places<00:02:50.819> that

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
for capturing and being in places that

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.220 
for capturing and being in places that
it<00:02:51.060> needs<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.329> be<00:02:51.450> quickly<00:02:51.750> because<00:02:52.140> i

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
it needs to be quickly because i

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.900 
it needs to be quickly because i
designed<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.829> very<00:02:53.099> quick<00:02:53.430> character

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
designed it to be a very quick character

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.610 
designed it to be a very quick character
finally<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.629> rampages<00:02:55.200> one<00:02:55.410> which

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
finally we have rampages one which

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.990 
finally we have rampages one which
essentially<00:02:55.920> does<00:02:56.129> this<00:02:56.220> thing<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.489> war<00:02:56.730> horn

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
essentially does this thing as war horn

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.520 
essentially does this thing as war horn
does<00:02:57.209> but<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:57.690> also<00:02:57.840> increases<00:02:58.140> your<00:02:58.409> attack

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
does but it also increases your attack

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
does but it also increases your attack
speed<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.459> what's<00:02:59.700> cool<00:02:59.940> about<00:03:00.000> having<00:03:00.450> both

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
speed now what's cool about having both

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.420 
speed now what's cool about having both
of<00:03:00.780> these<00:03:00.959> skills<00:03:01.349> you<00:03:01.769> activate<00:03:02.129> call<00:03:02.310> the

of these skills you activate call the
while<00:03:02.549> first<00:03:02.879> then<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.299> activate<00:03:03.720> rampages

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
while first then you activate rampages

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.170 
while first then you activate rampages
one<00:03:04.440> second<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.640> reactivate

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
one second and then you can reactivate

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.970 
one second and then you can reactivate
call<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.569> wild<00:03:06.780> again<00:03:07.170> that's<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.590> total<00:03:07.890> of

fifty<00:03:08.340> seconds<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.879> having<00:03:09.120> swiftness<00:03:09.420> might

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
fifty seconds of having swiftness might

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.229 
fifty seconds of having swiftness might
and<00:03:09.959> fury<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.409> all<00:03:10.799> at<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.220> same<00:03:11.400> time<00:03:11.670> that

and fury on all at the same time that

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.000 
and fury on all at the same time that
can<00:03:12.420> be<00:03:12.540> huge<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.049> fight<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.890> will

can be huge in a fight and it will

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.920 
can be huge in a fight and it will
definitely<00:03:14.370> give<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.760> cutting<00:03:15.120> edge<00:03:15.329> over

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
definitely give you a cutting edge over

definitely give you a cutting edge over
your<00:03:15.959> enemies<00:03:16.409> I<00:03:16.590> decided<00:03:16.980> use<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> short<00:03:17.669> bow

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
your enemies I decided use the short bow

is<00:03:17.970> my<00:03:18.120> second<00:03:18.480> weapon<00:03:18.599> because<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.410> traits

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
is my second weapon because with traits

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.170 
is my second weapon because with traits
it<00:03:19.950> definitely<00:03:20.250> becomes<00:03:20.549> more<00:03:20.730> important

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
it definitely becomes more important

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.120 
it definitely becomes more important
than<00:03:21.269> long<00:03:21.569> though<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.989> also<00:03:22.200> causes<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.799> lot<00:03:23.069> of

needs a lot of it causes bleed it causes
poison<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.980> will<00:03:29.280> then<00:03:29.430> also<00:03:29.669> give<00:03:29.940> you

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
poison it will then also give you

swiftness<00:03:30.389> which<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.109> huge<00:03:31.500> part<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.829> this

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
swiftness which is a huge part of this

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.890 
swiftness which is a huge part of this
build<00:03:32.160> it'll<00:03:32.519> cause<00:03:32.669> bleed<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.209> cripple<00:03:33.720> and

build it'll cause bleed and cripple and

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.020 
build it'll cause bleed and cripple and
finally<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.530> stunning<00:03:34.889> days<00:03:35.129> sadly

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
finally the stunning days sadly

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.390 
finally the stunning days sadly
marksmanship<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.720> namely<00:03:37.290> used<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.980> well

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
marksmanship is namely used for well

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.699 
marksmanship is namely used for well
marksmanship<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.359> that<00:03:40.290> means<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.650> you

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
marksmanship and that means that you

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.050 
marksmanship and that means that you
won't<00:03:40.889> be<00:03:40.980> getting<00:03:41.069> as<00:03:41.280> much<00:03:41.400> power<00:03:41.669> with<00:03:41.910> this

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
won't be getting as much power with this

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.460 
won't be getting as much power with this
build<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.540> needs<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:42.870> supplemented<00:03:43.410> in

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
build so it needs to be supplemented in

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.170 
build so it needs to be supplemented in
other<00:03:43.739> ways<00:03:43.889> however<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.519> did<00:03:44.730> find<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:45.030> way<00:03:45.060> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
other ways however I did find a way to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.270 
other ways however I did find a way to
at<00:03:45.359> least<00:03:45.510> get<00:03:45.720> 10<00:03:46.230> points<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.799> first<00:03:47.129> of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
at least get 10 points in it first of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.470 
at least get 10 points in it first of
all<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.430> thought<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.819> opening<00:03:48.150> strike<00:03:48.359> is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
all I thought that opening strike is

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.180 
all I thought that opening strike is
very<00:03:48.720> important<00:03:49.169> causing<00:03:49.709> random<00:03:49.829> me<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.069> be

very important causing random me to be

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.380 
and there's things that must have been
changed<00:06:56.130> or<00:06:56.250> that<00:06:56.550> it<00:06:56.640> doesn't<00:06:56.910> actually<00:06:57.000> work

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
changed or that it doesn't actually work

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.330 
changed or that it doesn't actually work
because<00:06:57.990> of<00:06:58.230> how<00:06:58.350> things<00:06:58.560> have<00:06:58.770> been<00:06:58.800> changed

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
because of how things have been changed

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.550 
because of how things have been changed
finally<00:07:00.210> I<00:07:00.240> didn't<00:07:00.750> talk<00:07:00.960> about<00:07:01.170> the<00:07:01.290> pets

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
finally I didn't talk about the pets

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.100 
finally I didn't talk about the pets
because<00:07:02.160> it<00:07:02.880> would<00:07:03.000> have<00:07:03.090> made<00:07:03.150> a<00:07:03.210> video<00:07:03.450> even

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
because it would have made a video even

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.480 
because it would have made a video even
longer<00:07:04.350> so<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.860> pets<00:07:05.040> that<00:07:05.160> I<00:07:05.220> wouldn't

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
longer so the pets that I wouldn't
