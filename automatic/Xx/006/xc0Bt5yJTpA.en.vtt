flying<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.130> death<00:01:29.250> touch<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.970> that's<00:01:30.329> really

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
flying and death touch so that's really

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.649

like<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> repulse<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:35.820> something<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
take him down to nine so this is an

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.710 
take him down to nine so this is an
alternate<00:03:41.190> way<00:03:41.430> rather<00:03:42.000> than<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.390> rushing

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
alternate way rather than the rushing

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.569 
alternate way rather than the rushing
way<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.900> play<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.320> blue<00:03:43.500> deck<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:43.920> basically

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
way to play the blue deck is basically

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.789 
way to play the blue deck is basically
control<00:03:45.299> him<00:03:45.510> have<00:03:45.840> better<00:03:46.049> board<00:03:46.350> position

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
control him have better board position

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.060 
control him have better board position
and<00:03:47.070> then<00:03:47.370> win<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.329> game<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.750> way<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.590> that's

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
and then win the game that way so that's

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.330 
and then win the game that way so that's
pretty<00:03:50.250> much<00:03:50.340> what<00:03:50.940> i'm<00:03:51.180> doing<00:03:51.480> right<00:03:51.600> now<00:03:51.750> and

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340

guard i'm just gonna cancel it and now

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.759 
guard i'm just gonna cancel it and now
he<00:03:57.690> has<00:03:57.810> nothing<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.140> do<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.440> there<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.680> he

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
he has nothing to do this there and he

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.199 
he has nothing to do this there and he
can<00:03:58.890> swing<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.130> for<00:03:59.370> two<00:03:59.489> if<00:03:59.610> he<00:03:59.700> wants<00:04:00.030> which

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
can swing it for two if he wants which

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.000 
can swing it for two if he wants which
i'm<00:04:00.480> sure<00:04:00.540> he<00:04:00.900> should<00:04:01.140> do<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.590> he's<00:04:01.739> for

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
i'm sure he should do because he's for

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.650 
i'm sure he should do because he's for
some<00:04:02.190> reason<00:04:02.400> he's<00:04:02.519> not<00:04:02.579> blocking<00:04:02.910> if<00:04:03.480> he<00:04:03.540> had

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
some reason he's not blocking if he had

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.180 
some reason he's not blocking if he had
just<00:04:03.810> blocked<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.380> mean<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.890> wouldn't<00:04:05.070> have

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
just blocked I mean it wouldn't have

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.890 
just blocked I mean it wouldn't have
been<00:04:05.250> right<00:04:05.459> smart<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.030> him<00:04:06.120> because<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.600> have

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
been right smart for him because I have

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.350 
been right smart for him because I have
trophic<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.380> missing<00:04:07.620> my<00:04:07.650> am<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:08.010> if<00:04:08.100> he<00:04:08.360> had

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
trophic and missing my am but if he had

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.560 
trophic and missing my am but if he had
just<00:04:09.570> blocked<00:04:10.160> drizzle<00:04:11.160> blues<00:04:11.370> turn<00:04:11.670> turn<00:04:12.299> one

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
just blocked drizzle blues turn turn one

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.479 
just blocked drizzle blues turn turn one
then<00:04:13.079> he<00:04:13.170> would<00:04:13.290> be<00:04:13.380> at<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.500> much<00:04:13.709> higher<00:04:13.739> life

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
then he would be at a much higher life

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.949 
then he would be at a much higher life
returned<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:14.910> or<00:04:15.209> whatever<00:04:15.359> whenever<00:04:15.750> he

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
returned to or whatever whenever he

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.440 
returned to or whatever whenever he
swung<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.410> another<00:04:17.130> counter<00:04:17.459> spell<00:04:17.669> but<00:04:17.940> this

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
swung in another counter spell but this

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.110 
swung in another counter spell but this
time<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.930> can<00:04:19.560> play<00:04:19.919> korova<00:04:20.549> can<00:04:20.700> mist<00:04:20.910> and

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
time I can play korova can mist and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.200 
time I can play korova can mist and
still<00:04:21.680> counterspell<00:04:22.729> maybe<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.820> should<00:04:24.090> have

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
still counterspell maybe I should have

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.240 
still counterspell maybe I should have
time<00:04:24.450> warped<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:24.990> turn<00:04:25.200> because<00:04:25.860> if<00:04:26.010> i<00:04:26.130> had

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
time warped this turn because if i had

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.320 
time warped this turn because if i had
time<00:04:26.430> warp<00:04:26.669> than<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.910> could<00:04:27.060> have<00:04:27.150> done<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
time warp than I could have done the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.680 
time warp than I could have done the
same

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
same

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.060 
same
second<00:04:28.140> main<00:04:28.230> phase<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.680> then<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.800> would<00:04:28.980> have

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
second main phase and then I would have

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.650 
second main phase and then I would have
been<00:04:29.160> fine<00:04:29.370> but<00:04:29.850> I'll<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:30.210> do<00:04:30.360> that<00:04:30.390> next

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
been fine but I'll just do that next

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.360 
been fine but I'll just do that next
turn<00:04:30.900> um<00:04:31.200> I<00:04:31.500> can<00:04:31.650> still<00:04:31.860> counterspell

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
turn um I can still counterspell

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.860 
turn um I can still counterspell

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
sure like for some reason there's a

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.320 
sure like for some reason there's a
glitch<00:04:43.860> there<00:04:44.160> sometimes<00:04:44.850> if<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.120> press<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
too fast and the connection isn't great

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.050 
too fast and the connection isn't great
then<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:50.040> don't<00:04:50.160> your<00:04:50.370> creature<00:04:50.760> doesn't

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
then you don't your creature doesn't

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.330 
then you don't your creature doesn't
select<00:04:51.300> they<00:04:51.660> just<00:04:51.870> like<00:04:51.990> unselect<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:52.980> then

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
select they just like unselect and then

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.830 
select they just like unselect and then
sometimes<00:04:53.700> you<00:04:53.790> press<00:04:54.000> triangle<00:04:54.270> too<00:04:54.600> quickly

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
sometimes you press triangle too quickly

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
have another counter spell so I'm still

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.110 
have another counter spell so I'm still
set<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:24.210> way<00:06:24.680> and<00:06:25.680> he's<00:06:26.250> only<00:06:26.400> at<00:06:26.610> three<00:06:26.910> life

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
set that way and he's only at three life

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.300 
set that way and he's only at three life
i'm<00:06:27.390> still<00:06:27.630> at<00:06:27.720> 15<00:06:28.140> I<00:06:28.500> don't<00:06:28.830> think<00:06:28.980> he<00:06:29.070> stands

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
i'm still at 15 I don't think he stands

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.480 
i'm still at 15 I don't think he stands
much<00:06:29.490> of<00:06:29.610> a<00:06:29.669> chance<00:06:30.290> but<00:06:31.290> I<00:06:31.350> mean<00:06:31.740> if<00:06:31.860> I<00:06:31.980> if<00:06:32.340> I

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
much of a chance but I mean if I if I

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.700 
much of a chance but I mean if I if I
had<00:06:32.610> just<00:06:32.640> drawn<00:06:33.169> repulse<00:06:34.169> in<00:06:34.380> that<00:06:34.500> have<00:06:34.620> been

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
had just drawn repulse in that have been

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.170 
had just drawn repulse in that have been
pretty<00:06:35.040> sick<00:06:35.220> but<00:06:35.490> I<00:06:35.520> guess<00:06:35.729> I<00:06:35.760> guess<00:06:36.090> he

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
pretty sick but I guess I guess he

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.820 
pretty sick but I guess I guess he
probably<00:06:36.300> has<00:06:36.570> the<00:06:36.660> counter<00:06:36.930> in<00:06:37.020> his<00:06:37.110> hand<00:06:37.289> so

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
probably has the counter in his hand so

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.469 
probably has the counter in his hand so
it<00:06:37.860> looks<00:06:38.070> like<00:06:38.130> he<00:06:38.340> drew<00:06:38.490> a<00:06:38.520> swamp<00:06:38.940> there<00:06:39.240> and

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
it looks like he drew a swamp there and

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.390 
it looks like he drew a swamp there and
he<00:06:39.570> still<00:06:39.810> has<00:06:40.050> a<00:06:40.380> counter

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
he still has a counter

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.249 
he still has a counter
maybe<00:06:41.729> on<00:06:42.180> something<00:06:42.540> else<00:06:42.690> in<00:06:42.780> this<00:06:42.870> and<00:06:43.050> not
