00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 You know that I will try by all 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.569
 means that you use is handkerchief 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.460
 pocket the poker square in your 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.290
 clothing for both the world of 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 business as for your leisure time 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
 and in those moments those who want to go a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.060
 little bit more special 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.550
 I am seeing boxes from Andalusia Spain 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.080
 I want to send you a sincere greeting and in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 this video we are going to dedicate to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.390
 explain exactly the measures that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.080
 You must must have a handkerchief 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.009
 pocket and especially details 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.210
 important that will help you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.210
 very much in your elegance 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.820
 I carry 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.820
 people nothing 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.070
 before going deeper into the subject of 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.620
 measurements and especially in the textures of 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.409
 the handkerchiefs I want to make you very clear 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.870
 first important concept a handkerchief 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.619
 pocket always have to carry the 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.110
 hand sewn edge as you will see in this 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.840
 image characteristic of the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.070
 Spaniards who are sewn by hand is that 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 edge cited turned that is needed to 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.619
 to be able to sew it these tips since 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.990
 I have been observing to sew it by hand 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.330
 look what a difference with a handkerchief 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.840
 it is machine sewn practically the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.569
 edge is completely completely 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 homogeneous and in addition the stitches are noticed 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:38.950
 machine-sewn a pocket handkerchief 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.950
 good and pretty also must carry that 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.049
 hand sewn edge with respect to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.720
 measures based on 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.049
 tissue characteristics usually vary 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.630
 quite for example while in 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.840
 silk we can find those 30 x 30 a 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.789
 square of 30 x 30 or 40 x 40 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.270
 it really seems like a measure 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.100
 excessive linen and cotton 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.789
 measurements are usually quite smaller 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.879
 for me the right thing would be that the handkerchief 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.280
 of pocket had 30 x 30 how are you 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.510
 seeing in this example although the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.349
 difference of 20 by 20 can also 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.810
 be a more interesting interesting measure of 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.110
 that amount I recommend almost that is 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.290
 better than what you send to your seamstress and 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.630
 and that they leave it exactly to that extent 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.000
 of 30 by 30 as I was telling you 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.340
 if we enter the world of 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.680
 patterns of handkerchief patterns 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.690
 here it is true that we do not have the limit 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.459
 of any kind we are currently 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.280
 moving in all the possible variety 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.420
 because I remember you in Europe the cloth of 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.319
 pocket is total trend and I mean 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.800
 that we can use small moles 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.500
 points 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.580
 flowers 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.490
 and even details that you can go yourself 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.650
 contributing if you have in mind any 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.930
 special combination for your handkerchiefs and 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.790
 you can not get it 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.290
 I recommend that you go to a store 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.480
 fabrics and buy the print or that 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.890
 type of motive that you want to take from a 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.050
 special way to combine it with 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.150
 some of your sets and you yourself 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.280
 make your pocket handkerchiefs like 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.800
 you know in this channel we always tell you 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.190
 that what the idea is that we show you 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.070
 they are all tendencies in europe well 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.520
 the biggest trend this year in europe 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.190
 is to play with the handkerchiefs that have 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.440
 Changed edges of color you can not 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.989
 or imagine the game so awful that you 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.420
 allows this model in relation to 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.180
 traditional models where we do not have 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.630
 that effect because you can show the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.720
 handkerchief well of a single color if what 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.760
 we use from the inside or 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.890
 playing with these colorful edges 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.170
 how are you seeing in the image that we 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.400
 allows many greater possibilities of 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.920
 combination 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.540
 tie and other features that 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.189
 I'll teach you in future videos how 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.379
 use certain references of your 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.320
 way of dressing so you can get him out 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.979
 much match in those combinations 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.739
 you know that for me it is very important 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.289
 abandon a video leaving you always a 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.100
 advice a recommendation a suggestion 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.410
 in this case the advice of today I want 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.610
 have it very present 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.150
 never combine the handkerchief to match the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.570
 tie never use the same pattern of 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.460
 tie tissue for the handkerchief 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.830
 even now that the handkerchief is 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.139
 entering with tremendous force inside 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.610
 of man's styling is very likely 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.639
 that in some places where it is 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.370
 beginning to get this trend that 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.460
 offer neckties and scarves to games 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.849
 discards them completely and gives a 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.389
 little knowledge of little 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.090
 style use that that way of 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.699
 combine even there are some other 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.470
 video on this channel in which from a 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.509
 shape 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.849
 we have dressed some person using 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.430
 that trend that I'm talking about 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.379
 but you have married me to the 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.030
 recommendation that arrived and eludes it by 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:28.750
 complete remember always try that the 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.030
 handkerchief of different fabric to and from 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.800
 different reasons to the tie never 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.930
 use the same colors and the same 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.810
 fabric patterns that you win 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.969
 very much in elegance our three 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.219
 great recommendations to conclude 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.469
 This video most likely after 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.129
 have seen it, have any doubt whatsoever 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.050
 suggestion 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.940
 maybe a good idea that you want 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.550
 transmit to us feel with full 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.349
 freedom to use the drawer that has 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.830
 the one below the comments drawer 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:59.370
 to get to transmit that idea 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.740
 or that suggestion that you possibly have 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.180
 come out of there a good video that we can 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.810
 share with all our friends 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.389
 our second recommendation is to give 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.060
 like like I like if this video 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.340

 and we are continually uploading videos 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.180
 new uploading content I recommend you 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.340
 that you subscribe to this channel because 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.350
