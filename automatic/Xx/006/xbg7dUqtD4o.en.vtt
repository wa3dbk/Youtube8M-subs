00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.259
 There are millions of round and square bales 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.809
 every year in the agricultural sector too 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 no matter whether from stoppelacker 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.580
 or from the grassland the bales must from 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.680
 field the transport trailers for this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.869
 Not only are they used 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180
 Capacities are very different 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.490
 Often the cars are not directly for 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.250
 the goods transport thought or anyway 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.500
 what the transport safety and built 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 the traffic rules challenge 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.390
 Professional solutions do not seldom double 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 facilitate the acquisition costs and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.370
 accelerate the jellyfish logistics but 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.629
 Huge as our test of the dpw with 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.629
 Load fuse shows 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.590
 the three-axle with ball slewing ring has 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.070
 a permissible total weight of 21 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.470
 metric tons 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.450
 the base is a standard platform 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.710
 trailer on this the load securing 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.020
 was built 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.320
 supporting frame parts were for this 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.050
 Reinforced series is the opening only 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.090
 an optional side members is the 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.030
 double-sided opening like ours 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.520
 test machine will be hydraulic first 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.530
 the load securing construction is about 40 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.570
 centimeters pushed upwards around the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.149
 side elements from the lock 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.649
 can then lift sockets 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.170
 the desired page opened 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.789
 over a small control panel is the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 respective function with one 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.619
 Toggle switch selected and then the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.430
 Control unit operates 2 double-acting 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.430
 is needed 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.180
 that Mr. distinguished and lock 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.680
 almost always worked easier without any problems 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.200
 we acted as us the 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.240
 Cargo securing of the distances something 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
 Adjust generous to the bale 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.179
 the lower locking sockets for 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.030
 the side elements can be between 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.160
 250 and 295 in a big hole basta 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.110
 adjust the width of the cargo 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.500
 parallel must then also the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.400
 side elements at the top across 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.040
 hydraulically but by eye 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.020
 be postponed 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.420
 Attention with empty trailer applies to the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.260
 of course, the maximum width of 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.260
 25 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.670
 Based on the film footage becomes clear 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.800
 how easy and fast a dare with 32 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.440
 Big pack is loaded and safely on 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.269
 The street is allowed but what if by 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.340
 Missing bales in the middle of the trailer 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.069
 There is an important keyword 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.290
 here is the closing as long as one 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.989
 level is completely filled corresponds 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.569
 this be the applicable regulations 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.000
 but round or square bales must be loose 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.890
 With straps to be secured for this 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.890
 are sufficient to the points available 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.750
 the wing dpw 210 bl has us the bales 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.970
 transport work enormously facilitates the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.360
 advantages regarding 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.640
 transport safety and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.680
 Capacity increase are obvious 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.570
 what in the discussion about a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.000
 such a car is often forgotten 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.950
 In addition, the improved occupational safety 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.220
 by the disappearance of wild ones 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.360
 climbs when decorating arises 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.610
 further assessments of this 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.020
 test machine read in april 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.020
 issue of their agricultural technology
