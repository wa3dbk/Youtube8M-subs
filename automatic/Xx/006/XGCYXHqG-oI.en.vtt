00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.019
 is I do here in A major're not 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.560
 singers sing is to do the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.579
 strong sun zinho falsetto that has her and 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.579
 now suffer but more so 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.650
 ef 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.930
 so let's start step by step 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.930
 to 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.130
 Hey 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.230
 the first sentence is not 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:31.969
 is again chooses to pick up the table 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.069
 It is easier for me to change 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:51.760
 now if I have strength in little finger like 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:02:09.260
 this one o exchange-exchange best attack of the 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:19.930
 proof just in time O okay but the surest 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:19.930
 It's you or the second part later. 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.190

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.060
 O 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.320
 He is not very complicated. 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.870
 issue that will work hard on your 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.920
 fingers here, then I trained a lot 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.920
 this part here 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.290
 and again 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.140
 and is 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.090
 certain sister june 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.190
 the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:46.480
 then we are the following base that 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:54.819
 she time there are two types of archetypes 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:58.319
 and then the following right here there is greater m 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.319
 It's easy, you think. 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:20.870
 It's ok then, who liked it? 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.670

 chicken and with that, then it's
