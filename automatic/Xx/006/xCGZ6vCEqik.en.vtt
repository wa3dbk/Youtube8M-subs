you recreate that for us well i started
the<00:01:31.450> design<00:01:31.780> thigh<00:01:32.049> basically<00:01:32.590> just<00:01:32.770> prepping

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
the design thigh basically just prepping

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.770 
the design thigh basically just prepping
the<00:01:33.250> nail<00:01:33.400> like<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.790> would<00:01:34.000> for<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.330> full<00:01:34.510> set

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
the nail like you would for a full set

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.340 
the nail like you would for a full set
and<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.490> forms<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.210> build<00:01:37.450> out<00:01:38.080> the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
and put the forms on to build out the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.230 
and put the forms on to build out the
free<00:01:38.560> edge<00:01:38.710> i<00:01:39.010> basically<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:39.790> built<00:01:40.180> the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
free edge i basically just built the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.350 
free edge i basically just built the
free<00:01:40.479> edge<00:01:40.600> with<00:01:40.869> clear<00:01:41.619> acrylic<00:01:41.909> only<00:01:42.909> at<00:01:43.090> the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
free edge with clear acrylic only at the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.960 
free edge with clear acrylic only at the
tip<00:01:43.540> not<00:01:44.049> on<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.439> bed<00:01:44.650> very<00:01:45.189> very<00:01:45.369> very<00:01:45.520> thin

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
tip not on the bed very very very thin

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.490 
tip not on the bed very very very thin
because<00:01:46.210> if<00:01:46.420> it's<00:01:46.540> built<00:01:46.720> too<00:01:46.930> high<00:01:47.110> then

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
because if it's built too high then

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.249 
because if it's built too high then
you'll<00:01:47.860> get<00:01:48.009> balding<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.700> your<00:01:49.090> design<00:01:49.990> and

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
you'll get balding in your design and

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.320 
you'll get balding in your design and
then<00:01:50.710> after<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.340> tips<00:01:51.520> were<00:01:51.610> all<00:01:51.790> built<00:01:52.119> out

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
then after the tips were all built out

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.300 
then after the tips were all built out
then<00:01:52.600> i<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.930> took<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.409> brick<00:01:53.860> colored

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
then i just took the brick colored

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.510 
then i just took the brick colored
acrylic<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:55.330> built<00:01:55.780> all<00:01:55.960> her<00:01:56.110> spots<00:01:56.409> using<00:01:57.220> an

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
acrylic and built all her spots using an

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.300 
acrylic and built all her spots using an
acetone<00:01:57.939> monomer<00:01:58.330> mixture<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.560> acetone<00:02:00.009> is

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
acetone monomer mixture the acetone is

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.330 
acetone monomer mixture the acetone is
to<00:02:01.240> help<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.720> acrylic<00:02:02.049> set<00:02:02.200> up<00:02:02.350> faster<00:02:02.799> that

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
to help the acrylic set up faster that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.999 
to help the acrylic set up faster that
way<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.720> lay<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.140> acrylic<00:02:05.590> down<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:05.890> the

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
way when you lay the acrylic down on the

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.850 
way when you lay the acrylic down on the
nail<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.460> doesn't<00:02:06.850> drip<00:02:07.570> or<00:02:07.780> move<00:02:08.470> too<00:02:08.829> much

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
nail it doesn't drip or move too much

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.650 
nail it doesn't drip or move too much
but<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:09.549> have<00:02:09.700> just<00:02:09.970> enough<00:02:10.149> time<00:02:10.329> to<00:02:10.390> play

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
but you have just enough time to play

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.479 
but you have just enough time to play
with<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.019> make<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.290> go<00:02:11.860> where<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.220> want<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
with it to make it go where you want it

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.330 
with it to make it go where you want it
to<00:02:12.549> I<00:02:12.790> did<00:02:13.150> all<00:02:13.209> ten<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.660> spot<00:02:14.650> pattern

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
to I did all ten with the spot pattern

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.910 
to I did all ten with the spot pattern
and<00:02:15.579> then<00:02:16.150> went<00:02:16.630> back<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.230> capped<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.890> with

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and then went back and capped it with

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.850 
and then went back and capped it with
the<00:02:18.280> Goldie<00:02:18.760> lighter<00:02:19.480> color<00:02:19.870> brown<00:02:20.170> just

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
pushing it into the cracks and make sure

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.630 
pushing it into the cracks and make sure
you<00:02:23.170> cover<00:02:23.380> every<00:02:23.950> inch<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.250> nail<00:02:24.400> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
you cover every inch of the nail and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.880 
you cover every inch of the nail and
then<00:02:24.880> filing<00:02:25.389> it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
then filing it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.890 
then filing it
did<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.520> use<00:02:26.700> some<00:02:26.910> sort<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.210> guide<00:02:27.420> or

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
did you use some sort of guide or

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.800 
did you use some sort of guide or
pattern<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.770> create<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.340> spots<00:02:29.580> no<00:02:30.390> actually

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
pattern to create the spots no actually

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.720 
pattern to create the spots no actually
I<00:02:31.230> did<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> little<00:02:31.830> bit<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.040> research<00:02:32.370> online

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.680 
pattern and up prints just basically use
my<00:02:37.110> memory<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:37.850> what<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.000> remember<00:02:39.569> it

my memory with what I remember it
looking<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.440> didn't<00:02:41.010> draw<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.250> out<00:02:41.430> or

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
looking like I didn't draw it out or

anything<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.120> basically<00:02:42.570> used<00:02:42.840> my<00:02:42.990> memory

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
anything I just basically used my memory

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.740 
anything I just basically used my memory
cool<00:02:43.980> they<00:02:44.430> turned<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.030> well<00:02:45.060> I'm<00:02:45.450> really

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
impressed thank you I noticed that when

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.580 
impressed thank you I noticed that when
you<00:02:47.910> were<00:02:48.000> applying<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.540> light<00:02:48.750> gold<00:02:49.170> in

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
you were applying the light gold in

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.140 
you were applying the light gold in
between<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.310> crevices<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.060> were

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
between the crevices that you were

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.820 
between the crevices that you were
really<00:02:51.390> pushing<00:02:51.630> down<00:02:51.959> why<00:02:52.380> did<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.590> do<00:02:52.800> that

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
really pushing down why did you do that

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.640 
really pushing down why did you do that
you<00:02:53.670> have<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.820> really<00:02:54.120> push<00:02:54.780> down<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.020> acrylic

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
you have to really push down the acrylic

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.160 
you have to really push down the acrylic
hard<00:02:55.920> because<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.420> cracks<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.020> you're

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
hard because the cracks that you're

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.900 
hard because the cracks that you're
trying<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.590> push<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.980> acrylic<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.489> are<00:02:59.700> so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
trying to push the acrylic in are so

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.330 
trying to push the acrylic in are so
small<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:01.110> may<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.250> all

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
small that you may think you have it all

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
small that you may think you have it all
the<00:03:02.520> way<00:03:02.580> down<00:03:02.820> into<00:03:03.300> there<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:03.989> once

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
the way down into there and then once

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
the way down into there and then once
you<00:03:04.260> start<00:03:04.500> filing<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.040> you'll<00:03:05.220> notice<00:03:05.489> that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
you start filing it you'll notice that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.360 
you start filing it you'll notice that
there<00:03:05.820> are<00:03:05.850> holes<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.930> air<00:03:07.440> bubbles<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.130> when

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
there are holes in air bubbles so when

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.130 
there are holes in air bubbles so when
you<00:03:08.459> push<00:03:08.670> really<00:03:08.970> hard<00:03:09.090> down<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> acrylic

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
you push really hard down on the acrylic

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.259 
you push really hard down on the acrylic
that<00:03:10.530> makes<00:03:10.739> sure<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.220> gets<00:03:11.310> all<00:03:11.910> in

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
that makes sure that it gets all in

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.699 
that makes sure that it gets all in
there<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.720> pushes<00:03:12.900> all<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.170> air<00:03:13.350> bubbles

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
there and it pushes all the air bubbles

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.590 
there and it pushes all the air bubbles
out<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.400> after<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.730> acrylic<00:03:15.030> was<00:03:15.180> set<00:03:15.390> you

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
out so after the acrylic was set you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.270 
out so after the acrylic was set you
filed<00:03:15.900> them<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.380> shape<00:03:16.590> them<00:03:16.739> with<00:03:16.860> electric

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
filed them to shape them with electric

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.050 
filed them to shape them with electric
file<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:18.209> hand<00:03:18.540> file<00:03:18.840> why<00:03:19.230> do<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.410> use<00:03:19.560> both

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
file and a hand file why do you use both

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.740 
file and a hand file why do you use both
actually<00:03:21.060> when<00:03:21.180> you're<00:03:21.300> done<00:03:21.450> with<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
actually when you're done with the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.680 
actually when you're done with the
pattern<00:03:22.560> or<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.890> design<00:03:23.220> there's<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.420> much<00:03:24.540> of

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
pattern or the design there's so much of

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.140 
pattern or the design there's so much of
the<00:03:24.780> lighter<00:03:25.019> tones<00:03:25.320> brown<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.820> darker

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
the lighter tones brown on the darker

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.610 
the lighter tones brown on the darker
tone<00:03:27.360> brown<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.050> really<00:03:28.320> need<00:03:28.470> an

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
tone brown that you really need an

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.380 
tone brown that you really need an
electric<00:03:29.010> file<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.459> way<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.850> file<00:03:30.090> all

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
electric file that way you can file all

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.479 
electric file that way you can file all
of<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.810> lighter<00:03:31.350> color<00:03:31.620> off<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.190> darker

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
of the lighter color off of the darker

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.370 
of the lighter color off of the darker
color<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.390> pretty<00:03:33.600> hard<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> do<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.019> hand

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
color so be pretty hard to do that hand

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.009 
color so be pretty hard to do that hand
filing<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.430> hand<00:03:35.610> file<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.780> need<00:03:36.930> to

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
filing and the hand file you need to

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.390 
filing and the hand file you need to
hand<00:03:37.200> file<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.799> get<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.010> shape<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.220> you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
hand file just to get the shape that you

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.640 
hand file just to get the shape that you
want<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.030> side<00:03:39.209> file<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.840> file<00:03:40.470> the

excellent inspiration for me to do

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.460 
excellent inspiration for me to do
something<00:04:09.299> different<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.959> I've<00:04:10.049> never<00:04:10.200> seen

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
something different that I've never seen
