00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
one you use but I am using my left hand

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.860 
one you use but I am using my left hand
to<00:04:00.230> do<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:01.359> there<00:04:02.359> also<00:04:02.480> would<00:04:02.630> sound<00:04:02.810> like

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
to do that there also would sound like

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.160 
to do that there also would sound like
this

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.089 

and<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.230> know<00:04:07.349> when<00:04:07.500> all<00:04:07.620> those<00:04:07.739> two<00:04:07.920> ring

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
and you know when all those two ring

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.920 
and you know when all those two ring
together<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.730> more<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.060> staccato<00:04:09.360> Fiona

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
together it's more of a staccato Fiona

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.930 
together it's more of a staccato Fiona
so<00:04:12.920> just<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.640> when<00:04:14.760> you're<00:04:14.849> done

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
so just like that and when you're done

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.659 
so just like that and when you're done
with<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.150> part<00:04:15.480> hit<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> third<00:04:16.500> fret<00:04:16.889> before

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
with that part hit the third fret before

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.150 
with that part hit the third fret before
you<00:04:17.760> go<00:04:17.910> back<00:04:18.060> into<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:22.590> now<00:04:22.710> sound<00:04:23.040> like

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
you go back into the so now sound like

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:36.110 
you go back into the so now sound like
this<00:04:23.360> slow<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:34.470> like<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.790> if<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:35.940> play

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
