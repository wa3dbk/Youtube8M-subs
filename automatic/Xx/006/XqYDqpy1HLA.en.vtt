those<00:00:46.920> little<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.969> dots<00:00:49.760> there's<00:00:50.760> one

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
those little you know dots there's one

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
those little you know dots there's one
there<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.010> there<00:00:53.010> earthworm<00:00:53.579> eggs<00:00:55.219> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
there one there there earthworm eggs and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
there one there there earthworm eggs and
there's<00:00:56.820> quite<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> few<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
there's quite a few in there so that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.750 
there's quite a few in there so that
means<00:00:59.190> they're<00:00:59.430> multiplying<00:01:01.160> they<00:01:02.160> say<00:01:02.489> that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
means they're multiplying they say that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.899 
means they're multiplying they say that
there's<00:01:03.000> between<00:01:03.510> 3<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.080> 12<00:01:04.430> frames<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.729> each

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
there's between 3 and 12 frames in each

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.380 
there's between 3 and 12 frames in each
one<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.240> those<00:01:06.390> eggs<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:08.210> keep<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.390> wet<00:01:11.390> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
one of those eggs I keep this wet and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
one of those eggs I keep this wet and
let's<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> look<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.560> how<00:01:13.860> many<00:01:14.070> ones<00:01:14.340> we've

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
let's have a look at how many ones we've

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.210 
let's have a look at how many ones we've
got<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.000> here

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220

guess

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.930 

the<00:02:41.560> worms<00:02:41.770> really<00:02:42.160> like<00:02:42.340> laying<00:02:42.640> their<00:02:42.910> eggs

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
and put some cardboard it helps keep it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.550 
and put some cardboard it helps keep it
wet<00:02:50.650> for<00:02:50.920> longer<00:02:51.250> periods<00:02:51.849> so<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.420> doesn't<00:02:52.720> dry

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
