his eye not exactly this in line but a
little<00:02:28.750> bit<00:02:28.840> farther<00:02:29.049> out<00:02:29.260> we'll<00:02:29.829> start<00:02:30.099> in

little bit farther out we'll start in
one<00:02:30.549> little<00:02:30.700> triangle<00:02:31.180> year<00:02:31.359> they're<00:02:31.750> not

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
one little triangle year they're not

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.069 
one little triangle year they're not
straight<00:02:32.769> triangles<00:02:33.430> their<00:02:33.790> look<00:02:34.389> a<00:02:34.420> little

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
straight triangles their look a little

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.690 
straight triangles their look a little
bit<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.379> a<00:02:35.439> roundness<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.889> him<00:02:36.159> this<00:02:36.340> isn't<00:02:36.609> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
bit of a roundness to him this isn't a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.929 
bit of a roundness to him this isn't a
straight<00:02:37.209> line<00:02:37.719> it's<00:02:38.469> a<00:02:38.650> little<00:02:39.549> bit<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.849> a

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
straight line it's a little bit of a

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.539 
straight line it's a little bit of a
curve<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.329> then<00:02:40.450> ear<00:02:40.689> number<00:02:40.959> two<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:42.069> gonna

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
curve and then ear number two is gonna

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.179 
curve and then ear number two is gonna
be<00:02:42.760> right<00:02:43.000> above<00:02:43.389> this<00:02:43.719> I<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.319> it's<00:02:45.010> gonna<00:02:45.129> be

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
be right above this I and it's gonna be

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.360 
be right above this I and it's gonna be
about<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.819> same<00:02:46.000> height<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.680> we<00:02:47.950> want<00:02:48.159> a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
about the same height so we want a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.949 
about the same height so we want a
little<00:02:48.819> round<00:02:49.709> number<00:02:50.970> two<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.510> year<00:02:52.569> it

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
little round number two this year it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.319 
little round number two this year it
goes<00:02:53.079> behind<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.799> then<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.519> ear<00:02:54.819> comes<00:02:55.150> in

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
goes behind and then this ear comes in

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.390 
goes behind and then this ear comes in
front<00:02:55.569> because<00:02:56.349> he's<00:02:56.530> facing<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:57.220> very

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
front because he's facing a very

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520 
front because he's facing a very
particular<00:02:57.879> direction<00:02:58.389> actually<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.319> want

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
particular direction actually I want

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.899 
particular direction actually I want
this<00:02:59.680> year<00:02:59.859> to<00:02:59.950> be<00:03:00.099> a<00:03:00.129> little<00:03:00.489> bit<00:03:00.639> more

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
this year to be a little bit more

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.759 
this year to be a little bit more
pointed<00:03:01.389> I<00:03:01.510> made<00:03:01.689> it<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> little<00:03:02.139> bit<00:03:02.379> too<00:03:02.530> round

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
pointed I made it a little bit too round

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.369 
pointed I made it a little bit too round
and<00:03:03.040> i<00:03:03.280> exaggerated<00:03:03.939> it<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.180> show<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.359> guys<00:03:04.569> so

they come out you need to give a little

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.890 
they come out you need to give a little
bit<00:03:24.040> more<00:03:24.489> space<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:24.849> his<00:03:25.150> chin<00:03:25.419> and<00:03:25.449> his<00:03:25.629> body

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
bit more space for his chin and his body

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.750 
bit more space for his chin and his body
to<00:03:26.109> start<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.970> their<00:03:28.299> very<00:03:28.930> elongated

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
to start so in their very elongated

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.000 
to start so in their very elongated
circles<00:03:30.760> pull<00:03:31.540> those<00:03:31.689> so<00:03:32.260> there's<00:03:32.439> one<00:03:32.739> and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
circles pull those so there's one and

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.129 
circles pull those so there's one and
then<00:03:33.699> the<00:03:33.819> second<00:03:34.180> one<00:03:34.209> will<00:03:34.659> come<00:03:34.840> right

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
then the second one will come right

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.479 
then the second one will come right
around<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.680> same<00:03:35.889> part<00:03:36.689> like<00:03:37.689> so<00:03:38.169> same<00:03:39.069> same

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
around the same part like so same same

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.270 
around the same part like so same same
size<00:03:39.819> same<00:03:40.359> shape<00:03:40.419> just<00:03:41.199> just<00:03:41.769> flipped<00:03:42.069> over

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
size same shape just just flipped over

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.409 
size same shape just just flipped over
is<00:03:42.609> this<00:03:43.060> arm<00:03:43.540> right<00:03:43.930> there<00:03:44.729> nice<00:03:45.729> round<00:03:46.060> we're
