taken a specimen of the suspected tissue
the<00:00:49.920> tissue<00:00:49.950> specimen<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.329> sent<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the tissue specimen is then sent to a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.380 
the tissue specimen is then sent to a
laboratory<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:53.190> review<00:00:53.520> by<00:00:53.700> a<00:00:53.730> pathologist

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

specimen is assigned a number or a code

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.010 
specimen is assigned a number or a code
so<00:00:59.790> it<00:00:59.880> can<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.149> tracked<00:01:00.420> throughout<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so it can be tracked throughout the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.340 
so it can be tracked throughout the
process<00:01:01.730> on<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.570> day<00:01:03.870> our

process on this first day our

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
process on this first day our
pathologists<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.100> examine<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.700> specimen

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
pathologists will examine the specimen

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050 
pathologists will examine the specimen
measure<00:01:06.869> its<00:01:07.110> size<00:01:07.369> describe<00:01:08.369> its<00:01:08.549> color<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
measure its size describe its color and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.879 
measure its size describe its color and
texture<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.780> determine<00:01:10.469> if<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.799> any

texture and determine if there are any

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:14.239 
texture and determine if there are any
masses<00:01:11.609> present<00:01:12.109> the<00:01:13.109> pathologist<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.920> cuts

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.249 
masses present the pathologist then cuts

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:16.370 
masses present the pathologist then cuts
the<00:01:14.459> specimen<00:01:14.969> into<00:01:15.119> thin<00:01:15.420> slices<00:01:15.600> called

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the specimen into thin slices called

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.940 
the specimen into thin slices called
sections<00:01:16.889> and<00:01:17.130> examines<00:01:17.939> them<00:01:18.090> further<00:01:18.950> small

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
sections and examines them further small

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
sections and examines them further small
pieces<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.579> these<00:01:20.700> slices<00:01:21.179> are<00:01:21.329> then<00:01:21.450> fixed<00:01:21.990> in

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
pieces of these slices are then fixed in

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
pieces of these slices are then fixed in
formalin<00:01:22.679> this<00:01:23.219> hardens<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> tissue<00:01:24.090> and

formalin this hardens a tissue and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.149 
formalin this hardens a tissue and
prevents<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.200> tissue<00:01:25.409> from<00:01:25.740> breaking<00:01:26.130> down

following the fixing the tissue is then

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.239 
following the fixing the tissue is then
dehydrated<00:01:30.450> slowly<00:01:30.979> generally<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.130> the

the tissue is then embedded in hot wax

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.679 
the tissue is then embedded in hot wax
