it's one of my pet peeves the letter T
as<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.090> probably<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.599> has<00:00:31.230> two<00:00:31.769> strokes<00:00:32.369> a

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
as you probably know has two strokes a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
as you probably know has two strokes a
vertical<00:00:33.780> line<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.860> horizontal<00:00:35.219> line<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
vertical line and a horizontal line and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.229 
vertical line and a horizontal line and
the<00:00:36.960> correct<00:00:37.230> way<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.920> writing<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> letter<00:00:38.910> T

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the correct way of writing the letter T

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.780 
the correct way of writing the letter T
is<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.890> write<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> vertical<00:00:41.640> line

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is like this you write the vertical line

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.110 
is like this you write the vertical line
first<00:00:42.210> down<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.489> horizontal<00:00:45.090> line

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
first down and then the horizontal line

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.410 
first down and then the horizontal line
across<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.280> seen<00:00:47.489> hundreds<00:00:48.180> of
