00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.600 
God would there's only one more game
left<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.550> Sega<00:02:25.120> has<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.810> announce<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
left that Sega has to announce and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.810 
left that Sega has to announce and
that's<00:02:27.940> most<00:02:28.240> likely<00:02:28.540> for<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.959> 3ds<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.459> two

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
that's most likely for the 3ds the two

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.140 
that's most likely for the 3ds the two
games<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.450> reveal<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.640> we<00:02:33.790> already

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
games that reveal that that we already

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.330 
games that reveal that that we already
know<00:02:34.330> about<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.020> Sonic<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.770> new<00:02:35.950> Sonic

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340

game<00:02:36.490> which<00:02:36.700> people<00:02:37.420> are<00:02:37.510> naming<00:02:38.500> Sonic

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
game which people are naming Sonic

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.310 
game which people are naming Sonic
Generations<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:44.290> know<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:46.320> sonic

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
Generations and the you know the sonic

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.690 
Generations and the you know the sonic
episode<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.459> Sonic<00:02:49.150> 4<00:02:49.510> episode<00:02:50.200> 2<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.519> looks

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
episode of Sonic 4 episode 2 so it looks

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.300 
episode of Sonic 4 episode 2 so it looks
like<00:02:51.790> that's<00:02:52.690> all<00:02:53.050> we're<00:02:53.350> getting<00:02:53.590> even

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
like that's all we're getting even

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.340 
like that's all we're getting even
though<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:54.550> gonna<00:02:54.790> be<00:02:55.350> multi-platform

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
though that's gonna be multi-platform

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.190 
though that's gonna be multi-platform
but<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.580> other<00:02:57.790> thing<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.360> probably<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
but the other thing is probably the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.840 
but the other thing is probably the
other<00:02:59.350> Sonic<00:02:59.680> game<00:02:59.860> is<00:03:00.010> probably<00:03:00.250> for<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.430> 3ds

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850
