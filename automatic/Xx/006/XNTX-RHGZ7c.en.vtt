00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.900
 wishes and topics 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.530
 So turn into a workshop age 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.329
 at the same time briefly in part how here 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.049
 again and again 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.579
 These little tips and tricks me 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.109
 try already from the landscape 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.090
 So report something so daily 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.490
 This really happens on the web 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.079
 interesting is when we do that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.450
 Of course not withheld from them 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.640
