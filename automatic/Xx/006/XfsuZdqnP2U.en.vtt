station and the police seem to keep the
peace<00:02:57.139> around<00:02:57.170> here<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.889> see<00:02:58.639> and<00:02:59.150> what<00:02:59.329> is<00:02:59.359> that

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
peace around here I see and what is that

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.849 
peace around here I see and what is that
peasant<00:03:00.530> food<00:03:00.980> they<00:03:01.370> probably<00:03:01.609> poisoned<00:03:02.030> it

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
peasant food they probably poisoned it

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.830 
peasant food they probably poisoned it
it<00:03:03.859> appears<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.340> overlords<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.329> not<00:03:05.510> exist

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
it appears that overlords do not exist

in<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.139> world<00:03:06.380> either<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.459> that's<00:03:07.670> why<00:03:07.850> we

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
in this world either so that's why we

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.479
