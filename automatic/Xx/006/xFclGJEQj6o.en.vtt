 he employs fifteen kadima farmers 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.140
 just like other farms across the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 country 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.909
 tradition says that the log he 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.439
 cultivated must be beautiful to see and rogue 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.090
 psa in the direction of barter in the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.250
 torah is that of a citrus 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.530
 aesthetically beautiful how a and rogue 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.500
 can be beautiful we have the criteria 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.570
 halakha lacquer barely 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.119
 guidelines on what is classified 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.490
 like and rogue but audard what is a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.470
 to be hiding what is one and rogue 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.090
 means we try to do the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.610
 troubles but oudar which means 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 clean with a nice elliptical shape 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.509
 not lying like a ball with a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.490
 good color that is not too green 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.259
 and yellow nitro and that's what we 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.610
 make the whole year the judgment in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.630
 the trognes not only requires 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.670
 they are clean 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.040
 pauli and feeds them he must also 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.680
 have a cone shape similar to a 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.750
 wide tower at the base and three towards the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.090
 tip 7 and rogue is very aesthetic 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.979
 because its form of growth becomes 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 closer and closer to the top and he 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.259
 is perfect it is completely clean and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.420
 the demand for such and rogue is huge 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.849
 hello to the courtine crime except 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.860
 it takes about a year to grow 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.989
 years and dry to allow him to give 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.060
 citrus fruits that must be grown 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.500
 in a particular way each time 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.180
 he receives individual treatment 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.640
 commented paul nishi each and rogue 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.040
 receives a personal treatment the trog 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 starts when they sprout out of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.150
 the flower and then we protect it 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.250
 pests have sprayed 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.269
 throughout the summer so the trog 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.920
 stay clean 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.500
 we do something like that by 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.300
 example attached the bartering of such 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.340
 way he does not move on the tree 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.100
 so in case there is wind or 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.170
 other disturbances the barters will remain 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.660
 firmly in its place I go out that the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.580
 will yield a personal treatment 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.630
 and we work hard to satisfy 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.330
 consumers 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.239
 here we have for example 7 and rogue 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.549
 who is kosher the brakka and no but 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.910
 why in the center there is a 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:10.150
 small task that is a defect in game 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.829
 boy I look at a tree I look at one and 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.450
 rogue and I see a crack and that's 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.650
 like a cleft in the heart I feel 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.239
 as a form in the heart because 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.510
 the and rock we grow are like a 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.130
 baby 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.780
 each and rogue is pampered like a baby 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.070
 in the growth process and more 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.900
 late in the wash we consider them 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.530
 like our when each and rogue is 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.680
 unique in itself 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.090
 andrew davis indoor culture of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.980
 the e-tron requires a lot of work 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:38.049
 and efforts and the product maybe 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:40.299
 quite expensive ben to sarah dollars but the 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.090
 selling price of one and rogue of talent and 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.100
 from 10 to 300 dollars we treat them 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.260
 trog not like a fruit 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.060
 but as a diamond we work 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.030
 in an area that is actually 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.340
 agriculture but we work in 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.079
 the conditions of sinn polishing of 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.620
 diamonds like the diamond cutter 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.569
 who cleans shapes and pauline the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.030
 diamond that's what we do with 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.910
 drugs because demand demands 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.760
 it is totally clean elegant 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.100

 price 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.050
