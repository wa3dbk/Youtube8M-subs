00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
came across a shark and so I was on the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
came across a shark and so I was on the
board<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.150> time<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.660> wishes<00:00:30.960> circle<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
board of the time I wishes circle on the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.819 
board of the time I wishes circle on the
ball<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.899> shot<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> gun<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.750 
ball and I shot it with a gun right and
then<00:00:35.840> AK<00:00:36.840> neglect<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.550> it's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
then AK neglect like this so it's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.780 
then AK neglect like this so it's
basically<00:00:38.989> floating<00:00:39.989> above<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.530> water<00:00:41.070> like

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
basically floating above the water like

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
basically floating above the water like
half<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.510> under<00:00:42.960> water<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.649> rest

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
half of it is under water but the rest

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
half of it is under water but the rest
of<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.190> standing<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.789> no<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.840> too<00:00:46.050> sure<00:00:46.289> and
