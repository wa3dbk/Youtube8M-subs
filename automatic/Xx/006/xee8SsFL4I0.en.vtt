okay see what it gets right here don't
think<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.260> didn't<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
think of me if I didn't see the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.670 
think of me if I didn't see the
microphone<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> green<00:01:08.610> microphone<00:01:09.680> showing

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
microphone the green microphone showing

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.039 
microphone the green microphone showing
that<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.100> recognized<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.240> speech<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> heard
