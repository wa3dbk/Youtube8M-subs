00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.809 
those routines because there there's no
more<00:02:56.530> difficulty<00:02:57.069> levels<00:02:57.370> that's<00:02:57.489> what<00:02:57.670> these

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
more difficulty levels that's what these

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.369 
more difficulty levels that's what these
routines<00:02:58.239> replace<00:02:58.720> instead<00:02:59.109> of<00:02:59.200> just

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
routines replace instead of just

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.530 
routines replace instead of just
choosing<00:02:59.739> easy<00:02:59.950> medium<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.430> hard<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:01.299> choose

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
choosing easy medium and hard you choose

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.629 
choosing easy medium and hard you choose
beginner<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.170> basically<00:03:02.799> easy<00:03:03.069> then<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.519> have

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
beginner is basically easy then you have

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.339 
beginner is basically easy then you have
standard<00:03:04.150> then<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.629> have<00:03:04.750> deluxe<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.260> then

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
standard then you have deluxe and then

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.259 
standard then you have deluxe and then
you<00:03:05.440> have<00:03:05.560> Pro<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.069> that's<00:03:06.579> how<00:03:06.849> you<00:03:06.909> progress

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
you have Pro and that's how you progress

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.990 
you have Pro and that's how you progress
with<00:03:07.629> with<00:03:08.290> each<00:03:08.319> song<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.760> great

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
with with each song so it's a great

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.879 
with with each song so it's a great
implementation<00:03:10.659> of<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.959> it's<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.290> great<00:03:11.500> idea

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
implementation of it it's a great idea

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.979 
implementation of it it's a great idea
and<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.190> really<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.659> central

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
and I really like that then central

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.629 
and I really like that then central
spotlight<00:03:14.379> will<00:03:14.530> obviously<00:03:14.769> be<00:03:15.010> bundled<00:03:15.459> with

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
damn good job of reading what exactly

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.460 
damn good job of reading what exactly
you're<00:03:30.699> doing<00:03:30.730> with<00:03:31.180> your<00:03:31.209> limbs<00:03:31.569> isn't

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
spotlight it feels like that the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.839 
spotlight it feels like that the
tracking<00:03:35.319> itself<00:03:35.799> is<00:03:35.949> definitely<00:03:36.430> improved

course the ability for the Kinect to see

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.170 
course the ability for the Kinect to see
more<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.919> and<00:03:48.069> more<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.549> room<00:03:48.760> is

fans might notice right off the bat in

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.990 
fans might notice right off the bat in
this<00:03:52.750> video<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.799> some<00:03:54.069> of<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.250> moves<00:03:54.519> may<00:03:54.940> be

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
this video that some of the moves may be

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.539 
this video that some of the moves may be
recycled<00:03:55.660> from<00:03:55.750> past<00:03:56.079> games<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.859> some<00:03:57.430> of

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
recycled from past games and some of

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.399 
recycled from past games and some of
them<00:03:57.669> are<00:03:57.849> there's<00:03:58.480> no<00:03:58.599> doubt<00:03:58.780> about<00:03:58.900> that

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
them are there's no doubt about that

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.050 
them are there's no doubt about that
but<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.650> gives<00:04:00.220> them<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.400> ability<00:04:00.519> at

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
but it gives them the ability at

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.960 
but it gives them the ability at
