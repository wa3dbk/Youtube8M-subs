Aventa<00:03:09.360> with<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.570> car<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.770> focused<00:03:12.340> on<00:03:12.610> three

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
Aventa with this car we focused on three

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.880 
Aventa with this car we focused on three
major<00:03:13.090> items<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.050> first<00:03:14.290> one<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.650> the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
major items the first one is the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.190 
major items the first one is the
power-to-weight<00:03:15.760> ratio<00:03:16.540> which<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.840> one<00:03:17.050> of

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
power-to-weight ratio which is one of

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
power-to-weight ratio which is one of
the<00:03:17.410> key<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.430> sensor<00:03:18.910> issues<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:20.740> super

the key and the sensor issues of a super
sports<00:03:21.490> car<00:03:21.790> we<00:03:22.450> increase<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.990> power<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.260> the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
sports car we increase the power of the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.320 
sports car we increase the power of the
car<00:03:23.800> by<00:03:24.190> 50<00:03:24.880> horsepower<00:03:25.180> from<00:03:25.510> 700<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.410> 750<00:03:27.330> we

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
car by 50 horsepower from 700 to 750 we

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.260 
car by 50 horsepower from 700 to 750 we
decreased<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.380> weight<00:03:29.620> by<00:03:30.460> a<00:03:30.490> hundred<00:03:30.970> and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
decreased the weight by a hundred and

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.940 
decreased the weight by a hundred and
ten<00:03:31.900> pounds<00:03:32.670> mainly<00:03:33.670> due<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:34.300> additional

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
ten pounds mainly due to additional

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.310 
ten pounds mainly due to additional
carbon<00:03:35.950> fiber<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.700> exterior<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:38.110> the

carbon fiber on the exterior and in the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.870 
carbon fiber on the exterior and in the
exterior<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.800> leading<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.670> a

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
exterior and this is leading to a

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.580 
exterior and this is leading to a
power-to-weight<00:03:43.660> ratio<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.730> more<00:03:45.730> or<00:03:45.790> less

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
power-to-weight ratio of more or less

power-to-weight ratio of more or less
4.5<00:03:47.590> pounds<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:49.690> each<00:03:49.720> horsepower<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:50.830> an

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
4.5 pounds for each horsepower so an

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.300 
4.5 pounds for each horsepower so an
impressive<00:03:51.580> reason<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:53.320> second<00:03:53.770> item<00:03:53.950> we

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
impressive reason the second item we

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.820 
impressive reason the second item we
concentrated<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.930> aerodynamics<00:03:56.650> and

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
concentrated on is the aerodynamics and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.710 
concentrated on is the aerodynamics and
we<00:03:57.010> improved<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.640> aerodynamics<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:58.600> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
we improved the aerodynamics so the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.699 
we improved the aerodynamics so the
downforce<00:03:59.380> by<00:04:00.360> 170<00:04:01.360> percent<00:04:01.780> in<00:04:02.440> comparison

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
downforce by 170 percent in comparison

to his older brother the Aventador coupe
and<00:04:05.650> we<00:04:06.489> did<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.000> by<00:04:07.660> having<00:04:08.020> a<00:04:08.830> new<00:04:09.489> front<00:04:09.900> we

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
and we did this by having a new front we

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.750 
and we did this by having a new front we
have<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.470> new<00:04:12.390> diffuser<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:14.170> big<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.860> tail

have a new diffuser and a big a tail
wing<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.450> this<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:17.169> one<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.709> items

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
wing and this is just one of the items

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.449 
wing and this is just one of the items
and<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:19.060> third<00:04:19.299> thing<00:04:19.630> we<00:04:20.140> accomplished<00:04:21.130> or

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
and the third thing we accomplished or

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.170 
and the third thing we accomplished or
was<00:04:22.320> about<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.470> drivability<00:04:23.890> which<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:25.030> know

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
was about the drivability which you know

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.060 
was about the drivability which you know
if<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.630> speak<00:04:25.870> about<00:04:26.020> super<00:04:26.440> sports<00:04:26.680> car<00:04:26.919> it's

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
if you speak about super sports car it's

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.330 
if you speak about super sports car it's
about<00:04:27.700> weight<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.530> aerodynamic<00:04:30.130> but

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
about weight it's the aerodynamic but

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.830 
about weight it's the aerodynamic but
more<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.000> more<00:04:31.060> it's<00:04:31.300> important<00:04:31.840> than<00:04:32.380> daily

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
more and more it's important than daily

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.020 
more and more it's important than daily
drivability<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:34.870> our<00:04:35.230> cars<00:04:35.650> so<00:04:36.340> drivability

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
drivability of our cars so drivability

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.240 
drivability of our cars so drivability
was<00:04:37.210> one<00:04:37.390> of<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.660> key<00:04:37.840> items<00:04:38.020> for<00:04:38.590> us<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:39.010> this

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
was one of the key items for us so this

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.930 
was one of the key items for us so this
is<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.580> third<00:04:39.790> one<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.290> it's<00:04:41.940> something

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
is the third one and it's something

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.270 
is the third one and it's something
where<00:04:43.450> we<00:04:43.660> speak<00:04:44.320> about<00:04:44.500> handling<00:04:45.070> and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
where we speak about handling and

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
where we speak about handling and
driving<00:04:45.880> with<00:04:46.180> precision<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.490> one<00:04:48.490> is<00:04:48.760> the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
driving with precision and one is the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.000 
driving with precision and one is the
Lamborghini<00:04:49.510> dynamic<00:04:50.410> steering<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.980> the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
Lamborghini dynamic steering and the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.560 
Lamborghini dynamic steering and the
other<00:04:51.820> one<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.540> pushrod<00:04:53.260> suspension<00:04:54.570> with

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
other one is the pushrod suspension with

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.010 
other one is the pushrod suspension with
Magna<00:04:55.990> right<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.470> just<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.700> wrap<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.600> up<00:04:58.720> with

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
Magna right and just to wrap it up with

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.600 
Magna right and just to wrap it up with
a<00:04:59.080> few<00:04:59.440> in<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.919> few<00:05:00.160> numbers

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
a few in a few numbers

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.300 
a few in a few numbers
it's<00:05:01.150> from<00:05:01.510> zero<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.960> see

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
it's from zero to see

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.010 
it's from zero to see
see<00:05:02.490> two<00:05:02.700> in<00:05:02.910> just<00:05:03.590> 2.8<00:05:04.590> seconds

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
see two in just 2.8 seconds

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.660 
see two in just 2.8 seconds
yeah<00:05:07.020> it's<00:05:07.230> oppressive<00:05:08.540> from<00:05:09.540> 62<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.740> zero<00:05:11.490> I

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
yeah it's oppressive from 62 to zero I

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.950 
yeah it's oppressive from 62 to zero I
think<00:05:12.180> it's<00:05:12.560> 98<00:05:13.560> feet<00:05:13.830> or<00:05:14.130> 30<00:05:14.460> meters<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.240> in

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
think it's 98 feet or 30 meters and in

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.260 
think it's 98 feet or 30 meters and in
European<00:05:16.410> measures<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.070> at<00:05:17.190> 90<00:05:17.580> 80<00:05:17.700> towards

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
European measures so at 90 80 towards

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.330 
European measures so at 90 80 towards
nothing<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.890> top<00:05:20.550> speed<00:05:20.910> is<00:05:21.480> more<00:05:21.840> than<00:05:22.340> 270

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
nothing and top speed is more than 270

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.380 
nothing and top speed is more than 270
and<00:05:24.560> one<00:05:25.560> thing<00:05:25.860> remained<00:05:26.430> unchanged<00:05:27.150> that

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
and one thing remained unchanged that

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.890 
and one thing remained unchanged that
the<00:05:27.600> aventador<00:05:28.200> after<00:05:28.710> four<00:05:28.950> years<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:29.490> in

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
the aventador after four years so in

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.290 
the aventador after four years so in
2011<00:05:30.900> we<00:05:31.080> launched<00:05:31.320> Aventador<00:05:32.100> LP<00:05:32.360> 700-4<00:05:33.980> in

2013 we launched the Roadster now this

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.330 
2013 we launched the Roadster now this
is<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.210> super<00:05:39.510> veloce<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:40.290> it<00:05:40.830> still<00:05:41.010> has<00:05:41.160> no
