00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
me one hundred percent coverage so I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.590 
me one hundred percent coverage so I
know<00:00:55.460> exactly<00:00:55.550> what<00:00:55.970> I'm<00:00:56.090> going<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.300> get<00:00:56.480> in

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.650 

what's<00:01:03.680> great<00:01:03.830> about<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.220> autofocus<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:05.480> that

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
what's great about the autofocus is that

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.600 
what's great about the autofocus is that
all<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.080> point<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.440> cross<00:01:06.680> type<00:01:06.980> this

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
all of the point to cross type this

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.520 
all of the point to cross type this
maximizes<00:01:08.480> your<00:01:08.510> chance<00:01:08.840> of<00:01:09.020> locking<00:01:09.380> onto
