 of the extraction process not 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.430
 it's always easy and at the beginning you can 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.410
 costar is a technique that is learned if 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.420
 you have doubts or you 're not sure how 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.519

 some practical tips that also 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.279
 they can help you 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.149
 first sterilize or clean with water 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.210
 hot soap the pieces before 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.850
 use both the bottle bottle and the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.940
 funnel and the connector and the valve and the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.070
 membrane when assembling make sure that the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.610
 valve is connected in this way in 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.180
 lateral position then threads the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 bottle and place the tube in the 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.300
 connector 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.809
 and you will not have ready to start the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.809
 extraction 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.320
 the main characteristic of this 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.750
 extractor resides in that it mimics the rhythm 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.610
 natural suction of the baby at the beginning 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.650
 of fast and smooth to stimulate 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.630
 milk output and then it's more 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.900
 slow and deep to get the most 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.090
 milk quantity as fast as possible 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.100
 It is important that you start looking 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.890
 a moment when you are relaxed and 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.890
 quiet brings the extractor to the chest 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.740
 so that the nipple is just in the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.510
 center of the funnel to avoid rubbing and so 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.090
 that can move forward to 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.430
 back if you notice pain it may be that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.680
 you need some other type of size of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.830
 funnel and you can choose between five of 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.170
 different when you turn it on it will start 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.900
 to the fast and smooth suction the phase of 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.820
 stimulation for two minutes if the 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.430
 milk will start to flow before these 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.400
 two minutes you yourself could change the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.619
 rhythm by pressing this button in the phase 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.750
 next the extraction phase the rhythm 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.880
 it will be slower then is when 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.340
 You can regulate the force of suction 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.310
 to know which one is the best for you 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 press the increase button until 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 you notice an annoying 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.430
 and just then reduce it slowly 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.780
 with the decrease button until you 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.370
 stop hurting 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.730
 this will be the point where the strength of 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.709
 suction will be the most effective when 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.569
 you have finished washing the pieces of the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.850
 extractor and if you do not have to go back to 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.720
 use it for a while you'll save 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.720
 in an airtight container 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.800
 if the chest is so congested that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.690
 it's hard to extract from milk 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.910
 You can apply heat through bags of 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.770
 cold gel heat or hot cloths and 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.250
 you can also perform a gentle massage 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.319
 before and during the takeover 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.540
 to get more grip and 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.610
