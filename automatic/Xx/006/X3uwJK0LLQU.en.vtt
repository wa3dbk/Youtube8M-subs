00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.919 

like<00:01:53.689> I'm<00:01:54.380> doing<00:01:54.799> now<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:56.329> you're<00:01:56.600> doing

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.550 
right it's best to use a white line
instead<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.269> yellow<00:02:08.569> line<00:02:08.899> because<00:02:08.929> it

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
instead of a yellow line because it

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.650 
instead of a yellow line because it
doesn't<00:02:10.039> look<00:02:10.129> real<00:02:10.190> listen<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:10.970> yelling<00:02:11.510> on

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
doesn't look real listen you yelling on

doesn't look real listen you yelling on
yellow<00:02:12.440> lines<00:02:12.650> provides<00:02:13.069> double<00:02:13.519> yellow<00:02:13.730> line

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
yellow lines provides double yellow line

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.330 
yellow lines provides double yellow line
parking<00:02:14.569> or<00:02:14.720> something<00:02:15.080> not<00:02:15.650> four<00:02:15.830> main<00:02:16.040> roads

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
