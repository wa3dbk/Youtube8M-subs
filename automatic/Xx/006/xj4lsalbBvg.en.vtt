00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
building like pyramid type buildings and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.780 
building like pyramid type buildings and
if<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.239> turned<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.660> pretty<00:00:33.809> cool<00:00:35.809> huh<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.790> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this world I decided that big old

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080 
this world I decided that big old
mountain<00:00:52.199> back<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.980> took<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.489> tunnel<00:00:53.940> all

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
mountain back there I took a tunnel all

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.540 
mountain back there I took a tunnel all
the<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.180> through<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.530> fill<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.039> c4

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the way through it I'm a fill it with c4

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.990 
the way through it I'm a fill it with c4
and<00:00:56.850> blow<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.609> then<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.760> thought<00:00:59.789> about

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and blow it up but then I thought about

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
and blow it up but then I thought about
the<00:01:00.329> fact<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:00.840> c4<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.489> powerful

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the fact well c4 is a lot more powerful

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
the fact well c4 is a lot more powerful
on<00:01:03.030> TNT<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.049> putting<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.439> lot

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
on TNT and I'm going to be putting a lot

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.880 
on TNT and I'm going to be putting a lot
of<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> don't<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.799> this

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
of it in there so I don't want this

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.560 
of it in there so I don't want this
building<00:01:08.340> being<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.640> story<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> pretty

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
building being a story so that is pretty

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.609 
building being a story so that is pretty
cool<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:11.070> surrounding<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.619> these

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
cool so I'm surrounding it with these

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.200 
cool so I'm surrounding it with these
are<00:01:14.509> not<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.750> called<00:01:16.140> their<00:01:17.210> glowing

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
are not what they called their glowing

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.200 
are not what they called their glowing
plexiglass<00:01:19.490> because<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.729> cannot<00:01:21.000> be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
plexiglass because it cannot be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
plexiglass because it cannot be
destroyed<00:01:21.930> by<00:01:22.350> an<00:01:22.470> explosion<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.650> figured<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
destroyed by an explosion so I figured I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.910 
destroyed by an explosion so I figured I
would<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.119> video<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
would make a video of this I'm going to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.350 
would make a video of this I'm going to
finish<00:01:30.409> encasing<00:01:31.409> my<00:01:31.439> building<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
finish encasing my building in this the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.109 
finish encasing my building in this the
rest<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> side<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> top<00:01:35.119> and

find<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.210> oh<00:02:30.700> goodness<00:02:32.470> where'd<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.680> go<00:02:34.690> um<00:02:35.690> I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
find it oh goodness where'd it go um I

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:45.600 
find it oh goodness where'd it go um I
think<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:37.640> can<00:02:37.790> find<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.180> from<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.450> other<00:02:38.540> side

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.470 

i'm<00:02:46.610> going<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.850> go<00:02:46.940> ahead<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.120> pause<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
i'm going to go ahead and pause the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.170 
i'm going to go ahead and pause the
recording<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.470> i'll<00:02:48.620> get<00:02:49.220> back<00:02:49.280> when<00:02:49.790> i<00:02:49.820> find

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
recording and i'll get back when i find

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.750 
recording and i'll get back when i find
it<00:02:50.300> okay<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:50.900> i<00:02:51.110> found<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.560> entrance<00:02:51.680> on<00:02:52.580> their

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
it okay so i found the entrance on their

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.590 
it okay so i found the entrance on their
side<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.660> will<00:02:53.810> be<00:02:53.930> easy<00:02:54.200> from<00:02:54.320> here<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:56.180> this

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
side this will be easy from here so this

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.390 
side this will be easy from here so this
is<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.810> tunnel<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.350> i'm<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.830> completely

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
is a tunnel that i'm going to completely

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.240 
is a tunnel that i'm going to completely
fill<00:02:58.790> with<00:02:59.090> c4<00:02:59.660> I'm<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.890> move<00:03:01.100> these

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
fill with c4 I'm going to move these

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.970 
fill with c4 I'm going to move these
glow<00:03:01.490> stick<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.450> they<00:03:02.959> don't<00:03:03.110> block<00:03:03.350> 2c<00:03:03.530> for

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
glow stick so so they don't block 2c for

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.500 
glow stick so so they don't block 2c for
but<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:05.090> two<00:03:05.450> blocks<00:03:05.690> high<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:07.520> it's<00:03:08.330> this

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
but it's two blocks high and it's this

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.220 
but it's two blocks high and it's this
entire<00:03:08.959> length<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:10.090> dug<00:03:11.090> through<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.780> side<00:03:12.200> of

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
entire length a dug through the side of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.630 
entire length a dug through the side of
this<00:03:12.380> mountain<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:15.080> comes<00:03:15.440> out<00:03:15.680> all<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.459> way

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
this mountain that comes out all the way

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.120 
this mountain that comes out all the way
over<00:03:17.150> here<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:19.130> see<00:03:19.730> there's<00:03:19.940> my<00:03:21.010> building<00:03:22.010> I

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
over here and see there's my building I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.280 
over here and see there's my building I
wanted<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.730> protect<00:03:23.090> right<00:03:23.930> over<00:03:24.140> there

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
wanted to protect right over there

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.070 
wanted to protect right over there
that's<00:03:24.530> why<00:03:24.800> I<00:03:24.830> figured<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.340> better<00:03:25.930> protect<00:03:26.930> it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
that's why I figured I better protect it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.160 
that's why I figured I better protect it
otherwise<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:27.830> going<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.220> blow<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.730> up<00:03:29.170> so

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
otherwise this is going to blow it up so

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.570 
otherwise this is going to blow it up so
I'm<00:03:30.440> going<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.620> go<00:03:30.709> ahead<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.920> get<00:03:31.430> this

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
I'm going to go ahead and get this

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.699 
I'm going to go ahead and get this
filled<00:03:31.820> with<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.060> c4<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.750> then<00:03:33.200> I'll<00:03:33.410> start

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
filled with the c4 and then I'll start

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.360 
filled with the c4 and then I'll start
the<00:03:33.769> video<00:03:33.860> again<00:03:34.630> ok<00:03:35.630> I'm<00:03:35.780> back<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.410> as<00:03:37.100> you

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
the video again ok I'm back and as you

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.250 
the video again ok I'm back and as you
can<00:03:37.489> see<00:03:37.519> from<00:03:37.820> here<00:03:37.930> completely<00:03:38.930> filled<00:03:39.110> that

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
can see from here completely filled that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.210 
can see from here completely filled that
tunnel<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.680> c4<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:42.019> know<00:03:42.620> I'm<00:03:42.860> never<00:03:43.010> going

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
tunnel is c4 and I know I'm never going

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.370 
tunnel is c4 and I know I'm never going
to<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.370> able<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.580> get<00:03:43.670> away<00:03:43.760> in<00:03:44.000> time<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:45.050> live

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
to be able to get away in time to live

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.470 
to be able to get away in time to live
so<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:45.920> built<00:03:46.250> myself<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.730> little<00:03:46.820> bomb<00:03:47.060> shelter

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
so I built myself a little bomb shelter

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.390 
so I built myself a little bomb shelter
here<00:03:47.980> got<00:03:48.980> my<00:03:49.100> switch<00:03:49.340> ready<00:03:51.130> chances<00:03:52.130> are

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
here got my switch ready chances are

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.670 
here got my switch ready chances are
this<00:03:53.239> explosions<00:03:53.930> you'd<00:03:54.050> be<00:03:54.140> big<00:03:54.290> enough<00:03:54.380> it's

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
this explosions you'd be big enough it's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.860 
this explosions you'd be big enough it's
going<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:54.950> lag<00:03:55.370> out<00:03:55.850> considering<00:03:56.750> i'm

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
going to lag out considering i'm
