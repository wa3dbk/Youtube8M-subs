going to look like a question like for

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.479 
going to look like a question like for
me<00:02:43.489> but<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.940> no<00:02:44.090> idea<00:02:44.209> why<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.220> by<00:02:46.220> anyways

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
me but I have no idea why so by anyways

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.490 
me but I have no idea why so by anyways
that's<00:02:46.730> how<00:02:46.910> it's<00:02:47.090> spelled<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.350> says

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
that's how it's spelled and then it says

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.559 
that's how it's spelled and then it says
an<00:02:48.739> intuitive<00:02:51.370> you

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
an intuitive you

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.020 
an intuitive you
see<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.170> code<00:02:54.010> signs<00:02:54.489> iOS<00:02:55.209> apps<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.760> then

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
see that code signs iOS apps so then

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.770

to choose line links another reason why

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.459 
to choose line links another reason why
i<00:06:10.630> say<00:06:10.930> this<00:06:11.080> is<00:06:11.259> because<00:06:11.680> like<00:06:13.319> you<00:06:14.319> don't

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
i say this is because like you don't

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:15.930 
i say this is because like you don't
have<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.740> like<00:06:14.889> sign<00:06:15.190> up<00:06:15.370> for<00:06:15.610> crap<00:06:15.909> and

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
have to like sign up for crap and

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.939 
have to like sign up for crap and
everything<00:06:16.240> and<00:06:16.779> then<00:06:17.349> you<00:06:17.500> don't<00:06:17.650> have<00:06:17.740> to

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
everything and then you don't have to

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.629 
everything and then you don't have to
download<00:06:18.190> anything<00:06:18.430> else<00:06:19.259> so<00:06:20.259> yeah<00:06:20.889> that's

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
download anything else so yeah that's

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:28.490 
download anything else so yeah that's
why<00:06:21.909> it's<00:06:22.060> so<00:06:22.150> much<00:06:22.360> more<00:06:22.539> easier<00:06:25.919> lime<00:06:26.919> links

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
why it's so much more easier lime links

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.640 
why it's so much more easier lime links
