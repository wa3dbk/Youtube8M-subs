my dinner partner the thorn in my side
but<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.350> definitely<00:01:52.740> decided<00:01:52.890> trying<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
but we have definitely decided trying to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.240 
but we have definitely decided trying to
have<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> lot<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.630> year<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.860> only

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
done as fuel things I think he more

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.249 
done as fuel things I think he more
things<00:01:59.579> like<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.299> big<00:02:00.540> last<00:02:00.780> week<00:02:00.990> last<00:02:01.140> week

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
I never really flopped the whole event

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.790 
I never really flopped the whole event
because<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.890> wanted<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.160> live

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
because I just wanted to live

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.250 
because I just wanted to live
experience<00:02:12.670> was<00:02:12.880> been<00:02:13.150> tried<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.960> worry<00:02:14.140> about

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
experience was been tried to worry about

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.130 
experience was been tried to worry about
capturing<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.280> that's<00:02:15.580> why<00:02:16.180> i<00:02:16.210> did<00:02:16.540> not<00:02:16.960> as

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
capturing it so that's why i did not as

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.470 
capturing it so that's why i did not as
much<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.890> like<00:02:18.220> experience<00:02:19.180> things

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.300 
much I like to like experience things
rather<00:02:19.870> than<00:02:19.960> try<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.350> capture<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.130> yeah<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310

rather than try and capture it so yeah I
really<00:02:21.760> wish<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.120> 2013<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.410> traveled<00:02:24.130> a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.240 
came out like I'm not only free one year
and<00:02:36.010> then<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.310> got<00:02:36.520> here<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.790> then<00:02:37.210> probably

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and then I got here and then probably

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.640 
and then I got here and then probably
for<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.280> first<00:02:39.670> i<00:02:40.270> would<00:02:40.510> say<00:02:40.750> six<00:02:41.230> months<00:02:41.590> i

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
for the first i would say six months i

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.830 
for the first i would say six months i
was<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.920> little<00:02:42.070> bit<00:02:42.280> motivated<00:02:42.400> i<00:02:43.030> would<00:02:43.570> read

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
was a little bit motivated i would read

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.550 
was a little bit motivated i would read
here<00:02:44.320> in<00:02:44.440> there<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.610> i<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.540> fell<00:02:46.930> off<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.440> i

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
here in there but i just fell off and i

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.280 
here in there but i just fell off and i
just<00:02:47.770> stopped<00:02:48.040> studying<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:49.080> don't<00:02:50.080> know<00:02:50.170> what

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
just stopped studying I don't know what

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.560 
just stopped studying I don't know what
happened<00:02:50.710> but<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.340> feel<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.940> think<00:02:52.300> it's<00:02:52.450> because

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
happened but I feel I think it's because

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.820 
happened but I feel I think it's because
I<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:52.840> relied<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.410> fact<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.710> I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
I just relied on the fact that I

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.190 
I just relied on the fact that I
understand<00:02:54.640> more<00:02:55.090> than<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.390> know<00:02:55.450> anything<00:02:55.990> so

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
understand more than I know anything so

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.920 
understand more than I know anything so
I<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.970> couldn't<00:02:58.150> be<00:02:58.270> bothered<00:02:58.300> for<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.750> while

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
I just couldn't be bothered for a while

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.260 
I just couldn't be bothered for a while
and<00:02:59.110> i<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.170> lost<00:02:59.440> motivation<00:02:59.940> then<00:03:00.940> towards

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
and i just lost motivation then towards

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.770 
and i just lost motivation then towards
the<00:03:01.330> end<00:03:01.390> like<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.930> last<00:03:02.140> couple<00:03:02.320> months<00:03:02.560> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
the end like the last couple months of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.260 
the end like the last couple months of
2013<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.990> gained<00:03:05.740> motivation<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.820> became<00:03:07.120> really

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
2013 I gained motivation I became really

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.930 
2013 I gained motivation I became really
really<00:03:07.510> motivated<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:09.340> feel<00:03:09.820> like<00:03:09.850> that's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
really motivated and I feel like that's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.460 
really motivated and I feel like that's
carried<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.570> into<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:10.900> year<00:03:11.200> I'm<00:03:11.440> really

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
carried on into this year I'm really

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.820 
carried on into this year I'm really
motivated<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:12.400> learn<00:03:12.550> Korean<00:03:13.500> once<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.650> went

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
motivated to learn Korean once I went

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.860 
motivated to learn Korean once I went
home<00:03:15.070> 'over<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.400> crystal<00:03:15.760> period<00:03:16.120> got

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
home 'over the crystal period got

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.390 
home 'over the crystal period got
motivation<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.650> lot<00:03:17.770> of<00:03:17.860> things<00:03:18.010> fell<00:03:18.250> off

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
motivation for a lot of things fell off

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.610 
motivation for a lot of things fell off
