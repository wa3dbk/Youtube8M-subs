 this new video tutorial I will show you 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.440
 as how to start how to start linux in 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.929
 our console with our console 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.679
 xbox 360 with heretic 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.900
 and tag already installed, it can be said that very 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.599
 It brings many good applications for 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.669
 can enjoy more of our xbox with 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:30.499
 rg ag since it has a browser 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.599
 integrated which is in mozilla with which 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.570
 we can enter to access 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.360
 Internet pages from our xbox 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.750
 360 we can watch movies that have a 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.790
 integrated movie player in 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 we can do many things 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.340
 fun to get more out of 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.290
 our xbox 360 first 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.960
 first of all, remember that 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.750
 the necessary files so that he and not 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.210
 can run on our xbox 360 what 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.230
 we can find on the www page 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.190
 point 3 160 full dotcom in the area of 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.110
 downloads 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.630
 and just on that subject etc. and so on 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.000
 first of all first thing that we should 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.480
 to do is to have a usb memory already 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.790
 previously formatted or format the in 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.340
 our computer we will also have to 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.520
 download the files that are in the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.120
 post in this case I uploaded two versions 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.540
 the version of linux 10.10 created by the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.650
 team lips on on also upload the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.340
 linux version and the small city 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.710
 of 2011 it should be remembered that all two 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.290
 they serve since one is newer and the other 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.750
 it's a little older 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.390
 another thing that I will also tell you is 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.720
 that linux in the sea city ​​has a login 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.960
 and a password which is found 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.540
 within the 'tsar but practically the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.310
 installation in it we will start with 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.979
 the linux of 2010 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.050
 First of all we must download the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.920
 files found on page 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.069
 www point 360 full in this case are two 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.480
 203 parts a and 127 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.519
 kilobytes 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.080
 already after having lowered it we will have to 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:30.710
 extract it in our computer 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.110
 we wait for him to extract and while 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.920
 we are both introducing a memory 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.920
 usb in our usb port in our 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.430
 computer 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.020
 we close it we will have to format 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.760
 completely our memory we can 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.800
 leave it completely clean ok or format 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.069
 remember it so that you can 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.250
 work on our xbox 360 should be 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.390
 formatted in fat32 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.230
 ok then we give you start right away and 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.060
 will start formatting our usb yo 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.690
 I have windows 7 done this way 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.090
 the same is also done in windows xp 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.210
 well after doing this formatting 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.910
 memory we open our memory in 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.390
 this case I leave here and here 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.310
 we open the program the archives 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.430
 previously downloaded we must do is 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.130
 copy the files these internal ones that 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.160
 they come out in the folder linux 10.10 calls me 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.460
 x 0 what we copy we cut it in this case 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.990
 I'll cut it and stick it to the disk 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.190
 removable and ok that is my disk usb 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.540
 we wait for 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.010
 to hit 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:54.030
 ours or that copy our linux for 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.760
 can boot on the xbox 360 while 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.400
 that is copying this I'm telling you of 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.140
 that this linux application 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.230
 for me it is one of the best 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.079
 applications that the xbox may already have 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.530
 which is an application that does not go 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:13.109
 installed on the xbox 360 in no 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.970
 moment we are going to lose our 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:20.430
 functions as as as a console 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.889
 it will only start since it will start 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.699
 with the surrounding since it is a file 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.710
 point 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.220
 lf 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.080
 and will only start from the clock 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.319
 new will be installed in no time 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.060
 we will have our xbox whenever the 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.330
 pay and turn it on again 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.389
 removing the usb we can start the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.810
 normally ok ok then we wait 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.380
 to download is to copy the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.380
 records 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.059
 there is no longer 30 seconds left 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.490
 while going copying I'm also going 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:59.999
 saying that they subscribe to the page 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.119
 360 full one page very good one page 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:06.009
 where you will find good tutorials 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:09.159
 You will find a large unloading area 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.520
 you can express your doubts there is an area 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.199
 of chat in short a page too 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.300
 good I also hope that you subscribe to 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.770
 my channel on youtube where stably 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.319
 I will place several videos 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.319
 well now we wait for it to finish 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.030
 normal that I finished copying 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.239
 and I tell you, I'm telling you that this tutorial 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.869
 I have it separated in two parts already 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:40.389
 that I'm recording from my computer and 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:42.399
 then I have a camera to record the 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:47.969
 next step that is important that is 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:50.519
 the initiation of linux in the xbox 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.040
 this step is very important it does not have 

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:56.400
 much science for the equal 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.890
 like we should know ok the same 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.680
 what we did now do we with 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.500
 people lips and 10 bad 2011 that is the 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.310
 new version of linux in the same 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.710
 we simply extract we give it extract 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.940
 here 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:17.060
 ok we extract in the same installation what 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.910
 only that the versions are newer 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.260
 one more 9 the other oldest 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.420
 so what we should do here is 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.790
 just copy these files and 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.330
 pass it to usb memory previously 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.409
 formatted 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:36.090
 and when I start already start the server and 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:39.479
 I grabbed these files he will ask for a login 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.159
 ok a login and a password to which 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.939
 we will put you with a usb keyboard 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:47.280
 connected to the xbox the login is ruth and the 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:50.060
 password is 360 computers with which 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.060
 will start 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.610
 in linux in our console good up 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.560
 here we come in this first part we 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:01.430
 we see right now for a while for the 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.630
 second part remember to always extract 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:09.070
 your jaguar safely so as not to damage them 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:12.500
 ok and not also damage this files 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.450
 important now without more hope 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.930
 then now the second part of the 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.930
 tutorial
