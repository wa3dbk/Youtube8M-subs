browser and you can get additional i
think<00:03:59.820> five<00:03:59.970> or<00:04:00.030> six<00:04:00.450> more<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.170> that's

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
think five or six more so that's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.330 
think five or six more so that's
additional<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.470> short<00:04:04.470> cuts<00:04:04.650> down<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:05.130> and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
additional a short cuts down here and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.270 
additional a short cuts down here and
along<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.150> bar<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.410> that<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.769> very<00:04:08.040> nice

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
along with the bar so that is very nice

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.860 
along with the bar so that is very nice
level<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.970> customization<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:11.360> i<00:04:12.360> think

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
level of customization and i think

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.430 
level of customization and i think
