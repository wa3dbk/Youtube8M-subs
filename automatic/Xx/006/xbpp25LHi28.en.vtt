00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 back to clouds of words like 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 that the initiative that was carried out 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.180
 during Christmas the Octobers so much of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 Spain as in Latin America we have 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.529
 decided to make a recommendation for the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.119
 day of the book the recommendations are 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.980
 completely personal and they are going to group 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.649
 in a playlist whose link 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 I will leave here below the book that I 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.540
 I want to recommend it is crystal throne 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.400
 to j more 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.440
 is a book that I think has not been 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.570
 I talked a lot but I loved it as much as 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.270
 I read it I want to change it in the video 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.890
 the mechanics readings of 2012 because 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.350
 well it was book that took me treatment 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.240
 by surprise he did not call me anything in a 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.220
 principle but when I read it then I 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.739
 loved what I liked most about the book 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.960
 apart from the originality of the argument 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.150
 is that the protagonist comes out pretty 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.890
 normal, although perhaps it is a 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.170
 tidy introductory because obviously 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.920
 is the first book in a saga 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.020
 trilogy I think that actually the action 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.580
 Enough is very good not for any 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 moment and at the end 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 and that I will not tell you obviously 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.810
 it's quite unsettling I had it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.900
 really bad it's like a little bit of anguish 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.090
 it's pure adrenaline I loved it yes 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 that there are a series of elements 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 fantastic or magical that do not charge 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.800
 really important until the end of the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.960
 book but I think they will be very 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.730
 important in the following therefore 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 if you like fantasy or not but 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.510
 you want to read something totally different 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.340
 I would highly recommend that I encourage you 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.400
 crystal controls is a book is already 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.380
 published in English but I do not know anything about 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 they will not even when they will be published in Spanish 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.440
 although he would not hesitate to give them a 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.940
 opportunity because certainly 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.620
 deserves a lot the porthole is like that 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.920
 my recommendation for the day of the book 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.900
 of this 2014 if you have not read it and I 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 like to do it because they are free to 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.860
 comment it and tell me why you want 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.140
 read what is what most has called you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.330
 the attention of everything I said if 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.770
 you have already read it and liked it or not 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.860
 You can also tell me without any 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.660
