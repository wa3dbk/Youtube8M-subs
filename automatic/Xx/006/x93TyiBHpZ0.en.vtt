00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.170
 once again I bring you the section 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.470
 talking about monsters this week we're going 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.269
 to talk about flip the water whistle a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.670
 very interesting monster that a lot of people 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.980
 has and is quite common very useful and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.420
 let's use it as an attack as it puts there 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.619
 because it really is not a monster that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 do a lot of damage especially with the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.990
 second and third ability but as 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.160
 initiator and controller let's see 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 first your skills 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.720
 the first is spirit flow is an attack 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 maybe the one that harms the most so 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 say it that also has a 30% 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.570
 of probability of throwing it back like that 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.320
 that can ever go crazy like 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.329
 how to do it or something similar and throw two 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 three four attacks that yes they can 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.100
 hurt as you see also has 30% of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.280
 ability of possibilities that if 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.379
 you make critical the next time you have 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 30% more to make critical of this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.980
 way there are people who are 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.660
 critical and it does not work badly but as already 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.280
 I tell you it's not a monster that the horse 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.719
 it will take a lot of damage even if 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.610
 make you fatal 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.800
 the second skill is called cyclone and 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.960
 twice attack all enemies with 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.759
 40% each time to leave them the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.810
 possibility of the clan without hit is a 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.689
 how to control in fact 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.939
 a while ago I do not know I do not know how many months 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.579
 a few months ago because before I left three 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.130
 loads it was amazing to have another team 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.780
 count on three rocker loads was 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 too much they lowered it to two it's still 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 very well is still very useful and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.539
 works very well makes that damage that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.390
 it seems that they are going to do to you not do it 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.210
 it's great stability the third one is 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.770
 flame hellstrom and is the one that makes 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.780
 shot on what is the controller that is 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.659
 what it does is freeze the whole world 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.100
 during a turn not here puts the attacked 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.690
 the enemies and freezes during a turn 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 it does not always work logically we're going to 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.459
 have to use accuracy and all kinds of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.929
 things but it's a very good attack that you 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.240
 will give many sands both in attack 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.799
 as in defense the ability of leader is 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.740
 a also very useful as everyone's 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.509
 those that are quite useful leaders kill 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.429
 19% speed attack as you know the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.530
 sand format right now is 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.959
 almost always approaching the attack speed the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.340
 who beat before winning is not always like that 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.950
 because there are teams that you do not already see in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 the gods section of the arena but yes 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.299
 that works and is very good pull is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.519
 one of the best ski leader in 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.050
 speed for example if half 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.850
 of wind 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.290
 a kind little more but each 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.600
 brings some things others did is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.750
 great let's move on to talk about the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.750
 runes 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.710
 This is the one who represents 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.880
 I think swift is the most appropriate and 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 I will explain why there are many 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.770
 people that can put you fatal I have seen 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.150
 some violent there is a second vile of 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.060
 shot of which if I'm going to talk to you 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.020
 but let's talk first swift 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.750
 it has to be faster has to 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.770
 freeze and when you freeze with the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.690
 directly and the whole team goes behind 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.280
 and he uses it for that to start 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.570
 freezing the whole world will get you 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.430
 the turn again and it's very fast 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.709
 even before some of your bugs 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.750
 and you're going to put it to be lansing 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.090
 even so the damage of the cv of the of the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.530
 my mother first skill he will 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.530
 to keep doing enough damage 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.490
 even if we do not put it to work he 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.140
 is getting between 1500 2000 depends 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.880
 of the bug and when it goes crazy it's two 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.530
 thousand two thousand two thousand that is to say 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.480
 it works and you do not need super runes of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.840
 attack or anything the second we're going to 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.220
 put of speed as you see not normally 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.450
 they have focus 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.740
 although the play does not work badly because 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.540
 it looks good with your first skill 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.650
 but the first skill you use later 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.180
 if the second Latina comes to you already 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.730
 bufo lose so it really is not 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.400
 something that is the best the best option is 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.810
 Focus is worth swift focus but I put it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.100
 because I have this magnificent rune 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.460
 more or less about six stars with 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.230
 speed plus 15 for inside if you 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.380
 you have to put it in fact if you have a 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.940
 of any 6 star energy of 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.380
 you also wear the speed 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.210
 goal here is to have the maximum 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.580
 possible speed continues that's why I've 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.500
 put the law 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.840
 the 4 will be percent attack 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.040
 it should always be because we need 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.540
 that a little more damage as you see 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.890
 It's a little bad but good, we're pulling 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.630
 and the acura sex so important all 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.280
 what surrounds speed and acura pulls 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.250
 so very important 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.720
 this is the standard swift focus set that 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.320
 you should put it to your tug but I 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.420
 you say 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.800
 Gates give me another alternative because I already 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.360
 I have an initiator with swiss that 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.850
 works well and I want to pull it out 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.230
 something more useful is worth putting this 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.500
 page 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.840
 but we have the second ability that 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.729
 You will tune from an ability to 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.010
 four if you draw two stands can be 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.110
 totally worth it can be a pass 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.690
 with the ato tacvba to further tune each 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.740
 attack you have when the pro jumps 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.870
 will have the possibility to study 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.820
 although the third ability does not work 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.680
 You can also tell me how not to 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.479
 works well freezes this binds can 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.850
 be a last frozen premiered already 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.919
 but if you freeze two stars to those 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.840
 same two which is totally useless 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.180
 and the other two are free that is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.150
 the problem maybe flipping with this page 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.580
 still works pretty well because 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.410
 take the two studied to two others 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.270
 is free well freezes to three 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.070
 you study one studied if you freeze 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.289
 another normally when it comes together 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.270
 you say good is useless but almost 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.220
 you're always going to have the four of them there like that 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.410
 that with shooting and focus works very 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.940
 well this jerk case is not going to be 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.300
 initiator so let's make it a 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.340
 bit more offensive the second rune will 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.960
 you can put it on attack, I do not know 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.539
 would speed because we do not want that 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.920
 you're fast is not the one that starts so 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.530
 we are going to put this zone of speed 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.970
 the 4 will put the cluelessness forgiveness 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.260
 attack the 4 we are to put also of 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.460
 attack you have to stay all the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.680
 possible attack so that their 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.350
 skills and the last you have the option 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.050
 to put it to the cure like this to make sure 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.760
 that when the pp is going to be quite the 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.650
 you can also attack me 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.680
 I think you should put it on 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.090
 cures and more than anything because although pull 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.590
 is going to be a little more damage your 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.420
 abilities are not pure from damage like 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.220
 other characters their skills are going to 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.930
 hurt but in a much more way 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.280
 moderate so we are still interested 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.140
 although we have to dismiss and not 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.390
 be initiated that when he touches 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.520
 the world stops so we're going to 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.900
 put these two attack and this one 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.820
 acura yes 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.430
 in conclusion you have our very 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.050
 good in attack arenas is pretty 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.570
 good if you have initiation with 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.699
 gels everyone wins a turn 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.780
 you wait with all you can see in my 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.280
 video of gods of the sand because you 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.600
 I have as initiator and then even 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.070
 if you have another character that makes a cessation 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.419
 you can have the people standing two 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.850
 turns because you have the opportunity to 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.470
 do it but simply from ps 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.360
 frozen pull of weight behind west 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.650
 you catch two or three and the sand is over 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.199
 in defense and its function is the same 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.850
 Ella also not bad you going to 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.440
 put it on speed you're going to put 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.389
 leader and he will be the first to attack 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.979
 when attack basel management almost always 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.389
 Sometimes I want the second 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.650
 skill and that's where it leaves you sold 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.660
 because it is not a showed especially 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.490
 hard though six stars holds a 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.070
 strong blow of an enemy 's 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.690
 wind depends a ninja you tomb pull 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.280
 a stone 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.580
 It will knock you down if it comes out fast 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.560
 the armor debt so in defense is 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.910
 well maybe not so much but not what 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.110
 enough to lower it good still 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.539
 being a very good monster in 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.360
 definitive very standard works for 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:01.120
 almost everything on TV is good but not 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.550
 does a lot of damage and I think it's a 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.370
 monster 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.370
 in this position and that is going to give you 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.110
 many joys we finish the life of today 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.520
 I'm thinking about doing the next one 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.610
 they said that show have told me that 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.740
 do the phantom fit of darkness that I 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.600
 I left it out there in the inkwell and it came out in 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.280
 the halo previous turns you remember well 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.020
 that soon I will bring you to one of 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.220
 them but if someone does not ask me for another 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.960
 thing as clear that I have also been 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.090
 talked about it if you are interested in 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.740
 comments tell me what you want and already 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.240
 you know he has stolen cattle for any 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.980
 thing you have all day for me 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.140
 answer any question you want 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.640
 on a personal level and a greeting that you 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.150
 serve as always and see you in the 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.150
 next video 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.180
 all right 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.730
 Y 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.710
