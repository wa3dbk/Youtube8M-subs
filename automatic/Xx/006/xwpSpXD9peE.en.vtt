you put them in a bucket and you take it
to<00:00:32.160> those<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.730> where<00:00:32.910> were<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.149> fishing

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to those you know where were you fishing

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.790 
to those you know where were you fishing
the<00:00:33.570> baits<00:00:33.780> half-dead<00:00:34.260> by<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> time<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.710> get

the baits half-dead by the time you get
real<00:00:35.399> soon<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> Sun<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> roasted<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> Sun<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
real soon the Sun it roasted the Sun the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.470 
real soon the Sun it roasted the Sun the
oxygen<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.890> gets<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> water<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
oxygen just gets out of the water and a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.260 
oxygen just gets out of the water and a
ton<00:00:39.629> came<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> bubbles<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.379> put<00:00:40.530> into<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> so

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
ton came and bubbles you put into it so

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.549 
ton came and bubbles you put into it so
we've<00:00:42.270> decided<00:00:42.540> let's<00:00:42.840> try<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.290> take<00:00:43.440> an

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
we've decided let's try and take an

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
we've decided let's try and take an
insulated<00:00:44.040> cooler<00:00:44.190> let's<00:00:44.700> convert<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
insulated cooler let's convert it into a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.880 
insulated cooler let's convert it into a
live<00:00:45.690> bait<00:00:45.899> cooler<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.440> three<00:00:46.590> different

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
live bait cooler we got three different

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
live bait cooler we got three different
sizes<00:00:47.070> starting<00:00:47.969> out<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> 13<00:00:48.510> 19<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> 30

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
sizes starting out of 13 19 and 30

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
sizes starting out of 13 19 and 30
quarts<00:00:49.950> put<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.329> good<00:00:51.480> quality<00:00:51.660> aerator

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
quarts put a really good quality aerator

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.860 
quarts put a really good quality aerator
on<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> aerator<00:00:53.100> itself<00:00:53.719> I'm<00:00:54.719> gonna

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
on it and the aerator itself I'm gonna

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.869 
on it and the aerator itself I'm gonna
unplug<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.230> real<00:00:55.559> quick<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.309> got<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
unplug that real quick but it's got a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
unplug that real quick but it's got a
hook<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.329> where<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> DC<00:00:58.260> chord<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
hook up where you can put a DC chord in

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.029 
hook up where you can put a DC chord in
it<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.190> DC<00:00:59.520> cord<00:00:59.760> comes<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.039> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it the DC cord comes with it and that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
it the DC cord comes with it and that
allows<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.520> plug<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.329> car<00:01:03.600> or

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
allows you to plug it in to your car or

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.149 
allows you to plug it in to your car or
your<00:01:03.930> boat<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> save<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> batteries<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
your boat and save the batteries that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
your boat and save the batteries that
are<00:01:05.369> inside<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.970> obviously<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:06.659> you're<00:01:06.780> out

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
are inside but obviously when you're out

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.240 
are inside but obviously when you're out
remote<00:01:07.229> somewhere<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.860> running<00:01:08.159> on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
remote somewhere it's running on

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.840 
remote somewhere it's running on
batteries<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.210> two-speed<00:01:09.920> fast<00:01:10.920> slow

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
batteries and it's two-speed fast slow

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.450 
batteries and it's two-speed fast slow
and<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> does<00:01:13.740> save<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.010> batteries

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and off so it does save you batteries

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
and off so it does save you batteries
but<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.909> puts<00:01:15.150> oxygen<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.680> secret

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
but that puts oxygen in but the secret

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
but that puts oxygen in but the secret
is<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> temperature<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> water<00:01:18.390> down

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is get the temperature of the water down

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.710 
is get the temperature of the water down
a<00:01:18.979> frozen<00:01:19.979> bottle<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> water<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
a frozen bottle of water put it in the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.920 
a frozen bottle of water put it in the
water<00:01:21.950> let<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.250> cold<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.479> pretty

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
water let it get cold and that pretty

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
water let it get cold and that pretty
much<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.320> double<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> amount<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.100> oxygen<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
much can double the amount of oxygen in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
much can double the amount of oxygen in
the<00:01:26.640> water<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.270> fishing<00:01:27.570> with

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the water so if you're fishing with

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.749 
the water so if you're fishing with
shrimp<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.380> minnows<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.979> shiners<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.579> anything

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
shrimp or minnows or shiners or anything

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.980 
shrimp or minnows or shiners or anything
like<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> water

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
like that if you can get the water

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
like that if you can get the water
temperature<00:01:31.470> down<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.189> double<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.759> triple

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
temperature down you double or triple

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.510 
temperature down you double or triple
