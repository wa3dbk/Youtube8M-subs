00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.499
 hello this is a smoke pan for home 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.570
 sturdy british over scale with a 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:10.520
 slide dax from a double bottom 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.080
 that sprinkle courage at the bottom immediately 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.540
 finish it and you lay the schedule 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.880
 for example a piece of fish 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.520
 you can put the yellow on the stove so you can 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.289
 hot smoking in pan it gets hot 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.080
 fish I go through and through because of the heat 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.779
 and get a smoke taste at the same time 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.550
 cold smoking is below 25 degrees 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.020
 enter it a single of the smoke perishes 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.490
 the room must be able to smoke cold 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.950
 separated from the smoking area 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.960
 but these kots are nice generators' 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.610
 produces so little heat 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.350
 that you can take it cold even though it lasts 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.380
 it a long time in an acceptable 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.840
 result is it is a labyrinth you like 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.980
 mesh in which the robot is sprinkled with 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.809
 a waxine light on a stuff 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.070
 is brought 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.630
 but first we have our will there too 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.110
 prepare it today also a day 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.110
 across 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.690
 we will have to have an all sides with salt 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.040
 be sprinkled to suit my taste 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.090
 and especially to make as many as possible 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.090
 to absorb moisture 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.430
 after a night in the fridge is the filet 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 stiffened and must be rinsed at 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.220
 I would then remove it well 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.420
 leach out 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.500
 again early in the morning to a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.500
 few hours too loud in dry 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.960
 the wood moth is feasting 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 brought with a tea light one 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.330
 smoldering labyrinth goes into the empty cold 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.330
 barbecue 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.920
 above that comes the grid with the fish 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.610
 now the question of waiting is the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.330
 smoldering wood must cover the entire labyrinth 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.440
 has gone through 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.710
 and that is still possible for an afternoon 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.710
 last 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.270
 and then we have the result here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.180
 they smoked salmon in the restaurant 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.490
 Incidentally, you can also call it salty 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.430
 add other flavorings such as 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.820
 sugar in the ratio 75 salt 25 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.820
 sugar 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.819
 take it
