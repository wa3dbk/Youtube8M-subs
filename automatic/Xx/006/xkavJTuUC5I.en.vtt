or something in these you can crack

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
or something in these you can crack
these<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:33.000> tabs<00:00:33.210> or<00:00:33.840> little

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
these little tabs or little

spring-loaded retainers on the bottom of
these<00:00:35.820> couplers<00:00:36.270> also<00:00:36.540> get<00:00:36.719> weak<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> they

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
these couplers also get weak and they

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.560

can<00:00:37.559> break<00:00:37.739> over<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.250> well<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.360> what<00:00:39.480> I'm

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
can break over time as well so what I'm

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.240 
can break over time as well so what I'm
going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> show<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.170> how<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.620> remove

those<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.450> very<00:00:42.690> simple<00:00:42.989> using<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.320> Torx<00:00:43.590> 25

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
those it's very simple using a Torx 25

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.639 
those it's very simple using a Torx 25
simply<00:00:44.879> flip<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.329> center<00:00:45.629> armrest<00:00:45.870> and

the<00:00:48.719> bracket<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.890> actual<00:00:50.340> armrest<00:00:50.789> itself

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the bracket to the actual armrest itself

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
the bracket to the actual armrest itself
take<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> two<00:00:52.289> Torx<00:00:52.559> 25<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.489> you'll<00:00:53.640> be

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
take out the two Torx 25 and you'll be

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.040 
take out the two Torx 25 and you'll be
able<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> remove<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.420> armrest<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
able to remove the armrest from the
vehicle<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> armrest<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
vehicle now that the armrest is out of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
vehicle now that the armrest is out of
the<00:00:57.960> vehicle<00:00:58.379> simply<00:00:58.920> flip<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> over<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you'll notice that you have three Torx

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.789 
you'll notice that you have three Torx
25s<00:01:02.789> got<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.260> one

you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.190 

once<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.620> three<00:01:18.650> screws<00:01:19.010> are<00:01:19.220> removed<00:01:19.310> you

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
once the three screws are removed you

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.080 
once the three screws are removed you
can<00:01:21.200> separate<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.100> bottom<00:01:22.430> housing<00:01:22.850> away

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
can separate the bottom housing away

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.160 
can separate the bottom housing away
from<00:01:23.300> this<00:01:23.450> make<00:01:24.380> sure<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:26.510> front<00:01:26.720> trim<00:01:26.990> piece

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
from this make sure the front trim piece

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.870 
from this make sure the front trim piece
will<00:01:27.320> also<00:01:27.530> probably<00:01:27.710> come<00:01:28.040> off<00:01:28.250> that's<00:01:28.520> okay

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
will also probably come off that's okay

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.420 
will also probably come off that's okay
set<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.300> aside<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.740> now<00:01:30.800> here's<00:01:31.280> your
