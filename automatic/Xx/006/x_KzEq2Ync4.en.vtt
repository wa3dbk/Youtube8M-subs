requests for this guy and so we're going
to<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.920> them<00:00:17.070> up<00:00:17.220> very<00:00:18.109> sparse<00:00:19.109> pattern<00:00:19.710> this

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
to do them up very sparse pattern this

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
to do them up very sparse pattern this
is<00:00:20.630> very<00:00:21.630> simple<00:00:21.930> materials<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.210> it's<00:00:24.210> not

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is very simple materials and it's not

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.620 
is very simple materials and it's not
real<00:00:24.600> hard<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> tie<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> already<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
real hard to tie so I already have the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
real hard to tie so I already have the
thread<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> hook<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> upside<00:00:29.070> down

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
thread on the hook I got it upside down

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150 
thread on the hook I got it upside down
the<00:00:29.550> vice<00:00:29.730> obviously<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.800> start<00:00:32.009> with

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the vice obviously so I just start with

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.850 
the vice obviously so I just start with
some<00:00:32.369> flash<00:00:33.059> abou<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.690> back<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.620> by<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
some flash abou back back here by the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.660 
some flash abou back back here by the
bend<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.450> wrap<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.640> like<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
bend and wrap it up this is a like a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.440 
bend and wrap it up this is a like a
hopper<00:00:39.120> hukka<00:00:39.649> for<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:41.489> terrestrial<00:00:41.760> fishing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
hopper hukka for for terrestrial fishing

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.240 
hopper hukka for for terrestrial fishing
but<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.809> don't<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> way

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
but I don't know I just like the way

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790 
but I don't know I just like the way
this<00:00:44.550> looks<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> end<00:00:45.360> versus<00:00:46.350> having<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
this looks at the end versus having it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.869 
this looks at the end versus having it
straight<00:00:47.190> i<00:00:47.219> mean<00:00:47.489> i<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.700> how<00:00:47.820> many

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
straight i mean i don't know how many

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.779 
straight i mean i don't know how many
you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.600> perfectly<00:00:49.050> straight<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.160> Sam

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you know perfectly straight you know Sam

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.299 
you know perfectly straight you know Sam
and<00:00:50.820> fri<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.020> guess<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.160> could

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and fri there are but I guess it could

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.850 
and fri there are but I guess it could
be<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> few<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.840> tie<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
be a few but just tie this in at the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.970 
be a few but just tie this in at the
back<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> wrap<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
back and I'm just going to wrap this

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.599 
back and I'm just going to wrap this
forward<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:01.160> got<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> long

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
forward like so I got kind of a long

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.590 
forward like so I got kind of a long
piece<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> trim<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> off

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
piece here so I'm going to trim it off

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.950 
piece here so I'm going to trim it off
and<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.590> basically<00:01:07.740> create<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
and this will basically create kind of a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.090 
and this will basically create kind of a
like<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.220> little<00:01:11.220> glisteny<00:01:11.729> body<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.510> us<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.100> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
like a little glisteny body for us to to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.670 
like a little glisteny body for us to to
base<00:01:14.369> ourselves<00:01:14.670> off<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.380> could<00:01:16.530> use

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
base ourselves off of here you could use

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.560 
base ourselves off of here you could use
dubbing<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:17.939> dubbing<00:01:18.299> looks<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
dubbing but I think dubbing looks a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.910 
dubbing but I think dubbing looks a
little<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.049> don't<00:01:19.229> know<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.520> too<00:01:20.520> full<00:01:21.000> or

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
little I don't know to too full or

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
little I don't know to too full or
whatever<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.409> patterns

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
whatever and and you want these patterns

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.899 
whatever and and you want these patterns
sparse<00:01:26.869> like<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:29.220> most<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.610> flight

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
sparse like I like most of my flight

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.630 
sparse like I like most of my flight
pattern<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.600> sparse<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.400> you<00:01:32.400> want<00:01:32.579> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
pattern is pretty sparse so you want to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
pattern is pretty sparse so you want to
leave<00:01:32.729> extra<00:01:33.000> room<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.630> much<00:01:33.750> room

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
leave extra room you see how much room

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.469 
leave extra room you see how much room
I've<00:01:34.110> left<00:01:34.320> at<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> head<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.790> don't<00:01:36.210> don't

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
I've left at the head so and don't don't

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.719 
I've left at the head so and don't don't
trim<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.780> tag<00:01:37.110> end<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:37.560> take<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.890> hand<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
trim this tag end off take it hand it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.390 
trim this tag end off take it hand it
back<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> yourself<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.829> tie<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.860> over<00:01:41.130> again

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
back to yourself and tie it over again

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.999 
back to yourself and tie it over again
like<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.649> kind<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.890> leave

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
like so and it will just kind of leave

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
like so and it will just kind of leave
that<00:01:44.220> again<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.299> would<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.750> measure

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that again and I would just measure

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.740 
that again and I would just measure
about<00:01:46.140> where<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> bend<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.880> clip

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
about where the bend is there and clip

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170 
about where the bend is there and clip
it<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.340> sort<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it off and you get you know sort of a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
it off and you get you know sort of a
wing<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:52.320> gives<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> little<00:01:52.740> extra<00:01:52.890> flash

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
wing just gives it a little extra flash

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.910 
wing just gives it a little extra flash
or<00:01:53.670> whatever<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.439> now<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.770> take<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
or whatever but now I'm going to take a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.219 
or whatever but now I'm going to take a
little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.750> darker<00:01:57.750> color<00:01:58.100> flashable<00:01:59.100> has<00:01:59.579> oh

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
little bit darker color flashable has oh
