00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.170
 distinguished in the last game 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.000
 home games with spartak it 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 It turned out such a militant tense but 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.430
 This is very gentle Wirth junior good 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.289
 the team and this game is also not happy 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:30.149
 the quality of the game up was a lot of struggle up 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.649
 tried to win martial art and 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.610
 There are many moments created by this game and 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.829
 that and at our gate that her 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.410
 gate rivals we had i think 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.339
 more moments and accordingly we 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.409
 scored two goals a game like that I would 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.809
 said to call her in the bathroom or something 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.729
 still not satisfied with the quality again 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.729
 falling on 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:58.260
 thinking I will say that the quality of the game 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:01:01.230
 defense line no harmony 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.649
 it was somehow chaotic but huge 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 a wish 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.590
 but your opinion with what we were connected 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 spent a good segment of seven matches 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.830
 then the game with Spartak and occurred 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.140
 small recession they are young i was generally 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.610
 surprised that for a long time 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
 time we 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.320
 were in good condition now 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.900
 slight decline before and after the game 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.260
 their pavel said there are games that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.750
 there may be a bad quality game 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.800
 but at the expense of desire at the expense of dedication 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.050
 such games need to pull out and win 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.479
 what's the principle now i happened not 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.020
 happened with Spartak Spartak more 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.350
 her class was individually stronger 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 so the game with Spartak and the game with 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.920
 Nizhny Novgorod like our identical 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.050
 the game but the opponent too was different 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 a lot of marriage was the transfer of that 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.479
 of our side that from the bottom 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.259
 Novgorod 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.489
 but again I will probably say what I said after 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.130
 games that we deservedly won the game on 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.630
 gaming doesn't seem 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.120
 if not the quality of the game is very important for 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.360
 account dedication mood both burn 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.720
 teams that basically happened in this 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.810
 the game 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.910
 I repeat again dissatisfied with the quality of the decline 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.320
 which was being discussed as I understand it was 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.280
 it is psychologically that is not about 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.310
 functionality not only 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.460
 psychologically functionally very 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.800
 difficult to keep in one 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.840
 at the same level of young players at the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.710
 them it is peculiar to drops 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.690
 still on it is related to the fact that the amount 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.580
 football players 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.790
 There are many football players with injuries 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.110
 a footballer who didn't go out at all 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.660
 exited at 10 15 minutes and bench 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.760
 spare we have a little man otrin 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.210
 the past and in general there were 23 people now 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 a little more sick people who are without 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.630
 training sessions just from the fact that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.160
 for the quantity we took to reserve well and in 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.090
 This game was also helped by the players. 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.920
 the main composition is 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.750
 gatagov and muhammad tzarev 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.080
 at first from so for him to understand 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.150
 at first she felt something not in her 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.010
 the plate but then even broke out 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.950
 asked that you did not want them 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.360
 play the whole match well it is very good 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:41.510
 what is a good attitude towards youth 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.330
 that they are always ready to go play 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.250
 help first and foremost 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.510
 and help yourself first because 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.410
 gaming practice is needed and those guys who 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.410
 plays for youth
