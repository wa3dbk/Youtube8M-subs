00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 good good well welcome 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.370
 officially as 600 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.880
 we are here in the games of the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.840
 America 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.059
 today a son of mine is touching my life 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.530
 basic because today it's time to play games 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.020
 of hunger ' play games of the 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.400
 funny hunger 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.960
 the end is about to end 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.939
 invincibility for everyone there 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.320
 is there is has decided this dot of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 pillar 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.699
 let's go to the first order so that you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.660
 mount a very rich gold skirt very 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.660
 tasty sr 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.770
 I am strong until the perendengues of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.370
 the sound d 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.370
 yes 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.920
 and so we go 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 we are already in the hunger games 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.150
 then every time I love the game of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.160
 this server so we really are 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.690
 too tiny I would say too much in the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.910
 team so it really is that this from 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.170
 pick up a kit right away 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.300
 I really think that I think it 's a bit 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.300
 that is or I do not think we should 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.430
 different plants and food or something 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.259
 so why not know what 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.840
 not to give a little fluidity to the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.090
 game not but take a kit of equipment 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.640
 for example to diamond or for example the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.110
 iron whole kit I do not know what's 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.100
 a little state of the rock 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.100
 face and may 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.730
 if you are here they are here they are like 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.710
 under 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.890
 and I think that around here a mine that I've 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.890
 jumped off 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.860
