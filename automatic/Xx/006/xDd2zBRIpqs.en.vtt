00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:34.850
 three edges two side one transverse 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:37.000
 then the front rear edge and forest 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.060
 drawer lid 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.239

 rollers two rear rollers and in front 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.120
 below we will be killed 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.829
 sheet of hardboard proceed to the assembly of the box 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:05.469
 we take two side edges we take bars 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:10.600
 we put them on edge for under the face and 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:10.600
 fasten on screws 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.170
 we collected all the details 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.450
 except the transverse ribs now us 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:48.160
 it is necessary to check the diagonal 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:49.280
 of our threshold if you have exactly the details 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.560
 paganel 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.810
 most likely converge the maximum possible 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.810
 allow a few millimeters of difference 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.640
 set the transverse ribs 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.800
 for this we find the middle on the front 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.709
 the lid and on the back we found the middle 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.860
 made tags here for holes now 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.970
 we drill a hole and twist 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.970
 all this on the screws 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.450
 we secured the cross edges now to us 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.660
 need to fix 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:37.100
 hardboard it 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:39.440
 and fasten our short screws we 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.870
 we fixed the hardboard now we need 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.380
 install videos we have two pairs 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.340
 rollers means here is a pair of it 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.380
 front rollers and here are the rear 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.850
 it is very easy to install 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.630
 so here is flush in the corner exactly and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.510
 fasten on screws 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.190
 also doing from the other side similarly 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.910
 install the rear rollers we have 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.220
 hole for their mounts since on 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.680
 these clips will be given to us 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.760
 load I recommend 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.590
 tighten them with screws along the length and we 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.510
 set videos 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.870
 now I want to say a few words on 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.720
 about the front cover 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.450
 it means the front cover is installed 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.220
 on detailing look size we measure 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.650
 just did not set fastens means but 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.470
 done in the fact that in general this cover is still 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:44.019
 covered with fabric color cases and deeds 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.959
 and install it will not be very tight 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.540
 convenient so i recommend you first 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.860
 it is covered with cloth and then set 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.190
 we are going to do so you can pull 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.160
 fabrics can make utyazhki foster yet 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.819
 something original we will do 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.230
 here utyazhki that is glue foam rubber 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.230
 do the letters as we did on 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.200
 armrest 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.349
 we almost packed our box now to us 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.310
 you need to make a hole on both tanks 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.889
 for mounting mechanism in accordance with 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.460
 detailing defer size 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:33.700
 height and length 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:40.060
 I use the angle to do this 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:42.030
 tags and drill a hole not 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.030
 forget to put something under the bottom 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:53.020
 so that we have a beautiful inside and 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:55.270
 the hole we made the hole boxes 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.910
 for mechanisms now we have left 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.760
 the final touch is the facial setting 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.979
 drawer covers here it is this cover we and 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.930
 done in armrest style with 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.849
 buttons 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.400
 as I said you can her just 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.699
 wrapped in a cloth or come up with something 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.699
 its original install it 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:21.250
 there will be something like this all necessary 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.539
 dimensions for its installation you can 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.430
 find in our detailing this cap 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:32.070
 attached pepper 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.500
 screws inside the thickness of our plywood 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.950
 10 millimeters respectively so that our 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.890
 cap 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.430
 well kept we need a screw 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.510
 minimum length of 20 millimeters length 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.970
 self tapping screw 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.720
 you can calculate the proceeding and thickness 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.720
 of your material
