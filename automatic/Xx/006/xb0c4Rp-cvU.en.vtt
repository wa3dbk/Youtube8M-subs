00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.189
 hi friends with you about hi-tech we 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.260
 looked at the company panasonic 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.910
 meet new headphones was 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.750
 showing several models of the pair 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.369
 Wireless bluetooth with here such here 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.890
 ears cost 7 thousand rubles here 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.980
 what is interesting is that two are used 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.930
 neodymium magnet and two membranes then 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.000
 there is such a construction as 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.699
 usually do combining rebar and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.279
 the speaker here combined two speakers 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.700
 the price of 7000 rubles, but probably a bit too much 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.950
 they sound good and to me personally the most 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.440
 interesting thought modelc hd 10 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.129
 then this is a completely new headset 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.989
 which are designed to work with sound 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.070
 they have high quality digital sound 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.399
 range from 4 hertz to 50 kilohertz here 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.100
 used membranes in 200 layers and for 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.539
 to quench the vibrations that 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 most membrane are created here 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.329
 used material in the dairy field 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.980
 acid 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 Panasonic argues that it allows 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 make it sound cleaner i listened to them 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 headphones sound there is it nice at them 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.930
 cost about 13 thousand rubles with such 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 characteristics of course they try 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.729
 argue with headphones with significantly 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.900
 higher price tag while 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.900
 ergonomically they are made very 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.930
 interesting means here here is the highway 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.900
 go back and forth quite calmly and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.150
 just as well here they are good 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.939
 adapt to the shape of the head under 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.579
 small head under a big head 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:36.600
 sit comfortably and do not get tired of them 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.490
 the wire comes unfastened back to the sound 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
 the whole system has become the material that us 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.390
 have shown panasonic including queen and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.350
 everything else I liked when I 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 started listening to tougher music 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.680
 probably played what headphones have not yet 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.290
 warmed up and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.869
 and after a little warm-up they imagine 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.539
 will reveal fully precisely touching 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.710
 guitar music touching dense such 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.600
 tougher sound 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.700
 but even in such a cold state 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.220
 they do an excellent job with all those 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.489
 what does not have such a high density 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.660
 so if you have the opportunity 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.370
 listen to these headphones and you just 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.019
 are in the process of selecting a headset 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.600
 be sure to listen to the panasonic model 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.000
 every 10 think you will be interested 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.940
 compare it with other headphones since 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.860
 same class and hear the difference between here 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.300
 such a wide range and some 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.150
 chips to use before or 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.370
 order to justify a rather big price 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.850
 Thanks for watching this video before 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.850
 new meetings
