I will tell you about the plains long
time<00:00:27.400> ago<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.300> ancient<00:00:28.840> people<00:00:29.260> looked<00:00:29.800> up<00:00:29.980> in

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
time ago the ancient people looked up in

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.700 
time ago the ancient people looked up in
the<00:00:30.340> sky<00:00:30.610> and<00:00:31.000> dreamed<00:00:31.780> of<00:00:32.020> flying<00:00:32.290> like<00:00:32.680> birds

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
the sky and dreamed of flying like birds

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.000 
the sky and dreamed of flying like birds
but<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:34.450> took<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.840> long<00:00:35.050> time<00:00:35.080> before<00:00:35.680> it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
but it took a long time before it

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.940 
but it took a long time before it
happened<00:00:36.489> first<00:00:37.290> people<00:00:38.290> have<00:00:38.559> learned<00:00:38.830> to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
happened first people have learned to

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.210 
happened first people have learned to
rise<00:00:39.460> into<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.090> air<00:00:40.450> on<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:40.780> balloon<00:00:41.620> balloon

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
rise into the air on a balloon balloon

rise into the air on a balloon balloon
was<00:00:42.910> filled<00:00:43.270> with<00:00:43.510> smoke<00:00:44.050> from<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:44.620> fire

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
was filled with smoke from the fire

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.060 
was filled with smoke from the fire
which<00:00:45.790> is<00:00:46.000> lighter<00:00:46.300> than<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.960> air<00:00:46.989> but<00:00:47.920> the

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
which is lighter than the air but the

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.720 
which is lighter than the air but the
balloon<00:00:48.400> flies<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.210> way<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.660> wind<00:00:49.870> blows<00:00:50.200> and

balloon flies the way the wind blows and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.060 
balloon flies the way the wind blows and
men<00:00:51.730> wanted<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.750> choose<00:00:53.020> which<00:00:53.290> way<00:00:53.560> to<00:00:53.620> fly

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
men wanted to choose which way to fly

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.170 
men wanted to choose which way to fly
himself<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.260> men<00:00:56.590> attached<00:00:57.160> engine<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.150> a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
himself so men attached engine to a

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.800 
himself so men attached engine to a
balloon<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.800> became<00:01:00.310> possible<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:01.090> fly<00:01:01.480> in

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
balloon and it became possible to fly in

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.100 
balloon and it became possible to fly in
the<00:01:01.960> right<00:01:02.110> direction<00:01:03.000> such<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.030> structure<00:01:04.839> is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the right direction such a structure is

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.719 
the right direction such a structure is
called<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.740> blue<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:07.540> time<00:01:07.990> passed<00:01:08.380> by<00:01:08.729> people

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
called a blue as time passed by people

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
called a blue as time passed by people
have<00:01:09.940> learned<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.360> make<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.990> first<00:01:11.290> place<00:01:11.680> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
have learned to make the first place and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.249 
have learned to make the first place and
100<00:01:14.229> years<00:01:14.560> ago<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.820> machine<00:01:16.360> was<00:01:17.020> made

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
100 years ago on this machine was made

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.430 
100 years ago on this machine was made
the<00:01:17.500> first<00:01:17.770> flight<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.450> first<00:01:19.630> planes<00:01:20.080> were

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
the first flight the first planes were

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.490 
the first flight the first planes were
small<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.100> their<00:01:21.910> hull<00:01:22.210> was<00:01:22.720> shielded<00:01:23.200> with

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
small and their hull was shielded with

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.180 
small and their hull was shielded with
wood<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:24.119> they<00:01:25.119> went<00:01:25.450> up<00:01:25.660> into<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.380> air<00:01:26.590> with

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
wood and they went up into the air with

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.540 
wood and they went up into the air with
the<00:01:27.340> help<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.789> propellers<00:01:28.539> at<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.920> same<00:01:30.190> time

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
the help of propellers at the same time

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.499 
the help of propellers at the same time
they<00:01:31.149> invented<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.050> first<00:01:32.289> helicopters<00:01:33.509> at

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
they invented the first helicopters at

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.770 
they invented the first helicopters at
first<00:01:34.959> they<00:01:35.500> were<00:01:35.560> funny<00:01:36.039> him<00:01:36.369> clumsy<00:01:36.970> but

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
first they were funny him clumsy but

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.160 
first they were funny him clumsy but
with<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.259> appearance<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.950> jet<00:01:39.280> engines

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
with the appearance of jet engines

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.249 
with the appearance of jet engines
helicopters<00:01:41.170> became<00:01:41.619> faster<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.459> bigger

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
helicopters became faster and bigger

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.160 
helicopters became faster and bigger
planes<00:01:44.259> also<00:01:44.709> improved<00:01:45.429> now<00:01:46.360> plans<00:01:46.840> were<00:01:47.140> made

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
planes also improved now plans were made

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.940 
planes also improved now plans were made
of<00:01:47.530> metal<00:01:48.069> became<00:01:48.759> bigger<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:50.140> one<00:01:50.619> pair

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
of metal became bigger and got one pair

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.559 
of metal became bigger and got one pair
of<00:01:51.190> wings<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:53.110> planes<00:01:53.500> can<00:01:54.009> land<00:01:54.039> not<00:01:54.940> only<00:01:55.390> on

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
of wings now planes can land not only on

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.940 
of wings now planes can land not only on
the<00:01:55.750> asphalt<00:01:56.319> but<00:01:56.920> also<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.729> snow<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.539> water

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the asphalt but also on snow and water

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.940 
the asphalt but also on snow and water
to<00:01:59.950> be<00:02:00.069> able<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.670> do<00:02:00.819> so<00:02:01.119> planes<00:02:01.959> have<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.619> key

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to be able to do so planes have this key

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.639 
to be able to do so planes have this key
instead<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:04.000> wheels

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
instead of the wheels

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.949 
instead of the wheels
nowadays<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:06.069> most<00:02:06.099> modern<00:02:06.880> planes<00:02:07.240> are

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
nowadays the most modern planes are

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.160 
nowadays the most modern planes are
controlled<00:02:08.530> by<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.950> computer<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.660> pilot
