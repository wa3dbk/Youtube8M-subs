this uh this video but I'm still hoping

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.179 
this uh this video but I'm still hoping
you<00:01:30.689> guys<00:01:30.840> enjoy<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you guys enjoy this and think it's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.480 
you guys enjoy this and think it's
pretty<00:01:32.400> cool<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.770> top<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:34.979> lined<00:01:35.369> with

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pretty cool so the top is lined with

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.460 
pretty cool so the top is lined with
glass<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.840> no<00:01:37.110> mobs<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.619> spawn<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.040> here

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.880 

and<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:42.310> think<00:01:43.060> next<00:01:43.630> we'll<00:01:43.810> go<00:01:44.110> take<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.500> look<00:01:44.710> at

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
and I think next we'll go take a look at

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.660 
and I think next we'll go take a look at
the<00:01:45.070> belly<00:01:45.520> of<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.760> beast<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:49.030> we<00:01:49.120> go

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.350 

ok<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.870> collection<00:01:55.440> room<00:01:56.210> we're<00:01:57.210> at

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
ok this is the collection room we're at

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
ok this is the collection room we're at
level<00:01:57.720> 4<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.240> you<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:00.600> mobs<00:02:00.810> dying<00:02:01.170> up

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
level 4 so you see some mobs dying up

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.109 
level 4 so you see some mobs dying up
there<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.900> far<00:02:04.170> I've<00:02:04.380> benchmark<00:02:05.100> Reb<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:06.060> at

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
there so far I've benchmark Reb a at

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.730 
there so far I've benchmark Reb a at
1152<00:02:09.140> items<00:02:10.140> per<00:02:10.350> hour<00:02:10.820> that's<00:02:11.820> far<00:02:12.570> far<00:02:13.530> below

1152 items per hour that's far far below
what<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.880> expected<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:18.120> hopefully<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.780> take

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
what I expected so hopefully we can take

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.720 
what I expected so hopefully we can take
a<00:02:19.140> quick<00:02:19.410> look<00:02:19.560> around<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.160> suss<00:02:21.000> out<00:02:21.290> why

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
a quick look around and suss out why

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.790 
a quick look around and suss out why
things<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:23.970> wrong<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:26.430> used<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.270> single

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
things are going wrong I used a single

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.150 
things are going wrong I used a single
lava<00:02:28.800> grinder<00:02:29.310> down<00:02:29.820> here<00:02:30.060> at<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.210> bottom

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
closed it in with glass so I could debug

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.090 
closed it in with glass so I could debug
this<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.910> case<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.360> bottleneck<00:02:37.100> which

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
this in case it's the bottleneck which

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.940 
this in case it's the bottleneck which
it<00:02:38.640> doesn't<00:02:38.880> look<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.800> mean<00:02:40.800> this

rumor is that the bailout clause from

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.420 
rumor is that the bailout clause from
the<00:02:56.660> mob<00:02:56.840> spawning<00:02:57.200> algorithm<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.760> gone

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
the mob spawning algorithm is gone

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.410 
the mob spawning algorithm is gone
algorithm<00:03:01.430> sorry<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> still<00:03:05.030> cleared<00:03:05.300> it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
algorithm sorry but I still cleared it

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.330 
algorithm sorry but I still cleared it
out<00:03:05.510> just<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.560> eliminate<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:07.100> as<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> variable

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
out just to eliminate that as a variable

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.690 
out just to eliminate that as a variable
so<00:03:10.340> about<00:03:10.670> 75%<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.810> mobs<00:03:12.020> die<00:03:12.550> just<00:03:13.550> from

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
so about 75% of the mobs die just from

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.110 
so about 75% of the mobs die just from
the<00:03:14.480> drop<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:16.040> put<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.340> lava<00:03:16.550> grinder<00:03:17.000> in

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the drop and I put the lava grinder in

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.250 
the drop and I put the lava grinder in
and<00:03:17.270> to<00:03:17.420> clean<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.810> whatever<00:03:18.470> was<00:03:18.650> left<00:03:21.190> so

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
and to clean up whatever was left so

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.350 
and to clean up whatever was left so
it's<00:03:24.260> dark<00:03:24.530> down<00:03:24.560> here<00:03:24.970> but<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.120> floor<00:03:26.300> is

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
it's dark down here but the floor is

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.720 
it's dark down here but the floor is
glass<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.650> roof<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.160> nothing<00:03:28.580> can

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
glass like the roof so that nothing can

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.960 
glass like the roof so that nothing can
spawn<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.070> lit<00:03:31.280> up<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.400> immediate

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
spawn and I just lit up the immediate

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.979 
spawn and I just lit up the immediate
area<00:03:33.160> not<00:03:34.160> sure<00:03:34.310> if<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.519> could<00:03:34.670> see<00:03:34.850> this<00:03:35.060> I'll

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
area not sure if you could see this I'll

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.250 
area not sure if you could see this I'll
probably<00:03:36.200> key<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.560> up<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.830> editing<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:38.260> this

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
probably key it up and editing but this

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.460 
probably key it up and editing but this
is<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.470> underside<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.069> channel<00:03:40.430> system

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
is the underside of the channel system

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.610 
is the underside of the channel system
they're<00:03:42.470> basically<00:03:43.600> 70<00:03:44.600> or<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:44.900> block<00:03:45.350> long

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
they're basically 70 or so block long

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.259 
they're basically 70 or so block long
channels<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:47.269> i<00:03:47.330> copied<00:03:48.050> and<00:03:48.470> rotate<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.130> and

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
channels that i copied and rotate it and

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.720 
channels that i copied and rotate it and
cloned<00:03:50.269> in<00:03:50.569> MCEdit<00:03:52.239> their<00:03:53.239> flat<00:03:53.510> channels

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
cloned in MCEdit their flat channels

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.259 
cloned in MCEdit their flat channels
meaning<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.300> there's<00:03:57.019> a<00:03:57.410> half-step<00:03:58.269> source

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
meaning that there's a half-step source

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.130 
meaning that there's a half-step source
blocks<00:03:59.660> running<00:04:00.620> water<00:04:01.209> half-step<00:04:02.209> source

blocks running water half-step source
blocks<00:04:03.470> running<00:04:03.920> water<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:06.070> that's<00:04:07.070> repeated

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
blocks running water so that's repeated

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.910 
blocks running water so that's repeated
for<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:07.880> entire<00:04:08.150> length<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.630> channel<00:04:08.920> and

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
for the entire length of the channel and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.280 
for the entire length of the channel and
I<00:04:10.220> did<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.519> just<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:10.970> keep<00:04:11.180> things<00:04:11.239> a<00:04:11.690> simple

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
I did that just to keep things a simple

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.160 
I did that just to keep things a simple
fast<00:04:12.829> for<00:04:13.220> construction<00:04:13.670> I<00:04:14.030> mean<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.900> did<00:04:15.049> this

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
fast for construction I mean I did this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.270 
fast for construction I mean I did this
in<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:15.829> lesson<00:04:16.640> afternoon<00:04:18.940> so

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
in like lesson afternoon so

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.280 
in like lesson afternoon so
I<00:04:21.340> mean<00:04:21.970> people<00:04:22.330> are<00:04:22.540> claiming<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:23.080> they're

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
I mean people are claiming that they're

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.850 
I mean people are claiming that they're
getting<00:04:23.730> ten<00:04:24.990> fifteen<00:04:25.990> thousand<00:04:26.470> items<00:04:26.560> an

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
getting ten fifteen thousand items an

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.450 
getting ten fifteen thousand items an
hour<00:04:27.010> out<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:27.940> traps<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:29.190> mean<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.280> don't<00:04:30.400> know

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
hour out of traps I mean I don't know

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.490 
hour out of traps I mean I don't know
that<00:04:30.669> they're<00:04:30.850> this<00:04:31.030> size<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.660> would<00:04:32.410> imagine

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
that they're this size I would imagine

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.360 
that they're this size I would imagine
they're<00:04:32.950> on<00:04:33.070> this<00:04:33.280> scale<00:04:35.130> but<00:04:36.130> i'm<00:04:36.220> only

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
they're on this scale but i'm only

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.510 
they're on this scale but i'm only
getting<00:04:36.840> 1100<00:04:38.970> so<00:04:39.970> i<00:04:40.560> want<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.590> find<00:04:41.740> out<00:04:41.919> why

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.890 

you<00:04:45.520> could<00:04:45.669> see<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.850> few<00:04:45.910> mobs<00:04:46.300> getting<00:04:46.690> backed

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you could see a few mobs getting backed

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.379 
you could see a few mobs getting backed
up<00:04:47.110> there<00:04:47.350> but<00:04:48.280> i<00:04:48.310> haven't<00:04:48.669> seen<00:04:48.790> any<00:04:49.000> sort<00:04:49.300> of

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
up there but i haven't seen any sort of

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.810 
up there but i haven't seen any sort of
a<00:04:49.450> sustained<00:04:49.900> bottleneck<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:54.280> again<00:04:54.550> here's

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
a sustained bottleneck and again here's

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.090 
a sustained bottleneck and again here's
the<00:04:54.880> collection<00:04:55.360> room<00:04:55.540> it's<00:04:56.440> right<00:04:56.770> under<00:04:57.010> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
the collection room it's right under the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.140 
the collection room it's right under the
center<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.550> trap<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:59.800> try<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.250> regulate

which<00:05:01.540> chunks<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.680> mobs<00:05:02.890> spawn<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.990> that's

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
which chunks the mobs spawn and that's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.680 
which chunks the mobs spawn and that's
another<00:05:05.230> thing<00:05:05.500> that<00:05:05.680> I'm<00:05:05.740> not<00:05:05.860> sure<00:05:06.130> about

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
another thing that I'm not sure about

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.270 
another thing that I'm not sure about
some<00:05:07.690> people<00:05:07.960> have<00:05:08.050> been<00:05:08.169> saying<00:05:08.440> that<00:05:09.130> the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
some people have been saying that the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.260 
some people have been saying that the
maximum<00:05:09.460> spawn<00:05:10.090> distance<00:05:10.660> is<00:05:11.020> now<00:05:12.270> 250

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
maximum spawn distance is now 250

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.100 
maximum spawn distance is now 250
something<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:13.990> want<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.229> say<00:05:14.400> rather<00:05:15.400> than<00:05:16.110> 144

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
something I want to say rather than 144

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.830 
something I want to say rather than 144
by<00:05:17.350> 144<00:05:18.180> for<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.240> immediate<00:05:21.479> 81<00:05:22.479> chunks

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
by 144 for the immediate 81 chunks

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.210 
by 144 for the immediate 81 chunks
around<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.200> player<00:05:24.270> so<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.979> haven't<00:05:26.979> been<00:05:27.070> able

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
around the player so I haven't been able

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.550 
around the player so I haven't been able
to<00:05:27.400> verify<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:28.030> so<00:05:28.720> maybe<00:05:28.930> someone<00:05:29.350> can

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
to verify that so maybe someone can

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.040 
to verify that so maybe someone can
chime<00:05:29.890> in

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.150 

okay<00:05:35.580> here<00:05:36.580> we<00:05:36.610> are<00:05:36.820> at<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.060> observation<00:05:37.870> deck

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
okay here we are at the observation deck

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.760 
okay here we are at the observation deck
this<00:05:39.160> is<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.370> spawning<00:05:39.700> floor<00:05:40.030> here<00:05:40.770> and

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
this is the spawning floor here and

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.990 
this is the spawning floor here and
there's<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.460> drop<00:05:43.300> chute<00:05:43.540> in<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:43.840> center<00:05:44.170> and

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
there's the drop chute in the center and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.550 
there's the drop chute in the center and
you<00:05:46.000> can<00:05:46.150> see<00:05:46.330> all<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.540> currents<00:05:47.020> are<00:05:47.140> pushing

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
you can see all the currents are pushing

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.370 
you can see all the currents are pushing
the<00:05:47.680> mobs<00:05:47.860> in<00:05:48.070> there<00:05:48.900> the<00:05:49.900> only<00:05:50.110> really

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
the mobs in there the only really

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.550 
the mobs in there the only really
problem<00:05:50.770> i<00:05:50.860> have<00:05:51.070> is<00:05:51.310> when<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.120> spider<00:05:52.570> or<00:05:52.930> a

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
problem i have is when a spider or a

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.850 
problem i have is when a spider or a
couple<00:05:53.890> of<00:05:54.100> spiders<00:05:54.490> as<00:05:55.090> you're<00:05:55.300> about<00:05:55.390> to<00:05:55.510> see

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
couple of spiders as you're about to see

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.770 
couple of spiders as you're about to see
get<00:05:56.860> pushed<00:05:57.160> to<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.430> shaft<00:05:57.640> they'll<00:05:58.420> sort<00:05:58.630> of

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
get pushed to the shaft they'll sort of

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.220 
get pushed to the shaft they'll sort of
plug<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.230> up<00:05:59.320> for<00:05:59.950> a<00:05:59.980> little<00:06:00.160> while<00:06:01.230> especially

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
plug it up for a little while especially

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.840 
plug it up for a little while especially
if<00:06:02.290> they<00:06:02.410> come<00:06:02.590> from<00:06:02.770> different<00:06:03.010> sides<00:06:03.340> I

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.130 

think<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:06.970> real<00:06:07.090> problem<00:06:07.120> we're<00:06:07.690> facing<00:06:07.720> here

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
think the real problem we're facing here

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.090 
think the real problem we're facing here
efficiency<00:06:08.920> was<00:06:09.070> is<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:11.440> flat<00:06:11.680> channel

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
efficiency was is the flat channel

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.460 
efficiency was is the flat channel
system<00:06:12.540> you<00:06:13.540> can<00:06:13.690> see<00:06:13.870> there's<00:06:14.140> zombies

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
system you can see there's zombies

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.930 
system you can see there's zombies
getting<00:06:15.100> hung<00:06:15.580> up<00:06:15.760> on<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.090> half<00:06:16.270> blocks

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
getting hung up on the half blocks

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.790 
getting hung up on the half blocks
there's<00:06:18.940> some<00:06:19.210> bunch<00:06:19.960> of<00:06:20.140> mobs<00:06:20.290> getting<00:06:20.680> hung

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
there's some bunch of mobs getting hung

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.630 
there's some bunch of mobs getting hung
up<00:06:21.630> I<00:06:22.980> really<00:06:23.980> think<00:06:24.100> it's<00:06:24.280> a<00:06:24.340> combination

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
up I really think it's a combination

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.440 
up I really think it's a combination
though<00:06:25.120> of<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:26.530> half<00:06:26.710> steps<00:06:27.070> and<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:28.180> length

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
though of the half steps and the length

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.150 
though of the half steps and the length
of<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.720> transport<00:06:29.290> system<00:06:31.920> you<00:06:32.920> know<00:06:33.040> it

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
of the transport system you know it

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.180 
of the transport system you know it
could<00:06:33.250> take<00:06:33.570> a<00:06:34.570> couple<00:06:34.720> of<00:06:35.110> minutes<00:06:35.410> for<00:06:35.950> a<00:06:35.980> mob

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
could take a couple of minutes for a mob

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.800 
could take a couple of minutes for a mob
to<00:06:36.370> be<00:06:36.490> pushed<00:06:36.730> to<00:06:36.850> the<00:06:37.030> center<00:06:37.360> there<00:06:38.070> and

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
to be pushed to the center there and

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.350 
to be pushed to the center there and
really<00:06:40.810> I<00:06:40.990> think<00:06:41.050> I<00:06:41.830> should<00:06:42.730> be<00:06:42.760> killing<00:06:43.120> them

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
really I think I should be killing them

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.600 
really I think I should be killing them
sooner<00:06:43.900> because<00:06:44.680> there's<00:06:44.980> a<00:06:45.040> cap<00:06:45.310> of<00:06:45.340> a

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
sooner because there's a cap of a

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.700 
sooner because there's a cap of a
hundred<00:06:45.940> hostile<00:06:46.390> mobs<00:06:47.100> so<00:06:48.100> I<00:06:49.380> think<00:06:50.380> what<00:06:50.680> I

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
hundred hostile mobs so I think what I

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.760 
hundred hostile mobs so I think what I
have<00:06:50.860> to<00:06:50.980> do<00:06:51.190> is<00:06:51.600> kill<00:06:52.600> them<00:06:52.780> sooner<00:06:53.200> change

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
have to do is kill them sooner change

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.180 
have to do is kill them sooner change
them<00:06:53.950> into<00:06:54.450> items<00:06:55.450> and<00:06:55.890> that<00:06:56.890> way<00:06:57.040> I'm

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
them into items and that way I'm

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.270 
them into items and that way I'm
transporting<00:06:57.850> the<00:06:58.510> items<00:06:58.920> for<00:06:59.920> a<00:06:59.950> longer

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
transporting the items for a longer

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.370 
transporting the items for a longer
amount<00:07:00.430> of<00:07:00.760> time<00:07:00.840> towards<00:07:01.840> the<00:07:01.840> collection

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
amount of time towards the collection

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.620 
amount of time towards the collection
area<00:07:02.680> rather<00:07:03.370> than<00:07:03.520> transporting<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.420> mobs

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
area rather than transporting the mobs

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.560 
area rather than transporting the mobs
if<00:07:05.620> anyone<00:07:05.950> has<00:07:06.100> any<00:07:06.250> ideas<00:07:06.370> for<00:07:06.940> improvements

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
if anyone has any ideas for improvements

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.680 
if anyone has any ideas for improvements
or<00:07:07.810> if<00:07:08.560> you<00:07:08.650> think<00:07:08.860> I've<00:07:08.980> missed<00:07:09.220> anything<00:07:09.690> let

or if you think I've missed anything let
