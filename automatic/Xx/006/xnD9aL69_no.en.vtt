take it off very easy and here this is
the<00:02:58.200> solution<00:02:58.859> for<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.250> problem<00:03:00.620> but<00:03:01.620> it's

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
the solution for the problem but it's

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.069 
the solution for the problem but it's
only<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.190> solution<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.819> problem<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.750> if

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
only the solution if the problem is if

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.960 
only the solution if the problem is if
the<00:03:04.319> fan<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:05.010> like<00:03:05.780> very<00:03:06.780> dirty<00:03:07.019> if<00:03:07.859> its<00:03:08.099> effect

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the fan is like very dirty if its effect

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.670 
the fan is like very dirty if its effect
you<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.390> go<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.900> reparation<00:03:10.440> because

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
you have to go to the reparation because

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.860 
you have to go to the reparation because
I<00:03:10.799> don't<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.370> any<00:03:11.549> solution<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.269> but

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
I don't have any solution for that but
