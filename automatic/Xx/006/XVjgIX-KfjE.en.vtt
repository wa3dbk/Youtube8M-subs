a smooth surface on that final
microphone<00:04:45.260> layer<00:04:45.470> then<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.730> most

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
microphone layer then this is the most

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.820 
microphone layer then this is the most
critical<00:04:47.120> step<00:04:47.360> we<00:04:47.930> want<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:48.230> create<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.500> smooth

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
of a microphone layer as you can which

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.570 
of a microphone layer as you can which
will<00:04:50.720> enhance<00:04:51.170> your<00:04:51.500> contouring<00:04:52.430> and

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
will enhance your contouring and

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.540 
will enhance your contouring and
polishing<00:04:53.030> efforts<00:04:53.650> I'll<00:04:54.650> do<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:54.860> final<00:04:55.190> cure

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
polishing efforts I'll do a final cure

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.550 
polishing efforts I'll do a final cure
for<00:04:55.730> sixty<00:04:56.120> seconds<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:56.930> micro<00:04:57.380> fill

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
for sixty seconds of that micro fill

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.490 
for sixty seconds of that micro fill
surface<00:04:58.120> so<00:04:59.120> now<00:04:59.270> I'm<00:04:59.360> going<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.660> polish<00:05:00.140> the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
surface so now I'm going to polish the

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.480 
surface so now I'm going to polish the
distal<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:02.360> central<00:05:02.720> incisor<00:05:03.310> first<00:05:04.310> with

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
distal of the central incisor first with

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.100 
distal of the central incisor first with
the<00:05:04.640> diamond<00:05:05.090> strip<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.540> then<00:05:05.660> going<00:05:05.930> into

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
the diamond strip and then going into

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.430 
the diamond strip and then going into
the<00:05:06.310> flexi<00:05:07.310> strips<00:05:07.670> to<00:05:08.330> get<00:05:08.480> an<00:05:08.570> extra<00:05:09.080> smooth

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
the flexi strips to get an extra smooth

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.290 
the flexi strips to get an extra smooth
polished<00:05:09.860> surface<00:05:10.520> on<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.820> distal<00:05:11.210> two

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
polished surface on the distal two

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.340 
polished surface on the distal two
central<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:12.380> then<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.620> can<00:05:12.680> layer<00:05:13.100> my<00:05:14.350> final

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
central so then I can layer my final

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.760 
central so then I can layer my final
layer<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.190> micro<00:05:16.610> fill<00:05:16.850> on<00:05:17.140> to<00:05:18.140> the

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
layer of the micro fill on to the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.610 
layer of the micro fill on to the
lateral<00:05:19.130> incisor<00:05:19.840> so<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.020> I<00:05:21.050> can<00:05:21.380> get<00:05:21.560> a

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
lateral incisor so that I can get a

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.610 
lateral incisor so that I can get a
blend<00:05:22.610> that<00:05:22.700> right<00:05:22.850> on<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.990> distal<00:05:24.410> the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
blend that right on to the distal the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.110 
blend that right on to the distal the
central<00:05:24.980> incisor<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.430> not<00:05:25.640> have<00:05:25.790> to<00:05:25.910> worry

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
central incisor and not have to worry

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.060 
central incisor and not have to worry
about<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:26.510> those<00:05:26.900> two<00:05:27.290> layers<00:05:27.500> binding

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
about that those two layers binding

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.030 
about that those two layers binding
together<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:30.080> is<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.290> look<00:05:30.590> at<00:05:30.770> the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
together so this is a look at the

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.850 
together so this is a look at the
central<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.120> lateral<00:05:32.510> with<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.470> let<00:05:33.830> the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
central and the lateral with the let the

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.900 
central and the lateral with the let the
final<00:05:34.370> layer<00:05:34.520> is<00:05:34.550> complete<00:05:35.860> after<00:05:36.910> final

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
final layer is complete after final

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.880 
final layer is complete after final
curing<00:05:38.270> then<00:05:38.420> I<00:05:38.450> start<00:05:38.780> out<00:05:38.840> with<00:05:38.900> an<00:05:39.110> ET<00:05:39.590> burr

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
curing then I start out with an ET burr

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.650 
curing then I start out with an ET burr
from<00:05:40.100> brass<00:05:40.430> ler<00:05:40.670> to<00:05:40.910> start<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.450> initial
