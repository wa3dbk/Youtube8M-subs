00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:22.829 
to see if it works but I have actually

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.489 
to see if it works but I have actually
found<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.220> way<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.519> doing<00:00:23.669> it<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.349> you

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
found a way of doing it and what you

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.640 
found a way of doing it and what you
need<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.579> need<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.759> cable<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.839> goes<00:00:27.900> from

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
need is you need a cable that goes from

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.310

equally you need a cable that goes from

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
equally you need a cable that goes from
your<00:00:36.210> keyboard<00:00:36.680> which<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.920> case<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
your keyboard which in this case is a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.960 
your keyboard which in this case is a
MIDI<00:00:38.610> cable<00:00:39.090> which<00:00:39.870> goes<00:00:40.170> into<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.650> USB<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.850> my

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
MIDI cable which goes into a USB into my

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.630 
MIDI cable which goes into a USB into my
laptop<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.740> then<00:00:43.740> run<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> through<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.280> piece<00:00:44.490> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
laptop I then run it through a piece of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
laptop I then run it through a piece of
software<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> laptop<00:00:45.960> called<00:00:46.470> or<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.830> some

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
software on the laptop called or do some

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
software on the laptop called or do some
MIDI<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.150> I'll<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> link<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
MIDI and I'll put the link of that in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.550 
MIDI and I'll put the link of that in
the<00:00:49.320> description<00:00:51.020> basically<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> allows

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
the description basically what it allows

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.730 
the description basically what it allows
me<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.750> allows<00:00:55.020> me<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.290> combine<00:00:55.500> my

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
me to do is it allows me to combine my

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.400 
me to do is it allows me to combine my
guitar<00:00:56.360> through<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.570> keyboard<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.260> give

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
guitar through the keyboard so if I give

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:09.560 
guitar through the keyboard so if I give
you<00:00:58.470> an<00:00:58.530> example<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.130> just<00:00:59.160> play<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you an example if I just play so that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.530 
you an example if I just play so that
that<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> trumpet<00:01:10.970> sound<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> just

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that is the trumpet sound if I just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910 
that is the trumpet sound if I just
change<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> trumpet<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.500> something<00:01:13.770> else

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
change the trumpet for something else

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.370 
change the trumpet for something else
let's<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.400> change<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> horn

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:35.000 

something<00:01:22.380> else

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.920 

so<00:01:36.010> every<00:01:36.220> time<00:01:36.370> I<00:01:36.490> change<00:01:36.730> my<00:01:37.270> instrument<00:01:37.780> on

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
so every time I change my instrument on

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.230 
so every time I change my instrument on
the<00:01:37.960> keyboard<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:38.770> get<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.370> different<00:01:39.580> sound<00:01:39.970> by

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
the keyboard I get a different sound by

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.120 
the keyboard I get a different sound by
simply<00:01:40.540> playing<00:01:40.750> my<00:01:40.960> guitar<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.560> getting<00:01:42.070> it

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
simply playing my guitar and getting it

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.050 
simply playing my guitar and getting it
through<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.400> keyboard

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
through the keyboard

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.860 
through the keyboard
so<00:01:47.370> also<00:01:48.370> like<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:48.880> still<00:01:49.090> get<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.330> sentence<00:01:49.660> by

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
so also like I still get the sentence by

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.850 
so also like I still get the sentence by
playing<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.910> my<00:01:51.910> keyboard<00:01:52.210> itself

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.790 

so<00:01:56.730> if<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.300> was<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.480> set<00:01:57.810> something<00:01:58.080> away<00:01:58.470> just

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
so if I was to set something away just

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:45.720 
so if I was to set something away just
simply<00:01:59.400> big

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.090 

so<00:02:46.730> basically<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:48.019> sound<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.680> just<00:02:48.709> play<00:02:49.069> a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
so basically that sound you just play a

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.520 
so basically that sound you just play a
guitar<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.060> via<00:02:50.209> keyboard<00:02:50.420> nice<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.200> simple

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
guitar so via keyboard nice and simple

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.800 
guitar so via keyboard nice and simple
you<00:02:52.160> have<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.430> play<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.330> get<00:02:53.569> used<00:02:53.750> to

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
you have to play you have to get used to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.420 
you have to play you have to get used to
how<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.080> play<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.530> because<00:02:54.860> there<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.160> bit

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
how you play it because there is a bit

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.170 
how you play it because there is a bit
of<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.580> time<00:02:55.819> delay<00:02:56.180> but<00:02:56.959> otherwise<00:02:58.000> that's<00:02:59.000> how

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
of a time delay but otherwise that's how

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.940 
of a time delay but otherwise that's how
you<00:02:59.239> do<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.630> so<00:02:59.810> hopefully<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.680> found<00:03:00.709> that

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
you do it so hopefully you found that

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.630 
you do it so hopefully you found that
abuse

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
abuse

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.789 
abuse
