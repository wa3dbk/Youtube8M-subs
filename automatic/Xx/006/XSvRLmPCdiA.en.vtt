so that could fit through the circle and

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.350 
so that could fit through the circle and
you<00:03:33.320> feed<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.590> through<00:03:34.329> pull<00:03:35.329> it<00:03:36.459> go<00:03:37.459> over<00:03:37.970> the

and then pull and you'll have liked that
little<00:03:54.079> contraption<00:03:54.739> see<00:03:55.420> then<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:57.320> should

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
little contraption see then you should

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.470 
little contraption see then you should
probably<00:03:57.560> put<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.040> rubber<00:03:58.220> stopper<00:03:58.579> on<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.209> I

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
probably put a rubber stopper on so I

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.680 
probably put a rubber stopper on so I
just<00:03:59.690> forgot<00:04:00.019> again<00:04:00.350> but<00:04:01.310> um<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:02.420> have<00:04:02.570> the

out of the place is just this flat one
like<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.489> said<00:04:14.080> then<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.590> curved<00:04:16.160> 1<00:04:16.370> sideways

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
like I said then the curved 1 sideways

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.800 
like I said then the curved 1 sideways
on<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.479> board<00:04:18.229> see<00:04:18.470> how<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.680> nose<00:04:18.979> up<00:04:19.310> here

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
on the board see how the nose up here

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.469 
on the board see how the nose up here
it's<00:04:20.810> like<00:04:20.959> however<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.130> then<00:04:22.490> there's<00:04:23.330> the

either a circle like this with a little
triangle<00:06:40.140> cut<00:06:40.290> out<00:06:40.500> piece<00:06:40.740> and<00:06:41.010> it<00:06:41.820> has<00:06:41.970> like

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
that little string loop thing which is

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.780 
that little string loop thing which is
basically<00:06:43.950> with<00:06:44.160> this<00:06:44.310> serves<00:06:44.520> its<00:06:44.730> purpose

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
then this is the main big circle one

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.660 
then this is the main big circle one
except<00:06:50.520> obviously<00:06:51.120> it's<00:06:51.750> not<00:06:51.810> big<00:06:52.170> and<00:06:52.670> circle

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
here's a better picture right there see

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.400 
here's a better picture right there see
a<00:06:59.580> big<00:06:59.790> circle<00:06:59.970> thing<00:07:00.300> onto<00:07:00.420> the<00:07:00.570> GoPro<00:07:00.930> that's

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
a big circle thing onto the GoPro that's

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.120 
a big circle thing onto the GoPro that's
what<00:07:01.650> it<00:07:01.680> is<00:07:02.000> but<00:07:03.000> um<00:07:03.650> this<00:07:04.650> is<00:07:04.800> just<00:07:04.980> so<00:07:05.070> it

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
what it is but um this is just so it

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.500 
what it is but um this is just so it
doesn't<00:07:05.160> fall<00:07:05.460> if<00:07:05.610> I<00:07:05.670> recommend<00:07:06.150> getting<00:07:06.240> that

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
doesn't fall if I recommend getting that

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.050 
doesn't fall if I recommend getting that
big<00:07:06.720> orange<00:07:06.960> back<00:07:07.470> piece<00:07:07.830> for<00:07:08.100> it<00:07:08.250> that<00:07:08.580> makes

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
big orange back piece for it that makes

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.270 
big orange back piece for it that makes
it<00:07:09.210> float<00:07:09.510> if<00:07:09.690> it<00:07:09.810> falls<00:07:09.990> off<00:07:10.200> this<00:07:10.890> isn't<00:07:11.250> a

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
it float if it falls off this isn't a

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.330 
it float if it falls off this isn't a
hundred<00:07:11.550> percent<00:07:11.640> proof<00:07:12.150> but<00:07:12.480> I<00:07:12.750> mean<00:07:13.340> not

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
hundred percent proof but I mean not

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.620 
hundred percent proof but I mean not
like<00:07:14.460> proof<00:07:14.730> but<00:07:14.910> like<00:07:15.060> it's<00:07:15.240> not<00:07:15.300> going<00:07:15.540> to

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
like proof but like it's not going to

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.690 
like proof but like it's not going to
work<00:07:16.110> one<00:07:16.350> hundred<00:07:16.560> percent<00:07:16.590> of<00:07:16.860> the<00:07:16.920> time<00:07:17.010> it

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
work one hundred percent of the time it

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.190 
work one hundred percent of the time it
could<00:07:17.820> fall<00:07:18.090> off<00:07:18.270> and<00:07:18.570> don't<00:07:18.780> leave<00:07:18.930> it<00:07:19.080> in<00:07:19.140> the

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
could fall off and don't leave it in the

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.270 
could fall off and don't leave it in the
Sun<00:07:19.440> because<00:07:20.480> right<00:07:23.210> there<00:07:24.210> it<00:07:24.840> says<00:07:25.160> that<00:07:26.160> it

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
Sun because right there it says that it

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.010 
Sun because right there it says that it
can<00:07:26.430> come<00:07:26.640> up<00:07:26.790> can<00:07:27.000> be<00:07:27.150> removed<00:07:27.480> when<00:07:27.720> heat

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
can come up can be removed when heat

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.980 
can come up can be removed when heat
from<00:07:28.290> hair<00:07:28.530> dryer<00:07:28.830> or<00:07:29.660> obviously<00:07:30.660> song<00:07:30.840> is
