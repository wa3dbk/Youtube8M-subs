few<00:00:48.690> assists<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> eight<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:49.739> nine<00:00:49.950> he's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
few assists now is it eight or nine he's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
few assists now is it eight or nine he's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
start into a fat games from that deeper

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.000 
start into a fat games from that deeper
position<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.289> well<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> something<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
position as well which is something that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
position as well which is something that
Jared<00:00:56.370> did<00:00:56.520> well<00:00:56.670> last<00:00:56.850> season<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.899> struggled
