00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.019

 the normal 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.620
 the court the man it's true the school 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.030
 some Protestants one could be heavier friborg france 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.960

 stone the real difference for all with this championship everyone else 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.840
 desire 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810
 the Belgian footballer 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 make 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.710
 source ap 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.670
 I attacked all the time finally France 2 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.080
 Yes 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.320
 but it's so many years raphael tanoh 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.570
 this base had to adapt to the country 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.850
 after circulate 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 11 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.110
 with these two deadlines it's bad for a good it takes a lot of 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.830
 delay 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.260
 damas we will see how it is played 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.120
 and after in the head bourassa 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.120
 all games back on stage 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.670
 in summary the most English football 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.480
 these are the impacts 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.230
 and especially the fervor of the sporting players for their club 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.959
 at the google device level 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.179
 this case another mentality every game 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.549
 it's like a war 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.890
 we confuse you the greens you do on his age 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.579
 in the green 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.579
 all the teams think like that damas 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.340
 I hope all present in the oil 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 you told me about difficulties with the language of Shakespeare 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.089
 we could have thought 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.089
 I did not want to take 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.569
 so his wife arrived free he speaks for me including me 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.809
 the impact will try a lot of French satisfied in the evening 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.749
 in the duel of bottom of table 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.989
 in the end it's more sales 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.289
 finally to speak english 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.119
 to do 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.369
 his teammates 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.709
 it makes it even easier 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.420
 today you are a man with 8 shots on goal 2 8% riccio with time rikers 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.370
 so rough it is totally different from europe 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.459
 chamia 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.069
 so necessarily the pace nevertheless important 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069
 efforts will be softer 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.319
 you lose the ball had broken the record 50 meters master thirty degrees that's 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.909
 not easy 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.149
 fighting is an atmosphere 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.679
 why the public 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.759
 really behind his team 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.909
 no 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.119

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.899
 the traders the commune 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.839
 the 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.869
 a little tired of my race 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:02.609
 m 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.389
 it's a meeting in Alexandria 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.839
 then all together 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:09.999
 apart from that 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.049
 no problem otherwise with the greediest 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.530
 a great first this agreement will be found gathering 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.479
 it's also the first grand slam world cup on road in Africa 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.479
 mitsou the objectives of the guen 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.509
 failure to believe the first round 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.819
 françois fillon crowd 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.139

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.479
 only finally 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.029
 ok world cup entries this summer paris 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.210

 White 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.789

 cit maybe a plus for sportsmen 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.870
 yes I think inevitably 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.030
 in the professional environment or with the professional player 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.199
 not necessarily gold gesture 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.020
 for me 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 in fact because a little dull even not having 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.259
 for the player to be valid why mentally his luck 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.050
 luck two strong points 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.509
 this is very short 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.639
 France I think and I hope that it will be able to pay attention I could not 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.550
