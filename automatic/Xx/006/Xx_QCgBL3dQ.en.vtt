00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
so you do not know which figure you are

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
so you do not know which figure you are
getting<00:00:24.600> unless<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.710> feeling

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

method<00:00:27.590> who<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.189> no-brainer<00:00:29.580> he's<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
method who is a no-brainer he's just a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.000 
method who is a no-brainer he's just a
ball<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.130> he's<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.669> easy<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.390> find<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:34.010> Mario

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
ball and he's so easy to find out Mario

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.889 
ball and he's so easy to find out Mario
would<00:00:35.309> prop<00:00:35.579> Mario<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.270> dry<00:00:36.450> bones<00:00:36.750> would

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
would prop Mario and dry bones would

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
would prop Mario and dry bones would
probably<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:38.010> where<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:38.910> much

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
probably be one where there's not much

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.380 
probably be one where there's not much
but<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.469> feels<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.430> has<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
but this one feels like it has a lot of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.520 
but this one feels like it has a lot of
its<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.020> fat<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> I'm<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.899> sure<00:00:45.960> which

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
its kind of fat so I'm not sure which

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.670 
its kind of fat so I'm not sure which
one<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.010> guy<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> gonna<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.530> one

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
one this guy is gonna be and you get one

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.470 
one this guy is gonna be and you get one
figure<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.129> each<00:00:50.280> pack<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:52.710> actually<00:00:53.550> have

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.660 

another<00:00:57.480> series<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.260> first<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.980> unpack<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
another series the first one to unpack I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
another series the first one to unpack I
have<00:00:59.789> five<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.510> those<00:01:00.660> bags<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.350> that'll<00:01:01.680> be

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
have five of those bags but that'll be

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.880 
have five of those bags but that'll be
in<00:01:01.890> another<00:01:02.129> video<00:01:02.489> now<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.409> code<00:01:04.680> on

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
in another video now there is a code on

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.490 
in another video now there is a code on
the<00:01:05.040> back<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.479> code<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:10.140> actually

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the back and that's the code it actually

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.760 
the back and that's the code it actually
says<00:01:10.979> zero<00:01:11.460> five<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:12.150> three<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.930> oh<00:01:12.960> five<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
says zero five one three one oh five I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.700 
says zero five one three one oh five I
don't<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.060> tell<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.020> five

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't know if you can tell but the five

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.330 
don't know if you can tell but the five
is<00:01:17.930> underlined<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> let's<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is underlined so let's see what you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:42.710 
is underlined so let's see what you
figure<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.110> open<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.799> part<00:01:41.720> so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
figure we get so I can open this part so

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.499 
figure we get so I can open this part so
let's<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.610> bag<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.180> looks<00:01:45.329> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
let's take out the bag and it looks like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.499 
let's take out the bag and it looks like
we<00:01:45.689> got<00:01:46.280> Wario<00:01:49.729> show<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.270> looks

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we got Wario show that's what he looks

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.690 
we got Wario show that's what he looks
like<00:01:51.750> there's<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.590> instructions<00:01:53.369> but

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
like there's a little instructions but

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.550 
like there's a little instructions but
you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.450> probably<00:01:54.600> figure<00:01:54.899> them<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.350> your

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you can probably figure them out on your

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.550 
you can probably figure them out on your
own<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.850> let's<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.390> Wario<00:01:57.960> out<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:01.140> comes<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
own so let's take Wario out it comes in

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.840 
own so let's take Wario out it comes in
a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.920> tissue<00:02:02.219> paper<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:04.490> there's<00:02:05.490> his

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
a little tissue paper and there's his

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.270 
a little tissue paper and there's his
head

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
head

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.890 
head
and<00:02:10.190> that's<00:02:11.190> his<00:02:11.550> body<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:13.100> legs<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:15.270> put<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and that's his body and legs so put the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.480 
and that's his body and legs so put the
body<00:02:16.110> likes<00:02:16.440> together<00:02:16.830> that's<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.190> he<00:02:17.280> looks

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
body likes together that's what he looks

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.310 
body likes together that's what he looks
like<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:17.700> far<00:02:17.960> I'm<00:02:18.960> gonna<00:02:19.110> his<00:02:19.590> hands<00:02:19.920> move<00:02:20.280> and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
like so far I'm gonna his hands move and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.360 
like so far I'm gonna his hands move and
his<00:02:22.320> legs<00:02:22.620> move<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.280> let's<00:02:23.460> add<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.060> head

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
his legs move so let's add on the head

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:37.100 
his legs move so let's add on the head
and<00:02:27.410> there's<00:02:28.410> Wario<00:02:33.710> pretty<00:02:34.710> cool<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.960> get

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
and there's Wario pretty cool so you get

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.410 
and there's Wario pretty cool so you get
Wario<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.250> instruction<00:02:38.910> manual<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
Wario and the instruction manual that

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
Wario and the instruction manual that
you<00:02:39.660> could<00:02:39.810> figure<00:02:40.020> out<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.470> your<00:02:40.650> own<00:02:40.770> pretty

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you could figure out on your own pretty

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.280 
you could figure out on your own pretty
much<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.790> what's<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.720> why<00:02:42.959> are<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.110> over

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
much so what's that why are you over

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.570 
much so what's that why are you over
there<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:44.100> Wario<00:02:44.780> digit<00:02:45.780> code<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.100> second

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
there and Wario digit code is the second

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.970 
there and Wario digit code is the second
number<00:02:48.110> underlined<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:52.500> was<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.770> first

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
number underlined so that was the first

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.690 
number underlined so that was the first
big<00:02:53.220> let's<00:02:53.910> move<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.540> second<00:02:54.930> big<00:02:55.700> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
big let's move on to the second big and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.970 
big let's move on to the second big and
on<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.989> fourth<00:03:00.989> number<00:03:01.530> is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
on this one the fourth number is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.449 
on this one the fourth number is
underlined<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.820> three<00:03:03.209> which<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.660> right

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
underlined the three which is right

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.320 
underlined the three which is right
there<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:07.190> don't<00:03:08.190> know<00:03:08.430> if<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:09.120> that

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
there I don't know if you can see that

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.460 
there I don't know if you can see that
but<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.670> three<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.090> underlined<00:03:12.540> so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
but the this the three is underlined so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.780 
but the this the three is underlined so
let's<00:03:13.709> see<00:03:13.920> what<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.160> figure<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.519> get<00:03:14.670> in

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
let's see what you figure you get in

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:33.560 
let's see what you figure you get in
this<00:03:14.910> one<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:31.910> got<00:03:32.910> grabbed<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
this one this one got grabbed the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.910 
this one this one got grabbed the
instructions<00:03:35.630> order<00:03:36.630> eyes<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.170> instructions

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
instructions order eyes the instructions

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.600 
instructions order eyes the instructions
looks<00:03:38.850> like<00:03:39.000> we<00:03:39.150> got<00:03:39.410> dry<00:03:40.410> bones<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:44.310> one

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
looks like we got dry bones and this one

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.009 
looks like we got dry bones and this one
that<00:03:44.730> looks<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.299> little<00:03:45.510> harder<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
that looks like it's a little harder to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.050 
that looks like it's a little harder to
put<00:03:46.200> together<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:47.040> would<00:03:47.160> let's<00:03:47.760> see<00:03:47.970> if

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
put together but it would let's see if

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.970 
put together but it would let's see if
we<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.390> get<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:50.810> there's<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.930> tissue<00:03:52.260> paper<00:03:52.620> he

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
we can get it there's a tissue paper he

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.440 
we can get it there's a tissue paper he
comes<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:55.640> I'm<00:03:56.640> just<00:03:56.850> gonna<00:03:56.940> let<00:03:57.150> all<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
comes in and I'm just gonna let all the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.199 
comes in and I'm just gonna let all the
parts<00:03:58.410> splatter<00:03:58.860> on<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.190> floor<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:02.209> looks

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
parts splatter on the floor so looks

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.650 
parts splatter on the floor so looks
like<00:04:03.299> we<00:04:03.540> put<00:04:03.570> together<00:04:04.970> these<00:04:05.970> two<00:04:06.030> parts

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
like we put together these two parts

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.270 
like we put together these two parts
first<00:04:07.730> that's<00:04:08.730> what<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.030> looks<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:10.280> then

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
first that's what it looks like and then

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.770 
first that's what it looks like and then
it<00:04:11.519> looks<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:11.820> we<00:04:12.000> have<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.209> put<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> shovel

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
it looks like we have to put the shovel

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.710 
it looks like we have to put the shovel
together<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:15.840> looks<00:04:15.870> like

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.620 

oh<00:04:18.890> that<00:04:19.890> oh<00:04:21.920> I<00:04:22.920> get<00:04:23.220> it

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
oh that oh I get it

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.880 
oh that oh I get it
so<00:04:25.130> which<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.340> goes<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.170> top<00:04:28.470> shell

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
so which one that goes so the top shell

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.250 
so which one that goes so the top shell
goes<00:04:29.670> up<00:04:30.420> here<00:04:31.130> like<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:33.690> bottom<00:04:33.990> shell

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
goes up here like this the bottom shell

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:41.030 
goes up here like this the bottom shell
goes<00:04:34.710> down<00:04:35.160> here<00:04:38.450> like<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.440> that's<00:04:40.860> what

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
goes down here like that so that's what

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.240 
goes down here like that so that's what
a<00:04:41.070> shell<00:04:41.430> looks<00:04:41.700> like<00:04:41.910> that's<00:04:42.240> attached<00:04:43.250> and

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
a shell looks like that's attached and

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.320 
a shell looks like that's attached and
then<00:04:44.490> we<00:04:44.610> got<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.880> attach<00:04:45.120> his<00:04:45.300> head<00:04:47.330> and

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
then we got to attach his head and

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.220 
then we got to attach his head and
there's<00:04:48.540> dragons<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.290> think<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.860> broke<00:04:50.430> him<00:04:51.230> well

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
there's dragons I think I broke him well

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.010 
there's dragons I think I broke him well
I<00:04:52.260> broke<00:04:52.560> them<00:04:52.770> after<00:04:53.010> five<00:04:53.220> seconds<00:04:53.700> oh<00:04:57.020> not

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
I broke them after five seconds oh not

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.430 
I broke them after five seconds oh not
the<00:04:58.890> shell<00:04:59.160> has<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.370> stay<00:04:59.790> in<00:05:00.980> there<00:05:03.440> there's

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
the shell has to stay in there there's

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.080 
the shell has to stay in there there's
dry<00:05:04.680> bones<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:06.620> dry<00:05:07.620> bones<00:05:07.890> is<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:11.730> fourth

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
dry bones and dry bones is the fourth

dry bones and dry bones is the fourth
number<00:05:12.420> underlined<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.820> case<00:05:15.120> that's

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
number underlined in this case that's

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.020 
number underlined in this case that's
the<00:05:15.390> three<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:17.040> then<00:05:17.640> that's<00:05:17.850> the

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
the three and then that's the

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.280 
the three and then that's the
instructions<00:05:20.390> so<00:05:21.390> let's<00:05:21.540> get<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.750> little<00:05:21.990> ass

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290

gonna be tastier Peach so that's the
looks<00:05:32.370> like<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.820> zero<00:05:33.240> is<00:05:33.540> underlined<00:05:34.080> twice

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
looks like the zero is underlined twice

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.860 
looks like the zero is underlined twice
that's<00:05:36.120> where<00:05:36.300> just<00:05:36.510> those<00:05:36.630> aren't

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
that's where just those aren't

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:48.020
