what we call in the natural health world

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.109 
what we call in the natural health world
a<00:01:27.630> triple<00:01:28.110> threat<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.310> has<00:01:29.520> an<00:01:29.670> active

this<00:02:45.540> works<00:02:45.830> if<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.010> take<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> car<00:02:47.760> or<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.239> train

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this works if you take a car or a train

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.979 
this works if you take a car or a train
and<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.380> imagine<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.520> are<00:02:50.700> not

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
and you imagine that they are not

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.130 
and you imagine that they are not
metabolizing<00:02:51.989> their<00:02:52.200> fuel<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:53.040> coal<00:02:53.310> or<00:02:53.760> the

metabolizing their fuel the coal or the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.449 
metabolizing their fuel the coal or the
gasoline<00:02:55.140> very<00:02:55.440> well<00:02:55.650> you're<00:02:56.130> gonna<00:02:56.250> get<00:02:56.400> a

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
gasoline very well you're gonna get a

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.580 
gasoline very well you're gonna get a
lot<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.670> smoke<00:02:57.150> you're<00:02:57.660> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> get<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.260> lot

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
lot of smoke you're going to get a lot

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.710 
lot of smoke you're going to get a lot
of<00:02:58.739> inefficiencies<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.970> car<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> train

burning<00:03:27.840> its<00:03:28.110> fuel<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.610> answer<00:03:32.940> is

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
burning its fuel and the answer is

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.170 
burning its fuel and the answer is
absolutely<00:03:33.410> no<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> really

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
absolutely no and this is a really

really important fact

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
really important fact
so<00:03:37.760> brown<00:03:38.760> coffee<00:03:39.120> beans<00:03:39.600> have<00:03:40.410> been<00:03:40.799> dry

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
so brown coffee beans have been dry

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.090 
so brown coffee beans have been dry
roasted<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.660> they<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.769> different

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
roasted and so they have a different

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.360 
roasted and so they have a different
smell<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.760> have<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> different<00:03:45.420> flavor<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
smell they have a different flavor and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.820 
smell they have a different flavor and
they<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.640> removed<00:03:48.540> all<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.440> chlorogenic

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
they have removed all of the chlorogenic

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.210 
they have removed all of the chlorogenic
acid<00:03:50.670> when<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.330> dry<00:03:51.660> roast<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.230> which<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.650> four

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
acid when you dry roast it which is four

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.949 
acid when you dry roast it which is four
hundred<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.640> seventy<00:03:54.239> four<00:03:54.510> hundred<00:03:54.870> and

example of that dr. Lindsay are these

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.309 
example of that dr. Lindsay are these
typical<00:04:37.180> results<00:04:37.690> because<00:04:37.930> people<00:04:38.199> are

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
typical results because people are

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.920 
typical results because people are
losing<00:04:38.500> three<00:04:38.889> pounds<00:04:39.310> in<00:04:39.430> four<00:04:39.699> days<00:04:39.880> or<00:04:40.270> six

pounds<00:04:41.139> in<00:04:41.470> five<00:04:41.740> days<00:04:42.009> and<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.699> answer<00:04:43.000> is

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
pounds in five days and the answer is

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.260 
pounds in five days and the answer is
yes<00:04:43.620> it's<00:04:44.620> amazing<00:04:44.919> but<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.580> answer<00:04:45.880> is<00:04:46.000> yes

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270

these<00:04:46.569> are<00:04:46.630> typical<00:04:47.410> results<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.400> it's

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
these are typical results and it's

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.760 
these are typical results and it's
because<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.240> mechanism<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.870> action<00:04:50.050> but<00:04:50.710> I

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
because of the mechanism of action but I

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.640 
because of the mechanism of action but I
always<00:04:51.400> try<00:04:51.819> to<00:04:51.849> get<00:04:52.780> people<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.139> make<00:04:53.410> sure

approximately two beats per minute now
that's<00:06:20.500> amazing<00:06:20.889> because<00:06:21.789> it's<00:06:22.449> speeding<00:06:22.900> up

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
that's amazing because it's speeding up

that's amazing because it's speeding up
metabolism<00:06:23.669> yet<00:06:24.669> it's<00:06:24.940> lowering<00:06:25.599> the

metabolism yet it's lowering the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.770 
metabolism yet it's lowering the
heartbeat<00:06:26.620> so<00:06:26.979> it's<00:06:27.190> not<00:06:27.520> a<00:06:27.550> stimulant<00:06:28.090> and<00:06:28.389> no

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
heartbeat so it's not a stimulant and no

heartbeat so it's not a stimulant and no
it<00:06:29.050> does
