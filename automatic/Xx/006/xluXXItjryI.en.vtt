00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:17.820
 so I will introduce you to the citroÃ«n 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:20.090
 c4 1 liter 6 hdi of 2006 already we are going 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.090
 open 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.680
 look 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.680
 the back of his vehicles 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:42.910
 opening without lock 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:45.920
 here is a pusher system so that's it 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:01:03.699
 the interior is lit by small 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:01:05.180
 lights so logo chrome small details 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.340
 so the back 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.120
 four months is the model pack so 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.950
 not two there are no electric windows 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.540
 in back 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:23.530
 So here's something to tidy up with 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.530
 head restraint nevertheless 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:46.479
 so simple lock here and elsewhere there in 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.479
 has no power windows in the front 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:02:06.140
 various storage places here there it 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:14.360
 there is also the cigarette lighter here other 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 storage so has it here we have the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:23.660
 outline all the different 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:28.489
 information on the holds so the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.069
 kilometers that I put in display 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.700
 after i can remove them one of course 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.209
 with the little button which then so there 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.420
 it is for belts the speed of 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:46.220
 kilometers without losing myself temperature 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.480
 engine and km that remained to be done before 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:55.220
 the reserve or not finally the kilometers 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:00.200
 this case I believe as in at 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:07.750
 flying for the radio that's for the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.750
 limiters and cruise control 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.630
 have more or less 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.630
 and then I think so there we have 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.959
 little fantasy mirror here too 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:41.000
 here you know everything now on the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:44.540
 citroen hdi a liter 6 if I forgot this 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.409
 vehicle has a turbo so be careful 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.810
 at startup was logically waiting for that 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.680
 lubrication are done otherwise you 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.430
 risk breaking the engine 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.659
 so I usually expect a 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.049
 ten seconds before starting to 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.849
 accelerate 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:06.409
 so here you try it put the 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:10.040
 contact so I was waiting like everything 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.650
 diesel but do you want to wait 10 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.790
 seconds and then you can roll 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.259
 so at stake as I said everything to 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:22.000
 time there is no lock for 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:24.770
 passenger side so this is for the tires 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.400
 here the dimension is 205 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.449
 so that is 20 cm 5 mm wide 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.919
 fifty five for those who know 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.720
 not the height of the blank so 5 cm 5 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.720
 and that of 16 inches knowing that 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.720
 pushes his 2.5 cm so you calculate
