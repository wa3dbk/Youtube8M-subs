00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.110
 hi and welcome to this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.610
 presentation of the web activity 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.780
 it's a tv tuner in the form of usb key 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 so the pack looks so well so what 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 material was lent to us by the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.689
 stores dj life specializes in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.260
 selling apple products in Martinique 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.180
 and Guadeloupe so www.dijon.fr 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 so the very light key she presents herself 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.210
 sitting with an entrance for an antenna 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.550
 rake output digital inputs speaking 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.969
 an analog antenna but in the bath 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 that we also provide you with the antenna 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.629
 so here it is it's a solution that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.570
 is very interesting in my opinion for 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.770
 users who are very mobile 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.149
 for example in the office I travel 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.859
 advise it works fine 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.769
 so here I'm already going that the ford 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.080
 the antenna as here with one provides you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.020
 a remote like the one you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 can find at home with the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.920
 piles of course who will you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.270
 allow to change channels 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.850
 turn up the volume 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.590
 fair break recorded since the vast 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.789
 novelty of this key is to allow 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.860
 allow siding the recording 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:34.460
 the break right in full view and 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.460
 we also provide you with a usb hdmi cable 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.960
 increased support with whose base 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.020
 is a sucker here that's it 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.350
 and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 icing on the cake it's a connector 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.009
 with different 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.180
 input that allows you to integrate your 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.520
 satellite channel your dvd blu ray and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.399
 company and wally toussaint directly 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:11.760
 on the key here to be able to visualize 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.690
 all on your computer so well 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.300
 obviously this this key tuner tnt 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.440
 also allows you to scan the waves 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.920
 and that's when I'm going to make you a 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.920
 short presentation 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.560
 so here before 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:32.450
 I cried actually connected there the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.440
 tnt key to my computer here i connected 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.690
 the antenna that comes with 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.920
 I'll just drop it here on the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.799
 blu I also installed the software 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.600
 eyetv of the company el gato since 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.660
 it is el gato society that can be 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.459
 which allows who in any case offers 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.459
 hardware so the software is installed 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.879
 if you are like me overcome the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.180
 hate I advise you to make a 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.939
 update I want to clarify that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.379
 for the encoding format for the 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.120
 digital terrestrial television at the 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.709
 martinique and guadeloupe in the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.140
 country settings 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.849
 you have to choose Czech Republic in 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.890
 invest encoding theme that they 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.650
 use to the republic of Aix is ​​the 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.980
 even that 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.950
 that ours martinique guadeloupe 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.480
 saint-martin guyane so you choose 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.849
 I take this is the little trick 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.730
 Czech Republic for the system 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:35.739
 encoding so here we already have 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.769
 the two chains at tv france 24 arte 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.439
 france 2 france 3 france 4 france 5 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.590
 France ô kmt technical hand advocated a 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:51.579
 zouk tv since we are we are testing 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.950
 this key was seen in Martinique so 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.260
 necessarily when you scan the TNT 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.409
 of the agglo you have the chains the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.409
 guadeloupe guyane saint martin ok 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.190
 2 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.750
 So here we go 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.020
 directly in full presentation mode 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.020
 screen 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.190
 this in view obviously have the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:29.390
 remote control that have changed scale 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.390
 you see the picture is very correct 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.639
 see 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 and 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.229
 direct purchase 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:05:03.529
 opportunity to pause on a 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:05.299
 emission be absent come back reading and 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.769
 the ability to record in time 

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:09.319
 real with the remote it's 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:13.489
 actually the operation of the pve 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:16.149
 that you find at home we go 

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:16.149
 to change the channel 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.090
 johan stael never at the costs of the 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.860
 city ​​hall sign ahead 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.800
