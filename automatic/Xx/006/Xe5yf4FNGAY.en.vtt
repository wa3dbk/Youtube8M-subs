00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
just touch on really the familiarity

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
just touch on really the familiarity
that<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> guys<00:01:39.060> being<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that you have with the guys being at the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
that you have with the guys being at the
college<00:01:40.320> level<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
college level and now this is going to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039 
college level and now this is going to
be<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:41.790> second<00:01:42.150> draft<00:01:42.360> yeah<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> mean<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
be your second draft yeah I mean I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.010 
be your second draft yeah I mean I
really<00:01:43.500> didn't<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.799> terrier<00:01:44.250> Jordan<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:44.850> all

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
really didn't know terrier Jordan at all

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
really didn't know terrier Jordan at all
so<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> familiarity

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
so that I think that that familiarity

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910 
so that I think that that familiarity
was<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.450> big<00:01:48.689> deal<00:01:48.869> obviously<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.470> RJ

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
was not a big deal obviously I know RJ

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.819 
was not a big deal obviously I know RJ
pretty<00:01:50.159> well<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:51.479> his<00:01:51.600> family<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:52.049> and
