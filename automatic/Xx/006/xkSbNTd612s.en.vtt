00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
into the little container under the van

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.940 
into the little container under the van
which<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.070> nice<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:27.050> where<00:01:27.650> he's<00:01:27.800> got

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
which is nice and this is where he's got

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.490

the<00:01:28.070> bed<00:01:28.360> which<00:01:29.360> is<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.900> basic<00:01:30.260> frame

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the bed which is just the basic frame

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.010 
the bed which is just the basic frame
we're<00:01:30.710> probably<00:01:30.890> going<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.190> rip<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:31.430> out<00:01:32.020> and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
we're probably going to rip this out and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.110 
we're probably going to rip this out and
have<00:01:33.230> so<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.740> storage<00:01:34.010> under<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.430> bed<00:01:34.610> we

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
have so have storage under the bed we

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.600 
have so have storage under the bed we
might<00:01:35.300> actually<00:01:35.450> cut<00:01:36.230> off<00:01:36.380> half<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.190> it<00:01:37.400> and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
might actually cut off half of it and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.040 
might actually cut off half of it and
sleep<00:01:38.450> sideways<00:01:39.050> like<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:43.720> save<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.750> little<00:01:44.930> bit

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
sleep sideways like so save a little bit

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.310 
sleep sideways like so save a little bit
of<00:01:45.170> space<00:01:45.880> as<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:47.210> see<00:01:47.420> he's<00:01:47.720> got<00:01:48.140> the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
of space as you can see he's got the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.470 
of space as you can see he's got the
conversion<00:01:48.890> top<00:01:49.070> on<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.340> top<00:01:49.400> so<00:01:49.790> there's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
conversion top on the top so there's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.780 
conversion top on the top so there's
nothing<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.840> stand<00:01:51.170> up<00:01:51.380> really<00:01:52.310> nice<00:01:52.550> when
