 other than the oil itself to you when theo 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.080
 see me for example when these days of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.210
 summer and such that I go to the pool 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.720
 I wash my head almost every day 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.130
 but I do not normally do it whole 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.310
 let's say it's just I put on a shampoo 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.380
 which is that it's like a daily shampoo that 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.600
 it does not affect my hair too much and it's 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.630
 when two or three times a week I 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.250
 uncomfortable game his mask with his 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.140
 conditioner and such but normally 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.630
 daily only with the shampoo that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.579
 then after shampoo when it is 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.549
 more or less wet hair I apply 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.369
 a little bit of oil is with a serum 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.560
 this jojoba oil but with an effect 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.019
 zero but what you have to do if 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.470
 you want a more effective result is bone 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.360
 conditioners oil and shampoos that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.500
 contain mare oil 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.720

 what else do we usually 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.160

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.340
 a towel that plays all your hair 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.180
 and let it sit for 15 minutes a 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.530
 more time let act 15 minutes what 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.230
 you rinse well with the water with enough 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.770
 water the truth so that the oil does not 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.390
 is as fatty are the hair and the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.540
 remove it because we are more normal 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.790

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.330
 We already know that it damages our hair a lot 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.490
