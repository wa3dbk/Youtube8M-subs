00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.040
 a year-long record fall in prices 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.630
 precious metals seriously knocked down and the market 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 gold in Russia how is it you now 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
 Feels us told Nikita Dudkin 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.480
 Assistant Chairman of the Board of the Union 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.480
 gold producers of Russia 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 hello how do you rate the state 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.650
 gold market in russia now what 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.710
 main trends you see and forecasts 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 times the state of the gold market in Russia 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 now a little heavy because how are you 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.520
 well know last year we had 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.739
 dramatic price drop after 12 years 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.860
 growth in gold price has fallen and is pretty 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.379
 dropped significantly by 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.899
 many gold let's look for the company of Russia 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.410
 but not only in Russia in the world fall 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.500
 prices are very hard hit by this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.079
 companies were forced to resort to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 certain measures for 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.360
 decline 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.250
 funding call him still 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.680
 industry in particular 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.500
 there was a decrease in both costs 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.380
 leading hall of a mining company in Russia 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.789
 we have reduced our capital costs 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.420
 but also lowered the forecast here on 14 here in 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:25.320
 last year, operating rooms were cut off 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.440
 costs that is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.180
 saved on everything possible 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.380
 here and according to you how they managed not 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.670
 lose profit or 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.299
 and reduce losses profit after all 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.210
 many companies had to lose 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.970
 because the course is not very price 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.860
 hit the loss end part 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.280
 companies cut yes indeed it 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.009
 so well, anyway, a number of companies stayed in 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.640
 last year’s loss one of 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:07.280
 major also retaliate 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:09.470
 this high task was something that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.269
 companies increased gold production 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.430
 i.e 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.110
 last year we had a marked 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.280
 gold production and a number of companies 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.319
 responded to the price drop 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.269
 increasing production volumes here in 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.269
 this year we have a trend continues 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.769
 this is for the first 7 months of this year 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.610
 Russia’s gold production has increased 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.810
 to 27 cents that is, growth in general, 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.970
 inertia also goes 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.510
 one of the trends is that 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.470
 companies worked higher 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.020
 ore the so-called x grading that is 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.560
 took ore with high grade but on 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.349
 this may be bad for many 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.709
 further as words are fast and pro and 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.870
 Denmark its mineral resource base 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.790
 also went saving on exploration 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.980
 works 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.430
 companies put off projects 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.569
 its own 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.299
 last year on its own 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.850
 Gross Viku field 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.170
 suspended work and company 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.160
 Petropavlovsk postponed here 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.410
 autoclave moved it to 2019 but 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.700
 now from the company come such 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.680
 messages that the same Petropavlovsk already 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.370
 sort of like in the 15th year planning 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.640
 run autoclave and nord gold on the gross 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.000
 development is again, that is, due to what 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.180
 due to the fact that they expect further 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.489
 price increases or just more mined 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.530
 sold more and thereby covered their 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.250
 costs firstly you say it right 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.150
 Of course the market situation is a little bit 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.940
 stabilized and that's the price now 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.350
 firmly holding 1 level 1300 dollars 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.200
 per ounce here a little bit falls a little 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.110
 growing but prices have generally stabilized 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.690
 and remain at the level that instills in 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.280
 companies some optimism can be though 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.620
 to lucky star can at least something 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.790
 plan really thats because 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.550
 Then again went so good news 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.000
 let's say how much lost 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.760
 not industrialists but those who sold it 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.220
 gold anyway company you 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.680
 mined sold but lost mostly those 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.500
 who traded in gold due to falling prices 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.050
 because they bought all the same for above 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.419
 cost price 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.250
 well first lost first 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.750
 Of course companies because they 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.840
 give out gold at current prices only two 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.180
 companies as far as 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.010
 well known fixed part 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.490
 his gold company Petropavlovsk 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.430
 last year and this year part of the gold 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.530
 fixed kan hee jim company pole 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.729
 gold concluded forward contracts then 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.820
 there is not like that even win on it and 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.050
 unstable situation other companies 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.169
 why don't they 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.860
 hedge their price risks difficult 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.900
 say maybe we have this practice 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.729
 not yet very common because 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.780
 what were the good years 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:28.479
 and now probably other companies 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.010
 think about this measure from the situation 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:38.800
 gold will continue to be unstable anyway 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:40.690
 it seems that goes out over the for 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.750
 your when it comes out when we can 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.789
 see those numbers or never 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.940
 there is a toast that speculative price increase on 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:52.330
 gold which was not visible yet 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.910
 10 coming here very much depends on the 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.130
 China since it is well known that China 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.850
 is actively increasing its gold and currency 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.830
 reserves according to official estimates they 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.820
 now make up about a thousand tons 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:11.289
 gold but how would there be information that 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:13.419
 china just won't divulge the numbers and 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.719
 his gold reserves may exceed 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:20.289
 official several times and if china 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:23.529
 make public this figure which 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.020
 it is already valid then 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.580
 maybe the price of gold is very strong 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.230
 will go up and 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:35.070
 for a short time 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.740
 can exceed and 1700 1800 dollars for 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.870
 ounce that is, it all depends largely on 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.020
 detail of course outfit federal 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:47.430
 us reserve system which is always 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.440
 was the main indicator of the price of 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.600
 gold that is, but if we say that 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.280
 Now there is a program of wheels reduction 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.080
 quantitative easing programs 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.570
 federal reserve system ie 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.880
 expect some jumps in gold prices 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.920
 we, too, on this side will not be well, yet 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.860
 I think so expect some jumps 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.800
 difficult if possible 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.620
 tense situation in the world can be 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.830
 like that too bend the price up it 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.330
 only if countries are involved 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:19.200
 key buyers 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.670
 gold was not just him 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.700
 fixed and that's what 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:26.430
 where was the height of the military crisis on 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.280
 Ukraine price went up a little in 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.460
 Iraqi the same situation when with militants 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.010
 Islamic army was tense too 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.210
 price went up gold remains quiet 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:42.630
 by the harbor 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:44.340
 nothing crisis we will not see their 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.229
 review of the gold market in Russia with us 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.449
 shared Nikita Dudkin from the union 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:50.340
 Russian gold producers thanks for 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:51.960
 your attention with you was evgeny ben so
