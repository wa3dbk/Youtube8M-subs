00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 today in this new video I 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.780
 will introduce you to an audio headset that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.230
 comes from the online store 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.060
 die protect here we look like 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 product package on the front side one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.529
 found the somail with some 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 specificities on the low let's say there is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 extra basin microphone hd etc 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.250
 of course we'll check that out 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.050
 the time on the back there are different 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 available colors me I have the headphones 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.410
 white and on the left we have a few 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.489
 technical specifications 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 when you open the cuckoo box you to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.379
 ok super good class are we going gonna 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.239
 lift this little cardboard to catch the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.100
 cable to connect the headset to your 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.719
 smartphone it's all red 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.270
 it does not make you think of anything 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 thing that on the cable we have of course 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.809
 of them 3.5 mm jack input but also a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 remote control 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.129
 thanks to it ion b only 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.020
 to be able to make play or breaks or else 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.879
 answer a call is not going to be able 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.600
 move on to the next song or 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.460
 former 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.409
 or even increase the volume 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.180
 it's a shame but against 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.869
 it's true that the quality of the microphone will be 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 close to the hd 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.400
 we now see the headphones out 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.850
 his box at first sight he is rather 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.570
 not bad 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.950
 it really looks like a beat anyway 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 when in the hand or on the head 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.040
 by the way it is really light by 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.689
 against it is plastic 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.490
 care should be taken when one is 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.710
 common to the headset to the headband 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.880
 put on the head 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.189
 since we're talking about the hoop it's in 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.409
 imitation leather but very nice on the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.970
 head after a prolonged listening some 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 helmets can press us on the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.600
 skull and well this case what does not 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970
 not part it is very nice on the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.470
 head and the pads they are a little 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.390
 hard at first but they are at the end 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.799
 some time after like all 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.180
 case what you can enlarge his 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.950
 size for them to fit of course 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.119
 your skull you can turn them 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.070
 earbuds to put the headphones around 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.299
 of your neck 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.680
 when you put the helmet on your head 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.540
 is not too heavy as I tell you 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.570
 and it does not take up too much space 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.210
 remain discreet about the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.980
 sound quality and quite frankly for 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.420
 about 20 euros it's really good 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.039
 now I find that there is a little 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.320
 too much treble and that's missing 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.550
 sorely medium and low so 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.250
 I do not see where it is. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.840
 low extras but good for a price too 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.140
 affordable that it's really not bad 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.140
 at all 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.940
 m 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.130
 to summarize this helmet is really very 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.450
 good for its rather pretty price but 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.370
 do not compare it to helmets 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.780
 bose or bells there or even 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.000
 beats at 300 euros 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.680
 it does not matter they have nothing to 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.290
 see it's not at all the same quality 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.020
 sound the same quality of the product nor the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.280
 same price by the way if what 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.960
 you are interested souls it is 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.210
 available on the shop die protect 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.130
 in blue in black and white 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.360
 the one I have and know that the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.270
 delivery is free on the whole 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.710
 shop so enjoy 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.570

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.450
