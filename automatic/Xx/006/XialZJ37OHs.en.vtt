00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.819
 Now it's going to heal , nothing happens to the 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:10.119
 final with a program game that 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.799
 will start to bother and that no more than 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.799
 I do not know him very much the truth that 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.299
 I met him with in the telethon with expensive 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.660
 they are very nice doubles desire what 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.359
 better but more than a program game 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.310
 that are going to bother and more than more than 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.330
 it's a not the truth is that what happens 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.019
 when there is a television program 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.880
 free guy from vineyard and I sat there at 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.259
 obviously speaking what I know about the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.260
 horsemanship and they always invite me to 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.449
 program and nothing else thinking of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.129
 ask and they happened to bother me the 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.199
 face with cristian but it's good wave 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.020
 nice blesa I know them and obviously 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.199
 they start making a game that is 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.899
 single and that they do not start at the end 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.920
 get dressed and it was a joke but nothing else 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.579
 until the last time 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.629
 linked with several girls then 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.159
 when I go in television form and you 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.229
 are counting is bothering one is 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.899
 lends also so that for one to 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.960
 laugh and one has to follow the game 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.920
 I think that issues that you more than 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.770
 nothing understands how the few the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.119
 television right now I'm single 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.759
 I do not know her very much, I wish you the best 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.399
 she is a super nice girl but more 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.930
 I'm wondering is no no no 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.420
 nothing else that is not a time to spend it 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.520
 well the program and in the end you create a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.869
 fire and in the end that game after you 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.470
 ask going with a tan but it was not 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 nothing more than that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.170
 It seems that Mr. Nicolás Massú 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.479
 denies Mr. Maicon Roldan and he 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.060
 creates a whole fire was like this maicon was 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.189
 a whole game on the television set and that 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.289
 we all saw it all alive is a 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.119
 flirt a theme to raise the rating 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.710
 let's say it like that but what happened in the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.869
 sporting I do not know if for the lord plus me 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.610
 has been a game for sticks it seems that 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.200
 not because if there were kisses and there are 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.060
 many people who communicated with the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.369
 production of intruders to tell you that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.020
 they were together there are even a couple 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.460
 of photographs that we do not have 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.350
 because the people who have them are 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.630
 seeing money in exchange for her then 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.549
 more you suddenly so secure this 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.850
 theme that not everything is false everything is 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.850
 false 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.769
 because I do not know what he is afraid of me 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.630
 I feel that the best plus you are still 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:22.549
 hooked on there I still wait 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:24.590
 that last week let's go back to what 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.810
 We said before going to vineyard when one 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.450
 is beginning to paint a little with 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.160
 someone takes less than a week one does not 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.580
 he goes on TV saying he's together 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.580
 to another person 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 We do not know the reason but they can do what 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.330
 that we want we are right jenny because 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 it is being regulated is the only thing that goes up 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.760
 despite having a concept because it is 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.090
 retreating by tastes 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.760
 they are single there is something called 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.280
 codes and at this minute nor as to your 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.579
 I would be breaking all kinds of code 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.329
 because I say it because he himself is 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.329
 friend of face 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:21.600
 so why do not you want to go up because 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:26.600
 he changed the color of this information 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 Mrs 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.360
 it was not the only relationship that broke 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.940
 with this assumption do between karol and the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.400
 nicole because nicole confirms me 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.500
 effectively that she had been two months 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.540
 two and a half months with jaime arthus 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.710
 I was in a relationship and they too 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:04:00.810
 they ended up following this that their children 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:06.420
 Nomás up here comes the day with life 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.970
 same life is like when we nor 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.680
 we are talking about that in that minute 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.060
 karol dance was not single in this 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.820
 minute when you get involved with the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.739
 Misses Nicole Gomez the rebels 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.560
 they were with the ball and nicole commented with 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.140
 jaime arcos are talking about 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.880
 infidelities little things pipes and in addition 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.390
 threw the unique massú into the water in this 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.250
 Vineyard program but ortega when you 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.950
 they say start this as flirting 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.900
 of this assumption is kitsch value have 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.640
 he tells the child and by looking at her as in the 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.130
 watch shoot of tone 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.130
 as if you wanted to die
