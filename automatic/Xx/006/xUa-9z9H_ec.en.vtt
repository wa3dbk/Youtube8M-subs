00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.000
 the channel of cham medien ag and indeed 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.030
 is again today a new video 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.679
 from and omega intel calls here below 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.369
 clear 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.810
 and now it comes to soul like we do 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.740
 now noticed after the patch or 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.150
 after seitenwechsel he now has 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.910
 no more fire damage but one 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650
 Thus, many players have a negative impact 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.179
 just as easy that they are not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.270
 absolutely the color you need around 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.590
 to get this player down or 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.090
 at least two needed the gel hollow 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.730
 and one could look forward to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.100
 shoot but now there is 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.200
 Of course, that does it harm many 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 Games can also be easier 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.930
 not quite the losglÃ¼ck have him put 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.600
 here in the background we have a now 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.260
 Gameplay plays with a tactic 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.210
 we have found and have on the internet 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 taken our time today 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.770
 has three to four different tactics 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 just try it out just like that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.100
 internet to go say and personal 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.770
 we have now also for this 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.200
 tactics decided here because of this 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.320
 tactics really great just actually 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.390
 there is no big risk involved 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.369
 Clear that one or the other dies 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.400
 or so by a grenade and by it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.229
 not from him or anything can do anything 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 happen 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 we do not need to be able to talk the stupid 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.689
 The laptop can be around without it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.180
 Personally, it really is that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.140
 the simplest tactics as you really are 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.750
 if I 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.650
 I do not want if they say but me 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.710
 say so as one of the really bad luck 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.550
 has with good weapons to the groups themselves 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.400
 because you can use this tactic because 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.410
 These weapons where you can use it 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.050
 you earn yourself everywhere 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.750
 I can only tell you in first place 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.869
 Alfred Speer from Eisbrecher from the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.270
 icebreaker event can be had on everyone 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.610
 earning a case and playing together so 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.950
 anyone who said close is too heavy for me 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.320
 all so very honest that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.330
 railroad union everyone somehow 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.300
 I just have to sit down there long enough 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.489
 The rank can be reached either way 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.060
 what's it on place two with me 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:25.650
 definitely the veil shadow that is 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.420
 The new sniper may of the fallen 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.980
 has the mega good damage so too 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.640
 I like really good taxpower 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.290
 really good 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.650
 that's why it's in second place with me 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.180
 came in third place the lgr 5001 gave 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.430
 then to top it before 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.440
 I can not say for sure if she is 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.269
 meanwhile I still exist 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.340
 I think so 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.100
 and only in third place comes with me 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.720
 patience and time in the video we did 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.310
 Although it has been shown that 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.440
 the patience and time needed 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.510
 would personally seen, I would 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.269
 say no is not needed because 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.060
 these three other snipers are up 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.130
 every case much stronger than that 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.299
 tolerated time because everyone makes time 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.750
 without weapons babbel 5200 hurt or sat 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.980
 and with weapons babbel 7.200 and now 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.610
 take as a comparison to the example of it 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.420
 is hard 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.470
 He makes about 10,000 weapons with babbel 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.260
 the 800 damage and no weapons babbel 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.090
 he is still still close 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.420
 8200 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.760
 So it's going to be gigantic 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.190
 difference whether one with a shot 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.769
 4,000 more does not hurt or 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.230
 patience and time has more fire rate 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.540
 but it really matters 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.319
 to lay the boss as fast as possible 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.360
 So put more emphasis on shock I hope 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.610
 that helped you now if 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.290
 you have other tactics or say yours 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.980
 tactics are much easier you can 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.190
 us to visit on facebooks colloquial 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.660
 and your tactics and present in the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.940
 video one send or will go up 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.660
 what and we will this tactic times 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.610
 go through 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.340
 we also watch how you play a lot 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.530
 can and then try if yours 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.200
 tactics are definitely easier than this 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.480
 tactile showed much then it can 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.829
 also happen that your video with us 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.590
 is uploaded to the channel 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.139
 Of course with links to your channel 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.910
 on the one also looks okay you have the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.340
 video made and people can too 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.260
 subscribe to licon or what do I know 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.850
 Well, I would like to go 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.860
 then say goodbye again and 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.860
 I wish you a nice stool 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.100
 nice weekend then too
