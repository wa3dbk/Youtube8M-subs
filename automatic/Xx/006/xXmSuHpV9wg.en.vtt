00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to me guitar clinics for digitech and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.020 
to me guitar clinics for digitech and
while<00:00:34.530> ID<00:00:34.650> on<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> road<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> lot

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
while ID on the road I get to try a lot

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.689 
while ID on the road I get to try a lot
of<00:00:36.210> different<00:00:36.570> year<00:00:37.040> one<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.220> really

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
of different year one of the really

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.490 
of different year one of the really
great<00:00:38.850> things<00:00:38.970> about<00:00:39.269> that<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> I'll

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
great things about that is is that I'll

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.320 
great things about that is is that I'll
occasionally<00:00:40.830> find<00:00:41.339> that<00:00:41.489> key<00:00:41.730> component

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
occasionally find that key component

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.410 
occasionally find that key component
that<00:00:42.809> works<00:00:43.080> in<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.470> setup<00:00:43.830> that<00:00:44.699> I<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.300> my

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
that works in my setup that I use for my

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.960 
that works in my setup that I use for my
clinic<00:00:45.750> rig<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.199> for<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.500> library<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.850> was

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
clinic rig and for my library and I was

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.790 
clinic rig and for my library and I was
able<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> find<00:00:48.449> that<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.900> i-5<00:00:49.320> mic<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
able to find that with the i-5 mic in

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
able to find that with the i-5 mic in
the<00:00:49.829> cab<00:00:50.070> grabber<00:00:51.049> the<00:00:52.049> i-5<00:00:52.409> mic<00:00:52.680> was

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the cab grabber the i-5 mic was

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.479 
the cab grabber the i-5 mic was
introduced<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.089> was<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.839> designed<00:00:55.489> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
introduced it was this was designed and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
introduced it was this was designed and
engineered<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.690> put<00:00:57.839> together<00:00:57.989> all<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.589> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
engineered and put together all in the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.689 
engineered and put together all in the
USA<00:00:59.900> biotics<00:01:00.900> this<00:01:01.890> mic<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.309> designed

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
USA biotics this mic was designed

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.690 
USA biotics this mic was designed
basically<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.420> compete<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.869> the<00:01:04.049> sm57<00:01:04.739> which

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
basically to compete with the sm57 which

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
basically to compete with the sm57 which
is<00:01:05.880> based<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.510> been<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> studio

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
is based you know it's been a studio

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.630 
is based you know it's been a studio
standard<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.740> quite<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> while

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
standard for quite a while

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
standard for quite a while
but<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.330> thing<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.570> noticed<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
but the one thing I noticed about the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.910 
but the one thing I noticed about the
Audax<00:01:10.830> i-5<00:01:11.310> mic<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.799> up

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
Audax i-5 mic is that when I have it up

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.250 
Audax i-5 mic is that when I have it up
against<00:01:14.250> my<00:01:14.310> amplifier<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.900> standing

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
against my amplifier when I'm standing

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.320 
against my amplifier when I'm standing
out<00:01:16.380> front<00:01:16.650> listening<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> tone<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
out front listening to the tone what I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.620 
out front listening to the tone what I
hear<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.930> amplifier<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:19.979> hear<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:21.060> mic

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hear is my amplifier I don't hear a mic

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
hear is my amplifier I don't hear a mic
coloring<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> tone<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.760> with<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:23.970> sm57

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
coloring the tone you know with an sm57

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
coloring the tone you know with an sm57
it<00:01:25.650> has<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.070> specific<00:01:26.310> sound<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.120> that's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it has that specific sound and that's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.780 
it has that specific sound and that's
what<00:01:27.390> everybody's<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:27.870> used<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:29.160> with

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
what everybody's really used to but with

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.480 
what everybody's really used to but with
this<00:01:30.000> microphone<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.470> transparent<00:01:31.800> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this microphone it's so transparent it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.640 
this microphone it's so transparent it
basically<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.570> true<00:01:33.990> sound<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.530> my

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
basically I get the true sound of my

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.530 
basically I get the true sound of my
amplifier<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:35.940> is<00:01:35.970> something<00:01:36.330> that's<00:01:36.480> very

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
amplifier which is something that's very

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.750 
amplifier which is something that's very
important<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> me<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:40.220> i-5<00:01:41.220> basically

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
important to me the the i-5 basically

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.170 
important to me the the i-5 basically
it's<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.030> very<00:01:42.170> tight<00:01:43.170> cardioid<00:01:43.740> pattern<00:01:44.180> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it's a very tight cardioid pattern that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
it's a very tight cardioid pattern that
is<00:01:45.659> gonna<00:01:45.990> you're<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.409> gonna<00:01:46.620> get<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> lot<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
is gonna you're not gonna get a lot of

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
is gonna you're not gonna get a lot of
bleed<00:01:47.310> from<00:01:47.550> other<00:01:47.760> things<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.210> stage<00:01:48.540> you're

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
bleed from other things on stage you're

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.290 
bleed from other things on stage you're
only<00:01:49.680> gonna<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.159> exactly<00:01:50.400> what<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.120> up

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
only gonna get exactly what it's up

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.300 
only gonna get exactly what it's up
against<00:01:51.870> which<00:01:52.350> makes<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:52.800> good<00:01:53.100> mic

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
against which makes it a really good mic

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.020 
against which makes it a really good mic
for<00:01:53.700> snare<00:01:54.330> or<00:01:54.870> Tom's<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.860> horns<00:01:56.370> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
for snare or Tom's or horns and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.210 
for snare or Tom's or horns and
definitely<00:01:57.690> guitar<00:01:58.020> caps<00:01:59.030> now<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.220> with

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
definitely guitar caps now with the with

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.920 
definitely guitar caps now with the with
the<00:02:02.340> cab<00:02:02.549> grabber<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.479> basically

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the cab grabber you can see basically

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170 
the cab grabber you can see basically
this<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.200> attaches<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> side<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
this just attaches to the side of the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.869 
this just attaches to the side of the
amplifier<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:08.399> has<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.700> microphone

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
amplifier and it has the microphone

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.180 
amplifier and it has the microphone
right<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
right on it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.250 
right on it
up<00:02:10.220> against<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.700> amplifier<00:02:11.240> this<00:02:11.720> enables

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
up against the amplifier this enables

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.480 
up against the amplifier this enables
you<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.770> makes<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.460> don't

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
you so this makes it so that you don't

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.280 
you so this makes it so that you don't
have<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> mic<00:02:14.270> stand<00:02:14.420> sitting<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.050> stage

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
have a mic stand sitting on stage

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.260 
have a mic stand sitting on stage
collecting<00:02:16.220> all<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> vibrations<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.240> the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
collecting all the vibrations on the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.850 
collecting all the vibrations on the
rumble<00:02:17.570> from<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.960> stage<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.440> people<00:02:18.650> moving

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
rumble from the stage of people moving

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.980 
rumble from the stage of people moving
around<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.400> doing<00:02:19.550> different<00:02:20.270> things<00:02:20.300> this

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
around and doing different things this

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.110 
around and doing different things this
is<00:02:21.170> basically<00:02:21.560> isolating<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> mic<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.940> your

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
is basically isolating the mic to your

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.350 
is basically isolating the mic to your
cabinet<00:02:23.720> very<00:02:24.440> cool<00:02:24.740> design<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:26.210> it's

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
cabinet very cool design and it's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.940 
cabinet very cool design and it's
something<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.810> basically<00:02:26.930> keeps<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.740> just

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
something that basically keeps it just

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.710 
something that basically keeps it just
out<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.310> way<00:02:28.490> nobody's<00:02:29.270> gonna<00:02:29.390> be<00:02:29.540> able<00:02:29.570> to

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
out of the way nobody's gonna be able to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.270 
out of the way nobody's gonna be able to
bump<00:02:29.930> into<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.380> with<00:02:30.500> their<00:02:30.650> feet<00:02:30.860> or<00:02:31.100> anything

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
bump into it with their feet or anything

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.140 
bump into it with their feet or anything
like<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:31.580> on<00:02:32.180> stage<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.610> cab<00:02:34.850> grabber

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
like that on stage and the cab grabber

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.970 
like that on stage and the cab grabber
is<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:36.670> very<00:02:37.670> cool<00:02:37.910> piece<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.120> gear<00:02:38.740> now<00:02:39.740> back<00:02:39.950> to

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
is a very cool piece of gear now back to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.000 
is a very cool piece of gear now back to
the<00:02:40.190> i-5<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.970> i-5<00:02:41.510> microphone<00:02:42.110> has<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> really

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
the i-5 the i-5 microphone has a really

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.670 
the i-5 the i-5 microphone has a really
wide<00:02:43.280> range<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.790> frequency<00:02:44.360> going<00:02:44.660> from<00:02:44.960> 50

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
wide range of frequency going from 50

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.020 
wide range of frequency going from 50
Hertz<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.610> 16<00:02:47.330> kilohertz<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:49.000> because<00:02:50.000> of

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
Hertz to 16 kilohertz and because of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.160 
Hertz to 16 kilohertz and because of
that<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:50.330> really<00:02:50.390> going<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.750> capture<00:02:50.990> all

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
that it's really going to capture all

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.560 
that it's really going to capture all
the<00:02:51.470> different<00:02:51.740> nuances<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:53.300> the

guitar cab I really think you're gonna
enjoy<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:55.970> microphone<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.820> there's<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
enjoy this microphone and there's the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.960 
enjoy this microphone and there's the
