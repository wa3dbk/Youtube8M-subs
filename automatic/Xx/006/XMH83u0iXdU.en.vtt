 there are two on this page 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.520
 it's very easy , I do not actually think that my 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.979
 records were downloaded by 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.450
 it is not necessary and it is best to load it 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.679
 Downloading files that try 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.460
 downloaded by torrent that without 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.460
 make it a bit 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 archive 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:20.819
 with the host gal 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.390
 here it opens and here because I already 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.430
 I have downloaded 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.610
 as I already have it on the disk 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.610
 hard 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.680
 4 6 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.450
 when what you do is unzip it 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.950
 well you have to install it decompresses 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.040
 you are going to have a folder with this name 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.930
 which is called foreign 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 then we come to the stone folder or 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.580
 zeta what are you going to go 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.470
 decompressed 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.300
 in the folder let's find the storm file 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.640
 z is an application when we open it 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.230
 it's going to leave us as a launcher 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.300
 game you can have any kind of 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.100
 accounts the same or you can do 20 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.470
 If you want to never buy it, it 's like 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.950
 out of home 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.300
 to register to accept wait because 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.060
 it takes a little bit then to give it accept 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.830
 for 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.410
 I let create the account the only thing that 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.410
 need is to put xxxx 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.859
 ok and now it's going to validate 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.819
 I think that drives people present 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.170
 the crack is four times five times 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.230
 now we pss and create the account that does not 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.250
 know how to deduce for example 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.250
 very loose 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.970
 gmail.com 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.340
 so the other 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.360
 to teach us love 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.950
