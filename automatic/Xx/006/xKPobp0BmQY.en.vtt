developers<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.190> anything<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.910> it's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
developers or anything like that it's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.740 
developers or anything like that it's
just<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.280> expected

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
just that it's not what I expected

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
just that it's not what I expected
personally<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.960> battlefield<00:01:01.230> game<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.070> when

a let's player I'd no just chose
battlefield<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.920> really

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
battlefield just because I really

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
battlefield just because I really
enjoyed<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> game<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.299> said<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.570> had

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
enjoyed the game and like I said I had

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
enjoyed the game and like I said I had
two<00:01:48.990> options<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.770> either<00:01:50.009> play<00:01:50.460> battlefield

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
two options I either play battlefield

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
two options I either play battlefield
which<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.450> wasn't<00:01:51.810> enjoying<00:01:51.930> battlefield<00:01:52.770> 4

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
which I wasn't enjoying battlefield 4

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
which I wasn't enjoying battlefield 4
were<00:01:53.100> talking<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.579> or<00:01:53.939> post<00:01:54.600> other<00:01:54.899> gates

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
well I did neither hand because I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
well I did neither hand because I
thought<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.950> myself<00:01:58.979> I'm<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.969> to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
break at some point and I knew it was

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.980 
break at some point and I knew it was
coming<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:11.000> think<00:03:11.240> this<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.660> best<00:03:11.780> way

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
coming and I think this is the best way

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.750 
coming and I think this is the best way
to<00:03:12.050> go<00:03:12.320> about<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.860> thought<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.220> myself<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
to go about it I thought to myself I

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.750 
to go about it I thought to myself I
deserve<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.840> myself<00:03:15.380> as<00:03:15.650> much<00:03:15.920> as<00:03:16.160> my<00:03:16.280> audience

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
deserve to myself as much as my audience

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.480 
deserve to myself as much as my audience
to<00:03:17.000> come<00:03:17.630> back<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.110> finish<00:03:18.530> what<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:18.920> started

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
to come back and finish what I started

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.390 
to come back and finish what I started
so<00:03:19.820> what<00:03:19.970> do<00:03:20.060> we<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:20.330> from<00:03:20.540> here<00:03:20.810> now<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.890> thing

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
so what do we do from here now the thing

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
package so i won't get into that too

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.490 
package so i won't get into that too
much<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:05.240> that<00:04:05.630> was<00:04:05.780> probably<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.200> main

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
much but that was probably the main

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.590 
much but that was probably the main
reason<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:07.010> me<00:04:07.160> coming<00:04:07.670> back<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.060> soon<00:04:08.360> was<00:04:08.570> I

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
reason of me coming back so soon was I

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.780 
reason of me coming back so soon was I
enjoyed<00:04:08.930> hardline<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:10.310> know<00:04:10.400> what's

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
enjoyed hardline and I know what's

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.780 
enjoyed hardline and I know what's
coming<00:04:10.880> out<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.930> did<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.350> delayed<00:04:12.709> too<00:04:13.190> early

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
coming out it did get delayed too early

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.210 
coming out it did get delayed too early
2015<00:04:14.480> also<00:04:15.440> talked<00:04:15.650> about<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:16.070> in<00:04:16.100> another

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
2015 also talked about that in another

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.610 
2015 also talked about that in another
video<00:04:16.640> coming<00:04:17.120> up<00:04:17.209> soon<00:04:17.510> but<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:18.440> was

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
video coming up soon but that was

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.159 
video coming up soon but that was
another<00:04:18.890> reason<00:04:19.040> why<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.239> wanted<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.020> come

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.440 
another reason why I I wanted to come
back<00:04:21.320> was<00:04:21.590> because<00:04:21.770> I<00:04:22.220> got<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:22.760> feeling<00:04:23.150> of

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
back was because I got that feeling of

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.960 
back was because I got that feeling of
enjoyment<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.290> enjoying<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:25.490> battlefield
