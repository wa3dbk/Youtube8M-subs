00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
and I didn't really know why it would be

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.530 
and I didn't really know why it would be
fun<00:05:13.160> I<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:13.550> was<00:05:13.670> like<00:05:13.760> oh<00:05:13.910> this<00:05:14.090> would<00:05:14.240> be<00:05:14.390> fun

and those guys came for rehearse we did

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.250 
and those guys came for rehearse we did
three<00:05:18.500> days<00:05:18.650> of<00:05:19.210> choreography<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.510> wanted<00:05:21.140> to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
three days of choreography I wanted to

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.190 
three days of choreography I wanted to
make<00:05:21.530> sure<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.490> was<00:05:22.670> good<00:05:23.030> for<00:05:23.840> me<00:05:23.900> with

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
make sure that it was good for me with

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.630 
make sure that it was good for me with
the<00:05:24.320> most<00:05:24.470> important<00:05:25.010> thing<00:05:25.160> was<00:05:25.340> that<00:05:25.400> these

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
the most important thing was that these

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.820 
the most important thing was that these
guys<00:05:25.880> were<00:05:26.090> good<00:05:26.450> yeah<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.710> would<00:05:27.800> be

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
guys were good yeah and it would be

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.190 
guys were good yeah and it would be
because<00:05:28.340> if<00:05:28.580> they<00:05:28.670> were<00:05:28.730> bad<00:05:29.060> dancers<00:05:29.660> it

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
because if they were bad dancers it

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.770 
because if they were bad dancers it
wasn't<00:05:30.500> going<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.680> be<00:05:30.770> funny<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.640> we<00:05:32.540> brought

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
wasn't going to be funny and we brought

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.180 
wasn't going to be funny and we brought
in<00:05:32.960> phenomenal<00:05:33.970> dance<00:05:34.970> doubles<00:05:35.450> and<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:36.890> think

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
in phenomenal dance doubles and I think

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.550 
in phenomenal dance doubles and I think
I<00:05:37.310> only<00:05:38.090> used<00:05:39.220> maybe<00:05:40.220> a<00:05:40.340> hair<00:05:41.180> of<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.200> dance

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
I only used maybe a hair of the dance

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.160 
I only used maybe a hair of the dance
doubles<00:05:43.040> in<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.190> actual<00:05:43.610> film<00:05:44.150> Oh<00:05:44.420> Josh<00:05:44.960> and
