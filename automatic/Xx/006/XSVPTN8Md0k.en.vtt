don't know if funny's things are

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.219 
don't know if funny's things are
different<00:00:40.680> where<00:00:41.250> you're<00:00:41.549> at<00:00:41.750> but<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so I've I've made my marking see there's

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920 
so I've I've made my marking see there's
like<00:00:46.080> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.470> space<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.970> I've

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
like a little space right here and I've

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170 
like a little space right here and I've
made<00:00:49.140> my<00:00:49.350> marking<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.159> think<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.729> gonna<00:00:50.879> put<00:00:51.059> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
made my marking I think I'm gonna put it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.969 
made my marking I think I'm gonna put it
right<00:00:51.210> around<00:00:51.540> there<00:00:51.839> so<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.470> gonna<00:00:52.619> drill

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
right around there so I'm gonna drill

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.009 
right around there so I'm gonna drill
and<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.640> course<00:00:53.909> the<00:00:54.150> hole<00:00:54.330> isn't<00:00:54.600> gonna<00:00:54.839> be

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
and of course the hole isn't gonna be

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.109 
and of course the hole isn't gonna be
big<00:00:55.979> enough<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> put<00:00:56.519> this<00:00:56.670> thing<00:00:56.909> because

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
big enough to put this thing because

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.460 
big enough to put this thing because
it's<00:00:57.269> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.479> rectangular<00:00:57.900> so<00:00:58.229> we're<00:00:58.379> gonna

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
it's kind of rectangular so we're gonna

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.250 
it's kind of rectangular so we're gonna
have<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.890> find<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.760> maybe<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.750> dremel

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
have to find a way maybe like dremel

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.850 
have to find a way maybe like dremel
sand<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.549> rest<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.089> or<00:01:03.239> file<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.650> file<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
sand the rest of it or file it file the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.460 
sand the rest of it or file it file the
hole<00:01:05.040> open<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.729> it'll<00:01:06.119> fit<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.290> first

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
hole open so it'll fit but the first

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.190 
hole open so it'll fit but the first
thing<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> make<00:01:08.040> our<00:01:08.280> cut<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.020> go<00:01:10.020> from

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
thing we do is make our cut and go from

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.639 
thing we do is make our cut and go from
there

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
there

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.190 
there
I<00:01:10.679> made<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.759> mark<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> looks<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I made a little mark here it looks it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
I made a little mark here it looks it
looks<00:01:13.380> pretty<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:13.829> and<00:01:13.950> centered<00:01:14.219> I<00:01:14.579> don't

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.090 

I've<00:01:27.760> made<00:01:27.940> some<00:01:28.210> sort<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.570> hole<00:01:28.900> alright<00:01:29.860> so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
I've made some sort of hole alright so

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.000 
I've made some sort of hole alright so
now<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:30.340> have<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:30.970> hole<00:01:31.270> here<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.900> we<00:01:32.830> got<00:01:32.980> a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
now we have this hole here and we got a

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.390 
now we have this hole here and we got a
we<00:01:33.340> got<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.640> find<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.940> way<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.920> round<00:01:36.190> out<00:01:36.370> the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
we got to find a way to to round out the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.610 
we got to find a way to to round out the
sides<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.570> mean<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.080> height<00:01:38.290> is<00:01:38.470> good

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
sides so I mean the the height is good

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.990 
sides so I mean the the height is good
but<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.890> width<00:01:39.100> has<00:01:39.280> got<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.550> get<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.700> little

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
but the width has got to get a little

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.480 
but the width has got to get a little
wider<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.570> don't<00:01:41.230> have<00:01:41.320> any<00:01:41.470> kind<00:01:41.620> of<00:01:41.680> dremel

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
wider I don't have any kind of dremel

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.800 
wider I don't have any kind of dremel
attachment<00:01:43.060> for<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:43.450> I'm<00:01:43.540> just<00:01:43.690> gonna

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
attachment for this so I'm just gonna

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.570 
attachment for this so I'm just gonna
use<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.080> drill<00:01:44.470> bit<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.830> kind<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.040> drill<00:01:45.340> some

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
use a drill bit and kind of drill some

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.630 
use a drill bit and kind of drill some
holes<00:01:45.610> around<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.900> see<00:01:47.110> if<00:01:47.260> I<00:01:47.350> can't<00:01:47.650> make

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
holes around it and see if I can't make

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.460 
holes around it and see if I can't make
it<00:01:48.850> just<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.120> little<00:01:49.150> bit<00:01:49.450> bigger<00:01:49.660> with<00:01:49.870> that<00:01:50.080> so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
it just a little bit bigger with that so

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.130 
it just a little bit bigger with that so
like<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.610> know<00:01:51.640> find<00:01:52.180> your<00:01:52.300> own<00:01:52.420> way<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.600> do<00:01:52.990> it

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
you know widen up a hole do that widen

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.010 
you know widen up a hole do that widen
the<00:01:57.430> hole<00:01:57.550> man<00:01:57.820> make<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.210> fit<00:01:58.450> make<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.900> fit

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
the hole man make it fit make it fit

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.150 
the hole man make it fit make it fit
nice<00:01:59.550> alright<00:02:00.550> so<00:02:00.850> with<00:02:01.090> some<00:02:01.650> finagling<00:02:02.650> I

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
nice alright so with some finagling I

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.850 
nice alright so with some finagling I
drilled<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.330> well<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:04.960> looks<00:02:05.200> pretty<00:02:05.290> crude

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
drilled this well it looks pretty crude

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.910 
drilled this well it looks pretty crude
but<00:02:06.790> check<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.690> out<00:02:07.930> when<00:02:08.350> this<00:02:08.530> thing<00:02:08.740> goes

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
but check it out when this thing goes

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.370 
but check it out when this thing goes
over<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.460> there<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.300> go<00:02:10.360> that's<00:02:10.840> how<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.110> do

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
over it there you go that's how you do

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.430 
over it there you go that's how you do
it<00:02:11.410> here's<00:02:12.250> what<00:02:12.370> we're<00:02:12.520> gonna<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:13.440> remember

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it here's what we're gonna do remember

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.590 
it here's what we're gonna do remember
this<00:02:14.560> thing<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:15.340> cut<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.730> off<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.270> power

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
this thing we cut it off of the power

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.900 
this thing we cut it off of the power
supply<00:02:17.110> earlier<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.950> what<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.100> did<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.670> I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
supply earlier and what I did is I I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.350 
supply earlier and what I did is I I
snipped<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.900> right<00:02:20.620> there<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.240> what<00:02:22.240> we're

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
snipped it right there and what we're

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.060 
snipped it right there and what we're
gonna<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.900> we're<00:02:23.080> gonna<00:02:23.140> find<00:02:23.650> out<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
gonna do is we're gonna find out the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.550 
gonna do is we're gonna find out the
length<00:02:24.370> here<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:24.820> plug<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.440> we're

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
length here and plug that in and we're

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.590 
length here and plug that in and we're
gonna<00:02:26.650> determine<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.700> length<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.300> don't

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
gonna determine the length so we don't

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.040 
gonna determine the length so we don't
have<00:02:28.720> too<00:02:29.020> much<00:02:29.970> too<00:02:30.970> much<00:02:31.120> slack<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.989> I'm

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
have too much too much slack so I'm

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.020 
have too much too much slack so I'm
gonna<00:02:32.170> cut<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> here<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.070> then<00:02:33.760> we're<00:02:33.910> gonna

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
gonna cut it here and then we're gonna

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.840 
gonna cut it here and then we're gonna
go<00:02:34.239> ahead<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.630> solder<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.260> thing<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.850> all

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
go ahead and solder this thing up all

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.600 
go ahead and solder this thing up all

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
and very crudely might I add my

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.440 
and very crudely might I add my

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.780 
take out the part that went to the Elco
going<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.420> this<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:56.019> teacher's<00:03:56.440> piano<00:03:57.069> which

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
going to this the teacher's piano which

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.270 
going to this the teacher's piano which
I<00:03:57.940> believe<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.420> this<00:03:58.840> one<00:03:59.170> here<00:03:59.620> it's<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.980> black

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
I believe is this one here it's a black

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.149 
I believe is this one here it's a black
one<00:04:00.610> or<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.390> gray<00:04:01.629> one<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.409> say<00:04:02.620> or<00:04:02.829> because

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
one or the gray one and I say or because

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.410 
one or the gray one and I say or because
it<00:04:03.280> really<00:04:03.489> doesn't<00:04:03.670> matter<00:04:03.849> because<00:04:04.000> one<00:04:04.390> of

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
it really doesn't matter because one of

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.569 
it really doesn't matter because one of
them<00:04:04.599> is<00:04:04.629> for<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.989> microphone<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:05.799> both<00:04:06.400> of

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
them is for the microphone so both of

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.490 
them is for the microphone so both of
the<00:04:06.640> ones<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:06.909> look<00:04:07.120> like<00:04:07.150> telephone<00:04:07.810> cords

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
the ones that look like telephone cords

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.220 
the ones that look like telephone cords
I<00:04:08.609> believe<00:04:09.609> all<00:04:09.909> that's<00:04:10.180> all<00:04:10.629> that's<00:04:10.900> going

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
I believe all that's all that's going

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.289 
I believe all that's all that's going
out<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.150> actually<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:14.079> know<00:04:14.230> kind<00:04:14.709> of

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
out so you can actually you know kind of

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.969 
out so you can actually you know kind of
squeeze<00:04:16.299> these<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:17.199> pull<00:04:17.470> them<00:04:17.620> out<00:04:17.709> all

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
squeeze these and pull them out all

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.699 
squeeze these and pull them out all
right<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.370> we<00:04:18.519> got<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:19.139> all<00:04:20.139> that<00:04:20.380> crap

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
right so we got this all that crap

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.520 
right so we got this all that crap
pulled<00:04:21.039> out<00:04:21.250> we<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:22.120> got<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> couple<00:04:22.530> three

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
pulled out we just got a couple three

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.790 
pulled out we just got a couple three
that's<00:04:23.949> easier<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.310> deal<00:04:24.550> with<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:25.530> now<00:04:26.530> we're

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800
