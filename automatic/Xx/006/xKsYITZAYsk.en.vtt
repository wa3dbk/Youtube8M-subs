00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.629
 hello friends we are young 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.639
 people 16 years old name is lion from the bottom 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.270
 Novgorod 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.250
 he is in the 10th grade and wants to continue 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.470
 learning higher education getting 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.660
 united states i'm honestly not 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.880
 I know the letters here it was not clear 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.180
 if the family has money to pay or 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.189
 he is going to get a scholarship somehow 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.860
 in one of the American universities that too 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.180
 it is possible 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.060
 but the question is which such a lion is not that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.070
 so that he somehow inclination some 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.800
 manifested in mathematics and physics 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.700
 but he wants to study or not narrowly 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.720
 understands that absent by technology about 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.860
 programming is like this 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.390
 of this and he asks he year if i 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.080
 I will gather there everything I can I am capable of 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.080
 but talking about 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 these are the programming languages 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.780
 canceled often sound so here's closer 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.590
 be lugging in purpose understand 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.900
 I will say this on this account and by the way 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.300
 so many people ask these 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.360
 programming languages ​​against it and 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.369
 when it says let's say already well 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 adult man there with education and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.130
 maybe even there he is engaged in something 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 in oite but wants retraining it 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.500
 One thing, but when a young check is 15 years old 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.940
 16 so on I would say that 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.350
 programming this specialty this 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.799
 profession 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.320
 in this profession you can be good or 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.270
 move competently this this this this very 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.369
 popular and people are a good programmer 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.369
 craftsman 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.830
 claimed person there are people and so 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.850
 say yes lead this craft up 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.350
 mastery this artists such a plan and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.470
 then I'm not talking about those in 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.450
 management there is this one therefore 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.810
 will you have a profession here 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.690
 let's say there language is not what it does 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.760
 you are a professional there is no profession to 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.280
 program sweets class class or not 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.410
 profession programmer Jed no 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.769
 professions there is a programmer where there is no 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.209
 I know 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.190
 web application in the application that is it 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.620
 still not a profession professor of him 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.110
 the program he further specializes in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.810
 something but due to the fact that he has 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.220
 profession programming languages 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.510
 is an instrument well, all sorts 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.310
 the specialist here is the same locksmith 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.170
 there comes a box of me there full of all 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.630
 tool you can not say that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.680
 he is a locksmith for pliers or a locksmith 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.180
 there is a pose run to the forger went there for 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.230
 I will not be offended 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.400
 processes. 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.000
 so the same with the programmer and you 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.000
 sure you can 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.730
 some kind of a puzzle yourself to put these 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.000
 16 say i want to make a website 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.950
 some kind or some kind of in app 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.569
 who will be there does not know collect 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.739
 some information for that to you 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.650
 will have to have some kind of database 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.659
 write some kind of interface 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.030
 accordingly need 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.799
 maybe you some back there 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.269
 applications do you have a question 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.379
 what language do i write 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.599
 front-end in which language do not write back-end 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.609
 what is my database and you immediately 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.040
 two will overgrow the whole complex there 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:47.419
 all sorts of things and I you can absolutely 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.579
 where far there is technically 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.739
 guys you connected it throw there lead 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.319
 I really don't want this choice 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.290
 do and this does not raise specialization 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.879
 here are you guys nakidat but you start 10 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.189
 takes out the project you want 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.469
 make and when you select a project 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.019
 sleep him means going to some 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.879
 tool kit will advise these people 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.590
 which projects do they do to you 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.049
 advise they will say you need this 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.989
 this one this one and this one decide 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.400
 what are you doing interesting and never 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.549
 think that the profession 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 in programming language 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.949
 in biysk programmer I do not have here 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.259
 There are people who want to get there 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.400
 work there as a tester here they come and 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.090
 begin to rot but tell me what it is 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.680
 automation tool 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.919
 Testing you need to know the tester 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.300
 be no testing tool 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.240
 which you have mastered does not make you 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.250
 this tester no language 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.030
 programming who you mean there 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.009
 learned how not to make you a programmer here 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.080
 that's all means if you 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.520
 you know how to program then a lot of things 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.949
 know for this people study in 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.750
 Universities if that do not study in 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.139
 universities and learned the language 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.620
 programming solve simple 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.229
 tasks not requiring so this knowledge 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.460
 what teaches the university is good especially 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.710
 here it is we also program in 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.690
 general to the extent that there is work 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.909
 to the extent that demand exceeds 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.539
 sentence and they kinda feel like 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:24.880
 okay so it is therefore therefore 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.159
 if you are 16 I would be in your place 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.659
 would not go this way especially by 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.870
 getting a good education 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.819
 specialty decided there by computer 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.759
 Sainz learn very cool and and learn 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.380
 on health and in 16 years I would be parallel 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:42.009
 so that you may be there some 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.770
 puzzle will be writing 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.250
 any program click on 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.120
 math push physics 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.009
 push the foundation on 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.740
 fundamental things that will allow 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.629
 you then understand the complex things come from 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.000
 full of people who are kind of a programmer about 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.740
 difficult things do not know and begin 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.279
 explains and he does not even understand what 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.680
 conversation 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.000
 so do not be such a programmer 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.000
 This is how a vector is 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 is happy
