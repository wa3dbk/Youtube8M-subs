00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 at sportsfreunde I'm simon yours 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.100
 muscle maker today, there is still one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 small connection between bwl between 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.440
 my bwl study and my passion 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.940
 namely the muscle sport I am as bwl 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 student, of course, through the first 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.599
 semester came through relatively well but 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.369
 I always sat the union I thought 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.109
 where you can find it here 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 connection to sport i want to see you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.199
 even if she is not realistic though 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.539
 she does not make sense i want the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.099
 Connection of bwl and sport somehow 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.240
 always in the head that helps 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.740
 Of course, learning is also important 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.420
 such a small advantage if you look at that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.980
 It's easy to do things in a simple way 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.290
 sympathetic because in contrast to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.180
 any accounting formulas around 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.680
 which higher mathematics is me that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.030
 Sport just relatively sympathetic 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 I can remember things well then 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.690
 and a thing that I, for example, me 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.010
 I realized how in my head 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.170
 even furthered by my 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 Setting forth from a long-term 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.730
 Thinking in the basics is that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 economic principle of this economic 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.360
 principle you can on walls on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 Households, so to speak, on individual 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.609
 Simplified people as well as people 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.020
 Company households are always use 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.940
 thus maximizes utility-oriented and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 Businesses are maximizing profits 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 is now vwl that is now bwl that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.220
 probably not so interesting though 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.159
 what you are thinking about in any case 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.280
 you have to be the minimalist 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.750
 or maximum is exactly that is whole 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.490
 interesting and we consider 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.380
 These two things always have the input and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.580
 the output even if you have that on the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.439
 some others may stop 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.270
 seems to be a little bit abstract 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.040
 let's have a look if you have questions 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.810
 I still like the comments on it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 even a because I think this videos 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.689
 important to just yourself about it 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.189
 to think and maybe then 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.020
 long-term things to change the one 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.180
 otherwise, maybe too much 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.650
 made easy so back to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.030
 topic once we have the input and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.220
 once the place photos you can completely 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.360
 simply translate input are the means 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.520
 I'm on walls so for example how 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.840
 I often go to the gym or how 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.500
 a lot more money for the diet 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.509
 ready 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 then we have the output that is exactly 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.520
 taken nothing other than the goal that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.170
 I then there are two different 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.219
 principles that you think you again 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.600
 I've already taken that away 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.100
 I actually wanted to be contacted 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 not however how we catch it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.780
 Just take a look at the minimal prince 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.300
 it's about us being one 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.090
 have a given goal and want 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.870
 this goal with as little as possible with the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.220
 to reach 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.170
 that's exactly what they do for example 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.450
 administrations like your city or 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.860
 what I say of your county 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.840
 Okay, we have to go somewhere here now 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 Build a street and that's best 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.160
 cheap as possible so with so little 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.390
 as much as possible achieve a goal 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.040
 Of course you can do that on the whole 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.930
 sporty area transferred to 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.120
 Example I want three kilograms 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.980
 increase or maybe i would like to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.069
 We'll just put it down 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.170
 to 8 percent of body fat that 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.330
 could, for example as a goal to be 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.610
 down to 8 percent body fat percentage 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.769
 and the whole please as cheap as 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.290
 possible as far as the diet is concerned and with 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.360
 as little training as possible that is 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.280
 So the minimalist after the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.290
 so it is me minimalist principle 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.730
 've got my goal just like that 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.380
 Doing as little as possible sounds 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.819
 Of course, also very comfortable 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.170
 but we'll just come to the next one 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.280
 point perhaps you realize then that 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.860
 this comfortable maybe not 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.840
 absolutely so ideal is so then we have 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.790
 The maximum is the one who has his means 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.980
 given predetermined are his 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.200
 his medium he has for example a 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.269
 home game and can just be with you 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.590
 train very well in the home or the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.450
 maybe a maximum is also one 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.769
 Training contract with a good one 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.650
 fitness studio and says I can 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.109
 train three times a week 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.989
 training and having three times a week 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.420
 a budget of 150 euros for the 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.079
 diet supplemente not 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.030
 intervened 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.739
 150 euro is not much but with it 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.299
 you can definitely get along and do it 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.579
 Now the question is what can I do 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.780
 with the given convey to me to 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.970
 to be available 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.070
 get a goal out what is for me 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.359
 Realistically, I can do it with three 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.680
 build kilo 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.590
 for example, three kilograms more mass 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.000
 it is possible to build up with 150 euros 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.130
 just to increase 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.350
 simply said so who is now 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.680
 better the minimalist or the maximum 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.569
 is 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.489
 I'll tell you in a nutshell none of 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.930
 both thinking right most 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.319
 of course, so they know what they know 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.000
 want 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.380
 they want to look like the lasa angelo or 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.150
 just want to 8 percent 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.650
 body fat maybe what so 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.000
 the lowest really nice 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.220
 look at the body fat percentage at 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.870
 man men according to per se 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.580
 and here, of course, something 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.170
 know exactly what 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.489
 they already give and want to know 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.320
 what is possible with it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.579
 In the end you are not allowed in 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.800
 think drawers and it is whole 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.510
 important both the goal and the output 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.500
 as well as the input should always be 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.970
 be variable 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.560
 now we come to the optimum 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.420
 principle that means we can do this 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.700
 linking both things together 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.100
 It is for example possible with 150 euros 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.500
 definitely on 8 percent body fat 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.450
 to come provided I have just 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.640
 this 150 euro not already in the first 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.530
 ten days of the month but squandered 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.910
 lives this plan evenly over the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.160
 month also makes no sense yes 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.690
 the first ten days somehow there everyone 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.360
 great food to eat and then 20 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.370
 logically but how to fast 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.780
 both the medium and the 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.980
 For example, here you should have nutrition 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.010
 be ready too a little bit more 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.990
 maybe spend from 150 to 180 too 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.940
 make you say ok three times 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.169
 training may be possible then 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.419
 I manage to take it sometime 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.220
 but it is also possible four 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.680
 train for me during the week 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.200
 that means exactly at this point both 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.600
 the funds should be variable than 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.250
 also the goal should be variable 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.020
 that's where it comes from 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.580
 Gives the spell he knows each of the way 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.750
 is the goal and that means im 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.190
 plain text that is not on it 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.050
 Arrives at a certain moment 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.180
 somehow to say I have now 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.800
 eight dad fat but also the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.970
 away until then if you just the 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.919
 changes looks when you see the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.750
 Of course, change also feels that 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.040
 Change in the head and body simply 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.390
 of course it is also one 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.530
 very important thing that is to say 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.960
 the connection of the whole 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.220
 the moral of this video the moral of 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.680
 This video is quite simple 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.300
 you always have to think about it 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.780
 which means do I have and where do I want to go? 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.430
 down 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.720
 as I realized, I thought 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.460
 me okay that sounds a bit like now 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.229
 abstractly that sounds so far now 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.540
 but if you just like that 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.190
 10 15 minutes think about what am 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.090
 I actually already give and what 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.710
 I want to reach 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.150
 you do not have to be minimalist to her 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.430
 would have to be maximum 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.380
 It is quite possible about the optimum 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.390
 principle simply the best of the 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.940
 the means available to you 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.350
 and the target what you like what you 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.640
 you might want to achieve what you might as well 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.240
 someday want to reach 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.270
 to reach 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.600
 But a factor is very important 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.650
 perseverance the whole 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.810
 does not work tomorrow 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.409
 that's why it's so important 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.939
 not about 100 anyway 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.289
 a very extreme diet 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.399
 and then not anymore 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.110
 to persevere but it really works 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.769
 therefore successful in the long term 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.360
 work 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:31.879
 the whole is really philosophy though 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.080
 you want the whole bwl vwl maybe 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.429
 not interesting for those 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.809
 It's just a training tip from 

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:37.429
 but want to have me over it 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:38.599
 think of the outside length 

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:39.860
 Of course, I hope teachers 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.839
 that you think as you do 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.039
 improve in the long run and not 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.779
 Only the next training session is wearing 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.189
 somehow gets through because that 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.599
 then gets when one or 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.080
 others also understood how from 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.309
 alone 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.379
 All right, see you next 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:53.379
 Many greetings from your simon
