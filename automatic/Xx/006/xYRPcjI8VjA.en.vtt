00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.350
Is this the kind of example you want to set?

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.350
Shut Up! Cartoons

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.350
We now return to The View.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.000
Why is this show still on the air?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.590
Hey guys, have you noticed anything unusual
about Andre?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.030
Are you talking at me? Are you talking at
me? Don't give me that look, smart guy! Andre

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.050
show you who boss!

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.110
Seems fine to me.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.989
Oh, come on! It's obvious he's got serious
anger management issues.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.500
Nonsense. Being an out of control rage-aholic
is just part of Andre's lovable personality.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.329
Yeah, like mangling the English language and
drinking out of the toilet.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.370
Anger management is an important skill to
have. 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.050
All right! Anything to stop the nagging.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.890
Great! Now first, we need to create a nurturing
environment so he won't feel threatened.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.130
What are you doing?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.739
Duct-taping him to the couch, what does
it look like?

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.940
What going on here?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.320
Relax, buddy. We're just trying to help you
manage your anger. What are friends for, right?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.409
You're welcome!

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.159
---- YOU! You no friend to Andre, you son
of -----!

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.200
We're gonna need some professional help.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.240
Welcome to Anger-Be-Gone, everyone! My name's
Mel Gibson and I hereby declare this meeting

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.359
in session. And if you don't like it, you
can go to hell!

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.359
Ok, who'd like to share first?

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.039
Whoa, Mel, is this the kind of example you
want to set?

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.920
Listen, Sugar---s, I kissed Jodie Foster on the
mouth! I'll say whatever the ---- I want!

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.020
Andre not know why he so angry. Maybe it reason
he fight so good?

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:40.590
Who are you-- sashaying around in your tight
clothes with your big boobs? I pay your rent

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.719
you ----in' gold digger!

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.950
Andre, you don't have to be controlled by
your anger. You can be the master of your

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.889
own emotions.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.179
She'­s absolutely right! It's just like that
time me and Danny Glover tracked a gang of 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.289
South African drug smugglers down to the docks
just before the whole place exploded! KA-BOOM!

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.429
That's Lethal Weapon 2.

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.529
DonÃ't you dare ----in'­ complain to me! I'll
burn your house to the ground!

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.489
Mm-mm! Girl, you're like a sexy, little California
Raisin. What's your story?

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.800
I was a rage-aholic for ninety years and finally
decided to mellow out and reclaim my life!

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.130
I've never felt better!

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.700
Whoops, there goes my aneurysm!

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Holy ----! All my mortal enemies! Back from
the grave!

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.990
Hey! Where the hell's he going?
Braveheart, my ass!

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.070
There's too many of them!

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.480
Nah, we can take 'em as long as nobody does
anything incredibly stupid.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.980
FREEEEEE-DOMMMMMMM!!!!

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.980
Man, I haven'­t seen Mel Gibson blow up like
that since last week on TMZ!

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.220
Andre, you saved us!

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.560
You used your anger constructively without
losing control!

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.080
Andre see friend's point. From now on, Andre
try to be calm, cool-headed and totally in

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.130
control of temper.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.130
Who you think you talking to, stupid hand?
Andre hit you with face!

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.450
We're gonna need more duct tape.
