00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk to

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk to
you<00:00:02.159> about<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.550> test<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.060> thermostat<00:00:04.940> now

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
you about how to test a thermostat now

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.110 
you about how to test a thermostat now
this<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.359> programmable<00:00:07.200> thermostat<00:00:08.120> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
this is a programmable thermostat and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.110 
this is a programmable thermostat and
you<00:00:09.330> may<00:00:09.510> either<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.460> your<00:00:11.639> home<00:00:11.849> or

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
you may either have this in your home or

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.700 
you may either have this in your home or
you<00:00:12.300> may<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.139> mechanical

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
you may have just a mechanical

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.670 
you may have just a mechanical
thermostat<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:15.150> either<00:00:15.299> way<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:16.230> use

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
thermostat but either way you can use

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.740 
thermostat but either way you can use
these<00:00:16.890> same<00:00:16.949> procedures<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.090> test<00:00:18.359> whichever

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
these same procedures to test whichever

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
these same procedures to test whichever
one<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.550> now<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.789> particular<00:00:21.000> case

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
one you have now in this particular case

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.120 
one you have now in this particular case
we've<00:00:21.689> got<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.900> digital<00:00:22.289> readout<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.949> want

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
we've got a digital readout so we want

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.400 
we've got a digital readout so we want
to<00:00:23.189> make<00:00:23.340> sure<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.720> showing<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> time

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
to make sure that it's showing the time

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.279 
to make sure that it's showing the time
and<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> current<00:00:26.970> temperature<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.480> now

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and what the current temperature is now

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.410 
and what the current temperature is now
something<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.680> important<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:30.090> happens

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
something very important is it happens

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.380 
something very important is it happens
to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.630> about<00:00:30.720> 70<00:00:31.260> degrees<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.669> that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to be about 70 degrees in here so that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
to be about 70 degrees in here so that
is<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> temperature<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.710> check<00:00:35.250> both

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
is a temperature that we can check both

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.490 
is a temperature that we can check both
the<00:00:35.520> heating<00:00:36.090> system<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.110> cooling

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the heating system and the cooling

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.299 
the heating system and the cooling
system<00:00:38.899> it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.170> recommended<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.980> check

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
system it is not recommended to check

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.530 
system it is not recommended to check
your<00:00:41.520> cooling<00:00:41.910> system<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
your cooling system when the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.709 
your cooling system when the
temperatures<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.260> below<00:00:43.579> 65<00:00:44.579> degrees<00:00:45.239> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
temperatures are below 65 degrees so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.000 
temperatures are below 65 degrees so
that's<00:00:45.930> something<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> keep<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.559> mind<00:00:46.620> when

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that's something to keep in mind when

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.560 
that's something to keep in mind when
you<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.129> checking<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.730> thermostats<00:00:48.270> make

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you are checking your thermostats make

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.850 
you are checking your thermostats make
sure<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.050> proper<00:00:49.440> temperature

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
sure you're in the proper temperature

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.299 
sure you're in the proper temperature
range

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
range

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.180 
range
so<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.420> fold<00:00:51.660> down<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.170> lid<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so as we fold down this lid we want to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.069 
so as we fold down this lid we want to
make<00:00:53.309> sure<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.610> run<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.780> particular

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
make sure we run in this particular

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.439 
make sure we run in this particular
system<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.250> either<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.730> operating

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
system you can either have it operating

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.560 
system you can either have it operating
in<00:00:57.660> heat<00:00:57.989> mode<00:00:58.260> off<00:00:59.160> position<00:00:59.730> or<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
in heat mode off position or in the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.130 
in heat mode off position or in the
cooling<00:01:01.050> mode<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:03.000> fan<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.449> auto<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
cooling mode and the fan is auto so the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260 
cooling mode and the fan is auto so the
first<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
first thing we want to do is we want to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.750 
first thing we want to do is we want to
take<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.810> fan<00:01:07.049> switch<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.830> switch<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
take the fan switch and switch it to the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.539 
take the fan switch and switch it to the
on<00:01:08.880> position<00:01:09.770> when<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> switch<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
on position when you switch it to the on

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.770 
on position when you switch it to the on
position<00:01:12.680> then<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.280> should<00:01:14.790> hear<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.479> ear

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
position then you should hear your ear

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.910 
position then you should hear your ear
and<00:01:16.670> be<00:01:17.670> able<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> feel<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.590> return

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and be able to feel it in your return

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.810 
and be able to feel it in your return
air<00:01:20.159> grill<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.650> long<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> happens

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
air grill so as long as that happens

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270 
air grill so as long as that happens
then<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> fan<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.710> your<00:01:25.740> unit

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
then you know that the fan in your unit

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
then you know that the fan in your unit
is<00:01:26.430> working<00:01:26.820> properly<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.479> we'll<00:01:28.200> switch<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
is working properly so we'll switch that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.160 
is working properly so we'll switch that
back<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.009> auto<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:30.329> next<00:01:30.630> thing<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> want<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
back to auto the next thing you want to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
back to auto the next thing you want to
do<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> want<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.009> make<00:01:32.159> sure<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.850> check

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
do is you want to make sure and check

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
do is you want to make sure and check
and<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> temperature<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.740> working

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and see if the temperature is working

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.830 
and see if the temperature is working
correctly<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.600> says<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
correctly so right now it says the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.300 
correctly so right now it says the
temperature<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.590> 72<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
temperature is 72 so what we will do is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.170 
temperature is 72 so what we will do is
we<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> should<00:01:43.259> hear

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
we will set it up and you should hear

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
we will set it up and you should hear
when<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.329> go<00:01:45.509> above<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.840> temperature<00:01:46.259> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
when you go above the temperature you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.490 
when you go above the temperature you
should<00:01:47.220> hear<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> click<00:01:48.229> indicating<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.259> it's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
should hear a click indicating that it's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.870 
should hear a click indicating that it's
coming<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> should<00:01:53.040> also<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.640> able<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
coming on and you should also be able to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.580 
coming on and you should also be able to
hear<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> background<00:01:55.159> your<00:01:56.159> furnace<00:01:57.590> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
hear in the background your furnace the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.490 
hear in the background your furnace the
burner<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.009> actually<00:01:59.399> coming<00:01:59.640> on<00:02:00.200> now<00:02:01.200> what

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
burner is actually coming on now what

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.719 
burner is actually coming on now what
you<00:02:01.649> need<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> need<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> wait<00:02:02.700> for

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you need to do is you need to wait for

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.789 
you need to do is you need to wait for
it<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> cycle<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.990> those<00:02:04.200> burners<00:02:04.469> will

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
it to cycle because those burners will

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.580 
it to cycle because those burners will
run<00:02:05.070> they'll<00:02:05.700> actually<00:02:06.180> heat<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.110> unit

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
run they'll actually heat up the unit

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.369 
run they'll actually heat up the unit
and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.670> air<00:02:08.819> will<00:02:08.849> come<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.170> you'll

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and then the air will come on so you'll

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.770 
and then the air will come on so you'll
need<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> wait<00:02:11.300> up<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.660> couple<00:02:13.020> minutes

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
need to wait up to a couple minutes

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.440 
need to wait up to a couple minutes
to<00:02:14.319> make<00:02:14.500> sure<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.790> happens<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
to make sure that that happens so the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.210 
to make sure that that happens so the
heat<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.319> verified<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.830> return

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
heat is on it's verified now the return

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.790 
heat is on it's verified now the return
air<00:02:24.670> we<00:02:25.209> can<00:02:25.390> start<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.750> feel<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.200> then<00:02:26.650> you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
air we can start to feel it then you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.559 
air we can start to feel it then you
might<00:02:26.980> want<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.220> go<00:02:27.370> around<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:28.030> even<00:02:28.180> check

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
might want to go around and even check

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.840 
might want to go around and even check
and<00:02:28.780> make<00:02:28.930> sure<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.620> you've<00:02:29.830> got<00:02:30.069> hot<00:02:30.580> air

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and make sure that you've got hot air

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.199 
and make sure that you've got hot air
coming<00:02:31.450> out<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.840> your<00:02:31.959> diffusers<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.790> once<00:02:34.030> we

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
coming out of your diffusers so once we

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.110 
coming out of your diffusers so once we
do<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:35.650> we're<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:36.040> we're<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.850> good

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
do that then we're know we're in good

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.930 
do that then we're know we're in good
shape<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.690> heating<00:02:37.930> system<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:39.790> can

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
shape on the heating system so we can

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.750 
shape on the heating system so we can
set<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.270> back<00:02:40.420> down<00:02:40.620> let<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.650> system<00:02:42.010> cycle

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
set it back down let the system cycle

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.910 
set it back down let the system cycle
and<00:02:42.970> cool<00:02:43.690> itself<00:02:44.050> down<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:46.260> shut<00:02:47.260> itself<00:02:47.620> off

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
and cool itself down and shut itself off

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.190 
and cool itself down and shut itself off
now<00:02:48.430> when<00:02:48.730> it's<00:02:48.880> completely<00:02:49.420> shut<00:02:49.630> off<00:02:49.810> and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
now when it's completely shut off and

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020 
now when it's completely shut off and
you<00:02:50.320> wait<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> few<00:02:50.680> minutes<00:02:51.010> then<00:02:51.400> we're<00:02:51.910> going

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
you wait a few minutes then we're going

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.460 
you wait a few minutes then we're going
to<00:02:52.120> do<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.360> same<00:02:52.570> procedure<00:02:52.750> we're<00:02:53.290> going<00:02:53.410> to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
to do the same procedure we're going to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.130 
to do the same procedure we're going to
switch<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.070> cooling<00:02:54.459> system<00:02:54.880> we<00:02:55.840> will

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
switch it to the cooling system we will

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.620 
switch it to the cooling system we will
put<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.920> temperature<00:02:57.370> down<00:02:57.730> below<00:02:58.239> the

current temperature wait for the system
to<00:03:01.390> cycle<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.930> should<00:03:02.170> hear<00:03:02.410> click<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.950> then

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
to cycle you should hear click and then

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.530 
to cycle you should hear click and then
you<00:03:03.130> should<00:03:03.310> hear<00:03:03.489> your<00:03:03.610> cooling<00:03:03.970> system<00:03:04.000> come

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
you should hear your cooling system come

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.690 
you should hear your cooling system come
on<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.410> should<00:03:05.440> hear<00:03:05.830> your<00:03:05.980> air<00:03:06.190> flowing

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
on and you should hear your air flowing

on and you should hear your air flowing
so<00:03:07.569> as<00:03:07.780> long<00:03:07.930> as<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.170> do<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:09.550> can<00:03:09.700> check

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
so as long as you do that you can check

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.059 
so as long as you do that you can check
both<00:03:10.060> your<00:03:10.300> heating<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.600> cooling<00:03:10.720> again<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
both your heating and cooling again and

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.040 
both your heating and cooling again and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
you check your cooling as long as it's

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.400 
you check your cooling as long as it's
above<00:03:14.319> 65<00:03:14.920> degrees<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:17.080> should<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.350> able

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
above 65 degrees and you should be able

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.050 
above 65 degrees and you should be able
to<00:03:17.530> determine<00:03:17.709> whether<00:03:18.010> your<00:03:18.220> thermostat<00:03:18.820> is

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
to determine whether your thermostat is

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.300 
to determine whether your thermostat is
working<00:03:19.540> properly<00:03:19.750> if<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.799> do<00:03:20.950> have<00:03:21.160> any

working properly if you do have any

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.090 
working properly if you do have any
problems<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:23.260> not<00:03:23.350> something<00:03:23.739> that's

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
problems and it's not something that's

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.319 
problems and it's not something that's
readily<00:03:25.140> identifiable<00:03:26.140> at<00:03:26.440> your<00:03:26.590> thermostat

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
readily identifiable at your thermostat

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.789 
readily identifiable at your thermostat
you<00:03:28.329> can<00:03:28.450> check<00:03:28.660> your<00:03:28.780> wiring<00:03:28.989> connections<00:03:29.650> by

you can check your wiring connections by

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.100 
you can check your wiring connections by
popping<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.400> off<00:03:30.610> it's<00:03:31.480> usually<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.989> good

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
popping this off it's usually a good

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.080 
popping this off it's usually a good
idea<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:33.010> contact<00:03:34.380> professional<00:03:35.380> HVAC
