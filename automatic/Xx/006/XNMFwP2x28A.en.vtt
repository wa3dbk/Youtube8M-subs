00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
don't think that my viewers want to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.050 
don't think that my viewers want to
watch<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:20.550> he<00:02:20.580> shows<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.030> his

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
watch that but then he shows you his

watch that but then he shows you his
bloody<00:02:21.510> finger<00:02:22.790> yeah<00:02:23.790> what<00:02:24.630> that's<00:02:25.410> not<00:02:25.530> what

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
bloody finger yeah what that's not what

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.000 
bloody finger yeah what that's not what
I<00:02:25.680> did

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010

better because it was there were less
people<00:02:41.100> there<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:42.830> how<00:02:43.830> did<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.070> feel<00:02:44.190> I

people there and how did you feel I

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.270 
people there and how did you feel I
still<00:02:45.570> felt<00:02:45.840> weird<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.590> went<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.010> anyway

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
still felt weird but I went in anyway

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.070 
still felt weird but I went in anyway
and<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.660> was<00:02:48.810> good<00:02:49.730> yeah<00:02:50.760> mm-hmm<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.660> then<00:02:51.989> I

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and that was good yeah mm-hmm and then I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.750 
and that was good yeah mm-hmm and then I
think<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:53.010> some<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.370> has<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.700> with

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
think I think some of it has to do with

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.030 
think I think some of it has to do with
the<00:02:53.880> time<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.060> day<00:02:54.180> too<00:02:54.360> because<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:55.920> in

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the time of day too because if it's in

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.100 
the time of day too because if it's in
the<00:02:56.130> morning<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.700> have<00:02:57.000> my<00:02:57.030> anxiety<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.870> like

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the morning I have my anxiety is like

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.479 
the morning I have my anxiety is like
more<00:02:58.320> heightened<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.830> morning<00:02:59.160> than<00:02:59.400> it

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
more heightened in the morning than it

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.699 
more heightened in the morning than it
is<00:02:59.610> at<00:02:59.730> night<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> think<00:03:01.019> because<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.440> like

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
is at night so I think because I like

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.729 
is at night so I think because I like
worked<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.130> day<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.600> like<00:03:03.630> tired<00:03:04.019> and

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
worked all day and I'm like tired and

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.840 
worked all day and I'm like tired and
then<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.190> came<00:03:05.310> home<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.610> we<00:03:05.700> went

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
then I just came home and we went

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.759 
then I just came home and we went
straight<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.330> store<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.989> think<00:03:07.440> that's<00:03:07.590> why

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
straight to the store I think that's why

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.340 
straight to the store I think that's why
it<00:03:07.950> was<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.310> easier<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.090> me<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.870> did

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
it was like easier for me to do it I did

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.570 
it was like easier for me to do it I did
notice<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.830> didn't<00:03:11.160> want<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.370> stay<00:03:11.549> in

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
very long though but that's the way that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.420 
very long though but that's the way that
