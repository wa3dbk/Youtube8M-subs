00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
through this company which is a little

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.529 
through this company which is a little
confusing<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.739> me<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.489> why<00:00:44.640> one

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
confusing to me I don't know why one

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.279 
confusing to me I don't know why one
company<00:00:45.870> has<00:00:46.260> such<00:00:46.469> huge<00:00:46.829> market<00:00:47.309> dominance<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
company has such huge market dominance I

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.939 
company has such huge market dominance I
guess<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.469> similar<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> nerf<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.579> busby<00:00:51.149> but

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
guess it's similar to nerf and busby but

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.900 
guess it's similar to nerf and busby but
in<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.100> mind<00:00:53.270> Wizards<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.960> nerf<00:00:58.850> okay<00:00:59.850> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
in my mind Wizards is like nerf okay so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
in my mind Wizards is like nerf okay so
