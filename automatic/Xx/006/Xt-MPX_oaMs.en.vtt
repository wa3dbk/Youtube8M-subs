here in this age of reason there is

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.409 
here in this age of reason there is

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
darker a bar bathroom is in reality the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.910 
darker a bar bathroom is in reality the
better<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.420> think<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.110> all<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.410> us<00:00:18.920> so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
better I think it is for all of us so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.380 
better I think it is for all of us so
you've<00:00:20.070> probably<00:00:20.220> heard<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.789> breaking<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
you've probably heard of breaking the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.060 
you've probably heard of breaking the
seal<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> idea<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.650> if<00:00:22.830> you're<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
seal it's the idea that if you're at a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.650 
seal it's the idea that if you're at a
bar<00:00:23.130> drinking<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.029> hold<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.449> pee

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
bar drinking you can hold your pee

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
bar drinking you can hold your pee
almost<00:00:25.140> indefinitely<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> second

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
almost indefinitely but then the second

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269 
almost indefinitely but then the second
you<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> bathroom<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you go to the bathroom you are going to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.460 
you go to the bathroom you are going to
have<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> pee<00:00:29.699> constantly<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.050> rest<00:00:31.320> of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
have to pee constantly for the rest of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.680 
have to pee constantly for the rest of
the<00:00:31.560> night<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:32.009> people<00:00:32.309> who<00:00:33.059> swear<00:00:33.660> by

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the night I know people who swear by

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.680 
the night I know people who swear by
this<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.440> I've<00:00:34.530> always<00:00:34.860> been<00:00:35.250> skeptical

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
this but I've always been skeptical

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
this but I've always been skeptical
thankfully<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:37.020> neurologists<00:00:37.860> who<00:00:38.100> are

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
thankfully some neurologists who are

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.639 
thankfully some neurologists who are
probably<00:00:38.700> also<00:00:38.940> drunks<00:00:39.540> decided<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> figure

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
probably also drunks decided to figure

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.830 
probably also drunks decided to figure
out<00:00:40.800> what's<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> what's<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.540> this

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
out what's up and what's up is that this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.560 
out what's up and what's up is that this
just<00:00:43.290> feels<00:00:44.010> true<00:00:44.640> here's<00:00:45.030> what's<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.390> on

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
just feels true here's what's going on

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.139 
just feels true here's what's going on
alcohol<00:00:46.200> suppresses<00:00:46.950> vasopressin<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
alcohol suppresses vasopressin which is

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.959 
alcohol suppresses vasopressin which is
an<00:00:48.239> antidiuretic<00:00:48.690> hormone<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:49.890> body<00:00:50.010> ADH

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
an antidiuretic hormone in your body ADH

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
an antidiuretic hormone in your body ADH
regulates<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> water<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.110> kidneys<00:00:52.530> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
regulates the water in your kidneys so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.670 
regulates the water in your kidneys so
if<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> ADH<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:55.260> kidneys

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
if you have a lot of ADH your kidneys

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
if you have a lot of ADH your kidneys
absorb<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.280> water<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.149> less

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
absorb more water and if you have less

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
absorb more water and if you have less
of<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.230> water<00:00:58.500> goes<00:00:58.770> into<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> rest<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
of it that water goes into the rest of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
of it that water goes into the rest of
your<00:00:59.460> body<00:00:59.699> which<00:01:00.059> means<00:01:00.329> more<00:01:00.629> water<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.140> your

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
your body which means more water in your

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.830 
your body which means more water in your
bladder<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.340> you're<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> bar<00:01:03.210> you're

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
bladder so you're in the bar you're

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
bladder so you're in the bar you're
drinking<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> lot<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.470> fluid<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> you're

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
drinking a lot of fluid and you're

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
drinking a lot of fluid and you're
stopping<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.420> body<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:07.110> absorbing<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
stopping your body from absorbing it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.420 
stopping your body from absorbing it
right<00:01:08.270> alcohol<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.170> bladder<00:01:10.650> irritant

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
right alcohol is also a bladder irritant

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.130 
right alcohol is also a bladder irritant
for<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> people<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
for a lot of people so the more of it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.679 
for a lot of people so the more of it
you<00:01:13.290> drink<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:15.030> bladder<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.479> going

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you drink the more your bladder is going

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
you drink the more your bladder is going
to<00:01:15.780> feel<00:01:15.960> uncomfortable<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.830> full<00:01:17.100> even<00:01:17.340> when

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
to feel uncomfortable and full even when

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270 
to feel uncomfortable and full even when
it's<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.509> effects<00:01:19.049> increase<00:01:19.979> over

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it's not and these effects increase over

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
it's not and these effects increase over
time<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.939> longer<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> add<00:01:21.570> alcohol<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.140> your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
time the longer you add alcohol to your

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
time the longer you add alcohol to your
system<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> suppresses<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> ADH

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
system the more it suppresses that ADH

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
system the more it suppresses that ADH
and<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> also<00:01:25.229> makes<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.619> bladder<00:01:25.890> feel<00:01:26.189> more

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and it also makes your bladder feel more

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
and it also makes your bladder feel more
and<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.090> irritated<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.500> you've<00:01:28.619> been

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
and more irritated so if you've been

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
and more irritated so if you've been
holding<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.729> long<00:01:29.939> time<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.780> can

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
holding it in for a long time it can

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810 
holding it in for a long time it can
feel<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.590> you've<00:01:31.740> broken<00:01:31.950> some<00:01:32.250> sort<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
feel like you've broken some sort of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
feel like you've broken some sort of
seal<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.630> these<00:01:34.200> effects<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.710> all

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
seal but really these effects have all

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
seal but really these effects have all
been<00:01:35.070> building<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.460> anyway<00:01:35.820> by<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> time<00:01:36.360> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
been building up anyway by the time you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
been building up anyway by the time you
initially<00:01:37.200> go<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.829> bathroom<00:01:38.340> they're<00:01:38.700> all

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
initially go to the bathroom they're all

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.690 
initially go to the bathroom they're all
in<00:01:39.360> their<00:01:39.540> late<00:01:39.720> stages<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.100> feels<00:01:41.400> like

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
in their late stages so it feels like

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.789 
in their late stages so it feels like
you've<00:01:41.850> skipped<00:01:42.150> from<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.600> having<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> go<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you've skipped from not having to go to
