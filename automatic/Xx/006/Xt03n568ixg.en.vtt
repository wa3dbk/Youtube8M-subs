00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hello, I'm a telephone judge, and this is more. 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.139
 A TV quiz tells the program about the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.450
 largest skateboard video championship 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.130
 Brazil, as you can see, I'm not in the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.900
 studio had to take a trip to 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.760
 I work when I arrived. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 Late they would not let me in. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.020
 so I looked for a wall here from the neighbor 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.000
 cool, I took the camera and recorded the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.279
 information can not stop because it's final 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 of the month coming and with it the deadline 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.849
 You send your video to the farm. 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.000
 the tie is coming to an end 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.010
 You have until 31st just that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 five days to upload your video 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 participate in this tie but for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.920
 to take part in the tie now 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.850
 enough of this culture to leave everything to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.860
 last hour 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.629
 remember the sooner you send your 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.579
 video and move to the final 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 a new video unpublished maneuvers 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.390

 cash prizes 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.719

 the dispute over the only two vacancies for 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.310
