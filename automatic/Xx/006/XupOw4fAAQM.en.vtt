00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.990
 hello people welcome to the second map 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.920
 Welcome to the cloud map and nothing 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.360
 good this map the truth that is 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.639
 pretty big you know what the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.530
 second map before knowing before the 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.300
 The first video is that of fracture and this is 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.340
 the upper load that looks like a 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.980
 kind of Mozarabic or Persian castle or 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.960
 something like that the truth is that a map that 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.220
 well it's pretty big I still could not 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.260
 play it so I can not comment 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.939
 nothing of the gameplay because good there 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.320
 is today is the worst day in the world in 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.750
 how much internet has burst my 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.119
 router and like that so it 's a mess 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.879
 everything but good basically you already know 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.039
 this map is of the four of the dlc 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.809
 collect and I think it's the greatest 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.960
 of the four the truth the invitation 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.059
 It's pretty cool although I do not know 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.889
 some colors that I do not like much 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.049
 do not use at all what you liked most 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:49.760
 that this map has been made to start at 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.249
 sunset then now at noon not for 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.440
 the morning but re good the truth is that 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.729
 it's pretty big, that's true 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.589
 it also has color is much 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.359
 example sabalera yes azulita those that yes 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.639
 the pink flowers such that is pretty 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.769
 cool and good the dynamic element now 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.869
 I will also teach it that basically 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.250
 Plasma actors shoot islands 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.220
 they let you loose rays 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.020
 there are towers all around the map and the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.600
 this is really seeing that this guy or 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.740
 what is going around the map 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.320
 will also get a little bit by the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.650
 medium for you to see everything and nothing 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.550
 I do not know if the DLI is going to be very cool 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.920
 I'm basically recording these videos 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.150
 those on the maps so they can see more 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.550
 or less the maps all those of 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.210
 playstation 3 where pace a 4 of 13 or 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.119
 simply that you do not have the dlc 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.940
 simply because good the truth 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.560
 it's always good not to see them and immolate 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.750
 pretty here you are going to see the tower 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.390
 flat you can climb on top was the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.610
 partner 6 looking at nothing too if 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.170
 you see if he shoots loose radios to everything 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.759
 the world and it can even kill you 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.399
 same I do not know what more kids I think that 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.710
 has liked this map the author map what 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.140
 you have on screen the next role of 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.180
 41 so good then pass and pass 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.220
 and see it and nothing later we'll see 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.220
 those two my greetings so far
