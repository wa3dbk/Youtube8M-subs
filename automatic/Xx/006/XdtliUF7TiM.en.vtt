without<00:00:23.570> dying<00:00:24.439> all<00:00:24.829> those<00:00:25.039> because<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.789> day

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
that I did that it wasn't that hot but

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.819 
that I did that it wasn't that hot but
it's<00:00:28.730> still<00:00:28.820> gonna<00:00:29.029> get<00:00:29.210> hotter<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.319> the<00:00:30.650> air

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
it's still gonna get hotter so the air

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.109 
it's still gonna get hotter so the air
conditioner<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:31.429> still<00:00:31.669> something<00:00:31.909> that<00:00:32.090> I

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
conditioner is still something that I

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.720 
conditioner is still something that I
want<00:00:32.449> fortunately<00:00:33.199> I<00:00:33.260> just<00:00:33.469> there's<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:34.609> many

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
want fortunately I just there's so many

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.930 
want fortunately I just there's so many
different<00:00:35.149> options<00:00:35.359> I<00:00:36.460> honestly<00:00:37.460> don't<00:00:37.789> know

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
different options I honestly don't know

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
different options I honestly don't know
what's<00:00:38.329> best<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.940> so<00:00:40.940> far<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.449> one<00:00:41.660> that's

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
what's best and so far the one that's

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.400 
what's best and so far the one that's
like<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:43.460> top<00:00:43.940> choice<00:00:44.329> is<00:00:44.359> still<00:00:44.960> like<00:00:45.170> two

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
like the top choice is still like two

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.830 
like the top choice is still like two
hundred<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:45.829> ten<00:00:46.010> dollars<00:00:46.390> which<00:00:47.390> I<00:00:47.570> can't

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
hundred and ten dollars which I can't

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.990 
hundred and ten dollars which I can't
just<00:00:48.170> go<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.800> store<00:00:48.920> put<00:00:49.309> that<00:00:49.460> down<00:00:49.640> right

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
just go to the store put that down right

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.880 
just go to the store put that down right
now<00:00:50.149> but<00:00:50.989> that's<00:00:51.079> still<00:00:51.350> something<00:00:51.559> that<00:00:51.739> I

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
now but that's still something that I

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.189 
now but that's still something that I
want<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.399> happen<00:00:52.850> especially<00:00:53.449> once<00:00:53.929> I<00:00:53.989> get<00:00:54.109> out

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
want to happen especially once I get out

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.420 
want to happen especially once I get out
there<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.440> start<00:00:54.649> working<00:00:54.679> on<00:00:55.039> that<00:00:55.219> wall

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
there and start working on that wall

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.780 
there and start working on that wall
to<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.750> moss<00:00:58.960> there<00:00:59.620> are<00:00:59.770> still<00:01:00.040> moths<00:01:00.280> not

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
to the moss there are still moths not

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.460 
to the moss there are still moths not
nearly<00:01:01.180> as<00:01:01.390> many<00:01:01.950> those<00:01:02.950> traps<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:04.660> of<00:01:04.780> false

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
nearly as many those traps kind of false

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.870 
nearly as many those traps kind of false
advertisement<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.190> would<00:01:06.310> say<00:01:06.490> because<00:01:06.760> the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
advertisement I would say because the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.040 
advertisement I would say because the
box<00:01:07.150> showed<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.960> trap<00:01:08.260> just<00:01:08.650> full<00:01:09.190> of<00:01:09.520> moss

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
box showed the trap just full of moss

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.440 
box showed the trap just full of moss
and<00:01:11.050> so<00:01:11.800> made<00:01:12.070> me<00:01:12.130> think<00:01:12.370> that<00:01:12.430> like<00:01:12.700> literally

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
and so made me think that like literally

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.600 
and so made me think that like literally
overnight<00:01:13.920> every<00:01:14.920> single<00:01:15.190> moth<00:01:15.340> will<00:01:15.490> be

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
overnight every single moth will be

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.380 
overnight every single moth will be
attracted<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.120> it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
attracted to it

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.240 
attracted to it
that<00:01:16.660> didn't<00:01:16.900> happen<00:01:16.990> they<00:01:17.800> are<00:01:17.830> getting

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
that didn't happen they are getting

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.850 
that didn't happen they are getting
quite<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.580> few<00:01:18.910> in<00:01:19.180> them<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.470> haven't<00:01:20.770> wanted

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
quite a few in them and I haven't wanted

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.350 
quite a few in them and I haven't wanted
to<00:01:21.010> show<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.520> because<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:21.850> kind<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:22.090> gross

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
to show it because it's kind of gross

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.830 
to show it because it's kind of gross
honestly<00:01:22.990> but<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:24.280> traps<00:01:24.610> do<00:01:24.910> have<00:01:25.090> quite<00:01:25.780> a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
honestly but the traps do have quite a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.710 
honestly but the traps do have quite a
few<00:01:25.930> moths<00:01:26.290> in<00:01:26.770> each<00:01:26.979> one<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.700> I'm<00:01:28.390> seeing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
few moths in each one and I'm seeing

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.920 
few moths in each one and I'm seeing
less<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.080> less<00:01:29.530> hanging<00:01:30.490> out<00:01:30.759> on<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.690> walls

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
less and less hanging out on the walls

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.719 
less and less hanging out on the walls
and<00:01:32.290> stuff<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:32.950> we<00:01:33.040> actually<00:01:33.220> found<00:01:33.610> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
and stuff and we actually found the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.690 
and stuff and we actually found the
source<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.210> them<00:01:34.450> there<00:01:35.320> was<00:01:35.410> a<00:01:35.470> bag<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.340> corn

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
source of them there was a bag of corn

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.510 
source of them there was a bag of corn
that<00:01:37.030> looked<00:01:37.270> like<00:01:37.330> squirrel<00:01:37.990> feeder<00:01:38.340> corn<00:01:39.340> or

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
that looked like squirrel feeder corn or

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.290 
that looked like squirrel feeder corn or
whatever<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.920> there<00:01:42.520> was<00:01:42.640> like<00:01:42.790> holes<00:01:43.090> in

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
whatever and there was like holes in

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.850 
whatever and there was like holes in
that<00:01:43.420> bag<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.690> mean<00:01:44.020> he<00:01:44.080> opened<00:01:44.440> it<00:01:44.530> there<00:01:44.710> was

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
that bag I mean he opened it there was

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.910 
that bag I mean he opened it there was
like<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.009> million<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.330> moss<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.649> bag

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
like a million of the moss in that bag

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.520 
like a million of the moss in that bag
so<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:49.060> seems<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.450> be<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.690> source<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.350> so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
so that seems to be the source of it so

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.359 
so that seems to be the source of it so
he<00:01:50.649> threw<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.160> out<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:52.210> hopefully<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:53.410> is

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
he threw that out so hopefully that is

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.160 
he threw that out so hopefully that is
helping<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.450> now<00:01:55.570> it's<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:55.899> matter<00:01:56.050> of

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
helping and now it's just a matter of

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.260 
helping and now it's just a matter of
like<00:01:56.289> waiting<00:01:56.740> for<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.009> rest<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.399> them<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.820> die

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
like waiting for the rest of them to die

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.830 
like waiting for the rest of them to die
out<00:01:58.570> pretty<00:01:58.840> much<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.399> that's<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.300> thing<00:02:01.510> that

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
out pretty much so that's the thing that

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.039 
out pretty much so that's the thing that
is<00:02:02.290> getting<00:02:02.470> better<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:04.390> else<00:02:04.570> if<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.810> said<00:02:04.990> I

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
is getting better what else if I said I

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.009 
is getting better what else if I said I
was<00:02:05.140> going<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.320> update<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.920> mentioned<00:02:06.700> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
Venus flytrap but that's going to take

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.460 
Venus flytrap but that's going to take
several<00:02:10.119> weeks<00:02:10.479> before<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.989> can<00:02:11.320> really

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
several weeks before I can really

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.870 
several weeks before I can really

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
windowsill to get a little bit of

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.650 
windowsill to get a little bit of
sunlight<00:02:14.320> every<00:02:14.680> day<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:16.360> really<00:02:16.480> all

all right so this is recording with the
rear<00:04:12.420> camera<00:04:13.610> obviously<00:04:14.610> playing<00:04:15.150> away<00:04:15.300> from

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
rear camera obviously playing away from

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.900 
rear camera obviously playing away from
my<00:04:15.780> face<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.320> everything<00:04:16.830> is<00:04:17.340> perfectly<00:04:17.850> fine
