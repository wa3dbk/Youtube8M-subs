00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
when i first started my journey about

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.249 
when i first started my journey about
caring<00:00:06.420> what<00:00:06.569> i<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.750> putting<00:00:06.930> into<00:00:07.109> my<00:00:07.230> body

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
caring what i was putting into my body

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.720 
caring what i was putting into my body
carrying<00:00:07.830> about<00:00:08.040> what<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.189> was<00:00:08.340> eating<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
carrying about what I was eating and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.490 
carrying about what I was eating and
drinking<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.090> stuff<00:00:09.269> like<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.809> decided

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
drinking and stuff like that I decided

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.499 
drinking and stuff like that I decided
to<00:00:10.800> cut<00:00:11.160> gluten<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.790> dairy<00:00:12.030> out<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.450> diet

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
to cut gluten and dairy out of my diet

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.200 
to cut gluten and dairy out of my diet
and<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.170> when<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> cut<00:00:13.530> dairy<00:00:13.920> out<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.429> course<00:00:15.059> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
and so when I cut dairy out of course I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.269 
and so when I cut dairy out of course I
did<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.599> natural<00:00:16.289> healthy<00:00:16.680> thing<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
did the natural healthy thing and I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.220 
did the natural healthy thing and I
started<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.760> consume<00:00:18.150> soy<00:00:18.449> products<00:00:18.930> instead

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
started to consume soy products instead

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.260 
started to consume soy products instead
you<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> was<00:00:19.949> doing<00:00:19.980> soy<00:00:20.340> milk<00:00:20.699> soy<00:00:21.119> ice

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
cream soy yogurt and I think that really

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.189 
cream soy yogurt and I think that really
upsets<00:00:24.119> me<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.630> even<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.019> look<00:00:25.170> back

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
upsets me you know even when I look back

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.099 
upsets me you know even when I look back
on<00:00:25.500> until<00:00:25.680> today's<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:27.029> would<00:00:27.840> look<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
on until today's I would look at the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
on until today's I would look at the
back<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> labels<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> soy

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
back of the labels and on the soy

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
back of the labels and on the soy
products<00:00:30.570> I'd<00:00:30.720> noticed<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.289> didn't<00:00:31.500> have

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
products I'd noticed that it didn't have

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
products I'd noticed that it didn't have
cholesterol<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> time<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
cholesterol in it and at the time I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.610 
cholesterol in it and at the time I
didn't<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.899> had<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.170> an<00:00:34.290> animal

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
didn't know that it had to be an animal

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.709 
didn't know that it had to be an animal
product<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.130> order<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.880> cholesterol<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
product in order to have cholesterol and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.560 
product in order to have cholesterol and
I<00:00:37.530> would<00:00:37.829> naturally<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:38.850> oh<00:00:39.030> this

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I would naturally think like oh this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.240 
I would naturally think like oh this
must<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.899> better<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.290> me<00:00:40.410> than<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> dairy<00:00:40.890> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
must be better for me than the dairy so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.680 
must be better for me than the dairy so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
thing when you cut those three things

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
thing when you cut those three things
out<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.289> diet<00:01:01.469> completely<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.640> really

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
out of your diet completely is it really

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
out of your diet completely is it really
limits<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.780> processed<00:01:04.350> foods<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.979> eat

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
limits the processed foods you can eat

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
limits the processed foods you can eat
because<00:01:05.580> almost<00:01:06.210> every<00:01:06.750> process<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.590> or

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
because almost every process thing or

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
because almost every process thing or
thing<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> unwrap<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.790> order<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> eat

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
thing you have to unwrap in order to eat

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
thing you have to unwrap in order to eat
usually<00:01:10.049> contains<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.619> least<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.430> all

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
usually contains at least one if not all

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
usually contains at least one if not all
three<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> those<00:01:12.390> things<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.430> video<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
three of those things so in this video I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
three of those things so in this video I
basically<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> go<00:01:15.869> through<00:01:16.259> some

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
basically just want to go through some

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
basically just want to go through some
of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.009> research<00:01:17.640> some<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> negative

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
of the research some of the negative

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.210 
of the research some of the negative
things<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.960> able<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.259> find<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> soy<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
things as able to find in the soy and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.670 
things as able to find in the soy and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
just want to go through some of the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.240 
just want to go through some of the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
reasons why most forms of soy are not
health<00:01:32.460> foods<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> end<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
health foods and at the end of this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
health foods and at the end of this
video<00:01:33.450> I'll<00:01:33.869> actually<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.320> telling<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> which

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
video I'll actually be telling you which

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
video I'll actually be telling you which
forms<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.759> soy<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.119> okay<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> eat<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
forms of soy or okay to eat and the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.420 
forms of soy or okay to eat and the
forms<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> soy<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> are<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.280> okay<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> eat<00:01:38.880> so

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
forms of soy that are not okay to eat so

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.560 
forms of soy that are not okay to eat so
basically<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.759> want<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> make<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.270> short

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
basically I just want to make this short

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.030 
basically I just want to make this short
sweet<00:01:42.810> simple<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> point<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.950> know

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
sweet simple and to the point you know

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.819 
sweet simple and to the point you know
this<00:01:44.430> could<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:45.659> topic<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.409> courts

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
this could be a to our topic but courts

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.050 
this could be a to our topic but courts
and<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.009> YouTube<00:01:47.310> videos<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.700> about<00:01:47.850> 10

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and these YouTube videos get about 10

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.780 
and these YouTube videos get about 10
minutes<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.159> basically<00:01:50.159> number<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> just

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
minutes so basically number one it just

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.749 
minutes so basically number one it just
contains<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.390> large<00:01:51.659> amount<00:01:52.350> of

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
contains a large amount of

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.170 
contains a large amount of
anti-nutrients<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.939> you've<00:01:54.060> got

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
anti-nutrients you know you've got

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780 
anti-nutrients you know you've got
things<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.600> enzyme<00:01:55.290> inhibitors<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.860> block

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
things like enzyme inhibitors that block

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.209 
things like enzyme inhibitors that block
your<00:01:57.000> body's<00:01:57.329> ability<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:58.070> release<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
your body's ability to release the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.550 
your body's ability to release the
enzymes<00:01:59.640> necessary<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.630> protein<00:02:01.170> digestion

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
enzymes necessary for protein digestion

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.740 
enzymes necessary for protein digestion
most<00:02:02.520> people<00:02:02.790> refer<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.329> trips<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
most people refer to the trips and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.880 
most people refer to the trips and
inhibitors<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.380> they're<00:02:04.500> talking<00:02:04.649> about

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
inhibitors when they're talking about

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370 
inhibitors when they're talking about
this<00:02:05.189> topic<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.820> basically<00:02:06.689> trypsin<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
this topic and basically trypsin is a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.770 
this topic and basically trypsin is a
digestive<00:02:08.280> enzyme<00:02:08.660> secreted<00:02:09.660> by<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
digestive enzyme secreted by the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
digestive enzyme secreted by the
pancreas<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.349> breaks<00:02:10.770> down<00:02:10.890> proteins<00:02:11.039> in

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
pancreas that breaks down proteins in

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.070 
pancreas that breaks down proteins in
the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.410 
the
small<00:02:12.230> intestine<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.490> animal<00:02:13.910> testing

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
small intestine and in animal testing

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.290 
small intestine and in animal testing
animals<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.560> were<00:02:15.860> fed<00:02:16.250> diets<00:02:16.490> high<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.240> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
animals that were fed diets high and the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.540 
animals that were fed diets high and the
trypsin<00:02:17.660> inhibitors<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.440> car<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.250> caused

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
trypsin inhibitors a car it caused

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.090 
trypsin inhibitors a car it caused
enlargement<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> pancreas<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.890> lot<00:02:22.070> of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
enlargement in the pancreas and a lot of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.010 
enlargement in the pancreas and a lot of
digestive<00:02:22.790> disorders<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.450> sometimes<00:02:23.780> even

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
digestive disorders and sometimes even

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.570 
digestive disorders and sometimes even
cancer<00:02:24.490> number<00:02:25.490> two<00:02:25.700> soybeans<00:02:26.270> also<00:02:26.450> contain

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
cancer number two soybeans also contain

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.520 
cancer number two soybeans also contain
hemagglutinin<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.990> something<00:02:30.350> that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
hemagglutinin and this is something that

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.530 
hemagglutinin and this is something that
causes<00:02:30.800> red<00:02:31.190> blood<00:02:31.460> cells<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.970> clump<00:02:32.330> together

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
causes red blood cells to clump together

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.390 
causes red blood cells to clump together
and<00:02:33.250> when<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.760> animals<00:02:35.240> were<00:02:35.480> fed<00:02:35.750> these<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
and when the animals were fed these the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.210 
and when the animals were fed these the
hemagglutinin<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.200> trypsin<00:02:39.800> inhibitors

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
hemagglutinin and the trypsin inhibitors

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.280 
hemagglutinin and the trypsin inhibitors
they're<00:02:40.400> both<00:02:40.550> growth<00:02:41.120> inhibitors<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.080> well

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
they're both growth inhibitors as well

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.140 
they're both growth inhibitors as well
and<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.400> caused<00:02:43.730> animals<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.810> not<00:02:45.170> grow

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and so it caused animals to not grow

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.180 
and so it caused animals to not grow
regularly<00:02:47.150> or<00:02:47.270> normally<00:02:47.750> number<00:02:48.650> three<00:02:48.920> soy

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
regularly or normally number three soy

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.730 
regularly or normally number three soy
foods<00:02:49.490> contain<00:02:49.880> great<00:02:50.510> Trojans<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.290> these

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
foods contain great Trojans and these

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.310 
foods contain great Trojans and these
are<00:02:51.920> substances<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:53.000> suppress<00:02:53.630> thyroid

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
are substances that suppress thyroid

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.830 
are substances that suppress thyroid

some<00:04:44.750> studies<00:04:45.080> actually<00:04:45.259> suggest<00:04:46.009> that<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.400> is

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
some studies actually suggest that it is

some studies actually suggest that it is
not<00:04:46.819> a<00:04:46.880> complete<00:04:47.449> protein<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:48.139> shows<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.560> it

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
not a complete protein it shows that it

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.999 
not a complete protein it shows that it
is<00:04:48.740> lacking<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.520> essential<00:04:50.000> amino<00:04:50.210> acid

is lacking the essential amino acid

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.059 
is lacking the essential amino acid
methionine<00:04:52.599> so<00:04:53.599> honestly<00:04:54.229> guys<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:54.710> know<00:04:54.830> the

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
methionine so honestly guys you know the

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.800 
methionine so honestly guys you know the
list<00:04:55.250> goes<00:04:55.310> on<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.639> on<00:04:55.849> with<00:04:56.030> this<00:04:56.210> topic<00:04:56.389> but

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
again i'm gonna try to keep this short

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.920 
again i'm gonna try to keep this short
just<00:04:58.370> give<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.639> some<00:04:58.820> reasons<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.419> then<00:04:59.509> you

just give you some reasons and then you
guys<00:05:00.080> can<00:05:00.289> decide<00:05:00.410> from<00:05:00.740> there<00:05:00.830> if<00:05:01.009> it's

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
guys can decide from there if it's

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.920 
guys can decide from there if it's
something<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.699> you<00:05:01.729> want<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.270> be<00:05:02.389> putting

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
something that you want to be putting

something that you want to be putting
into<00:05:03.080> your<00:05:03.169> body<00:05:03.259> or<00:05:03.770> not<00:05:04.009> you<00:05:04.160> know<00:05:04.280> there's

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
into your body or not you know there's

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.879 
into your body or not you know there's
just<00:05:05.090> nothing<00:05:05.599> that's<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:06.110> good<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.650> soy

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
just nothing that's so good in the soy

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.010 
just nothing that's so good in the soy
that<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.310> can't<00:05:07.639> get<00:05:07.910> from<00:05:08.150> other<00:05:08.449> food

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
that you can't get from other food

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.890 
that you can't get from other food
sources<00:05:09.050> so<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:11.030> me<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:11.330> just<00:05:11.360> made<00:05:11.570> sense

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
sources so it to me it just made sense

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.960 
sources so it to me it just made sense
to<00:05:12.050> cut<00:05:12.349> soy<00:05:12.590> out<00:05:12.830> completely<00:05:13.310> I<00:05:13.460> can<00:05:13.699> get<00:05:13.820> all

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
to cut soy out completely I can get all

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.120 
to cut soy out completely I can get all
the<00:05:14.000> other<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.720> know<00:05:14.750> good<00:05:15.560> things<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:15.949> guess

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
the other you know good things I guess

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.100 
the other you know good things I guess
that<00:05:16.280> might<00:05:16.400> be<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:16.669> soy<00:05:16.940> from<00:05:17.539> other<00:05:17.720> foods

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
that might be in soy from other foods

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.200 
that might be in soy from other foods
that<00:05:18.440> don't<00:05:18.680> have<00:05:18.860> all<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.460> other<00:05:19.639> negative

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
that don't have all the other negative

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
unwrap and open e which is like ninety

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.339

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
America and around the world so your soy

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.520 
America and around the world so your soy
consumption<00:05:48.590> can<00:05:48.919> really<00:05:49.370> add<00:05:49.610> up<00:05:49.719> so<00:05:50.719> if<00:05:50.990> the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
consumption can really add up so if the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.770 
consumption can really add up so if the
best<00:05:51.830> way<00:05:52.099> to<00:05:52.159> avoid<00:05:52.490> this<00:05:53.000> or<00:05:53.240> keep<00:05:53.449> this<00:05:53.599> from

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
best way to avoid this or keep this from

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.330 
best way to avoid this or keep this from
happening<00:05:53.960> is<00:05:54.409> when<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.740> pay<00:05:54.889> attention<00:05:55.009> to

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
happening is when you pay attention to

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.620 
happening is when you pay attention to
what<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:55.610> eat<00:05:55.759> and<00:05:55.789> basically<00:05:56.180> just<00:05:56.419> eat

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
what you eat and basically just eat

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.959 
what you eat and basically just eat

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
foods that are whole organic raw

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.300 
foods that are whole organic raw
unprocessed<00:05:59.570> you<00:06:00.050> know<00:06:00.169> that<00:06:00.349> that<00:06:00.979> would<00:06:01.130> cut

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
unprocessed you know that that would cut

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.129 
unprocessed you know that that would cut
down<00:06:01.490> on<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.699> lot<00:06:01.969> of<00:06:02.120> problems<00:06:02.449> we<00:06:02.599> have<00:06:02.780> but

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
down on a lot of problems we have but

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.020 
down on a lot of problems we have but
definitely<00:06:04.099> it<00:06:04.340> would<00:06:04.400> definitely<00:06:04.580> cut<00:06:04.849> back

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
definitely it would definitely cut back

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.249 
definitely it would definitely cut back
on<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.300> amount<00:06:05.330> of<00:06:05.539> soy<00:06:05.719> that<00:06:05.930> you're<00:06:06.020> putting
