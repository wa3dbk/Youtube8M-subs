00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.690 

okay<00:01:28.420> now<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.659> register<00:01:29.080> is<00:01:29.140> complete<00:01:30.930> okay

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
okay now the register is complete okay

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.999 
okay now the register is complete okay
and<00:01:33.700> now<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.939> test<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.450> Bluetooth<00:01:34.810> device<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
and now the test a Bluetooth device you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
connect bluetooth go to Java and now

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.930 
connect bluetooth go to Java and now
it's<00:01:44.590> going<00:01:44.680> to<00:01:44.770> connect<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.159> job<00:01:45.369> loan<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.850> I

it's going to connect the job loan and I

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.560 
it's going to connect the job loan and I
was<00:01:46.030> going<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.240> test<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.690> make<00:01:47.200> sure<00:01:47.259> it<00:01:47.470> works

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
was going to test it make sure it works

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.090 
was going to test it make sure it works
okay<00:01:49.570> so<00:01:49.810> I'm<00:01:50.530> just<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.830> do<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.979> little

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
okay so I'm just going to do a little

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.210 
okay so I'm just going to do a little
testing<00:01:51.670> here

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
testing here

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:04.289 
testing here
let's<00:01:54.220> see<00:01:54.580> system<00:01:55.390> default<00:01:59.190> all<00:02:00.190> right

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:16.120 

first<00:02:05.080> time<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.440> heads<00:02:05.680> out

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.340 

all<00:02:16.760> right<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.660> my<00:02:17.870> headsets<00:02:18.200> on

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
all right I think my headsets on

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.980 
all right I think my headsets on
input<00:02:21.190> device<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.630> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.840> be<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
input device it's going to be the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.740 
input device it's going to be the
jawbone<00:02:23.880> output<00:02:24.880> device<00:02:25.150> will<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.510> job

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
jawbone output device will be the job

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.920 
jawbone output device will be the job
all<00:02:26.500> right<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.950> I'm<00:02:27.130> testing<00:02:27.640> testing<00:02:28.420> testing

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
all right so I'm testing testing testing

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.390 
all right so I'm testing testing testing
all<00:02:29.620> right<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:29.920> I'm<00:02:29.980> going<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.130> change<00:02:30.250> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
all right and I'm going to change the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.880 
all right and I'm going to change the
output<00:02:30.580> device<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.330> be<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.620> system<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.890> now

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
output device to be the system and now

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.770 
output device to be the system and now
as<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.130> can<00:02:36.220> see<00:02:36.280> it's<00:02:36.820> scanning<00:02:37.270> through<00:02:37.510> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
as you can see it's scanning through and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.330 
as you can see it's scanning through and
the<00:02:38.410> system<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.250> picking<00:02:39.640> my<00:02:39.940> voice<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:41.340> you

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
the system is picking my voice on it you

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.800 
the system is picking my voice on it you
can<00:02:42.430> also<00:02:42.550> change<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.330> when<00:02:43.540> you're<00:02:43.660> in

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
can also change it so when you're in

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.990 
can also change it so when you're in
game<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.080> can<00:02:44.470> hear<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.950> other<00:02:45.130> voices<00:02:45.430> that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
game you can hear the other voices that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.660 
game you can hear the other voices that
are<00:02:46.240> being<00:02:46.450> said<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.860> through<00:02:48.340> your<00:02:48.490> headset
