00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 joop guest and welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.920
 episode of millions of hunts ie now the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.470
 previous episode chose up 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 briefcase 69 serious melody is not me 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.929
 have chosen case 6 instead 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:20.369
 what 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:21.570
 tiger a mark why we have now 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.279
 maybe a problem i don't know 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.510
 sure if there was a premium in our club 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.460
 after I check the previous one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.080
 episode you have this card so I hope 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.670
 that's ok too 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.619
 we can both chesney and euro 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
 stopping here also equals jar 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 most of the searches are in divisions 6 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.989
 like you the previous episode too 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.230
 just to the see when we were 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.629
 not being promoted against being 9010 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 ah yes this is only from the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.600
 most dramatic episodes to date 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.300
 what first are we preached within us 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.010
 suitcase then come against this team 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 This also will be no picnic 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.469
 even the who has that 100 booty morning 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.329
 how the good goes and this 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.379
 is going to be a real challenge like 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.480
 you might also have noticed 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.369
 my channel i have vacation that now 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.049
 means reasonably have much time 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.090
 videos to make this is full of candy third 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.250
 video that I make in three days 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.049
 essential if you just let it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.369
 know if you want that daily 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.090
 Upload or whether you think that's no 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.310
 too much 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 just leave a blue thumb behind god 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.600
 well what do you do if you have a chill 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.790
 think it is very appreciated from 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.750
 my cat too if you have a thumb 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.390
 let it up 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 I of course youtuber and it is just 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.600
 nice to see something you make 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.610
 something quality in the content 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.890
 that you create that is appreciated 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.850
 your viewers would be the now one here 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 to score 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.090
 we can immediately get a chance again 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.890
 create it is not very good at it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.869
 defend the has the free the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.920
 defense or your desk on the keeper 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.659
 dirty sanchez on that maria di maria 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.790
 Back on Sanchez Sanchez Ward Loop 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.220
 deep you it when he also runs deep 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.399
 yes yes then he is going to sweat him on oh 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.930
 my god i have been serious then 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.640
 then you see open cool and having is like that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.320
 not concentrated, you normally count 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.509
 just that they are first time when 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.729
 it was the right one got free 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.480
 kick from her this is not a position 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.980
 for him 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.420
 think i'm someone with more power behind 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.040
 put the ball in and that's natural 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.120
 yaya tourÃ© I have that ball 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.120
 approve that he goes into it 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.460
 let's not go there anymore about the tour 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.970
 the battery also what action what a 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.520
 walk anything and now you will see 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.020
 three point the battery back at 0 2 this 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.450
 dude has a ridiculously good team 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.740
 but totally unable to defend it and it 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.420
 pretty funny because you actually see very 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.680
 often that people with a good team 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.970
 just one of the worst player said 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.470
 I have that too, I already have it once 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.670
 said by the fire little dick 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.650
 effect hassle I have it once 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.270
 said but you often see those 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.370
 old men in such a big or very big one 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.020
 expensive car and that means they do 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.730
 just have to compensate for one 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.220
 small nickel like you expensive players 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.660
 need it means you for 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.230
 do not trust your own quality and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.760
 on the quality of your players and therefore 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.610
 it won't always be this one 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.920
 an exception that the for care 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.450
 I mean that sometimes I mean one 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.530
 good team that member since 10 that yesterday 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.960
 had uploaded 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.340
 that is fine too but i'm on my own 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.200
 play a very good fifa so then 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.000
 it's a plus plus situation and that is then 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.800
 a bucket and chill with them gestanden 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.180
 Gerefit what the skill example already 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.130
 again though quite reasonable alongside me 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
 was to dress talk to me argumentation 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.880
 can microfiche in right now because i am 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.410
 focused and players and then talk was 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.910
 so good we go the second 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.489
 match search we are going a second 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.610
 game came in the same BPL team 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.380
 hit her 86 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.150
 walked and like 10 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.920
 it must be exactly j cole but without 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.500
 all too many chemistry ff rest are just one 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.110
 number of games via players a number 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.209
 public players and danilo time that 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.709
 report this to you again and again 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.390
 just a like behind if you find that 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.580
 the daily upload really is chill one 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.590
 good addition to my channel and late 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.420
 leave a comment or now come on 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.010
 feedback if you have something like rooijen 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.900
 did you upload a lot i have one 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.640
 missed some videos because I have them 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 just not in so seen the box 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.370
 then I also like to know because it 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.660
 is of course about important collection 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.550
 Santa's on her this must be spider 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.410
 right to the keeper this this this potty this 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.340
 goes so far not very flawless and 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.239
 it's breaking it 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.790
 world on man de 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.620
 ship to go you what the mass that we 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.989
 rear right not that pay attention what 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.609
 by Hazare was not offside stood 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.949
 put a shop along the keeper 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.240
 oh we have a corner and it has 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.680
 not well concealed 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.630
 And that means we have a lot of space 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.910
 now if this purple goes well what 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.310
 that goes means that her she second 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.150
 and that makes it bullock what 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.190
 I really happened that happened 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.790
 that seriously what a 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.350
 balls management and nice balls 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.450
 well broad today say they find each other 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.840
 all the time is something like the weather 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.840
 tipping 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.910
 well could not have a number 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.860
 worked as such as through part 2 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.900
 what a bubble of kuperus oldies too 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.310
 don't let them pass perfectly by sharing that 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.170
 own soul from still a search 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.260
 where it went and this time 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.800
 makes something wants what 2 0 injured 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.110
 what an assumption what dribble no there 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.610
 is going to score because it does not say belly this 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.500
 do not turn in the right direction 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.050
 yes that is still I think the difference 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.760
 between diego costa team of the season and 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.510
 normal defenders that he put him in one 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.510
 can run out 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.370
 referee has called off 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.290
 also this match 2 and won 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.280
 we now have 7 points in divisions 6 that 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.390
 That means if we have the following 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.770
 episode 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.810
 all competitions win have 13 points 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.190
 can no longer degrade me 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.720
 do not think that will happen because we 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.310
 are still undefeated in the 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.600
 league millions so touch wood 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.610
 that it's not going to happen people
