what<00:03:40.890> do<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.130> mean<00:03:41.160> with<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.580> well<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:42.450> prime

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
what do I mean with that well the prime

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.740 
what do I mean with that well the prime
example<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.590> certainly<00:03:44.070> going<00:03:44.850> for<00:03:45.270> steel

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
example is certainly going for steel

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.710 
example is certainly going for steel
running<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.830> fast-break<00:03:47.420> going<00:03:48.420> for<00:03:48.690> a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
running the fast-break going for a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.840 
running the fast-break going for a
dribble<00:03:49.080> move<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.530> then<00:03:49.860> converting<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.610> layup

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
dribble move and then converting a layup

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.920 
or a slam dunk
now<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.220> sequence<00:03:53.850> would<00:03:54.120> get<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.540> five<00:03:54.900> or

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
now that sequence would get you five or

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.800 
now that sequence would get you five or
six<00:03:55.500> ratings<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.340> overall<00:03:57.060> your<00:03:57.330> teammate
