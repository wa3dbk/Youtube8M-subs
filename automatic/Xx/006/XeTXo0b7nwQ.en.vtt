00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
was just trying to take a guess as to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
was just trying to take a guess as to
where<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.309> go

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
where it was but here we go

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.030 
where it was but here we go
I<00:01:06.210> think<00:01:06.810> that's<00:01:06.960> brighter<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
I think that's brighter I think that's a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
I think that's brighter I think that's a
brighter<00:01:08.280> blue<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.600> else<00:01:09.689> is

brighter blue I don't know what else is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.500 
brighter blue I don't know what else is
definite<00:01:10.140> let's<00:01:10.290> say<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
definite let's say I think it's just the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.870 
definite let's say I think it's just the
boost<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> his<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.830> blue<00:01:14.250> color<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
boost and his little blue color when you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
good as how I'm seeing it but at least

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.310

you<00:05:33.310> guys<00:05:33.580> can<00:05:33.640> witness<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.419> frame<00:05:34.690> rate<00:05:34.990> I

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
you guys can witness the frame rate I

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.170 
you guys can witness the frame rate I
guess<00:05:36.010> there's<00:05:36.160> no<00:05:36.250> gravity<00:05:36.550> in<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:36.760> part<00:05:36.970> I

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.250 
guess there's no gravity in this part I
was<00:05:37.330> kind<00:05:37.540> of<00:05:37.570> expecting<00:05:37.750> that<00:05:38.080> though

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
was kind of expecting that though

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.560 
was kind of expecting that though
because<00:05:39.070> I<00:05:39.520> guess<00:05:40.000> it's<00:05:40.180> like<00:05:40.300> hard<00:05:40.510> to

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
because I guess it's like hard to

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.510 
because I guess it's like hard to
manipulate<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.650> gravity<00:05:42.040> or<00:05:42.160> whatever<00:05:42.400> in

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
manipulate the gravity or whatever in

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.790 
manipulate the gravity or whatever in
