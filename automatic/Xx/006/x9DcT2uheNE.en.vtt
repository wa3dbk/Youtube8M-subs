 wants is from calida and goodgame has it 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.860
 also with it 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.219
 we want you 1 of our today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.500
 new projects and that is 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.180
 the one org started by me 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.550
 I started three days ago 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.689
 yes and the idea behind it was just time 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.840
 a little something different to build 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.309
 have so here on the server so style of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.870
 has now naturalized a bit 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.610
 and it's really only 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.950
 still so that's a medieval one 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.120
 City is merely built into something 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.350
 other architectural style and there we wanted it 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 got me out a bit I wanted one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.829
 bring in a little more fantasy with 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.910
 and we want that now 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.910
 look exactly located 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.710
 Here you can see the entrance 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.450
 by the big gate his skull with 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 big teeth here from the two 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.840
 huge chains is kept chained 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.510
 are connected with the winds here 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.730
 On top of the tower , these are still 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.340
 not quite finished like a lot here 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.760
 looks that is all still very mau 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.960
 and just so easily torn and 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.110
 planned as the landscape here for 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.670
 example that is I have you so first 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.310
 set to look like that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:50.479
 Everyone looks very much 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:55.940
 carried away devastated and withered 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:02:01.450
 no trees no grass no 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:09.290
 water only volcanoes volcanic crater lava death 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:11.000
 and everything is very dirty and yes the 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.209
 Diet itself should also by a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.920
 tell stories and of those of 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.080
 big battles and massacres because of the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 already report through their own 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.410
 appearance exactly one should really 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.330
 see that the fortress is like already 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.440
 was besieged at the area here 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.090
 is still broken siege devices 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.820
 ruins of burning houses and everything 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.959
 I'm possible every time I'm with you 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.320
 continue the project 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.730
 and yes you are in the fortress 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.340
 there is still a lot to do 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.810
 that's just like that one now 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.370
 only the scenery that I built there 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.600
 I have to see if that in itself 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.430
 I really look what I am there 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.660
 thought yes it is roughly the fortress 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.340
 torn mountain here you can also see the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.170
 whole voxels that are still unprocessed 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.910
 stand around 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.180
 Here is the keep that I am today 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.100
 That started very much 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.530
 in its basic form there is another 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.530
 entire amount of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.760
 which is when I first finished with him 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.330
 I look completely different 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.990
 his own little no castle inside 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.560
 the fortress 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.450
 that's just the last place of retreat 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.850
 if the fortress walls can file 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.380
 The remaining ones are better able to 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.270
 fighter again in the bergfried back 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.810
 to pull and from there again 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.130
 to offer resistance 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.260
 The whole thing should not be like one 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.819
 so it is to be built 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.690
 For example, no market or harbor or 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.450
 so what is planned is a military camp 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.330
 be that fortress so house of 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:53.350
 soldiers exactly yes weapons one can and 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:57.100
 various times just a little something 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.180
 something else new 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.840
 the landscape always a bit of 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:07.120
 show exactly above and then back to 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.440
 in front of the gate he collects a volcanic crater 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.090
 I made the rest 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.959
 landscape that should also be determined 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.180
 of big volcanoes that is there now 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.450
 but it is quite small 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.340
 we will be there soon 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.550
 a few videos out here progressed too 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.729
 see there then make a little leak 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.479
 There are huge mountains in the back 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.120
 to recognize 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.900
 Of course not otherwise I have to now 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.060
 first load second 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.910
 That's why I planned two volcanoes 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.910
 through which one enters the thalia 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.229
 in general, so to speak, are for the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.210
 Disarmament still no name so if 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.780
 you think of something good and so 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.930
 Write in the comments 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.630
 would like to behave then like that 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.070
 Wanting to take dignified and when you star 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.650
 players on plaintiff side think of course 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.800
 also its price 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:10.070
 I hungry and take your name 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:14.340
 So who the creatively surprised us 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.510
 yes in general if we are here for of course 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.340
 create a project and you have yes 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.639
 our website under directory below 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.610
 kw / projects that would of course be yourself 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.220
 also use for this project that is 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.930
 There you will get a screenshot gallery 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.669
 Find and always his current status 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.690
 and a description is whole project 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.450
 that you can read everything 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.280
