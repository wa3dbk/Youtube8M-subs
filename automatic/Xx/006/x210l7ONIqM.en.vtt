00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 wake up today we're going to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:26.279
 fishing 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:29.400
 oh my god not this whole hour trudge 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:36.620
 walk to the pier and then listen 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.620
 pancake damn day loss 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.730
 but as always 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.430
 not a damn thing on this lake but 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:23.400
 nothing now I will tell you a legend 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:29.540
 this story happened many centuries 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:36.950
 back one day on the lake fishing 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.950
 man and there was a noise in the water 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 the fisherman looked round and suddenly he saw two 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:51.810
 beautiful girls in the water they are so 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.570
 beckoned him to himself for a long time he looked at 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.770
 them and admired their beauty 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:08.850
 in the end, he could not resist and jumped into the water 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:12.890
 no one else saw him 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.890
