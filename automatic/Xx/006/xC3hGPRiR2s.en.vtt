00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.440
 all right 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.980
 the macaroni is a basic dish that 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.720
 they will always get us out of a hurry and that 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.640
 they also like practically all the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.770
 world is a dish that the kids 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.599
 I love it especially and it also brings 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.310
 much energy but not only is it a 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.500
 dish for children to adults we 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.660
 love just where a good dish is 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.180
 of macaroni with homemade bolognesa sauce 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.250
 that the rest be removed 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.740
 The ingredients we need are 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.230
 about 100 grams of 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.500
 macaroni per person an onion 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.480
 small half red pepper red meat 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.220
 chicken or pork 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.830
 400 grams of crushed natural tomato 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.280
 but if you do not like him with so much tomato 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.890
 you throw about 250 or 300 grams a 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.930
 spoonful of homeland the fine herbs 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.470
 a teaspoon of butter 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.620
 next spices thyme rosemary 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.020
 oregano dill and ground black pepper 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.820
 a bay leaf a teaspoon of 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.160
 sugar but only needed to 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.009
 reduce the acid to the cheese tomato 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.310
 grated to serve olive oil salt 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.380
 and water 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.570
 we will start cutting the onion by 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 half and removing the skin until 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.020
 half we will make some cuts in vertical 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.149
 all over the surface without reaching the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 final and then we will make a cut for 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.320
 the medium horizontally without reaching 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.240
 neither at the end then the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.340
 we cut from top to bottom and we'll see that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.649
 do not extract the onion in cubes this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.360
 type of cut is called witches when 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.890
 we have to do I'm going to cut the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.710
 we just chopped with the knife to 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.780
 leave it finer 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.790
 we will remove the tail and the heart to 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.770
 red pepper and we will tell it in strips 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.570
 we clean the inner part of 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.729
 seeds we remove the white parts 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.830
 and the strips that we have cut before 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.280
 we'll make squares like that with all the 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.280
 pepper 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.909
 shred all the minced meat in a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.979
 dish I have used two hamburgers 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.509
 of chicken I had but if you do not buy 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.899
 directly in your butcher shop the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.899
 mince 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.590
 in a medium casserole we will put a 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.569
 tablespoon of butter a dash of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.970
 olive oil and let it melt 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.280
 all together when it's melted and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.900
 hot we will add the minced meat and the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.819
 We will stir until it is done 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.360
 but without getting browned like that it will be more 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.610
 juicy 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.560
 we reserve the meat and we go back to throwing 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.570
 a splash of olive oil when 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.910
 is hot we will add the onion 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.920
 chopped a little salt to release 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.530
 your water and we'll let you listen to fire 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.140
 medium when poached we add the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.360
 red pepper and a pinch of salt 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.430
 we integrate with the onion and we let 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.280
 he also struck out for about 68 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.110
 minutes when it's already poached 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.080
 we will put the leaf of laurel split 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.370
 so that it releases more flavor and more aroma of 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.680
 while we are going to take the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.660
 Macaroni we put something in a salt pot 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.640
 and oil and when it starts to boil it 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.530
 we add the pasta we let it boil 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.660
 medium-high heat until cooked 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.280
 If you like al dente, keep an eye on the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.650
 cooking so you do not get all done 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.870
 of while we will finish our 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.000
 bolognesa sauce let's add the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.620
 crushed tomato to our sofrito and if 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.450
 You see that it is very acid rectify it 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.910
 with a little sugar until it is 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.260
 At your pleasure we remove it and leave 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.269
 to warm up 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 Once booting in the bubbles of the 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.799
 Tomato we will give you our pleasure 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.319
 essences of thyme rosemary oregano 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.480
 dill and black mint I have thrown 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.659
 approximately one tablespoon of each 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.189
 but I already tell you that it is to your liking 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.110
 we mix everything so that they integrate 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.940
 well the spices and we add a 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.099
 spoonful of fine herbs pÃ¢tÃ© that 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.630
 will enhance the flavor of our sauce what 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.880
 stir to make it melt well 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.500
 to the minced meat I added a couple 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.710
 of sliced â€‹â€‹sausages that were left over 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.140
 of the dinner so he also took advantage 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.090
 we add the meat to the sauce and stir 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.310
 a little bit and let's see how are the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.989
 macaroni 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.150
 well, the macaroni is already 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.560
 cooked we drain them if necessary and 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.319
 we are going to incorporate them into our 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.239
 delicious Bolognese sauce we revolve 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.530
 carefully so that they do not separate us and 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.140
 we integrate it very well so that it 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.360
 salsa come together well we leave it 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.340
 warm up in a loose fire we will cover it and 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.500
 we'll let it sit for 510 minutes 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.650
 before serving we will serve you with a 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.940
 little bit of grated cheese on top
