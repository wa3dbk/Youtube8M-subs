00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
that we've all pretty much came across

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.200 
that we've all pretty much came across
it's<00:00:43.830> not<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:45.540> Iron<00:00:45.810> Gym<00:00:46.220> versus<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.670> p90x

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
awesome just because of the fact that

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.290

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
to show you guys in a second is that the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410 
to show you guys in a second is that the
p90x<00:01:06.869> pull-up<00:01:07.380> bar<00:01:07.590> has<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.340> wider<00:01:08.850> range<00:01:09.210> of
