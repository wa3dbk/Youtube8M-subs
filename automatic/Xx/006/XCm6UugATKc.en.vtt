00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.060
 I wish I had the beak To be satisfied with the crumbs 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.230
 Concentrated and very attentive Yes, but with your head in the clouds 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.660
 Understanding feelings when they are born when they die 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.670
 So I would like to have the senses to feel the danger 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.090
 If everyone knows this but they are afraid that love is a deception 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.230
 Oh, my grandmother did it 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.990
 for fifty years with my grandfather in the country 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 More or less like a pigeon does 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.240
 I know that the comparison is ugly 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 but I would live with the excitement of trusting those who pull me bread 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.730
 More or less like a pigeon does 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.790
 love above the cornice 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.880
 I would stay close in times of crisis 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 and far away when you ask me 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.670
 tell me what you believe 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.490
 AND TRUST YOU 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.480
 urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.040
 One day I had the wind that accompanied me on a tile 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.390
 Sometimes I'm alone and scared, 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 What do two pigeons do in a fairy tale? 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.130
 If everyone knows this but they are afraid that love is a deception 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.740
 Oh, my grandmother told me 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.110
 "Do you know how many times I didn't think of your grandfather?" 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.420
 More or less like a pigeon does 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.430
 And not like people 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 that because of the details 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.730
 They send dreams and great loves for air 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.860
 I will walk like a pigeon barefoot on the asphalt 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.930
 The guide believes he puts me under 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.970
 But I jump to the last moment-oo 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.190
 I will fly 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.790
 but not too high 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.030
 Because the secret is 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.750
 fly low 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 and a pigeon flies low
