clay put on the wheel and sent it up

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.709 
clay put on the wheel and sent it up
again<00:00:14.190> I'm<00:00:14.340> bringing<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.940> because<00:00:15.120> I'm

again I'm bringing it up because I'm
going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> stopper<00:00:17.029> for<00:00:18.029> those<00:00:18.180> olive

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
going to make a stopper for those olive

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.390 
going to make a stopper for those olive
oil<00:00:18.779> jars<00:00:19.140> at<00:00:19.410> me<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:22.580> take<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:25.279> little<00:00:26.279> bit<00:00:26.369> of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
oil jars at me so take the little bit of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.310 
oil jars at me so take the little bit of
a<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:27.619> knob<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.800> want<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> top<00:00:29.460> there

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
a a knob we want on the top there

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
a a knob we want on the top there
let<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.439> get<00:00:31.619> hold<00:00:31.830> off<00:00:34.370> take<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> width<00:00:35.730> there

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
let me get hold off take the width there

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:51.530 
let me get hold off take the width there
and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:39.590> push<00:00:40.590> down<00:00:41.180> down

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.540 

to<00:00:52.140> tighten<00:00:52.440> taper<00:00:52.950> it<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.400> same<00:00:53.640> time

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
to tighten taper it at the same time

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.310 
to tighten taper it at the same time
okay<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:58.050> actual<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:01.200> actual<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:03.320> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
okay the actual the actual them this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.820 
okay the actual the actual them this
part<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.130> taper<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.290> if<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.800> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
part here you taper it so if you get a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
part here you taper it so if you get a
variance<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:10.400> diameter<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:20.570> in<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
variance in the diameter of the in the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.910 
variance in the diameter of the in the
top<00:01:21.930> there<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.590> whole<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.920> variance

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
top there the whole you get a variance

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.300 
top there the whole you get a variance
in<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.160> size<00:01:26.990> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.110> taper<00:01:28.410> this<00:01:28.830> you'll

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
in that size if you taper this you'll

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
in that size if you taper this you'll
find<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:29.850> it'll<00:01:30.210> fit<00:01:34.790> any<00:01:35.790> number<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
find it all it'll fit any number of

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.640 
find it all it'll fit any number of
different<00:01:36.690> sizes<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.110> you've<00:01:37.350> happened

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
different sizes that you've happened

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.460 
different sizes that you've happened
have<00:01:37.770> made<00:01:38.570> because<00:01:39.570> generally<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:40.320> we're

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
have made because generally when we're

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170 
have made because generally when we're
doing<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.830> we<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.160> measure<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.700> inside

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
doing that we don't measure the inside

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.290 
doing that we don't measure the inside
so<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.250> making<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.670> line<00:01:44.910> there<00:01:45.210> with

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
so and now just making a line there with

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.570 
so and now just making a line there with
my<00:01:45.450> fingernail

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
my fingernail

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.180 
my fingernail

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
I've just got a blade here of a knife

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.749 
I've just got a blade here of a knife

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.790 
which I first just wet and like getting
my<00:01:54.390> finger<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.869> thumb<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.380> ready<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> know

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
my finger and thumb here ready you know

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.120 
my finger and thumb here ready you know
just<00:01:56.460> put<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> blade<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.080> middle<00:01:58.320> like

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
just put the blade in to the middle like

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.680 
just put the blade in to the middle like
that<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.580> lift<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.870> there<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:02.390> okay<00:02:03.390> on

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the board okay now back to back to our

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.160 
the board okay now back to back to our
lump<00:02:09.510> of<00:02:09.660> plate<00:02:09.929> pull<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.679> again<00:02:10.979> alright

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.570 

basically<00:02:17.980> what<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.820> want<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.270> get<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
basically what you want to do is get the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.990 
basically what you want to do is get the
the<00:02:21.580> width<00:02:22.320> at<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.440> maximum<00:02:23.950> point<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the width at the maximum point the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.970 
the width at the maximum point the
diameter<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.570> this<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.350> then<00:02:26.650> out<00:02:26.920> of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
diameter of this here and then out of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.120 
diameter of this here and then out of
that<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.280> then<00:02:29.490> do<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.640> top<00:02:30.820> bit<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:32.110> knob

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.590 

make<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.820> get<00:02:37.030> hold<00:02:37.240> of<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
make it so you can get hold of it

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.760 
make it so you can get hold of it
remember<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.850> an<00:02:42.970> olive<00:02:43.300> oil<00:02:43.600> job<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.470> might

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
remember it's an olive oil job it might

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.630 
remember it's an olive oil job it might
get<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.070> bit<00:02:45.280> slippery<00:02:45.910> after<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.540> while<00:02:47.190> if<00:02:48.190> it's

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.160 

badly<00:02:51.640> designed<00:02:51.970> it'll<00:02:52.540> just<00:02:52.750> slip<00:02:52.990> through

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
badly designed it'll just slip through

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.860 
badly designed it'll just slip through
your<00:02:53.290> fingers<00:02:54.570> okay

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
your fingers okay

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.460 
your fingers okay
again<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:57.270> just<00:02:58.270> stick<00:02:58.810> my<00:02:58.989> finger<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.620> there

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
again I just stick my finger in there

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:10.860 
again I just stick my finger in there
that<00:03:04.470> take<00:03:05.470> our<00:03:06.930> knife<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:09.690> stick<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.780> in

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
that take our knife and just stick it in

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:27.210 
that take our knife and just stick it in
there<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.290> lift<00:03:11.820> all<00:03:12.820> right<00:03:16.320> one<00:03:17.320> more

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:48.100 

bring<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:28.490> like<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:34.510> form<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.690> top

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:57.770 

slowly<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.290> lump<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.650> clay

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:08.690 

yes<00:03:58.780> smaller<00:04:00.900> obviously
