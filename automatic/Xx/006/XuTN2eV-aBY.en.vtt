00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.079
 we will see now 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.929
 Customer's shoelace 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.929
 can be accessed 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.710
 we have here 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 until the decline 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.760
 banished from the shock sequel type bpchoque pastures 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.419
 I think I expected so many classics 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.659
 all that we nor in the statutes by all this has 220 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.820
 the xevelhas kilos each state 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 since he was injured 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720
 all of this creates a postman 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.320
 Customer service in the case of shifts 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.590
 modifying 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 written in crisis matters very little to predict 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.220
 the 13 years and 500 thousand 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.610
 real 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.050
 in the municipality of rio de janeiro niemi in the pallium that was parked for the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.400
 clinical 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 This information is very important and 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.540
 the positive register others also 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.760
 the cac phone calls 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.930
 visiting your home 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.140
 and therefore also 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.530
 I'll try 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.549
 no client can be an owner can if interested in the purchase of the property 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 no letter 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.060
 here is a lesson the criterion of customers seeking to escape 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.510
 however that we do not even have that possibility I think the siege more 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.970
 and the criteria 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.570
 on that button injured molds 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.800
 It's a lot of pressure why clicking a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.740
 messi is the best talent bank survey the real estate that are 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.890
 with the criterion 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 who has already identified 601 points 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.600
 the electric shock 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 this reason 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 interesting is that it streamlined states 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.439
 the same way we can from a 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.259
 click that button until the fifth round 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.469
 and in those moments is better Brazilian I think that this homemade option 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.099
 he is searching here they interested 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.609
 the grill chopp 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.609
 I agree with Oscar 3% 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.959
 clint 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.159
 so much Ricardo 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.659

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.039
