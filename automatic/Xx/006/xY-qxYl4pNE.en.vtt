00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hi guys, everything's good to play in the tips, nothing. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.900
 Professional, but I'm going to give some 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.500
 How to Paint the Secret Garden 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 I 'm kind of addicted to it from here and it's a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
 weird photo 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.670
 We'll show you how I organized the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.510
 my pencils in the pens and today a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.830
 cutlery I had here at home 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.740
 there is everything super organiza line 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 I want to show you here is the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.350
 tips is how to paint I really like 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.420
 Paint nothing professional but I 'm going to come 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 I'm going to even learn how I do not 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.950
 I found nothing on youtube how to do these 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.350
 civil techniques record a video for you 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 to see how, for example, these 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.760
 here in s here we are going to paint this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 flower dacta just look for one of the tips 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 it is always to have pencil sharpened the tip of the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.199
 pencil sharp is sharp there the tip is never 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:10.439
 carry too much when you are 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:14.250
 making the base always have lightness in the hand 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.390
 do not marry on paper pencil on paper you 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.619
 will try to paint always the same 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.409
 sense 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.240
 so as not to be at risk to stay 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.979
 paint as possible and I will 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 teaching to make a gradient is for who has 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.780
 pencil watercolor weiss and not now she 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.670
 won for example have lips buy the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.180
 pencil and did not know how to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.329
 This is used there. I learned later. 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.430
 watercolor points have to be really 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.680
 is painted on a car in the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.390
 forest is to make a gradient 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.310
 Now you're going to say yes and that's it. 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.290
 charity at departure you want it to stay 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.530
 darker yet for what you want to go 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.020
 more to have bc do not buy using 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.360
 what is a color and lava I was painting 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.069
 and passing the foot're not operate at all 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.810
 so the team was not understanding 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.959
 so the secret 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.680
 the next I like having a paintbrush 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.030
 I put a brush right next to the tip 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.590
 wet brush 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.640
 I'm going to look at the pencil point 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.610
 I do not brush here, I'll let her stay 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.519
 a little glance and can not have much 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:43.790
 Water success at the tip are you coming 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:46.680
 here it is very wet, you are now 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.799
 seems not to make much difference but makes the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.230
 people when the tip with this stay in 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:57.030
 quadra water with this difference 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.330
 now seeing to make the leaves is the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.650
 same system, it's alright, it's always sharp. 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:09.049
 will see who always paint talk in the hand 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:14.040
 then change the tip of the pencil in the brush 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:16.290
 ne also need it, this is farm and farm 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 I like to do so, do not like just the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.130
 risk 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.900
 I'm going to vary only using my imagination 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.940
 sometimes I like to paint the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.239
 leaves but I paint so others I 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.310
 pinto sciences here it is with the pencil is 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.500
 reprehensible is just getting here is 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.160
 bet on white stays on this plane 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.299
 so much this is how I hope you liked it 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.130
 of the tips 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.200
 This is my performance here was when I 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.480
 I started here was when I already went 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.090
 gaining technique that I was already a little 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.670
 more rigid 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.590
 sometimes it also understands yellow and 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:56.819
 with the tip of the pencil changed only 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:59.639
 make the chicks tim so pink here 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.170
 It was the same pink it was even apis and 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.989
 ask this is just letting go of the imagination 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.000
 people look so beautiful there, the partnerships 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.090
 until this team is beautiful with the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.930
 I used two techniques there. 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.000
 from the pencil 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.940
 This one here I do not know the color and lava 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.930
 procas also looked very pretty and stay 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.229
 walking but I used more shades lopes pt 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.229
 in the state
