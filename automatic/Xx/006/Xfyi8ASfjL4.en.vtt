00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
through a season and this takes a lot of

I<00:02:30.500> talked<00:02:31.010> talked<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.209> guys<00:02:32.269> last<00:02:32.590> um<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
I talked talked to you guys last um the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.660 
I talked talked to you guys last um the
new<00:02:35.750> alignment<00:02:36.200> thing<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.069> guess<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.340> call<00:02:37.640> it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
new alignment thing I guess you call it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.039 
new alignment thing I guess you call it
I<00:02:37.970> don't<00:02:38.239> really<00:02:38.360> know<00:02:38.569> what<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.780> called<00:02:38.989> to

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
I don't really know what it's called to

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.500 
I don't really know what it's called to
be<00:02:39.140> honest<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.709> new<00:02:39.859> division<00:02:40.250> thing<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
be honest the new division thing the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.479 
be honest the new division thing the
players<00:02:41.720> kind<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.049> rejected<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.680> guess<00:02:42.890> so

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
players kind of rejected it I guess so

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.599 
players kind of rejected it I guess so
it's<00:02:44.359> not<00:02:44.510> gonna<00:02:44.629> be<00:02:44.750> happening<00:02:44.870> next<00:02:45.109> year<00:02:45.379> I

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
it's not gonna be happening next year I

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.410 
it's not gonna be happening next year I
haven't<00:02:46.609> really<00:02:46.700> looked<00:02:46.879> into<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.390> much

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
haven't really looked into it that much

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.360 
haven't really looked into it that much
but<00:02:47.840> I'm<00:02:48.470> not<00:02:48.739> sure<00:02:48.769> what's<00:02:48.980> gonna<00:02:49.040> happen<00:02:49.280> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
all-star game I just watched the draft

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.809 
all-star game I just watched the draft
was<00:03:10.420> pretty<00:03:11.420> good<00:03:11.799> they<00:03:12.799> castles<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.459> Kessel

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
was pretty good they castles that Kessel

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.539 
was pretty good they castles that Kessel
didn't<00:03:14.150> get<00:03:14.269> picked<00:03:14.480> last<00:03:15.069> they<00:03:16.069> actually<00:03:16.400> had

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
didn't get picked last they actually had

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.150 
didn't get picked last they actually had
Kuchar<00:03:17.090> picked<00:03:17.450> last<00:03:17.629> which<00:03:18.049> kind<00:03:18.709> surprising

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
Kuchar picked last which kind surprising

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.699 
Kuchar picked last which kind surprising
um<00:03:19.720> he's<00:03:20.720> actually<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:21.139> really<00:03:21.260> good<00:03:21.500> player

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
um he's actually a really good player

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.069 
um he's actually a really good player
but<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:22.790> pretty<00:03:23.359> much<00:03:23.449> everyone<00:03:23.810> there<00:03:23.959> was

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
but I pretty much everyone there was

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.229 
but I pretty much everyone there was
really<00:03:24.319> good<00:03:24.440> player<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.069> really<00:03:26.000> would

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
really good player and really would

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.119 
really good player and really would
expect<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.629> defense<00:03:27.139> to<00:03:27.199> go<00:03:27.410> last<00:03:27.650> but<00:03:27.949> there's

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
expect a defense to go last but there's

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.069 
expect a defense to go last but there's
some<00:03:28.549> crazy<00:03:28.790> rule<00:03:29.150> or<00:03:29.359> they<00:03:29.510> had<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.720> pick<00:03:29.900> all

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
some crazy rule or they had to pick all

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.619 
some crazy rule or they had to pick all
their<00:03:30.230> defense<00:03:30.560> left<00:03:31.310> by<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:31.970> 15th<00:03:32.419> round

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
their defense left by the 15th round

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.569 
their defense left by the 15th round
otherwise<00:03:33.139> I<00:03:33.410> think<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.949> defense<00:03:34.310> would<00:03:34.400> be

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
otherwise I think a defense would be

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.439 
otherwise I think a defense would be
picked<00:03:34.849> last<00:03:36.730> be<00:03:37.730> I'm<00:03:37.910> pretty<00:03:37.940> excited<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
picked last be I'm pretty excited to

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.189 
picked last be I'm pretty excited to
