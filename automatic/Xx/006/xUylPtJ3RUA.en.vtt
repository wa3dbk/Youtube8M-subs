00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.449
 games for the best-known emulators 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.600

 so to speak to do it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 what we have to do is download a program called

 nor of natural grass 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.700
 it's not very heavy it's 24 kilometers in size, the only thing they're going to do is 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.799
 create a folder and unzip 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.620
 the file 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.760
 508 needed to apply some 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.130
 failing 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.620
 and an application 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.340
 then let's go 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.490
 We are going to the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 the file that we want to decompress with different formats 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.400
