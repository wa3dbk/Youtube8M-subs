00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.089 
the crease curve brush this is a lovely
alien<00:00:07.500> plant<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.040> was<00:00:08.250> able<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:09.050> sculpt

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
alien plant that I was able to sculpt

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.820 
alien plant that I was able to sculpt
with<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.370> crease<00:00:11.910> curve<00:00:12.240> brush<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.500> let's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
with the crease curve brush so let's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.250 
with the crease curve brush so let's
let's<00:00:14.309> get<00:00:14.460> into<00:00:14.730> it

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
let's get into it

let's get into it
okay<00:00:16.260> let's<00:00:16.470> hide<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.340> fiber<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:19.890> I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
okay let's hide the fiber that I

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.420 
okay let's hide the fiber that I
fibermesh<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.119> I've<00:00:21.210> created<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.400> take<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
fibermesh that I've created and take a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
fibermesh that I've created and take a
look<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:23.850> we've<00:00:24.029> got<00:00:24.320> okay

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
look at what we've got okay

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.339 
look at what we've got okay
now<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.640> access<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.090> crease<00:00:27.720> curve<00:00:28.019> brush

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
now to access the crease curve brush

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.420 
now to access the crease curve brush
press<00:00:28.890> B<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.599> then<00:00:30.599> C<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.120> E<00:00:34.219> okay<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
press B and then C and then E okay this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360 
press B and then C and then E okay this
is<00:00:35.780> accessible<00:00:36.780> by<00:00:37.020> holding<00:00:37.469> down<00:00:37.590> ctrl<00:00:38.160> +

is accessible by holding down ctrl +

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.470 
is accessible by holding down ctrl +
shift<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.110> not<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.790> now<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.270> visible

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
shift so it's not there now it's visible

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.549 
shift so it's not there now it's visible
okay<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.700> exciting

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
okay this is really exciting

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.060 
okay this is really exciting
let's<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.090> turned<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.360> active<00:00:49.350> symmetry<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
let's I turned on active symmetry and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.170 
let's I turned on active symmetry and
then<00:00:50.250> radial<00:00:50.719> count<00:00:51.920> radial<00:00:52.920> symmetry<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
then radial count radial symmetry so it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.110 
then radial count radial symmetry so it
my<00:00:54.989> brush<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> being<00:00:55.800> affected<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.030> way

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
my brush is being affected all the way

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.529 
my brush is being affected all the way
around<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.660> object<00:00:58.199> okay<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.969> aliens

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
around the object okay now the aliens

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
around the object okay now the aliens
that<00:01:00.690> I've<00:01:00.840> made<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.460> told

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that I've made this for they have told

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
that I've made this for they have told
me<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.210> doesn't<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.600> enough<00:01:03.629> curve

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
me that it doesn't have enough curve

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.840 
me that it doesn't have enough curve
right<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.869> funky<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.580> I'm

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
right here and this is all funky so I'm

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.660 
right here and this is all funky so I'm
going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.450> edit<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.049> using<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.130> amazing

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
going to edit it using this amazing

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.410 
going to edit it using this amazing
brush<00:01:12.119> okay<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.770> hold<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.640> control<00:01:15.119> shift

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
brush okay so hold down control shift

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
brush okay so hold down control shift
then<00:01:16.140> click<00:01:16.640> just<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> other

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
then click just like some of the other

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.580 
then click just like some of the other
brushes<00:01:18.570> we've<00:01:18.869> been<00:01:19.049> looking<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
brushes we've been looking at and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.950 
brushes we've been looking at and
somewhere<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> middle<00:01:23.630> press<00:01:24.630> alt<00:01:25.159> and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
somewhere in the middle press alt and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.640 
somewhere in the middle press alt and
then<00:01:28.040> do<00:01:29.040> something<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
then do something like this and this is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.980 
then do something like this and this is
the<00:01:31.979> intensity<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.689> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the intensity is all the way up so this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.950 
the intensity is all the way up so this
is<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.880> extreme<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.659> our

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
is going to be really extreme on our

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.700 
is going to be really extreme on our
mesh<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:38.579> will<00:01:38.700> cut<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> way<00:01:39.360> through

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
mesh it will cut all the way through

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.359 
mesh it will cut all the way through
leaving<00:01:40.710> us<00:01:40.890> nothing<00:01:42.079> just<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.369> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
leaving us nothing just like that that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.300 
leaving us nothing just like that that
that's<00:01:44.700> way<00:01:44.880> too<00:01:44.909> much<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:45.600> doesn't<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.020> any

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's way too much now doesn't have any

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.730 
that's way too much now doesn't have any
stability<00:01:47.310> whatsoever<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.299> ctrl<00:01:48.689> Z<00:01:48.869> ctrl

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
stability whatsoever so ctrl Z ctrl

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.420 
stability whatsoever so ctrl Z ctrl
shift<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.689> died<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.750> down<00:01:52.250> mid<00:01:53.250> way

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
shift and died this down mid way

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.980 
shift and died this down mid way
somewhere<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.840> let's<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> same<00:01:55.710> thing

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
somewhere and let's do the same thing

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.499 
somewhere and let's do the same thing
okay

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
okay

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.090 
okay
alt<00:02:01.399> right<00:02:02.399> there

alt right there

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.749 
alt right there
perfect<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.210> will<00:02:06.950> push<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
perfect now this will push it in a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.949 
perfect now this will push it in a
little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:10.099> okay<00:02:11.099> that's<00:02:11.370> that's<00:02:11.819> nice<00:02:11.970> let's

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
little bit okay that's that's nice let's

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.190 
little bit okay that's that's nice let's
do<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.319> bit<00:02:13.530> more<00:02:16.220> okay<00:02:18.200> perfect

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
do it a little bit more okay perfect

do it a little bit more okay perfect
okay<00:02:19.349> that's<00:02:19.769> good<00:02:20.069> now<00:02:22.040> my<00:02:23.510> employers<00:02:24.510> have

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
okay that's good now my employers have

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.500 
okay that's good now my employers have
informed<00:02:25.800> me<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.250> needs<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:27.000> really

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
informed me that it needs to be really

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.160 
informed me that it needs to be really
fancy<00:02:28.290> designing<00:02:29.130> up<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:31.140> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
fancy designing up here so to do that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.430 
fancy designing up here so to do that
let's<00:02:31.680> hold<00:02:32.010> down<00:02:32.069> can<00:02:32.750> control<00:02:33.750> shift<00:02:34.170> and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
let's hold down can control shift and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500 
let's hold down can control shift and
make<00:02:34.890> sure<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.700> intensity<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.330> all

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
make sure this is the intensity is all

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.809 
make sure this is the intensity is all
the<00:02:36.630> way<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.950> still<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.489> radial

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
the way up and we still have the radial

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.390 
the way up and we still have the radial
count<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.540> our<00:02:40.200> object<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:42.590> down<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.860> let's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
count on our object so down here let's
