00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
call it the instant red guard jump so

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.730 
call it the instant red guard jump so
why<00:00:09.059> don't<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.360> take<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> look<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:10.050> how<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.380> can

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
why don't we take a look at how you can

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.580 
why don't we take a look at how you can
implement<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.429> jump<00:00:11.730> into<00:00:12.120> your<00:00:12.300> base<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:13.440> we

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
implement this jump into your base so we

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.530 
implement this jump into your base so we
click<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.980> edit<00:00:14.219> button<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.940> here<00:00:15.420> you

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
click on the edit button and here you

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.140 
click on the edit button and here you
can't<00:00:15.839> see<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.199> basically<00:00:17.100> all<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.730> matters

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
can't see it basically all that matters

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450 
can't see it basically all that matters
is<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.539> door<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.350> red<00:00:19.560> guard<00:00:19.800> now<00:00:20.130> it's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
is the door and the red guard now it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
is the door and the red guard now it's
very<00:00:20.730> important<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> door<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.930> placed

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
very important that the door is placed

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.950 
very important that the door is placed
on<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.800> edge<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> terrain<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.510> basically

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
on the edge of the terrain so basically

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
on the edge of the terrain so basically
if<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.500> don't<00:00:25.769> jump<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.160> will<00:00:26.369> instantly

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
if you don't jump you will instantly

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
if you don't jump you will instantly
fall<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> terrain<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:29.099> next<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
fall off the terrain the next to the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
fall off the terrain the next to the
door<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> red<00:00:30.330> guard<00:00:30.570> go<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.050> three

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
door we have a red guard go in three

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.770 
door we have a red guard go in three
spaces<00:00:31.650> upward<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.640> now<00:00:32.850> let's<00:00:33.270> take<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> look

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
spaces upward so now let's take a look

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.100 
spaces upward so now let's take a look
what<00:00:33.960> happens<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:35.130> jump<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.550> all

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
what happens as we don't jump at all

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.630 
what happens as we don't jump at all
obviously<00:00:37.110> well<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.739> instantly<00:00:38.100> fall

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
obviously well you will instantly fall

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.000 
obviously well you will instantly fall
into<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> red<00:00:39.239> guard<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.620> let's<00:00:40.829> take<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
into the red guard so now let's take a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100 
into the red guard so now let's take a
look<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:41.399> happens<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.360> do

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
look what happens if you actually do

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.850 
look what happens if you actually do
jump<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.210> there<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.899> end<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.320> against<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
jump and there we go we end up against a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.430 
jump and there we go we end up against a
red<00:00:47.039> guard<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> might<00:00:48.329> wonder<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.930> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
red guard so you might wonder is this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.880 
red guard so you might wonder is this
jump<00:00:49.770> even<00:00:49.950> possible<00:00:50.670> well<00:00:51.210> yes<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.020> but

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
jump even possible well yes it is but

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.560 
jump even possible well yes it is but
you<00:00:53.070> need<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.030> lucky<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.480> get

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you need to be a little bit lucky to get

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.660 
you need to be a little bit lucky to get
it<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.530> basically<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it down right so basically you have to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.240 
it down right so basically you have to
slide<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.059> very<00:00:57.390> small<00:00:57.719> amount<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:59.100> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
slide a very small amount and then you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
slide a very small amount and then you
can<00:00:59.489> jump<00:00:59.730> over<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> red<00:01:00.300> card<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.109> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
can jump over the red card but it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
can jump over the red card but it's
really<00:01:01.500> hard<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.550> slide

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
really hard to do because if you slide

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.700 
really hard to do because if you slide
too<00:01:03.120> long<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:03.899> fall<00:01:04.409> off<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
too long you will actually fall off the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.370 
too long you will actually fall off the
edge<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.790> basically<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.780> comes<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
edge so basically it just comes down to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
edge so basically it just comes down to
trying<00:01:07.950> over<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.400> over<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.880> until<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.360> get

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
trying over and over up until you get

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.870 
trying over and over up until you get
successful<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> let's<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
successful so let's see if I can do it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.160 
successful so let's see if I can do it
and<00:01:15.039> there<00:01:16.039> we<00:01:16.219> go<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.579> got<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.090> as<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.899> can<00:01:18.110> see

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
and there we go I got it as you can see

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.679 
and there we go I got it as you can see
it's<00:01:18.770> pretty<00:01:19.070> hard<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:19.909> let's<00:01:20.210> see<00:01:20.329> if<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.479> can

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
it's pretty hard so let's see if I can

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.219 
it's pretty hard so let's see if I can
do<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.810> one<00:01:21.020> more<00:01:21.110> time

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.090 

yeah<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.860> that's<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
yeah and there we go so that's how you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
yeah and there we go so that's how you
do<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.579> instant<00:01:30.119> red<00:01:30.299> guard<00:01:30.540> jump<00:01:30.810> now<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
do this instant red guard jump now you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
do this instant red guard jump now you
might<00:01:31.530> argue<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.340> isn't<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:32.820> actual

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
might argue that this isn't an actual

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
might argue that this isn't an actual
hard<00:01:33.960> jump<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:34.619> you're<00:01:34.890> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.340> right

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
hard jump well you're kind of right

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880 
hard jump well you're kind of right
eventually<00:01:36.210> invade<00:01:36.899> invading<00:01:37.439> thieves<00:01:37.740> we'll

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
eventually invade invading thieves we'll

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
eventually invade invading thieves we'll
get<00:01:38.039> it<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:39.149> taken<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.780> consideration

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
get it right but taken to consideration

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.859 
get it right but taken to consideration
that<00:01:40.830> most<00:01:41.159> Eve<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.640> die<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:42.299> against<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
that most Eve will die a lot against the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
that most Eve will die a lot against the
Red<00:01:43.049> Guard<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.500> basically<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.340> will<00:01:44.460> bring

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
Red Guard and basically it will bring

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.929 
Red Guard and basically it will bring
them<00:01:44.850> down<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.270> two<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.929> stars<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.939> it's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
them down to two or one stars and it's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.700 
them down to two or one stars and it's
almost<00:01:48.270> certain<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.409> disable

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
almost certain that they will disable

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.070 
almost certain that they will disable
the<00:01:50.070> Red<00:01:50.250> Guard<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.210> other<00:01:51.390> traps<00:01:51.840> are

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
the Red Guard so if your other traps are

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.289 
the Red Guard so if your other traps are
placed<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.679> good<00:01:52.860> positions<00:01:53.429> and<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:53.820> form<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
placed in good positions and they form a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.690 
placed in good positions and they form a
real<00:01:54.570> challenge<00:01:55.080> for<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> invading<00:01:55.830> thief<00:01:56.069> he

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
real challenge for the invading thief he

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.270 
real challenge for the invading thief he
won't<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.030> able<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> reach<00:01:57.539> your<00:01:57.720> totem<00:01:58.170> or

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
won't be able to reach your totem or

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.639 
won't be able to reach your totem or
only<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.580> one<00:01:59.819> star<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.299> least<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.409> that's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
only with one star at least so that's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
only with one star at least so that's
definitely<00:02:01.860> quite<00:02:02.459> important<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.090> keep<00:02:03.270> in

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
definitely quite important to keep in

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.449 
definitely quite important to keep in
mind<00:02:03.479> now<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.350> last<00:02:04.590> thing<00:02:04.679> I<00:02:04.860> also<00:02:05.100> want<00:02:05.429> to

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
mind now one last thing I also want to

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.249 
mind now one last thing I also want to
show<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.539> placement<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
show you is that the placement of the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
show you is that the placement of the
door<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.619> actually<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.369> important<00:02:09.060> for

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
door is actually really important for

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.380 
door is actually really important for
example<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.350> we<00:02:10.560> move<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.979> defense<00:02:11.430> one<00:02:11.970> spot

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
example if we move this defense one spot

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.570 
example if we move this defense one spot
to<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.600> left<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.100> isn't<00:02:14.430> actually

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
to the left then this isn't actually

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.940 
to the left then this isn't actually
that<00:02:15.000> hard<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.410> run<00:02:16.620> forward

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
that hard so you can just run forward

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
that hard so you can just run forward
but<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.519> can<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.940> run<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> little

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
but what you can do is run a little

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.180 
but what you can do is run a little
forward<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.989> then<00:02:19.170> jump<00:02:19.440> over<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.769> red<00:02:19.920> card

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
forward and then jump over the red card

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.970 
forward and then jump over the red card
which<00:02:20.700> makes<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.090> really<00:02:21.120> easy<00:02:21.980> basically

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
which makes it really easy basically

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.130 
which makes it really easy basically
this<00:02:23.190> jump<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.640> only<00:02:24.030> hard<00:02:24.299> because<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.870> teeth

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
this jump is only hard because the teeth

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.590 
this jump is only hard because the teeth
has<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.739> jump<00:02:25.980> immediately<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.819> not<00:02:27.209> fall<00:02:27.450> off

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
has to jump immediately to not fall off

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.199 
has to jump immediately to not fall off
the<00:02:27.750> edge<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.200> terrain<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.670> guys<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.180> hope

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.729 
the edge of the terrain so guys I hope
