this<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.890> dual<00:00:47.160> core<00:00:47.520> processor<00:00:47.930> 285<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.260> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
this is dual core processor 285 so it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.490 
this is dual core processor 285 so it's
faster<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.730> got<00:00:50.969> facetime<00:00:51.600> we've<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.199> more

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
faster so we got facetime we've got more
