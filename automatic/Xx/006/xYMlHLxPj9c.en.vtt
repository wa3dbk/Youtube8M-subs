Riesling<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> nose<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:15.049> think<00:01:16.049> maybe

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
Riesling on the nose I think maybe

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.359

converts<00:01:16.590> believe<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.220> there's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
converts believe it not because there's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.740 
converts believe it not because there's
a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.549> hint<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.909> lychee<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> backend

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
a little hint of lychee on the backend

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.469 
a little hint of lychee on the backend
that<00:01:19.200> might<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.920> swayed<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:20.700> let's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that might have swayed me that way let's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:38.819 
that might have swayed me that way let's
give<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.720> whirl

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.550 

nice<00:01:39.829> acid<00:01:40.340> balance<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:41.390> little<00:01:42.259> more<00:01:42.380> sugar

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
nice acid balance a little more sugar

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.670 
nice acid balance a little more sugar
than<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.830> would<00:01:43.009> have<00:01:43.040> liked<00:01:44.350> which<00:01:45.350> makes<00:01:45.590> me

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
than I would have liked which makes me

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.389 
than I would have liked which makes me
think<00:01:45.710> it's<00:01:45.950> not<00:01:46.159> outstation<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.950> good<00:01:49.189> ripe

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
think it's not outstation but good ripe

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.149 
think it's not outstation but good ripe
fruit<00:01:49.729> very<00:01:50.390> sweet<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:51.049> peach<00:01:51.439> flavors<00:01:52.009> on

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.399 
fruit very sweet like peach flavors on
the<00:01:52.250> backend<00:01:52.490> which<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.299> liked<00:01:53.509> good<00:01:54.049> solid

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
the backend which I liked good solid

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.649 
the backend which I liked good solid
stuff<00:01:54.619> probably<00:01:54.830> have<00:01:55.039> 20<00:01:55.220> $25<00:01:56.000> Riesling<00:01:56.509> is

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
stuff probably have 20 $25 Riesling is

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.230 
stuff probably have 20 $25 Riesling is
probably<00:01:57.259> what<00:01:57.409> it's<00:01:57.530> worth<00:01:57.679> if<00:01:58.670> there's<00:01:59.119> some

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
probably what it's worth if there's some

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.179 
probably what it's worth if there's some
bail<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.539> let's<00:01:59.689> say<00:01:59.810> 18<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.409> 24<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.070> would

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
bail that let's say 18 to 24 that would

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.679 
bail that let's say 18 to 24 that would
be<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.369> price<00:02:01.549> range<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.149> I'd<00:02:02.240> pay<00:02:02.450> for<00:02:02.509> this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
I like the structure it's a little sugar

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.820
