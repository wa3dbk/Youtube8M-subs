00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
for that I'm going to use the still a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.650 
for that I'm going to use the still a
smudge<00:04:01.570> pot<00:04:02.820> shape<00:04:03.820> will<00:04:04.000> create<00:04:04.360> in<00:04:04.450> with<00:04:04.570> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
smudge pot shape will create in with the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.900 
smudge pot shape will create in with the
eyeliner<00:04:05.020> it's<00:04:05.440> going<00:04:05.740> to<00:04:05.800> be<00:04:05.950> thicker<00:04:06.610> on<00:04:06.760> the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
eyeliner it's going to be thicker on the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.510 
eyeliner it's going to be thicker on the
outer<00:04:07.030> edge<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.720> then<00:04:07.990> taper<00:04:08.680> into<00:04:08.830> a<00:04:09.070> thinner

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
outer edge and then taper into a thinner

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.170 
outer edge and then taper into a thinner
line<00:04:09.790> one<00:04:10.540> will<00:04:10.690> come<00:04:10.810> into<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.260> inner<00:04:11.650> corner

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
line one will come into the inner corner

collection<00:05:00.280> in<00:05:00.460> these<00:05:00.610> ones<00:05:00.880> on<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.120> sheryl

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
collection in these ones on the sheryl

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.440 
collection in these ones on the sheryl
ones<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.920> reason<00:05:03.280> i<00:05:03.370> chose<00:05:03.400> these<00:05:03.880> ones<00:05:04.180> are

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
ones the reason i chose these ones are

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.040 
ones the reason i chose these ones are
because<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:06.640> concentration<00:05:07.540> of<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.840> lashes

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
because the concentration of the lashes

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.600 
because the concentration of the lashes
is<00:05:08.530> more<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.460> outer<00:05:10.390> edge<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.740> eye<00:05:11.770> to

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
is more to the outer edge of the eye to

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.450 
is more to the outer edge of the eye to
create<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.030> bit<00:05:13.300> more<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.840> winged<00:05:14.200> effect<00:05:14.460> so

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
create a bit more of a winged effect so

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.320 
create a bit more of a winged effect so
that's<00:05:15.700> why<00:05:15.880> i've<00:05:16.030> used<00:05:16.240> them

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330
