once i did my unboxing earlier on in the

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.630 
once i did my unboxing earlier on in the
video<00:06:22.840> was<00:06:23.080> able<00:06:23.350> to<00:06:23.440> look<00:06:23.560> up<00:06:23.710> online<00:06:23.920> and

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
video was able to look up online and

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.340 
video was able to look up online and
find<00:06:24.880> out<00:06:25.150> what<00:06:25.300> they<00:06:25.420> actually<00:06:25.540> worse<00:06:25.960> then

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
find out what they actually worse then

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.930 
find out what they actually worse then
when<00:06:26.560> i<00:06:26.590> did<00:06:26.860> my<00:06:27.010> tests<00:06:27.520> and<00:06:27.610> was<00:06:27.790> actually

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
when i did my tests and was actually

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.640 
when i did my tests and was actually
listening<00:06:28.300> I<00:06:28.660> could<00:06:29.140> make<00:06:29.320> sure<00:06:29.440> they<00:06:29.590> were

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
listening I could make sure they were

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.100 
listening I could make sure they were
relevant<00:06:30.010> to<00:06:30.280> my<00:06:30.400> review<00:06:30.550> video<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.840> black

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
relevant to my review video so the black

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.050 
relevant to my review video so the black
screws<00:06:32.500> on<00:06:32.710> the<00:06:32.740> back<00:06:32.920> are<00:06:33.220> for<00:06:33.490> if<00:06:33.550> you<00:06:33.700> want<00:06:33.910> a

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
screws on the back are for if you want a

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.490 
screws on the back are for if you want a
lot<00:06:34.210> of<00:06:34.240> bass<00:06:34.480> so<00:06:34.750> essentially<00:06:35.140> if<00:06:35.320> you're<00:06:35.470> a

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
lot of bass so essentially if you're a

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.830 
lot of bass so essentially if you're a
bass-heavy<00:06:35.770> music<00:06:36.250> listener<00:06:37.090> and<00:06:37.300> you<00:06:37.570> listen

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
bass-heavy music listener and you listen

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.420 
bass-heavy music listener and you listen
to<00:06:37.930> a<00:06:37.960> lot<00:06:38.140> of<00:06:38.200> EDM<00:06:38.590> and<00:06:38.620> EDM<00:06:39.100> is<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.280> only

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
to a lot of EDM and EDM is the only

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.800 
to a lot of EDM and EDM is the only
thing<00:06:39.640> you<00:06:39.729> listen<00:06:40.030> to<00:06:40.180> then

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
thing you listen to then

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.640 
thing you listen to then
essentially<00:06:41.169> you're<00:06:41.230> probably<00:06:41.410> going<00:06:41.590> to

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
essentially you're probably going to

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.930 
essentially you're probably going to
want<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:41.860> keep<00:06:41.950> the<00:06:42.070> black<00:06:42.280> screws<00:06:42.639> in<00:06:42.850> the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
want to keep the black screws in the

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.730 
want to keep the black screws in the
back<00:06:42.970> when<00:06:43.780> it<00:06:43.900> comes<00:06:44.110> to<00:06:44.350> like<00:06:44.500> the<00:06:44.590> mid

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
back when it comes to like the mid

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.580 
back when it comes to like the mid
rangers<00:06:45.160> and<00:06:45.310> the<00:06:45.370> vocal<00:06:45.760> tunes<00:06:46.200> the<00:06:47.200> actual

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
rangers and the vocal tunes the actual

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.700 
rangers and the vocal tunes the actual
silver<00:06:48.400> screws<00:06:48.760> are<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.810> ones<00:06:49.990> which<00:06:50.260> kind<00:06:50.650> of

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
silver screws are the ones which kind of

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.080 
silver screws are the ones which kind of
reduce<00:06:51.010> the<00:06:51.160> base<00:06:51.310> as<00:06:51.550> far<00:06:51.760> as<00:06:51.910> it<00:06:52.000> can

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
reduce the base as far as it can

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.520 
reduce the base as far as it can
possibly<00:06:52.150> go<00:06:52.690> so<00:06:52.870> if<00:06:52.960> you<00:06:53.080> look<00:06:53.230> a<00:06:53.320> lot<00:06:53.410> of

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
possibly go so if you look a lot of

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.460 
possibly go so if you look a lot of
vocal<00:06:53.889> music<00:06:54.040> or<00:06:54.400> a<00:06:54.600> lot<00:06:55.600> of<00:06:55.690> midranges<00:06:56.290> then

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
vocal music or a lot of midranges then

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.810 
vocal music or a lot of midranges then
you<00:06:56.560> want<00:06:56.740> to<00:06:56.830> go<00:06:56.919> for<00:06:57.070> the<00:06:57.130> silver<00:06:57.520> screws

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
you want to go for the silver screws

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.970 
you want to go for the silver screws
where<00:06:58.450> the<00:06:58.600> gray<00:06:58.840> screws<00:06:59.290> come<00:06:59.560> into<00:06:59.800> play

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
where the gray screws come into play

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.550 
where the gray screws come into play
these<00:07:00.220> ones<00:07:00.520> is<00:07:00.940> they<00:07:01.510> kind<00:07:01.780> of<00:07:01.930> seem<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.350> give

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
these ones is they kind of seem to give

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.960 
these ones is they kind of seem to give
you<00:07:02.620> a<00:07:02.680> little<00:07:02.800> bit<00:07:02.980> more<00:07:03.100> bass<00:07:03.340> which<00:07:03.580> kind<00:07:03.850> of

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
you a little bit more bass which kind of

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.150 
you a little bit more bass which kind of
then<00:07:04.120> blocks<00:07:04.450> out<00:07:04.720> the<00:07:04.930> background<00:07:05.230> noise<00:07:05.950> as

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
then blocks out the background noise as

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.220 
then blocks out the background noise as
well<00:07:06.310> at<00:07:06.460> the<00:07:06.490> ambient<00:07:07.000> noise<00:07:07.150> so<00:07:07.510> there's

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.230 
well at the ambient noise so there's

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.659 
well at the ambient noise so there's
definitely<00:07:08.440> three<00:07:09.040> different<00:07:09.340> types<00:07:09.490> of

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
definitely three different types of

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.550 
definitely three different types of
screws<00:07:09.970> here<00:07:10.180> the<00:07:10.300> hugely<00:07:10.750> beneficial<00:07:11.020> to

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
screws here the hugely beneficial to

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.379 
screws here the hugely beneficial to
listening<00:07:11.950> to<00:07:12.430> all<00:07:12.669> different<00:07:13.060> types<00:07:13.210> of

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:13.389 
listening to all different types of

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:15.120 
listening to all different types of
music<00:07:13.600> and<00:07:13.900> I<00:07:13.960> like<00:07:14.139> the<00:07:14.169> fact<00:07:14.290> that<00:07:14.530> now<00:07:14.889> move
