and<00:06:07.020> then<00:06:07.320> have<00:06:07.650> my<00:06:07.800> paddles<00:06:08.280> up<00:06:08.400> here<00:06:08.640> for

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
and then have my paddles up here for

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.580 
and then have my paddles up here for
shift<00:06:09.060> ability<00:06:09.450> but<00:06:09.840> you've<00:06:10.050> got<00:06:10.260> to<00:06:10.440> get<00:06:10.530> a

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
shift ability but you've got to get a

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.620 
shift ability but you've got to get a
different<00:06:10.860> trim<00:06:11.400> level<00:06:11.789> Passat<00:06:12.210> to<00:06:12.419> get<00:06:12.539> the

different trim level Passat to get the

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.630 
different trim level Passat to get the

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
combination of paddles and automatic I

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.580 
combination of paddles and automatic I
hit<00:06:14.940> this<00:06:15.060> car<00:06:15.240> high<00:06:15.510> marks<00:06:15.900> for<00:06:16.050> its<00:06:16.169> handling

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
hit this car high marks for its handling

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.800 
hit this car high marks for its handling
I<00:06:16.740> think<00:06:16.919> it's<00:06:17.010> a<00:06:17.100> very<00:06:17.490> well<00:06:17.880> struck<00:06:18.300> balance

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
I think it's a very well struck balance

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.180 
I think it's a very well struck balance
between<00:06:19.350> a<00:06:19.770> sporty<00:06:20.310> feel<00:06:20.340> and

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
between a sporty feel and

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.120 
between a sporty feel and
like<00:06:21.670> active<00:06:22.510> feel<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:23.050> excellent<00:06:23.950> ride

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
like active feel and excellent ride

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.280 
like active feel and excellent ride
quality<00:06:24.160> it<00:06:24.850> does<00:06:25.120> both<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:25.660> think<00:06:25.720> very<00:06:26.170> well

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
quality it does both I think very well

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.500 
quality it does both I think very well
if<00:06:26.860> I<00:06:26.950> had<00:06:27.070> to<00:06:27.250> nitpick<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.970> handling<00:06:28.240> at<00:06:28.390> all

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
if I had to nitpick the handling at all

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.200 
if I had to nitpick the handling at all
it's<00:06:28.690> the<00:06:28.840> new<00:06:29.230> ish<00:06:29.500> for<00:06:30.250> this<00:06:30.400> car<00:06:30.640> full

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
it's the new ish for this car full
