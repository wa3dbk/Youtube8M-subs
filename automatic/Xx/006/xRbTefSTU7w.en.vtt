00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.800
 for cooking soup we need 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.349
 the following products by dream is essentially we 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.119
 prepared beforehand knew 400 grams 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.789
 called me 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.730
 rinse and soak or throw in general 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.029
 preparing in advance is a divide in half 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.480
 cook whole mashed potatoes on 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.469
 need pepper garlic 24 cloves in 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.620
 depending on the size of garlic not 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.620
 whether the price helped was enough and also 2 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 liter of water or broth like you more 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.989
 like pour onions to fry 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 in the pan we are in the oil 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.420
 fry crushed garlic garlic 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:03.750
 then take it out no longer needed 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:08.469
 and it means onion for now 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.680
 began to prepare caramelize 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:15.299
 we will literally take a little oath 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.299
 again who is called faster 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.560
 Our life in the meantime has become a bug 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.390
 you will not believe a little bit 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.890

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.890
 Here we add here easier 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.560
 do not forget that at this time you already 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.439
 there should be broth or water should already 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.469
 a couple of minutes to warm up for two minutes when we 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.280
 allowed 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:21.319
 as long as weâ€™ve gotten some pepper 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:24.330
 Now with a half shop window. 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.150

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:34.400

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.400
 frozen frozen champignons, 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.909
