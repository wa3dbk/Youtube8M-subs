00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
Cheesecake will leak and then I just

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.590 
Cheesecake will leak and then I just
moved<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.790> bake<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.479> in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
moved it around like that I bake this in

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.050 
moved it around like that I bake this in
a<00:01:18.689> preheated<00:01:18.869> oven<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.560> 1<00:01:19.740> hour<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.310> let<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> sit

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
a preheated oven for 1 hour I let it sit

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.609 
a preheated oven for 1 hour I let it sit
at<00:01:21.180> room<00:01:21.210> temperature<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:22.080> 40<00:01:22.590> minutes

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
at room temperature for about 40 minutes
and<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> place<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> fridge<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and then I place it in the fridge for a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
and then I place it in the fridge for a
minimum<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.080> 4<00:01:25.439> hours<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.280> never<00:01:26.520> ever<00:01:26.759> want

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
minimum of 4 hours you never ever want

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
minimum of 4 hours you never ever want
to<00:01:27.030> place<00:01:27.210> anything<00:01:27.509> hot<00:01:28.049> inside<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> fridge

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to place anything hot inside a fridge

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
to place anything hot inside a fridge
whether<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.490> soup<00:01:29.790> beans<00:01:30.390> cheesecake

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
whether it's soup beans cheesecake

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
whether it's soup beans cheesecake
doesn't<00:01:31.500> matter<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.460> learned<00:01:32.820> from

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
doesn't matter that I learned from

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.880 
doesn't matter that I learned from
culinary<00:01:33.210> school<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.320> reason<00:01:34.619> why<00:01:34.740> I'm

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
culinary school and the reason why I'm

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.200 
culinary school and the reason why I'm
running<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.189> knife<00:01:35.340> along<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> sides<00:01:36.000> like

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
running a knife along the sides like

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
running a knife along the sides like
that<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> helps<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.409> Cheesecake

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that is because it helps the Cheesecake

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
that is because it helps the Cheesecake
mouth<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> crack<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.360> learn<00:01:39.689> from<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
mouth to crack and that I learn from a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.870 
mouth to crack and that I learn from a
