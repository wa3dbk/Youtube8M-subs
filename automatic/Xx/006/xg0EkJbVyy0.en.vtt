stickers<00:02:12.400> which<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:14.209> think<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> orange

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
stickers which on I think the orange

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.900 
stickers which on I think the orange
side<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.349> can<00:02:15.500> tell<00:02:15.860> yet

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
side you can tell yet

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.450 
side you can tell yet
all<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.510> sides<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.840> can<00:02:17.870> tell<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.410> it's

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
all the sides you can tell that it's

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.250 
all the sides you can tell that it's
transparent<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.760> see<00:02:19.940> through<00:02:20.210> it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
transparent and you can see through it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.510 
transparent and you can see through it
so<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.710> see<00:02:21.890> through<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.130> stickers

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
so you can see through the stickers

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.230 
so you can see through the stickers
which<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.820> very<00:02:23.000> neat<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.680> stickers

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
which is very neat and and the stickers

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.730 
which is very neat and and the stickers
don't<00:02:26.240> really<00:02:26.510> feel<00:02:26.720> like<00:02:26.750> stickers<00:02:27.170> they

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
don't really feel like stickers they

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.170 
don't really feel like stickers they
sort<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.040> feel<00:02:28.160> more<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.640> plastic<00:02:28.850> of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
sort of feel more like the plastic of

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.530 
sort of feel more like the plastic of
the<00:02:29.240> cube<00:02:29.450> which<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.780> find<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.950> pretty<00:02:31.280> neat

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.390 

so<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.690> stickers<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.440> bit<00:02:36.890> harder<00:02:37.370> than

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
so the stickers are a bit harder than

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.450 
so the stickers are a bit harder than
the<00:02:38.060> normal<00:02:38.300> stickers<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:39.560> there's<00:02:40.040> normal

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
the normal stickers on there's normal

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.750 
the normal stickers on there's normal
DIY<00:02:41.240> or<00:02:41.540> store-bought<00:02:42.170> cube<00:02:42.650> or<00:02:43.010> whatever<00:02:44.560> um

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
DIY or store-bought cube or whatever um

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.740 
DIY or store-bought cube or whatever um
so<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:47.390> very<00:02:47.840> very<00:02:48.200> good<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.150> I'm<00:02:50.150> going<00:02:50.720> to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
so it's very very good and I'm going to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.170 
so it's very very good and I'm going to
