 my channel of youtube recipes and this 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.119
 video is journey of our great challenge of 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.430
 the 49 where a community on the internet 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.680
 We decided to eat healthy 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.410
 for a week until we get there 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.030
 at least 4 kilos or 9 pounds so if 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.940
 you want to integrate this project 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.370
 you 're still on time look for one what 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.559
 you need in www the recipes of laura 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.170
 puntocom where it says bulletin informs that 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.760
 informative there you subscribe and all the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.980
 days your menu will be arriving 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.610
 daily to your email from over 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.220
 weekly on the super list 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.990
 and I decided to start this challenge 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.040
 because just lately I 've 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.900
 felt like that because difficult especially 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.060
 when we are overweight in power 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.770
 keep your breasts at an ideal weight 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.510
 after lowering it becomes a 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.220
 true nightmare but I think if 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.040
 we undertake this together as we are 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.630
 this is going to be much simpler and you'll see 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.520
 that after a week feeding 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.950
 healthy let's start to see the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.110
 things with a lot more optimism so 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 Welcome to Saturday, finally the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 supermarket list along with this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 video that you are currently watching 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 so the menu of all our 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.090
 week in addition to what we need 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 buy in the super remember for all 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.240
 those little things that are all 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.460
 thinking about cleaning the cupboard and the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.320
 essien refrigerator of the week and there's no 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.630
 permission so we go to the interest to the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.810
 dinner to take out everything we do not need 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.080
 all we can resort to the attacks 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.570
 despair 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.670
 or at the expense so let's clean 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.560
 goods in operators at dinner so that 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.300
 everything is clean because not when 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.460
 you arrive at an orderly and clean place 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.170
 with a chain I do not know how to be there 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.759
 so imagine the contract to dinner with 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.860
 all and the little gold cup that is 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.440
