00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
on this one like this one is definitely

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.680 
on this one like this one is definitely
like<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.359> solid<00:04:18.900> red<00:04:19.340> versus<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:21.180> pink<00:04:21.479> that

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
like a solid red versus the pink that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.390 
like a solid red versus the pink that
came<00:04:21.930> on<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.140> other<00:04:22.350> Sailor<00:04:22.680> Moon

but<00:04:23.910> looking<00:04:24.150> them<00:04:24.270> up<00:04:24.389> and<00:04:24.540> down<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.900> see

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
but looking them up and down you see

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.280 
but looking them up and down you see
they're<00:04:26.430> definitely<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.850> same<00:04:27.000> figure<00:04:27.290> just

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
they're definitely the same figure just

they're definitely the same figure just
with<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.620> minor<00:04:28.800> changes<00:04:29.040> but<00:04:29.510> that's<00:04:30.510> what

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
with the minor changes but that's what

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.760 
with the minor changes but that's what
you<00:04:30.720> should<00:04:30.870> expect<00:04:30.960> from<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.410> comic-con

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
you should expect from a comic-con

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.950 
you should expect from a comic-con
exclusive<00:04:31.889> because<00:04:32.639> it's<00:04:33.479> not<00:04:33.660> gonna<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.930> a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
brand new figure it has to be something

we've<00:04:48.780> seen<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:49.199> mold<00:04:49.470> like<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.430> said<00:04:50.610> like

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
we've seen this mold like I said like

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.320 
we've seen this mold like I said like
six<00:04:51.060> or<00:04:51.210> seven<00:04:51.240> times<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:51.960> far<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.440> then<00:04:53.340> more

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
six or seven times so far and then more

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
six or seven times so far and then more
if<00:04:54.540> you<00:04:54.660> count<00:04:55.190> Chevy<00:04:56.190> moon<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.930> Uranus<00:04:57.930> and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
if you count Chevy moon and Uranus and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.620 
if you count Chevy moon and Uranus and
Neptune<00:04:58.770> which<00:04:59.760> I<00:04:59.880> wasn't<00:05:00.180> because<00:05:00.330> not<00:05:00.539> the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
Neptune which I wasn't because not the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.990 
Neptune which I wasn't because not the
same<00:05:00.780> body<00:05:01.020> size<00:05:01.289> but<00:05:01.710> you<00:05:02.520> know<00:05:02.639> we<00:05:02.789> seem<00:05:02.970> to

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
same body size but you know we seem to

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.110 
same body size but you know we seem to
Sailor<00:05:03.270> Moon<00:05:03.449> mold<00:05:03.810> many<00:05:04.229> times<00:05:04.470> now<00:05:04.740> so

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
Sailor Moon mold many times now so

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.360 
Sailor Moon mold many times now so
articulation<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.300> same<00:05:06.479> as<00:05:06.660> that<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.590> I

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
articulation is the same as that and I

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.340 
articulation is the same as that and I
can't<00:05:09.240> really<00:05:09.389> say<00:05:09.570> if<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.750> recommend<00:05:10.020> this<00:05:10.199> or

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
can't really say if I recommend this or

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.090 
can't really say if I recommend this or
not<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:10.740> had<00:05:11.430> access<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.240> figure<00:05:12.539> so<00:05:13.100> I

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
not I had access to the figure so I

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.189 
not I had access to the figure so I
think<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:15.060> was<00:05:15.120> worth<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.510> if<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.660> could<00:05:15.990> get

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
think it was worth it if you could get

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.469 
think it was worth it if you could get
it<00:05:16.289> at<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.440> cheap<00:05:16.710> enough<00:05:16.949> price<00:05:17.220> but<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:18.180> see

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
it at a cheap enough price but I see

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.140 
it at a cheap enough price but I see
it's<00:05:18.600> going<00:05:18.840> for<00:05:19.020> like<00:05:19.110> 70<00:05:19.530> 999<00:05:20.190> now<00:05:20.430> on<00:05:20.669> online

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
it's going for like 70 999 now on online

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.159 
it's going for like 70 999 now on online
and<00:05:21.600> that's<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.680> bit<00:05:22.830> much<00:05:22.979> I<00:05:23.130> think<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.430> pay<00:05:23.580> for

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
and that's a bit much I think to pay for

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.300 
and that's a bit much I think to pay for
purple<00:05:25.169> Sailor<00:05:25.440> Moon<00:05:25.590> with<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.800> different<00:05:26.160> face

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
purple Sailor Moon with a different face

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.670 
purple Sailor Moon with a different face
and<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.580> boomerang<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.870> same<00:05:28.080> accessories

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
and a boomerang and the same accessories

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.120 
and a boomerang and the same accessories
that<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.950> just<00:05:29.130> saw<00:05:29.280> over<00:05:29.520> here<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:31.889> one

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
that you just saw over here the one

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.740 
that you just saw over here the one
benefit<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:33.000> could<00:05:33.210> say<00:05:33.360> is<00:05:33.419> that<00:05:33.510> it's

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
benefit I could say is that it's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.600 
benefit I could say is that it's
technically<00:05:34.530> our<00:05:34.740> first<00:05:34.979> villain<00:05:35.400> in<00:05:35.490> the

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
technically our first villain in the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.430 
technically our first villain in the
line<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.090> that's<00:05:36.389> definitely<00:05:36.660> incentive<00:05:37.320> to

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
line and that's definitely incentive to

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.830 
line and that's definitely incentive to
get<00:05:37.560> it<00:05:37.710> I<00:05:38.550> know<00:05:39.120> they<00:05:39.330> recently<00:05:39.539> just

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
get it I know they recently just

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.480 
get it I know they recently just
revealed<00:05:40.260> that<00:05:40.590> we're<00:05:40.710> getting<00:05:40.800> super<00:05:41.280> Sailor

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
revealed that we're getting super Sailor

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.159 
revealed that we're getting super Sailor
Mercury<00:05:41.760> which<00:05:42.389> kind<00:05:42.599> of<00:05:42.660> hints<00:05:42.930> that<00:05:43.050> we're

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
Mercury which kind of hints that we're

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.800 
Mercury which kind of hints that we're
getting<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.470> rest<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.830> supers<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.810> still

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
getting the rest of the supers and still

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.710 
getting the rest of the supers and still
no<00:05:45.930> villains<00:05:46.320> in<00:05:46.440> sight<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.419> guess<00:05:48.419> maybe

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
no villains in sight so I guess maybe

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.300 
no villains in sight so I guess maybe
this<00:05:48.930> might<00:05:49.110> be<00:05:49.260> a<00:05:49.289> way<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:49.470> support<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.190> idea

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
this might be a way to support the idea

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.490 
this might be a way to support the idea
that<00:05:50.520> we<00:05:50.820> want<00:05:51.000> villains<00:05:51.360> but<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.199> don't<00:05:52.440> know

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
that we want villains but I don't know

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.050 
that we want villains but I don't know
how<00:05:52.650> they<00:05:52.800> keep<00:05:53.039> track<00:05:53.280> of<00:05:53.490> that<00:05:53.580> considering

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
how they keep track of that considering

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.120 
how they keep track of that considering
this<00:05:54.120> was<00:05:54.270> an<00:05:54.389> exclusive<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:55.289> it's<00:05:55.919> being

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
this was an exclusive and it's being

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.159 
this was an exclusive and it's being
sold<00:05:56.310> in<00:05:56.490> Japan<00:05:56.820> I<00:05:56.849> think<00:05:57.330> as<00:05:57.510> like<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:57.900> lottery

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
sold in Japan I think as like a lottery

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.439 
sold in Japan I think as like a lottery
thing<00:05:58.560> so<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.310> only<00:05:59.550> real<00:05:59.760> way<00:05:59.789> to<00:05:59.970> get<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:00.330> is

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
thing so the only real way to get it is

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.050 
thing so the only real way to get it is
through<00:06:00.630> eBay<00:06:01.169> or<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.770> big<00:06:02.340> bad<00:06:02.520> toy<00:06:02.699> store<00:06:03.030> or
