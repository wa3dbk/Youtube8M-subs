this panel around and that lets the
spine<00:03:04.000> move<00:03:05.000> into<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.480> kind<00:03:05.600> of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
spine move into that you can kind of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.260 
spine move into that you can kind of
