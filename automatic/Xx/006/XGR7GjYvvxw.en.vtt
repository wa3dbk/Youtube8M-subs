00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
any other team the thing is he's he's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.920 
any other team the thing is he's he's
versatile<00:02:38.140> enough<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:39.030> like<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.629> know<00:02:40.750> other

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
versatile enough to like you know other

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.539 
versatile enough to like you know other
quarterbacks<00:02:41.379> are<00:02:41.500> necessarily<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.310> good

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
quarterbacks are necessarily that good

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.120 
quarterbacks are necessarily that good
and<00:02:42.880> look<00:02:43.000> at<00:02:43.090> those<00:02:43.209> stats<00:02:43.510> might<00:02:44.230> well<00:02:45.040> be

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and look at those stats might well be

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.210 
and look at those stats might well be
those<00:02:45.250> stats<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.349> feel<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:47.739> Jaguars<00:02:48.160> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
those stats but I feel like Jaguars the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.680 
those stats but I feel like Jaguars the
only<00:02:48.459> team<00:02:48.579> he<00:02:48.790> may<00:02:49.000> have<00:02:49.120> probably<00:02:49.390> be<00:02:49.540> so

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
only team he may have probably be so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.569 
only team he may have probably be so
versatile<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.260> he<00:02:50.799> doesn't<00:02:51.069> necessarily

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
versatile that he doesn't necessarily

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.100 
versatile that he doesn't necessarily
need<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.790> receiver<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.209> succeed<00:02:52.599> he'll<00:02:52.810> win

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
need a receiver to succeed he'll win

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.780 
need a receiver to succeed he'll win
