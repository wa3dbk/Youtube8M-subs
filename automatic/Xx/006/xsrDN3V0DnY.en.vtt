00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
our new survivor characters and we're

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.120 
our new survivor characters and we're
pretty<00:01:56.399> happy<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.909> what<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.420> came<00:01:57.569> up<00:01:57.630> with

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.969 
we think that's dynamics between the
characters<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.710> really
