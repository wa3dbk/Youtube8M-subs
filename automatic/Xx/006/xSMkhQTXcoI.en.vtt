00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 a solution to how are you and hk 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.599
 marijuana according to a new video in the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.210
 which I come to talk about 7 to 5 for pc 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.610
 and video but if they have not confirmed or 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.490
 rockstar nor any other good company 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.580
 accept what is being and I already know 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.230
 but I was browsing gta forums worth 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.530
 a Spanish generation forum so let 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.690
 below the description I have seen a post from 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 that talks about gta 5 for pc and has 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.140
 a page in norway 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 which is the one that is living right now 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 on our screens, it comes out that is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.730
 for sale or can not be bought 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 yet but that has a price of 399 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.210
 crowns that the change in Spanish comes 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.930
 being around 50 euros 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.390
 and the departure date would be on 18 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.290
 March 2014 is a date that I have to 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.050
 think because if you are going to look max payne 3 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.440
 and 7 to 4 came out about that 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.990
 date and then why would not it come out 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.149
 people doing also on that date 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.310
 which is confirmed not as I said that 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.200
 could be true yes and no because no 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.450
 because this one has not said anything again 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.290
 he wants to shut up or this page without 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.130
 want it has escaped like people 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.200

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.820

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.929

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.810
