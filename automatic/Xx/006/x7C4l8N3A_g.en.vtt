00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
was even first looking at building the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.350 
was even first looking at building the
gaming<00:01:03.780> machine<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.500> yeah<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.850> let's

gaming machine are like yeah so let's
just<00:01:06.689> let<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.229> future<00:01:07.619> proof<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.220> know

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just let go of future proof you you know

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
just let go of future proof you you know
i<00:01:08.369> mean<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:08.970> what's<00:01:09.210> future<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> year<00:01:10.020> two

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
i mean you know what's future a year two

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
i mean you know what's future a year two
years<00:01:10.350> three<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.100> five<00:01:11.310> years<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> three<00:01:12.180> years

years three to five years in three years

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
years three to five years in three years
your<00:01:12.720> gaming<00:01:12.960> machine<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
your gaming machine that you have now is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.890 
your gaming machine that you have now is
going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.549> big<00:01:14.850> slow<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.240> we'll<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
going to be big slow and we'll have the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
going to be big slow and we'll have the
graphics<00:01:16.320> performance<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.890> need<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> run<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
graphics performance you need to run the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
graphics performance you need to run the
new<00:01:17.520> game<00:01:17.729> an<00:01:17.970> SSD<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.570> still<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.080> bit

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
new game an SSD is still a little bit

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
new game an SSD is still a little bit
iffy<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.220> mean<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.700> working<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> lot

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
iffy like I mean it's working for a lot

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
iffy like I mean it's working for a lot
of<00:01:21.360> people<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.750> today<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.409> Roger<00:01:22.710> right

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
of people in today you on Roger right

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
of people in today you on Roger right
you<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.520> Roger<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.939> had<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> success

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
drive failures from from early SSDs I'm

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.620 
drive failures from from early SSDs I'm
one<00:01:29.549> thing<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.000> about<00:01:30.060> yeah<00:01:30.420> definitely

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
one thing to think about yeah definitely

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.289 
one thing to think about yeah definitely
like<00:01:31.049> run<00:01:31.380> windows<00:01:31.770> 7<00:01:32.159> enable<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> trim

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
like run windows 7 enable the trim

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
like run windows 7 enable the trim
command<00:01:33.329> make<00:01:34.110> sure<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.350> buy<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> drive<00:01:35.100> it'll

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
command make sure you buy a drive it'll

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.649 
command make sure you buy a drive it'll
work<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> trim<00:01:35.880> commands<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.420> basically

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
work with the trim commands of basically

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.969 
work with the trim commands of basically
deals<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> performance

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
deals with some of the performance

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
deals with some of the performance

we've seen in the past they're going to
