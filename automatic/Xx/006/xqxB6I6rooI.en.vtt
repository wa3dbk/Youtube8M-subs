00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The subtitles were created in German language. I take no responsibility for damage of any kind. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Subtitle in progress 

00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:20.997
 The capacitor bank is charged to about 310V. On the left you can see the open switching spark gap. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
 Here you can see the mini Railgun. It is loaded with a small aluminum ball. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 From the front, albeit blurred. 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 The circuit diagram of the flashboard looks something like this. 

00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:58.194
 In order to charge the capacitors we need this area. (see: mini Railgun Power Unit I) 

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.485
 For the switching spark gap we need this area. (see: mini Railgun Ignition Unit I) 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 The whole construction, as shown here, corresponds to this scheme. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 ... so, the battery is disconnected from the charger. ... 

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:24.595
 The charging board is disconnected from the capacitors. ... 

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:29.985
 The red toggle switch connects the positive capacitor end to the railgun and the switching spark gap. ! High voltage! 

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:38.482
 ... (Put on the goggles, so it wobbles a bit. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 Ignite the switching spark gap. ... 

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.185
 ! Attention ! There are still nearly 65V stored in the condenser. 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 Attention! If the switch is welded, the voltage is still on the contacts. 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.640
 For safety always unplug the plug. 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.659
 a few more pictures ... 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.650
 ... the switching spark gap at work. ... 

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:40.872
 ... in detail ... 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 Impact of the beam on a piece of paper. 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.960
 Aluminum and burn marks on the paper. 

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:14.913
 ... and again ... 

00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:21.182
 ... because it is so beautiful ... 

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:26.035
 The Aluninium ball was placed near the exit. 

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:37.552
 Here it was placed at the very back. 

00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:43.543
 and again. On the way forward, it was stuck somewhere. 

00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:55.014
 ... The shot went to the back. 

00:04:32.602 --> 00:04:35.602
 The rear exit was almost completely sealed here. 

00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:52.506
 again the circuit diagram of the whole Railgun. 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 Caution when replicating! There is danger to life! 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.550
 I take no responsibility for damage of any kind. Wear protective goggles. Unavailable for children stow away.
