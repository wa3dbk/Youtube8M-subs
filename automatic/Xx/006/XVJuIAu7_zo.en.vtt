up<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.630> into<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.140> hole<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.310> one

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
up going into this hole here and the one

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.130 
up going into this hole here and the one
that<00:00:29.670> fits<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.269> middle<00:00:30.510> will<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.840> slide

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that fits in the middle will just slide

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.000 
that fits in the middle will just slide
through<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.910> slot<00:00:33.239> next<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.320> I've<00:00:34.440> done<00:00:34.680> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
through this slot next what I've done is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.650 
through this slot next what I've done is
I've<00:00:35.219> taken<00:00:35.520> my<00:00:35.880> door<00:00:36.090> I've<00:00:36.270> tipped<00:00:36.510> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
I've taken my door I've tipped it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.869 
I've taken my door I've tipped it
sideways<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.190> piece<00:00:38.430> will<00:00:38.640> end<00:00:38.790> up

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
sideways so that piece will end up

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.900 
sideways so that piece will end up
fitting<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.390> there<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> front<00:00:40.680> one

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
fitting in there and then the front one

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.229 
fitting in there and then the front one
will<00:00:41.910> fit<00:00:42.239> inside<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:43.290> slot<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.030> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
will fit inside that slot so it's in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.900 
will fit inside that slot so it's in
there<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:46.110> door<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.410> angled<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.309> next<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.730> will

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
there this door is angled so next I will

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
there this door is angled so next I will
slowly<00:00:48.270> angle<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> top<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
slowly angle the top and get that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.750 
slowly angle the top and get that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it's not closing we're too close here so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.960 
it's not closing we're too close here so
we'll<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.850> lift<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> door<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:16.020> bit
