00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.100
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.890
 video offered by gameplays 3 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.040
 this time I will bring you a video 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 from home to people but before I go to 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.800
 explain a little the main menu 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.800
 from home to people 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.440
 well here we have the main menu of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.690
 house people we have the skill level 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 of the rivals departures fast and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.150
 markers the skill level you can 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.800
 buy various skills just like 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.100
 You can also do it in the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100
 mercenaries 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.950
 here you can buy skills 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.270
 attack defense skills and so on 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.310
 skills then you can improve 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.490
 these skills little by little for 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.789
 when I play being a zombie you can do 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.789
 more damage 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.619
 when higher level in attack and if here 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.900
 country higher level in defense will give you 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.840
 less damage then 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.420
 for that it is what serves the skills 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.460
 It depends on what bug you are and what 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.010
 the skills you take will have greater 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.600
 succeed well so you do not kill them either 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.380
 to kill the opponent faster that already 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.380
 it will depend on him 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.360
 even the energy of the creature 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.360
 you can also improve the stability 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.200
 For now I'm going to focus more 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.430
 in improving both attack and defense that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.090
 is what is most important in a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.610
 monster to be able to kill the agents 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.090
 alright I'm going to upload creature attack to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.090
 Level 2 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.310
 lets you climb more than the level but what 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.819
 happens is that it is quite expensive to upload 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.079
 level things so much in this mode of 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.079
 game like in any other 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.090
 and what 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.439
 accumulate points of level exits is delayed 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.120
 quite and at the time of spending 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.220
 Best two Gasteiz pretty fast 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.829
 other things we will move to the level of 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.720
 the rivals can choose any one and 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.880
 veteran or more 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.250
 at the beginning when you are starting 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.440
 choose any one or more but also 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.520
 you have the option to choose veteran or 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.410
 more this option is mostly for 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.480
 when you have enough attack then 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.490
 you can choose this option because with a 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.650
 just slap you will do a lot of damage to the 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.819
 enemy since playing in good veteran 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.400
 professional 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.319
 the least harm it causes to people 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.319
 it will be quite serious 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.650
 and then you are more successful at killing 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.200
 the agents 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.130
 then if you want to kill brief 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.870
 people look for that in veteran rather 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.610
 once explained this let's proceed 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.550
 to find a game to try these 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.069
 skills and see how we are given 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.469
 the last time I played 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.310
 home people had me suicide 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:59.489
 the dynamite to be able to stop already critical 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.319
 to the people the good thing was that a whole 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.659
 fat because there he got the engine and 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.499
 also that the partner was not close 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.499
 to be able to save it 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.959
 we were able to connect with a player who 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.030
 is taking out history and now you can see 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.280
 that said we started to give 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.790
 in a 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.670
 It is a space for corpses 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.920
 well this particular bug is very 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.340
 strong since we have fought against him in 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.080
 mercenaries and is one of the heaviest 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.380
 and more resistant than there are in some 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.380
 maps 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.169
 then we started well since we have been 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.469
 given a pretty tough monster 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.919
 How ugly is I, nor do I seem to eliminate 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.919
 these teeth 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.720
 ok let's see the controls 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.720
 we can grab 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.949
 we can give hooks we can dodge and 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.509
 we can also drag us the 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.069
 dodge is going to be like that drunk guy 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.220
 going from the alavÃ©s side quite funny 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.670
 but the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.310
 leave here climbing the fence and there 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.960
 we are going to dedicate ourselves to make his life 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.320
 impossible to the agents that we found 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.320
 Over there 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.470
 we see that there are other creatures too 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.630
 they walk we do not know if they were 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.320
 controlled by other users 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.670
 or they will be controlled by the machine well 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.520
 let's see if we can get it 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.699
 We met with the plant brief fuck 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.330
 He was not allowed to get well was he 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.599
 also fast with the button 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.490
 and it was possible to get away it seems that 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.229
 we were in a swimming contest 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.229
 there butterfly style 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.820
 even though he has already sent several 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.880
 shots and even hitting and they have not 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.600
 got killed there is again I 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.750
 they nudged and punched but did not 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.280
 have managed to kill then that's why 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.600
 what I like I like this zombie 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.600
 because it is very resistant 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.620
 the quick alex 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.300
 fuck this he was also quick with the 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.380
 button to be able to remove but we left 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.880
 Christ 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:31.220
 I loose from there shoot me not what 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.460
 can finish what luck and on top 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.440
 shot with the folders I already receive 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.500
 pretty hurt pretty bad and I'm still 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.500
 foot 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.090
 we are like the terminator but the zombie 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.550
 it seems that nothing will be able to kill us 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.010
 embassy takes the before it heals and 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.560
 there is a little bit complicated to manage 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.560
 sun moves pretty weird 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.560
 ok let's see if now yes now if 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.360
 we managed to finish 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.660
 to see and why get out this let's see 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.920
 so the game is over 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.920
 it will be that we kill him 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.930
 ok here you get all the statistics of 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.830
 everything you have got 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.889
 if you look at you have managed to kill a 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.889
 agent 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.220
 we have achieved in this game thus achieve 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.570
 in previous we had achieved over 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.280
 make you critical in this and finally 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.810
 we managed to kill an agent but that 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.180
 have liked already know how to give like 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.610
