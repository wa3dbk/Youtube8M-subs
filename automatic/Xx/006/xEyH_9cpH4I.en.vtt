top-of-the-line dode kind of crazy but

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.149 
top-of-the-line dode kind of crazy but
while<00:01:33.679> doing<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.039> repos<00:01:34.509> his<00:01:35.590> leg<00:01:36.590> popped<00:01:36.920> off

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159

mean it's not supposed to pop off that
easily<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.310> don't<00:01:43.609> think<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.780> maybe<00:01:44.960> just<00:01:45.049> a

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
easily I don't think so maybe just a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.380 
easily I don't think so maybe just a
little<00:01:45.320> bit<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.680> superglue<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.340> we'll<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:47.270> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
little bit of superglue and we'll do the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.410 
little bit of superglue and we'll do the
job<00:01:47.630> but<00:01:49.000> contemplating<00:01:50.000> on<00:01:50.090> sending<00:01:50.359> this

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
than it already has the thing I liked a

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.830 
than it already has the thing I liked a
lot<00:02:12.160> about<00:02:12.520> this<00:02:12.700> was<00:02:12.970> how<00:02:13.120> they<00:02:13.330> have<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
lot about this was how they have the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.550 
lot about this was how they have the
webs<00:02:14.140> secured<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.340> hard<00:02:16.060> foam<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:17.290> way

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
webs secured in this hard foam this way

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.260 
webs secured in this hard foam this way
they're<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.220> bend<00:02:18.430> up<00:02:18.610> or<00:02:18.880> break

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
they're not going to bend up or break

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.840 
they're not going to bend up or break
and<00:02:19.950> that's<00:02:20.950> pretty<00:02:21.100> cool<00:02:21.340> because<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.670> didn't

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
and that's pretty cool because I didn't

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.010 
and that's pretty cool because I didn't
have<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> black<00:02:22.210> suit<00:02:22.390> spider-man<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.930> that
