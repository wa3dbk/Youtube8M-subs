failed<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:56.579> does<00:00:56.910> charge<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.390> PCC<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.579> it<00:00:59.579> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
failed it does charge a PCC and it will

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.270 
failed it does charge a PCC and it will
charge<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:03.300> did<00:01:04.170> try<00:01:04.379> putting<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> Titan

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
charge this I did try putting a Titan

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.060 
charge this I did try putting a Titan
battery<00:01:05.610> inside<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.530> did<00:01:07.770> work

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
battery inside this and that did work

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
battery inside this and that did work
but<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.950> seemed<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.850> standard<00:01:12.240> battery

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
but it seemed that the standard battery

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
but it seemed that the standard battery
that<00:01:12.689> came<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:14.240> was<00:01:15.240> actually<00:01:15.720> better<00:01:17.090> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that came with it was actually better so

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
that came with it was actually better so
it<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.869> let<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.710> do

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it was kind of let down because I do

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.760 
it was kind of let down because I do
like<00:01:20.100> both<00:01:20.400> vaping<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.810> 5<00:01:22.200> volts<00:01:22.229> with

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
like both vaping that at 5 volts with

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.539 
like both vaping that at 5 volts with
the<00:01:22.860> time<00:01:23.270> now<00:01:25.009> coolest<00:01:26.009> thing<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the time now coolest thing about this is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.390 
the time now coolest thing about this is
because<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.020> small<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.130> turn<00:01:29.280> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
because it is so small you can turn this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.149 
because it is so small you can turn this
on<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> way<00:01:33.710> but<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.950> definitely

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
on and off by the way but it definitely

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.120 
on and off by the way but it definitely
matter<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:36.229> once<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> battery<00:01:37.590> charged

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
matter because once the battery charged

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.359 
matter because once the battery charged
in<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.960> flight<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:41.840> now<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.369> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
in it the flight with all now know this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.109 
in it the flight with all now know this
is<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:44.880> small<00:01:46.909> switch<00:01:47.909> means<00:01:48.210> i<00:01:50.119> can

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
is really small switch means i can

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:10.809 
is really small switch means i can
finish<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.750> my<00:01:51.869> pocket

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:21.500 

and<00:02:11.420> vape<00:02:11.659> all<00:02:11.870> there

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.390 

I<00:02:21.569> mean<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.760> don't<00:02:23.760> see<00:02:23.909> it<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> big<00:02:24.420> problem

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.770 

so<00:02:33.290> $30<00:02:34.610> those<00:02:35.610> little<00:02:35.939> definitely<00:02:36.450> a
