00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
four come on blocks or five command

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.399 
four come on blocks or five command
blocks<00:01:34.070> now<00:01:35.070> you'll<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.820> I've<00:01:36.060> actually

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
blocks now you'll see that I've actually

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.480 
blocks now you'll see that I've actually
color-coordinated<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.680> command<00:01:38.159> block<00:01:38.340> so

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
color-coordinated the command block so

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
color-coordinated the command block so
that<00:01:38.640> does<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> teleportation<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.350> well

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that does the teleportation here as well

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.840 
that does the teleportation here as well
now<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.250> you've<00:01:41.400> watched<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:43.340> how<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> set<00:01:44.700> your

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
now if you've watched my how to set your

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.389 
now if you've watched my how to set your
world<00:01:45.119> spawn<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.799> use

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
world spawn you know that I actually use

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.789 
world spawn you know that I actually use
a<00:01:47.549> command<00:01:48.180> called<00:01:48.390> status<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> can

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
a command called status which you can

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
a command called status which you can
actually<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.369> side<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.450> what

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
actually see on the side here then what

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.399 
actually see on the side here then what
the<00:01:51.720> status<00:01:52.200> does<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.130> when<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.409> player

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the status does is that when a player

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.319 
the status does is that when a player
logs<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.579> these<00:01:56.700> scoreboard

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
logs on all of these scoreboard

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
logs on all of these scoreboard
objectives<00:01:57.960> will<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.350> set<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> zero<00:01:59.340> okay<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
objectives will be set to zero okay so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.160 
objectives will be set to zero okay so
if<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.899> now<00:02:01.079> set<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.530> scoreboard<00:02:02.189> objective

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
if I now set my scoreboard objective

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.109 
if I now set my scoreboard objective
status<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.530> 0<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.280> will<00:02:05.640> instantaneously

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
status to 0 it will instantaneously

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.900 
status to 0 it will instantaneously
teleport<00:02:06.960> me<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.950> spawn<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.640> it'll<00:02:08.789> then

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
teleport me to the spawn and it'll then

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.040 
teleport me to the spawn and it'll then
set<00:02:09.209> my<00:02:09.390> spawn<00:02:09.810> coordinates<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:10.950> my<00:02:11.780> set<00:02:12.780> spawn

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
set my spawn coordinates my my set spawn

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.520 
set my spawn coordinates my my set spawn
so

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.490 
so
if<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.740> die<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.310> will<00:02:14.340> spawn<00:02:14.850> here<00:02:15.090> right<00:02:16.050> you'll

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
if I die I will spawn here right you'll

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.150 
if I die I will spawn here right you'll
see<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.770> will<00:02:17.040> spawn<00:02:17.340> right<00:02:17.850> yeah<00:02:19.100> okay<00:02:20.100> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
see I will spawn right yeah okay so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.280 
see I will spawn right yeah okay so
that's<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.209> where<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.690> status<00:02:22.080> comes

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that's that is where the status comes

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.620 
that's that is where the status comes
from<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.390> command<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.569> I

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
from and all it is is a command and I

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.080 
from and all it is is a command and I
think<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.050> one<00:02:25.200> over<00:02:25.500> here<00:02:25.910> no<00:02:26.910> it's

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
think it's this one over here no it's

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.559 
think it's this one over here no it's
not<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.240> one<00:02:27.600> it's<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:30.360> not

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
not that one it's not that one it's not

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.910 
not that one it's not that one it's not
that<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.209> one<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.770> go

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
that one it is not that one there we go

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.760 
that one it is not that one there we go
so<00:02:35.130> it's<00:02:35.250> scoreboard<00:02:35.760> objectives<00:02:36.480> ad<00:02:36.770> status

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
so it's scoreboard objectives ad status

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.120 
so it's scoreboard objectives ad status
as<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.060> dummy<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.420> display<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.440> as<00:02:40.590> status

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
as a dummy and display it as status

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.680 
as a dummy and display it as status
so<00:02:41.400> first<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.730> all<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.060> need<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.480> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
so first of all you will need that and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.040 
so first of all you will need that and
only<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.319> okay<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.790> my<00:02:44.940> status<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.450> zero

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
only that okay so if my status is zero

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.540 
only that okay so if my status is zero
and<00:02:46.320> we<00:02:46.440> use<00:02:46.680> my<00:02:46.830> contraption<00:02:47.130> over<00:02:47.370> here

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and we use my contraption over here

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.130 
and we use my contraption over here
you'll<00:02:47.790> get<00:02:47.910> spawned<00:02:48.209> here<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.870> what<00:02:49.050> I'm

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
you'll get spawned here so what I'm

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.600 
you'll get spawned here so what I'm
doing<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.410> I'm<00:02:49.590> now<00:02:49.709> using<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:50.130> same

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
doing is I'm now using that same

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.360 
doing is I'm now using that same
objective<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.019> I'm<00:02:52.350> now<00:02:52.680> saying<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.130> if

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
objective but and I'm now saying that if

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.930 
objective but and I'm now saying that if
my<00:02:53.700> status<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.510> three<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:56.130> means<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.880> need

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
my status is three it means that I need

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.059 
my status is three it means that I need
to<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.360> teleported<00:02:57.870> somewhere<00:02:58.080> else<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.860> can

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
to be teleported somewhere else so I can

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.190 
to be teleported somewhere else so I can
walk<00:02:59.250> around<00:02:59.489> all<00:02:59.790> happily<00:03:00.269> because<00:03:00.959> I'm<00:03:01.080> in

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
walk around all happily because I'm in

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.559 
walk around all happily because I'm in
status<00:03:01.590> two<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.640> moment<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.450> is

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
status two and the moment and this is

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.030 
status two and the moment and this is
what<00:03:03.690> this<00:03:03.810> command<00:03:04.080> block<00:03:04.260> over<00:03:04.590> here<00:03:04.830> does

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
what this command block over here does

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.460 
what this command block over here does
okay<00:03:05.580> all<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.030> does<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.450> says<00:03:06.930> scoreboard

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
okay all it does it says scoreboard

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.710 
okay all it does it says scoreboard
players<00:03:07.709> set<00:03:08.130> anybody<00:03:08.730> within<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.269> radius<00:03:09.450> of

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
players set anybody within the radius of

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.610 
players set anybody within the radius of
20<00:03:10.110> blocks<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:11.610> status<00:03:12.060> 3<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.080> hit<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.380> I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
20 blocks to status 3 so if I hit that I

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.059 
20 blocks to status 3 so if I hit that I
get<00:03:14.280> set<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.760> status<00:03:15.120> 3<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> sets<00:03:16.530> 3<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.860> get

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
get set to status 3 but it sets 3 I get

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.000 
get set to status 3 but it sets 3 I get
teleported<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:19.010> corresponding

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
teleported to the to the corresponding

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.060 
teleported to the to the corresponding
color<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.120> then<00:03:21.450> my<00:03:21.630> status<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.320> set<00:03:22.500> back<00:03:22.769> to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
color and then my status is set back to

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.150 
color and then my status is set back to
2<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.579> run<00:03:23.760> teleporter<00:03:24.329> ok<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.980> is

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
2 so that run teleporter ok so this is

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.550 
2 so that run teleporter ok so this is
really<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.690> first<00:03:27.900> thing<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.170> does<00:03:28.320> it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
really it so the first thing it does it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.729 
really it so the first thing it does it
checks<00:03:28.890> if<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.280> have<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.730> status<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.480> 3<00:03:31.170> at<00:03:31.380> least

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
checks if I have a status of 3 at least

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.650 
checks if I have a status of 3 at least
3<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.220> no<00:03:32.430> more<00:03:32.670> than<00:03:32.880> 3<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.299> I've<00:03:33.390> got<00:03:33.540> in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
3 and no more than 3 so that I've got in

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.710 
3 and no more than 3 so that I've got in
exact<00:03:34.079> status<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.680> 3<00:03:34.920> okay<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.090> it'll

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
exact status of 3 okay and if I do it'll

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.310 
exact status of 3 okay and if I do it'll
then<00:03:36.989> teleport<00:03:37.530> me<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.780> yellow<00:03:40.079> block

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
then teleport me to the yellow block

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.729 
then teleport me to the yellow block
then<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.940> another<00:03:42.120> repeater<00:03:43.019> with<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.410> 1

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
then I have another repeater with a 1

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.199 
then I have another repeater with a 1
tick<00:03:44.010> delay<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.579> what<00:03:44.730> i've<00:03:44.820> got<00:03:44.970> i've<00:03:45.060> got<00:03:45.180> a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
tick delay so what i've got i've got a

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.210 
tick delay so what i've got i've got a
hopper<00:03:45.450> clock<00:03:45.720> running<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.070> hopper

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
hopper clock running and in the hopper

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.130 
hopper clock running and in the hopper
clock<00:03:47.430> okay<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.329> an<00:03:48.450> item<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.049> just

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
clock okay I have an item so it's just

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.710 
clock okay I have an item so it's just
it's<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.620> shooting<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.370> between<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.730> two<00:03:50.940> ok

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
it's just shooting in between the two ok

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.750 
it's just shooting in between the two ok
powering<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.620> comparator<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.549> that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
powering that comparator and that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.030 
powering that comparator and that
comparator<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.540> then<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.500> have<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.829> first

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
comparator and then I have the first

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.830 
comparator and then I have the first
command<00:03:56.430> block<00:03:56.640> which<00:03:56.820> teleports<00:03:57.450> me<00:03:57.690> to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
command block which teleports me to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.170 
command block which teleports me to
yellow<00:03:58.170> with<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.859> 1<00:03:59.160> tick<00:03:59.400> delay<00:03:59.579> and<00:04:00.000> then<00:04:00.150> I

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
yellow with a 1 tick delay and then I

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.180 
yellow with a 1 tick delay and then I
have<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.540> second<00:04:01.079> command<00:04:01.859> block<00:04:02.040> which

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
have the second command block which

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.720 
have the second command block which
teleports<00:04:02.519> me<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:03.000> green<00:04:03.769> ok<00:04:04.769> then<00:04:05.280> here<00:04:05.579> I've

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
teleports me to green ok then here I've

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.009 
teleports me to green ok then here I've
got<00:04:05.910> 8<00:04:06.060> -<00:04:07.049> tick<00:04:07.320> delay<00:04:07.470> use<00:04:07.829> 1/2<00:04:08.489> tick<00:04:08.730> delay

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
got 8 - tick delay use 1/2 tick delay

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.080 
got 8 - tick delay use 1/2 tick delay
okay<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.470> runs<00:04:10.709> into<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.609> command<00:04:11.910> block

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
okay that runs into the command block

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.140 
okay that runs into the command block
that<00:04:12.209> teleports<00:04:12.870> me<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.109> red<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.799> then

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
that teleports me to red and then

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.819 
that teleports me to red and then
another<00:04:15.150> one<00:04:15.480> tick<00:04:15.720> delay<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.350> teleports

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
another one tick delay the teleports

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.550 
another one tick delay the teleports
with<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.039> purple<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.239> mean<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.079> is<00:04:19.140> time

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
with the purple so I mean this is time

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.860 
with the purple so I mean this is time
pretty<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.459> exactly<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.450> there<00:04:21.780> is

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
pretty much exactly so that there is

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.159 
pretty much exactly so that there is
only<00:04:22.140> ever<00:04:22.590> one<00:04:22.860> command<00:04:23.640> block<00:04:23.750> about<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:25.020> be

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
only ever one command block about to be

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.320 
only ever one command block about to be
powered<00:04:25.590> on<00:04:25.710> at<00:04:26.070> any<00:04:26.520> one<00:04:26.789> time

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
powered on at any one time

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.050 
powered on at any one time
right<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.439> at<00:04:29.159> the<00:04:29.250> moment<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.610> changed<00:04:29.970> my

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
right so at the moment I changed my

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.480 
right so at the moment I changed my
score<00:04:30.449> which<00:04:30.689> ever<00:04:30.990> command<00:04:31.560> block<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.949> then

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
score which ever command block is then

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.689 
score which ever command block is then
active<00:04:33.479> or<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.620> next<00:04:34.830> command<00:04:35.159> block<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.550> be

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
active or the next command block to be

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.920 
active or the next command block to be
activated<00:04:36.210> will<00:04:36.840> then<00:04:37.110> teleport<00:04:37.800> me<00:04:38.009> to

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
activated will then teleport me to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.119 
activated will then teleport me to
whichever<00:04:39.930> one<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.199> is<00:04:40.229> and<00:04:40.500> that's<00:04:40.620> why<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:40.889> is

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
whichever one it is and that's why it is

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.860 
whichever one it is and that's why it is
random<00:04:41.370> because<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:42.270> clock<00:04:42.569> will<00:04:42.750> be

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
random because this clock will be

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.559 
random because this clock will be
running<00:04:43.080> always<00:04:43.439> so<00:04:44.370> at<00:04:44.490> any<00:04:44.759> time<00:04:44.879> any<00:04:45.300> one<00:04:45.539> of

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
running always so at any time any one of

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.749 
running always so at any time any one of
these<00:04:45.840> as<00:04:46.530> its<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.129> I<00:04:47.280> mean<00:04:47.430> it's<00:04:47.580> in

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
these as its and I mean it's in

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.990 
these as its and I mean it's in
fractions<00:04:48.509> of<00:04:48.689> a<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.580> tick<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.729> mean<00:04:50.879> it's

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
fractions of a of a tick I mean it's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.270 
fractions of a of a tick I mean it's
probably<00:04:51.180> one<00:04:51.479> tick<00:04:51.750> delay<00:04:51.930> between<00:04:52.319> them<00:04:53.099> all

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
probably one tick delay between them all

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.429 
probably one tick delay between them all
firing<00:04:53.580> off<00:04:53.879> so<00:04:54.389> it's<00:04:54.659> a<00:04:54.719> very<00:04:54.960> very<00:04:55.229> narrow

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
firing off so it's a very very narrow

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.140 
firing off so it's a very very narrow
margin<00:04:55.740> there's<00:04:56.069> no<00:04:56.189> way<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.490> predicting<00:04:56.789> it<00:04:57.060> I

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
margin there's no way of predicting it I

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.640 
margin there's no way of predicting it I
mean<00:04:57.240> even<00:04:57.479> if<00:04:57.569> you<00:04:57.719> if<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.229> want<00:04:58.379> to<00:04:58.439> stand

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
mean even if you if you want to stand

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.950 
mean even if you if you want to stand
here<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.039> watch<00:04:59.849> it<00:04:59.909> and<00:05:00.180> then<00:05:00.240> you<00:05:00.539> know<00:05:00.690> hit

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
here and watch it and then you know hit

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.420 
here and watch it and then you know hit
it<00:05:00.990> at<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.289> certain<00:05:01.440> time<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:01.860> let's<00:05:02.129> see<00:05:02.250> if<00:05:02.310> we

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
it at a certain time so let's see if we

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.589 
it at a certain time so let's see if we
that<00:05:02.789> one's<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.090> okay<00:05:03.389> yellow<00:05:04.190> stride<00:05:05.190> again

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
that one's on okay yellow stride again

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.249 
that one's on okay yellow stride again
and<00:05:07.699> now<00:05:08.699> yellow<00:05:09.509> again<00:05:09.780> well<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.050> thought

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
and now yellow again well I thought

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.469 
and now yellow again well I thought
about<00:05:10.469> that's<00:05:10.860> not<00:05:11.069> bad<00:05:11.280> in<00:05:11.819> my<00:05:11.940> test<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.360> had

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
about that's not bad in my test I had

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.029 
about that's not bad in my test I had
trouble<00:05:12.780> getting<00:05:12.810> two<00:05:13.080> yellow<00:05:13.319> straight

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
trouble getting two yellow straight

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.719 
trouble getting two yellow straight
again<00:05:15.199> again<00:05:16.199> purple<00:05:16.710> so<00:05:17.069> I<00:05:17.099> mean<00:05:17.340> it's

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
again again purple so I mean it's

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.089 
again again purple so I mean it's
whatever<00:05:17.969> everyone<00:05:18.659> is<00:05:18.840> on<00:05:19.169> at<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.889> same<00:05:20.039> time

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
whatever everyone is on at the same time

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.269 
whatever everyone is on at the same time
now<00:05:20.699> this<00:05:20.969> is<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.240> important<00:05:22.020> bit<00:05:22.080> okay<00:05:22.740> you

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
now this is the important bit okay you

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.059 
now this is the important bit okay you
need<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.669> have<00:05:23.759> a<00:05:23.789> comparator<00:05:24.590> coming<00:05:25.590> out<00:05:25.740> of

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
need to have a comparator coming out of

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.950 
need to have a comparator coming out of
each<00:05:26.669> one<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.120> these<00:05:27.210> come<00:05:27.419> on<00:05:27.569> blocks

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
each one of these come on blocks

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.010 
each one of these come on blocks
running<00:05:28.550> into<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:30.270> command<00:05:30.629> block<00:05:30.840> that

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
running into the command block that

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.740 
running into the command block that
actually<00:05:31.529> changes<00:05:32.129> your<00:05:32.190> status<00:05:32.699> back<00:05:33.029> to<00:05:33.479> two

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
actually changes your status back to two

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.110 
actually changes your status back to two
because<00:05:34.560> if<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:34.830> if<00:05:35.099> your<00:05:35.310> status<00:05:35.699> is<00:05:35.849> not

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
because if you if your status is not

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.519 
because if you if your status is not
changed<00:05:36.569> back<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:36.990> two<00:05:37.169> you<00:05:37.349> will

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
changed back to two you will

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.769 
changed back to two you will
continuously<00:05:38.310> be<00:05:38.490> spawned<00:05:39.029> over<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.569> over

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
continuously be spawned over and over

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:41.659 
continuously be spawned over and over
and<00:05:39.870> over<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.259> if<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.650> remove<00:05:40.949> these<00:05:41.159> two<00:05:41.400> blocks

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
and over so if I remove these two blocks

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.320 
and over so if I remove these two blocks
okay<00:05:42.599> and<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:43.680> hate<00:05:43.830> this<00:05:43.979> button<00:05:44.339> you<00:05:45.180> will<00:05:45.300> see

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
okay and I hate this button you will see

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.240 
okay and I hate this button you will see
I'll<00:05:45.539> be<00:05:45.719> I'll<00:05:46.020> be<00:05:46.169> just<00:05:46.319> teleported

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
I'll be I'll be just teleported

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.040 
I'll be I'll be just teleported
continuously<00:05:48.000> over<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.419> over<00:05:48.599> and<00:05:48.719> over<00:05:48.960> and

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
continuously over and over and over and

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.899 
continuously over and over and over and
over<00:05:49.259> and<00:05:49.319> over<00:05:49.560> because<00:05:49.680> my<00:05:49.830> status<00:05:50.400> on<00:05:50.520> the

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
over and over because my status on the

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.029 
over and over because my status on the
side<00:05:51.089> is<00:05:51.270> three<00:05:51.569> so<00:05:52.110> if<00:05:52.229> I<00:05:52.349> now<00:05:52.500> change<00:05:52.770> my

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
side is three so if I now change my

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.959 
side is three so if I now change my
scoreboard<00:05:53.819> status<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.569> two<00:05:54.860> it'll<00:05:55.860> stop<00:05:56.190> okay

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
scoreboard status to two it'll stop okay

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.629 
scoreboard status to two it'll stop okay
so<00:05:57.330> this<00:05:57.419> is<00:05:57.599> why<00:05:57.839> this<00:05:58.440> Center<00:05:59.039> one<00:05:59.250> and<00:05:59.490> why

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
so this is why this Center one and why

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.170 
so this is why this Center one and why
these<00:05:59.699> comparators<00:06:00.690> over<00:06:01.110> here<00:06:01.319> is<00:06:01.469> so

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
these comparators over here is so

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.969 
these comparators over here is so
incredibly<00:06:03.180> important<00:06:03.719> okay<00:06:04.199> without<00:06:04.680> them

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
incredibly important okay without them

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.749 
incredibly important okay without them
you<00:06:05.190> will<00:06:05.759> not<00:06:06.000> this<00:06:06.629> will<00:06:06.810> not<00:06:06.930> work<00:06:07.460> now<00:06:08.460> as<00:06:08.639> I

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
you will not this will not work now as I

know you want to carry on you can you

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.740 
know you want to carry on you can you
know<00:06:14.550> maybe<00:06:14.849> add<00:06:15.089> a<00:06:15.120> little<00:06:15.360> bit<00:06:15.479> on<00:06:15.599> the<00:06:15.719> other

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
know maybe add a little bit on the other

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.519 
know maybe add a little bit on the other
side<00:06:16.169> and<00:06:16.819> so<00:06:17.819> yeah<00:06:17.940> that<00:06:18.089> that<00:06:18.509> is<00:06:18.719> it<00:06:19.169> one

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
side and so yeah that that is it one

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.680 
side and so yeah that that is it one
block<00:06:19.650> so<00:06:20.069> it's<00:06:20.339> a<00:06:20.610> status<00:06:21.210> gets<00:06:21.389> changed<00:06:21.569> to

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
block so it's a status gets changed to

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.019 
block so it's a status gets changed to
three<00:06:22.289> one<00:06:23.039> of<00:06:23.069> these<00:06:23.250> command<00:06:23.580> blocks<00:06:23.639> then

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
three one of these command blocks then

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.820 
three one of these command blocks then
picks<00:06:24.270> you<00:06:24.449> up<00:06:24.479> and<00:06:24.870> teleports<00:06:25.379> you<00:06:25.469> and<00:06:25.680> then

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
picks you up and teleports you and then

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.950 
picks you up and teleports you and then
because<00:06:26.550> they<00:06:26.759> have<00:06:26.940> successfully<00:06:27.629> tell<00:06:27.810> all

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.930 
because they've teleported you it will
activate<00:06:30.330> one<00:06:30.870> of<00:06:30.960> these<00:06:31.909> comparators<00:06:32.909> which

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
activate one of these comparators which

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.420 
activate one of these comparators which
will<00:06:33.270> then<00:06:33.419> turn<00:06:33.719> on<00:06:34.009> all<00:06:35.009> the<00:06:35.039> will<00:06:35.310> then
