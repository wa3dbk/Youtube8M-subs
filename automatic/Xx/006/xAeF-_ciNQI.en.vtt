and<00:00:53.420> we<00:00:54.140> put<00:00:54.350> this<00:00:54.530> together<00:00:54.770> this<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.100> called

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
and we put this together this is called

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.740 
and we put this together this is called
the<00:00:55.580> sand<00:00:55.910> noise<00:00:56.090> device

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750

so<00:00:57.710> as<00:00:58.360> these<00:00:59.360> parks<00:01:00.200> are<00:01:01.210> noticed<00:01:02.210> by<00:01:02.330> the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
so as these parks are noticed by the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.550 
so as these parks are noticed by the
camera<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:04.300> this<00:01:05.300> wave<00:01:05.600> comes<00:01:06.260> in<00:01:06.350> contact

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
camera and this wave comes in contact

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.490 
camera and this wave comes in contact
they<00:01:07.160> emit<00:01:07.340> these<00:01:07.460> particles<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.810> they

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
they emit these particles and they

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.010 
they emit these particles and they
follow<00:01:09.860> all<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.970> contours<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.570> sand<00:01:11.870> all

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
follow all the contours in the sand all

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.590 
follow all the contours in the sand all
the<00:01:12.050> physics<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.770> they<00:01:12.950> they<00:01:13.550> feel<00:01:14.120> in<00:01:14.420> this

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
the physics that they they feel in this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.990 
the physics that they they feel in this
world<00:01:14.840> that's<00:01:15.170> in<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.410> sandbox<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:16.130> based<00:01:16.760> on

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
world that's in the sandbox is based on

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.040 
world that's in the sandbox is based on
their<00:01:17.210> contours<00:01:18.250> see<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:19.520> can<00:01:19.670> kind<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:20.050> make

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
their contours see we can kind of make

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.340 
their contours see we can kind of make
them<00:01:21.229> sit<00:01:22.070> in<00:01:22.100> these<00:01:22.340> holes

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
them sit in these holes

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:35.050 
them sit in these holes
or<00:01:24.470> we<00:01:24.590> can<00:01:24.740> speed<00:01:25.010> them<00:01:25.130> up

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.359 

stop<00:01:36.170> around<00:01:37.490> sometimes<00:01:38.490> catch<00:01:38.700> them

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
stop around sometimes catch them

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.069 
stop around sometimes catch them
for<00:01:40.880> sure<00:01:41.679> just<00:01:42.679> with<00:01:42.859> this<00:01:42.979> sand<00:01:43.329> so<00:01:44.329> they<00:01:44.479> use

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
for sure just with this sand so they use

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.880 
for sure just with this sand so they use
the<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.770> contours<00:01:46.450> just<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:48.109> a<00:01:48.649> real

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the the contours just like in a real

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:00.570 
the the contours just like in a real
world

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580 

we<00:02:01.090> have<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.240> Kinect<00:02:01.660> camera<00:02:02.110> that's<00:02:02.320> looking

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
we have a Kinect camera that's looking

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.660 
we have a Kinect camera that's looking
overhead<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.940> it's<00:02:04.510> kind<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.780> tuned<00:02:05.020> for<00:02:05.380> this

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
overhead and it's kind of tuned for this

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.640 
overhead and it's kind of tuned for this
two<00:02:06.670> foot<00:02:07.020> space<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:09.400> so<00:02:10.360> we're<00:02:10.540> reading<00:02:11.380> that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
two foot space and so we're reading that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.630 
two foot space and so we're reading that
and<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.670> through

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
and going through

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.110 
and going through
basically<00:02:14.180> an<00:02:14.360> array<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.750> pixels<00:02:15.019> that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
basically an array of pixels that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
basically an array of pixels that
knows<00:02:17.420> how<00:02:17.840> high<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.349> versus<00:02:18.950> how<00:02:19.099> high

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
knows how high this is versus how high

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.360 
knows how high this is versus how high
this<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.599> so<00:02:20.599> as<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.349> pass<00:02:21.620> through<00:02:21.650> they

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
this is so as they pass through they

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.880 
this is so as they pass through they
they<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:22.959> where<00:02:23.959> all<00:02:24.110> these<00:02:24.230> contours<00:02:24.739> are

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
they know where all these contours are

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.130 
they know where all these contours are
in<00:02:25.010> metals<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.730> valleys

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
in metals and valleys

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.940 
in metals and valleys
curves

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.350 

all<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.940> audio<00:02:34.599> for<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:34.989> project<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.920> being

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
all the audio for this project is being

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.820 
all the audio for this project is being
synthesized<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.569> real-time<00:02:37.810> using<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.650> pure

data programming language which is a
graphical<00:02:42.099> serve<00:02:42.940> patching<00:02:43.840> language<00:02:44.230> where

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
graphical serve patching language where

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.860 
graphical serve patching language where
you<00:02:44.590> take<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.010> bunch<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.459> little<00:02:45.819> blocks<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
you take a bunch of little blocks and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.270 
you take a bunch of little blocks and
like<00:02:46.959> draw<00:02:47.170> lines<00:02:47.440> between<00:02:47.680> them<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.099> link

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
like draw lines between them to link

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.610 
like draw lines between them to link
like<00:02:48.580> their<00:02:48.760> inputs<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.269> outputs<00:02:49.630> sort<00:02:50.560> of

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
like their inputs and outputs sort of

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.110 
like their inputs and outputs sort of
like<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.769> really<00:02:51.010> complex<00:02:51.519> modular

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
like a really complex modular

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.870 
like a really complex modular
synthesizer<00:02:52.690> all<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.830> non<00:02:53.950> audio<00:02:54.370> part<00:02:54.700> is

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
synthesizer all the non audio part is

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.240 
synthesizer all the non audio part is
handled<00:02:55.300> by<00:02:55.420> open<00:02:56.200> frameworks<00:02:56.709> which<00:02:57.040> is

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
handled by open frameworks which is

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.509 
handled by open frameworks which is
essentially<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:58.799> full-up<00:02:59.799> framework<00:03:00.220> for

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
essentially a full-up framework for

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.449 
essentially a full-up framework for
using<00:03:01.030> various<00:03:01.450> multimedia<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.769> graphics

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
using various multimedia like graphics

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.660 
using various multimedia like graphics
and<00:03:03.730> audio<00:03:04.260> things<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.530> C++<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:07.319> we're<00:03:08.319> taking

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
and audio things and C++ so we're taking

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.370 
and audio things and C++ so we're taking
readings<00:03:09.670> from<00:03:10.000> our<00:03:10.239> color<00:03:10.690> camera<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.319> our

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
readings from our color camera and our

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.559 
readings from our color camera and our
depth<00:03:11.650> camera<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.280> essentially<00:03:13.180> writing

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
depth camera and essentially writing

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.660 
depth camera and essentially writing
those<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:14.319> reading<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.769> two<00:03:14.950> big<00:03:15.310> array<00:03:15.610> is

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
those like reading the two big array is

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.690 
those like reading the two big array is
full<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.180> pixels
