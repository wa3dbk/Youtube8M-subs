 Investment 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.729
 and then they re-work much larger episode of our broadcast 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.289
 Boston stuck 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.210
 the Federal Constitutional Court had recently ruled 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.570
 that on sunday 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.429
 do not talk anymore 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.619
 for sale of goods 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.659
 may be left open 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.699
 "I would like to read an article to Dennis 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.950
 the vertical on the first of December 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.830
 published in the star and then it says 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.750
 the four sale-open advent Sundays in Berlin violate the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.060
 basic law 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.620
 This has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.310
 In principle, the protection of the Sundays and holidays is towards 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.040
 more important than profit interests 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.940
 Sales-open Sundays and holidays are in Germany only in exceptional cases 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.499
 permissible 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:58.170
 that has the Federal Constitutional Court 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.590
 decided and the generous rules for shop opening in the state of Berlin 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.489
 partly declared unconstitutional 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.570
 the release of all four Advent Sundays in the federal capital violates 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.619
 the special of Frauke Schulz the Basic Law 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 The judges filed a lawsuit 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.329
 the two major churches 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.149
 instead of other words, the Catholic and the Protestant Church intend 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.710
 the Federal Constitutional Court 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.620
 against that complained that in the country Berlin 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.450
 on sunday are apparently on the ground 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 were able to sell 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 only the constitutional judges have referred to the Basic Law 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.770
 exactly on Article 41 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.330
 namely, some articles Dr then Weimar Empire constitution 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.810
 declared valid 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.759
 in particular Articles 136 to a hundred 41 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.260
 I would like to continue in Gossa a few of these articles which go beyond the Basic Law 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.810
 to read aloud 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.710
 Ina Tebbe 136 states it 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.730
 no one to a church action or solemnity 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.560
 or to participate in religious exercises 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.840
 or to use a religious old forms 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.939
 are forced 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.759
 only the reasoning bar that were 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:16.539
 the shops search must make people have more opportunity am 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.289
 Thinking about the church on Sunday 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.129
 is that a contradiction to what the article says here under 36 no one is allowed 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.489
 to attend a solemn ceremony of religious celebrations 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.709
 become 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.890
 and then it's called Matic hundred thirty-nine the Sunday and the state-approved 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.129
 Holidays stay as days of rest 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.469
 and the spiritual survey protected by law 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.940
 but the only question is if someone wants to go shopping on Sunday 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.260
 and want to go to church at the same time, why is there a contradiction 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.969
 the paradox of the matter, however, is 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.969
 that as a Christian state one should assume that, too 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:56.969
 Germany 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.070
 Image Fundamentals of the Bible 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.339
 is true to one 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:04.189
 the end one is here a Christian if you follow the basics of Veba consequently 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.219
 were 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.629
 Did you know that the Bible is TV 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.359
 the sunday agreement 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.559
 arranges 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.499
 Did you know that nowhere in the Bible is there a place to say 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.230
 Sunday 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.319
 go to the church 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.049
 or maybe Sunday 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.049
 Buy or sell things or work 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.290
 that 's surprising i should like to give him a few excerpts from Dr 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.289
 The Catholic Church read the open 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.369
 and clearly 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.399
 says first of all 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.529
 an article 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.819
 the Roman Catholic and Spiritual Cardinal Dions 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.339
 who in his work believes our fathers 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.379
 following skew 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.359
 The observation of this law has not been demanded 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.829
 to keep the law holy Sunday 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.169
 one of the first among our most sacred duties 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.869
 but he may read the Bible of Werther, it is from the first book 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.479
 Moses until the secret revelation 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:03.779
 and he will not find a single word which sanctity and of the 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.499
 orders on sundays 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.089
 the scriptures demand the religious observation that already saw 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.930
 He also says in another scripture 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.880
 Saturday is the seventh day according to the b19 commanded 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.979
 I answer yes 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.479
 Sunday is the first day of the week 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.680
 and he set the church the seventh day of the Saturday with the Sunday of the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.809
 first day 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:31.939
 I answer yes 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.159
 Christ changed the day 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.520
 I answer with no 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.550
 So Christ's raceday has not changed 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.779
 who has changed him then 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.259
 Here is an excerpt from who Kerssenberg Wenger are 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.259
 who wrote in Japan 47 following 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.999
 for example, we are nowhere in the Bible that Christ or the apostles 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.730
 hazards 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.469
 Image ESA was broadcast from Saturday to Sunday 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.710
 We have the commandment of God given to Moses 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.860
 that the Heath demands Kalthof Quests workday 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.860
 because the seventh day of the week is Saturday 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.849
 Today, most Christians hold Sunday 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.789
 Ferrero is outside of the Roman Catholic Church 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.789
 the bible reveals why he is 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.260
 and then the following quote in front 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.150
 his place was won by Scheitz and loser 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.349
 in Japan 2 95 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.279
 as this 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.580
 Agassi wrote the following 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.830
 the sacred holiday of the Sabbath was moved from Saturday to Sunday 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.729
 The day of the Lord was not told due to any authority of the Lord 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.029
 Bible but due to the claims of the Catholic Church and 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.110
 authority 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.110
 all these were Catholic quotes 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.590
 how to make it clear that we are somewhere 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.930
 the sunday 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.080
 Agreement command 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.059
 but that the Catholic Church 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:00.219
 felt as if they were 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.219
 then claim from their creditors 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.340
 but what about the Protestant church? 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.810
 Ultimately, the Protestant church emerged from the Reformation 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.289
 a formation that said that the Catholic Church has no authority 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.680
 any on 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 Decreeing to adopt decrees in the Bible 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.589
 nevertheless have themselves in this very important question 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.060
 the German church 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.669
 subordinated 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.240
 We do not go back to what the Bible tells us to do 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.339
 People 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:33.729
 in your 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.520
 inventiveness 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.999
 then interpreted 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:39.889
 and when it comes to a conflict 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.009
 between what love tells us 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.409
 and whoever what the Catholic or Protestant church may say to us 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.569
 then we should not answer the words of the apostle Peter he said 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:52.639
 we have to go there 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.779
 obey more 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.520
 as the human 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.490
 thank you for bringing attention to January 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.569
 for the shipment 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:00.509
 put on guard
