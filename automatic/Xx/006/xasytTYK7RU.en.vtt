00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.130 
but one thing you have to keep in mind
when<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.700> do<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.850> quick<00:02:23.390> marinade<00:02:23.630> like<00:02:23.959> this

when you do a quick marinade like this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.930 
when you do a quick marinade like this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
we've got oil in there we've got water

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.640 
we've got oil in there we've got water
and<00:02:26.120> we've<00:02:26.360> got<00:02:26.510> all<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.959> other<00:02:27.079> spices<00:02:27.410> you

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
have to continually like every few

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.090 
have to continually like every few
minutes<00:02:29.930> turn<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.530> cuz<00:02:30.680> we're<00:02:30.829> only<00:02:30.920> putting

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
minutes turn it cuz we're only putting

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.490 
minutes turn it cuz we're only putting
it<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.430> for<00:02:31.609> like<00:02:31.730> 20<00:02:32.090> minutes<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.500> because

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
it in for like 20 minutes so because

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.259 
it in for like 20 minutes so because
that<00:02:33.530> water<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.519> oil<00:02:34.549> separates

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
that water and the oil separates

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.420 
that water and the oil separates
constantly<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.290> can<00:02:36.739> just<00:02:36.890> push<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.190> up
