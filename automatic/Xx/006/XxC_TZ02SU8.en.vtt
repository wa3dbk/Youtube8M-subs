feel<00:01:55.969> that<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.479> was<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> worst<00:01:56.840> part<00:01:57.229> of<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
feel that that was the worst part of the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:05.060 
feel that that was the worst part of the
stage

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.210 

my<00:02:05.700> skin<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.630> start<00:02:06.900> peeling<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.830> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
my skin would start peeling like a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.410 
my skin would start peeling like a
sunburn<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.470> my<00:02:10.580> skin<00:02:11.580> would<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.820> two-toned

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
sunburn and my skin would be two-toned

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.050 
sunburn and my skin would be two-toned
when<00:02:13.290> one<00:02:13.680> part<00:02:13.950> would<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.190> dark<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
when one part would be dark and the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.270 
when one part would be dark and the
other<00:02:15.090> part<00:02:15.540> would<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.050> light<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
other part would be so light like a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.140 
other part would be so light like a
vitiligo<00:02:18.240> white<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:20.130> think<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.030> was

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
vitiligo white and then I think that was

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.990 
vitiligo white and then I think that was
the<00:02:21.300> worst<00:02:21.420> part<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:23.400> don't<00:02:23.640> know

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
the worst part for you and I don't know

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.550 
the worst part for you and I don't know
it<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.480> was<00:02:25.110> not<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.680> good<00:02:26.490> sight<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.820> see

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.440 

as<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.770> can<00:02:33.920> see<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.490> disease<00:02:34.790> lasted<00:02:35.360> in

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
as you can see the disease lasted in

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.080 
as you can see the disease lasted in
cycles<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.960> 14<00:02:36.380> days<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.860> they<00:02:37.760> had<00:02:37.910> three

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
cycles of 14 days and they had three

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.010 
cycles of 14 days and they had three
phases<00:02:38.600> within<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.990> 14<00:02:39.380> days<00:02:39.560> at<00:02:40.220> which<00:02:40.430> point

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
phases within the 14 days at which point

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.750 
phases within the 14 days at which point
this<00:02:42.020> cycle<00:02:42.380> would<00:02:42.440> start<00:02:42.500> again<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
this cycle would start again the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.370 
this cycle would start again the
scariest<00:02:44.300> thing<00:02:44.540> for<00:02:44.570> me<00:02:44.840> as<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.960> mom<00:02:45.200> when<00:02:45.350> I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
scariest thing for me as a mom when I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.840 
scariest thing for me as a mom when I
watched<00:02:45.650> junior<00:02:45.980> suffered<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.490> effects<00:02:46.760> of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
watched junior suffered the effects of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.030 
watched junior suffered the effects of
this<00:02:47.000> disease<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.990> at<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.350> end<00:02:48.530> when<00:02:49.010> I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
this disease is at the end when I

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.440 
this disease is at the end when I
thought<00:02:49.280> she<00:02:49.490> would<00:02:49.610> have<00:02:49.760> brand-new<00:02:50.180> skin

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
thought she would have brand-new skin

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.210 
thought she would have brand-new skin
