00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:13.300
 Good girls, welcome to my channel once again today we are going to do 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.360
 a tutorial, well this makeup you already know that I am passionate about the characters of Johnny Depp 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.730
 and this is 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.929
 Wolf of Into the Woods, is a makeup very easy to do, just take a couple of 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.230
 Accents on the face and the effect of mustache and eyebrows 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.140
 and these claws I have also done, I've done a tutorial for 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.630
 how to make these claws and how to put them and look like a werewolf and all this and I'll upload it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.970
 also very soon 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.850
 the special effects you already know as they are always added that give a total effect 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.920
 to makeup, it's very easy to make this character from The Wolf of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.500
 Into the Woods by Johnny Depp, so if you want to see how we do 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.680
 hair back, 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.140
 no hair forwards, no but for behind 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.060
 let's start the makeup by applying the base, I will apply a base that is more clarita 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.860
 of my skin tone because I want that finish, like that pale skin effect that this 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.910
 character of Johnny Depp in Into the Woods, is a wolf 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.500
 and I want the contrast to be much more marked so the first thing I'm going to do 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 apply the base and then seal it with a powder 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.539
 I'm not going to seal the base too much, I just do it because I want to apply a shadow after 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.100
 again the hair forwards 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 and the hair back 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.009
 but I want to seal it because I want to apply this shadow 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.240
 which is like greenish gray and goes great to create the effects of shadow and gestures 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.619
 what are we going to create in the face 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.130
 let's start first by marking the area well 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.460
 under the cheekbones and we're going to extend it to more or less 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.130
 As if it were we would mark well 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.339
 the jaw area, creating a line 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.129
 vertical that goes from the end of the area 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.889
 from below the cheekbones down towards 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:20.029
 the chin and we blend well, we will start to also create the wrinkle effect 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:22.999
 under the eyes, so the eyelet that we're going to create is not going to be 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.459
 directly the entire dark area but we are going to create rather an effect like 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.869
 bags and also little more intensity in the lacrimal area and everything applying it 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.800
 slightly this shadow and blurring 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:03:00.539
 I'm also going to slightly outline the nose above all wearing a line 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.439
 that is going to connect with 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.379
 eyebrows that we are going to create 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.059
 later on and we're also going to add a touch of intensity to the tip of the nose 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.640
 the next step is to start creating some of the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.889
 wrinkles 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.129
 we are going to mark the eyebrows and also some line 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.640
 from the forehead area 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 and the chin 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.189
 we're also going to harden the jaw line and a little bit the lines 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.419
 of the neck and use the same brush that we used for the base to simply 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.290
 blur 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.460
 and integrate everything and that is much more integrated in the face 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.450
 although it has to be marked, do not worry about that, with a black kohl let's delineate the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.790
 inner water line and we're also going to mark the part over the line of 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.520
 the tabs also top and we will blur everything and once we have it 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.949
 let's seal it lightly with a black shadow 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.349
 takes all this semi smoked 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.319
 makes the tear line, the inner area of ​​the eye and mark 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.300
 well this area of ​​the lacrimal 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.520
 do not complicate too much, it does not have to be too perfect this whole area 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.240
 it's just that, intensity 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.979
 and if you want you can give a few touches a little more intense with the pencil highlighting 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.110
 in some areas to be more intense at random and with a touch of a shadow 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.590
 neutral brown let's lightly apply 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.819
 a bit of intensity in the external area of ​​the mobile eyelid or banana 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.190
 and we're going to take an eyeliner and we're going to start our eyebrows, what I'm going to do is 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.099
 base ourselves 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.009
 at our 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.440
 the front part, the base that is going to be a little lower, more coming 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.900
 almost at the level of the lacrimal and we will start first creating a base and we will carry 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.970
 this eyebrow with a rise to the top 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.000
 with the rise in the top 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.730
 normally this eyebrow in the film takes volume, it takes hair stuck 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.150
 but I wanted to recreate it simply with paint to make it much easier 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.920
 and we are going to give small lines to create the effects of hair 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.490
 in a way a little more in a big way and with the eyebrow pencil what we are going to create is the filling 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.570
 and we are going to create a zone a little bit more credible and this is optional 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.050
 but I think it gives a very cool effect and is brushing the whole area with a mask that does not have too much 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.090
 amount of product that is half dry to create an effect like 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.000
 more finite hairline 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.080
 we are going to take the same eyeliner that we have used for the eyebrows and we are going to start creating our mustache 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.289
 takes a kind of rise in the area more 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.399
 near the tip of the nose, apart from that it also carries a space between 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.560
 two parts of the mustache 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.120
 and it takes a kind of rise and then a descent and then there 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.779
 we're just going to create some lines that carry 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.039
 a little bit of a rise another a drop, a little bit 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.749
 as well as different types of shapes with S with rises 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.029
 with drops, some cross each others 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:12.249
 overlap to create this whiskers effect and now at the tip 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.080
 final 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.540
 of each one of the whiskers we are going to give a touch in soft but before we are going to give 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.300
 this knob of knob 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.229
 that is flatter on the top and more on tiptoe at the bottom and now is when we give 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.979
 the white touches that in this case I will use a 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.879
 cream color, some colors in cream to give this effect, only on the little tips 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.479
 and as a final touch we are going to give 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.099
 a little shadow using the shadow we used for all the shadows 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:36.819
 of the face, and slightly below some 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.500
 of the mustache hairs to create this effect as volume 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:01.430
 now that we have this shadow on hand we will give a little bit of intensity also in between the mustache 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.749
 the lateral parts of the nose, of the lips and on the chin 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:09.110
 and also over the eyebrows to create a little more shadow 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.439
 and since I did not want to put on a wig, what I did was to fold my hair 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.590
 simply 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.570
 creates a hair effect a little shorter but at the same time a little weird 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.559
 because it leaves the tips so loose 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:24.239
 a blue shirt, our tie, a black jacket, the hat I added 

00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:28.519
 very cool ears, and some claws that next week I will show you 

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.879
 how to do them and that's it! 

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:31.400
