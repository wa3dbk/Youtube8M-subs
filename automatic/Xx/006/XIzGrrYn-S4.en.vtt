00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
prevailing circumstances now let us

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.000 
prevailing circumstances now let us
first<00:00:34.860> understand<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:36.469> hydrostatic<00:00:37.469> draft

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
first understand about hydrostatic draft

first understand about hydrostatic draft
well<00:00:38.730> draft<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.780> center<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.320> flotation<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
well draft at the center of flotation is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.680 
well draft at the center of flotation is
called<00:00:41.629> hydrostatic<00:00:42.860> draft<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:48.120> center<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
called hydrostatic draft the center of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
called hydrostatic draft the center of
flotation<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> point<00:00:49.829> about<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
flotation is the point about which the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.840 
flotation is the point about which the
ship<00:00:51.239> trims<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> vessel

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
ship trims so here this is the vessel

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.990 
ship trims so here this is the vessel
and<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> point<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:59.070> about<00:00:59.730> which

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and this is the point here about which

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
and this is the point here about which
the<00:01:00.210> vessel<00:01:00.390> trims<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.829> say<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the vessel trims so we can say the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.450 
the vessel trims so we can say the
vessel<00:01:02.879> trims<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:03.960> point

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.609 

so<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> hydrostatic<00:01:09.240> draft<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.960> draft<00:01:10.350> at

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so the hydrostatic draft is the draft at

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.640 
so the hydrostatic draft is the draft at
center<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.490> flotation<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.409> very

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
center of flotation and this is very

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380 
center of flotation and this is very
very<00:01:13.770> important<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
very important because all the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.840 
very important because all the
hydrostatic<00:01:16.080> particulars<00:01:16.580> like<00:01:17.580> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the point where the ship trims so if the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.990 
the point where the ship trims so if the
vessel<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.220> even<00:02:08.459> keel<00:02:08.729> trim<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.750> 0<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
vessel is that even keel trim is 0 and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.240 
vessel is that even keel trim is 0 and
the<00:02:12.000> draft<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.840> high

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
the draft is the high

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.510 
the draft is the high
static<00:02:13.640> draft<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.380> case<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.650> even-keel<00:02:16.310> it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
static draft so in case of even-keel it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.540 
static draft so in case of even-keel it
is<00:02:16.670> pretty<00:02:16.940> easy<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.300> find<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.170> initial

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
is pretty easy to find the initial

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.410 
is pretty easy to find the initial
hydrostatic<00:02:19.550> draft<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:21.730> from<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> table<00:02:23.240> we

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
hydrostatic draft and from the table we

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.990 
hydrostatic draft and from the table we
can<00:02:23.450> also<00:02:23.780> find<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.290> initial<00:02:24.940> displacement

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.500 

if<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.270> look<00:02:29.420> at<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:29.750> table<00:02:30.020> here<00:02:30.740> suppose

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
if we look at this table here suppose

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.150 
if we look at this table here suppose
draft<00:02:32.510> was<00:02:32.750> three<00:02:33.020> meter<00:02:33.230> we<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.620> find<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
draft was three meter we can find the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.460 
draft was three meter we can find the
displacement<00:02:34.400> as<00:02:34.940> five<00:02:35.480> four<00:02:35.810> seven<00:02:36.260> eight

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
displacement as five four seven eight

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.600 
displacement as five four seven eight
done<00:02:38.470> similarly<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.800> have<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.250> initial

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
done similarly if I have the initial

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.690 
done similarly if I have the initial
hydrostatic<00:02:41.270> draft<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.680> can<00:02:43.010> easily<00:02:43.430> find

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
hydrostatic draft so I can easily find

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.330 
hydrostatic draft so I can easily find
the<00:02:43.910> initial<00:02:45.010> displacement<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:47.920> if<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.070> have

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the initial displacement now if I have

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.130 
the initial displacement now if I have
some<00:02:49.580> cargo<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.240> load<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.630> cargo<00:02:50.870> like

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
some cargo and I load the cargo like

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.370 
some cargo and I load the cargo like
this<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.950> ship<00:02:52.190> goes<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.990> have

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
this the ship goes like this so I have

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.810 
this the ship goes like this so I have
final<00:02:54.950> hydrostatic<00:02:55.850> draft<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:57.459> similarly<00:02:58.459> I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
final hydrostatic draft and similarly I

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.560 
final hydrostatic draft and similarly I
can<00:02:58.880> find<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.420> final<00:02:59.950> displacement<00:03:01.510> all<00:03:02.510> I

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
can find the final displacement all I

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.370 
can find the final displacement all I
know<00:03:02.990> now<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:04.760> if<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.630> have<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.050> initial

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
know now that if I have the initial

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.340 
know now that if I have the initial
displacement<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:08.000> add<00:03:08.420> something<00:03:09.080> which

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
displacement and I add something which

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.160 
displacement and I add something which
is<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.530> cargo<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.040> have<00:03:10.280> loaded<00:03:10.490> or<00:03:11.170> subtract

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
is the cargo I have loaded or subtract

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.670 
is the cargo I have loaded or subtract
if<00:03:12.470> any<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.550> have<00:03:14.000> consumption<00:03:14.780> or<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.990> add

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
if any I have consumption or I add

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.070 
if any I have consumption or I add
something<00:03:16.070> like<00:03:16.400> if<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:17.060> loaded<00:03:17.360> some<00:03:17.660> ballast

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
something like if I loaded some ballast

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.690 
something like if I loaded some ballast
also<00:03:18.470> or<00:03:18.790> loaded<00:03:19.790> some<00:03:20.500> bunkers<00:03:21.500> also<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.130> have

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
also or loaded some bunkers also I have

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.390 
also or loaded some bunkers also I have
the<00:03:22.880> final<00:03:23.330> displacement<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:25.040> equation

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
the final displacement and this equation

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.180 
the final displacement and this equation
is<00:03:25.670> very<00:03:25.940> very<00:03:26.209> useful<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.900> can<00:03:27.440> easily<00:03:27.739> find

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
is very very useful I can easily find

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.090 
is very very useful I can easily find
the<00:03:28.760> quantity<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.540> cargo<00:03:30.019> loaded<00:03:30.380> with<00:03:30.950> this

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
the quantity of cargo loaded with this

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.920 
the quantity of cargo loaded with this
equation<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.360> basic<00:03:32.750> principle

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
equation and that is the basic principle

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.650 
equation and that is the basic principle
of<00:03:33.580> jobs<00:03:34.580> away<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:39.080> our<00:03:39.350> objective<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.730> find

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
of jobs away so our objective is to find

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.210 
of jobs away so our objective is to find
the<00:03:41.900> hydrostatic<00:03:42.709> draft<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:44.799> we<00:03:45.799> need<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
the hydrostatic draft well we need to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.539 
the hydrostatic draft well we need to
read<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.489> draft<00:03:46.760> from<00:03:47.750> all<00:03:47.989> six<00:03:48.709> positions

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
read the draft from all six positions

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.570 
read the draft from all six positions
that<00:03:50.060> means<00:03:50.420> on<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:51.140> forward<00:03:51.440> port<00:03:52.040> side<00:03:52.280> and

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
that means on the forward port side and

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.210 
that means on the forward port side and
starboard<00:03:53.180> side<00:03:53.390> midship<00:03:54.350> port<00:03:54.709> side<00:03:54.980> and

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
starboard side midship port side and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.509 
starboard side midship port side and
starboard<00:03:55.700> side<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.269> aft<00:03:56.930> also<00:03:57.590> port<00:03:58.250> side

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
starboard side and aft also port side

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.150 
starboard side and aft also port side
and<00:03:58.760> starboard<00:03:59.209> side<00:03:59.420> the<00:04:00.110> drafts<00:04:00.590> are<00:04:00.709> read

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
and starboard side the drafts are read

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.539 
and starboard side the drafts are read
to<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.030> nearest<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.630> centimeter<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:03.650> is<00:04:03.860> that

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
to the nearest a centimeter that is that

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.780 
to the nearest a centimeter that is that
can<00:04:04.760> be<00:04:04.910> seen<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:06.019> these<00:04:06.670> drafts<00:04:07.670> are

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
can be seen so these drafts are

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.560 
can be seen so these drafts are
corrected<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.519> centerline<00:04:10.519> so<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.360> have

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
corrected to the centerline so if I have

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.390 
corrected to the centerline so if I have
the<00:04:11.690> port<00:04:11.959> side<00:04:12.170> draft<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:12.709> starboard<00:04:13.130> side

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
the port side draft and starboard side

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.050 
the port side draft and starboard side
draft<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.360> need<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.810> take<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.170> mean<00:04:15.440> of<00:04:15.470> that

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
draft so I need to take the mean of that

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.729 
draft so I need to take the mean of that
similarly<00:04:17.060> if<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.359> have<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.780> port<00:04:18.169> side<00:04:18.410> draft

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
similarly if I have the port side draft

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.789 
similarly if I have the port side draft
of<00:04:18.979> mid<00:04:19.220> ship<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.640> starboard<00:04:20.150> side<00:04:20.560> draft<00:04:21.560> of

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
of mid ship and starboard side draft of

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.380 
of mid ship and starboard side draft of
the<00:04:21.919> mid<00:04:22.070> ship<00:04:22.099> so<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.430> need<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.820> take<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.150> mean

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
the mid ship so I need to take the mean

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.960 
the mid ship so I need to take the mean
of<00:04:23.419> that<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.050> similarly<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.520> aft<00:04:25.789> draft

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
of that and similarly to the aft draft

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.150 
of that and similarly to the aft draft
so<00:04:27.270> basically<00:04:27.960> we<00:04:28.350> need<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.710> correct<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
so basically we need to correct the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.240 
so basically we need to correct the
observed<00:04:29.670> draft<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.900> center<00:04:31.410> line

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.720 

however<00:04:35.250> we<00:04:36.060> have<00:04:36.360> one<00:04:36.600> more<00:04:37.080> challenge<00:04:37.730> that

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
however we have one more challenge that

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.660 
however we have one more challenge that
draft<00:04:39.090> marks<00:04:39.480> are<00:04:39.630> not<00:04:39.660> exactly<00:04:40.650> located<00:04:41.160> at

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
draft marks are not exactly located at

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.330 
draft marks are not exactly located at

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
they are slightly displaced sideways so

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.740 
they are slightly displaced sideways so

midship marks are also not exactly at

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.070 
midship marks are also not exactly at
midship<00:05:22.470> so<00:05:23.130> we<00:05:23.430> need<00:05:23.670> to<00:05:23.880> apply<00:05:24.330> Corrections

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
midship so we need to apply Corrections

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.510 
midship so we need to apply Corrections
accordingly<00:05:27.230> so<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.470> first<00:05:28.740> correction<00:05:29.130> is

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
accordingly so the first correction is

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.700 
accordingly so the first correction is
called<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:30.000> stamp<00:05:30.420> correction<00:05:31.170> which<00:05:31.350> needs<00:05:31.620> to

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
called a stamp correction which needs to
