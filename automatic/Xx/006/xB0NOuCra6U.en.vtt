on a board like fixture similar to my
marine<00:02:46.220> line<00:02:46.370> fixture<00:02:46.849> I<00:02:47.000> think<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.739> Kessel

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
marine line fixture I think the Kessel

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.199 
marine line fixture I think the Kessel
has<00:02:48.890> something<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.549> good<00:02:49.730> going<00:02:49.909> for

so<00:03:14.480> now<00:03:14.599> let's<00:03:14.840> remove<00:03:15.139> the<00:03:15.200> Amazon<00:03:15.709> Sun<00:03:15.980> and

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
so now let's remove the Amazon Sun and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.069 
so now let's remove the Amazon Sun and
replace<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.730> with<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.970> tuna<00:03:17.269> Sun<00:03:17.480> for<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
replace it with the tuna Sun for the

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.929 
replace it with the tuna Sun for the
purposes<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.530> this<00:03:18.739> video<00:03:19.069> I'll<00:03:19.340> be<00:03:19.459> using<00:03:19.639> the

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
purposes of this video I'll be using the

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.910 
purposes of this video I'll be using the
only<00:03:20.090> gooseneck<00:03:20.720> mount<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.079> have<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.709> show<00:03:21.859> you

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
only gooseneck mount I have to show you

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.250 
only gooseneck mount I have to show you
guys<00:03:22.129> how<00:03:22.189> the<00:03:22.459> LED<00:03:22.939> works<00:03:23.209> until<00:03:23.720> my<00:03:23.900> second

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
guys how the LED works until my second

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.170 
guys how the LED works until my second
one<00:03:24.349> arrives<00:03:24.650> next<00:03:24.980> week<00:03:25.129> now<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.909> we've<00:03:26.000> got

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
one arrives next week now that we've got

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.030 
one arrives next week now that we've got
the<00:03:26.299> LED<00:03:26.450> mounted<00:03:27.109> let's<00:03:27.290> take<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.500> look<00:03:27.769> at<00:03:27.920> the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
the LED mounted let's take a look at the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.890 
the LED mounted let's take a look at the
adjustments<00:03:28.579> we<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.849> make<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.389> color<00:03:29.599> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
adjustments we can make to the color and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.869 
adjustments we can make to the color and
intensity<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.010> light<00:03:31.189> now<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.459> turn<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
intensity of the light now to turn the

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.520 
intensity of the light now to turn the
light<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.480> intensity<00:03:32.959> adjustment<00:03:33.379> knob

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
light on the intensity adjustment knob

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.699 
light on the intensity adjustment knob
must<00:03:33.859> be<00:03:34.010> turned<00:03:34.280> slightly<00:03:34.780> there<00:03:35.780> we<00:03:35.900> go<00:03:36.049> so

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
must be turned slightly there we go so

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.559 
must be turned slightly there we go so
here's<00:03:37.099> how<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.459> looks<00:03:37.699> turned<00:03:38.030> all<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.480> way

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
here's how it looks turned all the way

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.900 
here's how it looks turned all the way
up

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.490 

and<00:03:44.170> then<00:03:45.170> all<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.380> way<00:03:45.500> down

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.470 

alright<00:03:51.280> now<00:03:51.400> let's<00:03:51.640> adjust<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.150> color

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
alright now let's adjust the color

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.450 
alright now let's adjust the color
intensity<00:03:52.930> here<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.770> is<00:03:53.890> turn<00:03:54.130> all<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.430> way

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
intensity here it is turn all the way

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.580 
intensity here it is turn all the way
down

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:13.080 

you

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.150 

and<00:04:13.180> then<00:04:13.900> all<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.170> way<00:04:14.260> up

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.069 

you

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.200 

I<00:04:22.139> would<00:04:22.860> say<00:04:23.069> it<00:04:23.280> has<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> pretty<00:04:23.789> good<00:04:23.879> range

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
I would say it has a pretty good range

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.330 
I would say it has a pretty good range
to<00:04:24.509> be<00:04:24.629> able<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.870> dial<00:04:25.259> in<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.770> perfect<00:04:25.800> color

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
to be able to dial in the perfect color

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.119 
to be able to dial in the perfect color
intensity<00:04:26.819> for<00:04:27.090> any<00:04:27.270> tank<00:04:27.659> however<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.889> does

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
intensity for any tank however it does

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.219 
intensity for any tank however it does
get<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> little<00:04:29.819> bluer<00:04:30.060> as<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.509> turn<00:04:30.719> it<00:04:30.750> up<00:04:31.020> I

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
get a little bluer as you turn it up I

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.200 
get a little bluer as you turn it up I
personally<00:04:32.009> like<00:04:32.219> the<00:04:32.370> orange<00:04:32.699> yellowish

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
personally like the orange yellowish

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.059 
personally like the orange yellowish
side<00:04:33.449> and<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.900> think<00:04:34.139> most<00:04:34.500> planet<00:04:34.889> tank

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
side and I think most planet tank

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.550 
side and I think most planet tank
obvious<00:04:35.430> will<00:04:35.610> as<00:04:35.759> well<00:04:35.969> the<00:04:36.659> bluer<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.319> tank

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
obvious will as well the bluer the tank

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.589 
obvious will as well the bluer the tank
looks<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.069> more<00:04:38.280> unattractive<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.180> seems<00:04:39.419> to

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
looks the more unattractive it seems to

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.990 
looks the more unattractive it seems to
me<00:04:39.750> but<00:04:40.110> maybe<00:04:40.770> some<00:04:41.069> of<00:04:41.159> you<00:04:41.310> like<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.819> blue

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
me but maybe some of you like the blue

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.909 
me but maybe some of you like the blue
setting<00:04:42.419> so<00:04:42.629> it'll<00:04:42.990> pretty<00:04:43.229> much<00:04:43.500> just<00:04:43.710> come

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
setting so it'll pretty much just come

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.490 
setting so it'll pretty much just come
down<00:04:44.129> to<00:04:44.159> personal<00:04:44.729> preference<00:04:45.150> now<00:04:45.930> as<00:04:46.229> far

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
down to personal preference now as far

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.649 
down to personal preference now as far
as<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.830> tunas<00:04:47.189> on<00:04:47.340> being<00:04:47.610> brighter<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.389> did

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
as the tunas on being brighter I did

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.839 
as the tunas on being brighter I did
notice<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.169> slight<00:04:49.500> difference<00:04:50.069> but<00:04:50.340> it's<00:04:50.610> not

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
notice a slight difference but it's not

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.850 
notice a slight difference but it's not
to<00:04:51.030> say<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.449> Amazon<00:04:51.900> Sun<00:04:52.199> wasn't<00:04:52.439> bright

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
to say the Amazon Sun wasn't bright

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.709 
to say the Amazon Sun wasn't bright
enough<00:04:52.889> both<00:04:53.639> fixtures<00:04:54.150> produce<00:04:54.539> an

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 
enough both fixtures produce an

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.240 
enough both fixtures produce an
incredible<00:04:55.020> amount<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.650> light<00:04:55.889> for<00:04:56.129> their

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
incredible amount of light for their

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.339 
incredible amount of light for their
size<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.849> I<00:04:56.909> think<00:04:57.180> anyone<00:04:57.569> would<00:04:57.930> be<00:04:58.110> happy

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
size and I think anyone would be happy

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.260 
size and I think anyone would be happy
with<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.860> brightness<00:04:59.250> emitted<00:04:59.669> by<00:04:59.789> either<00:05:00.060> of

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
with the brightness emitted by either of

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.839 
with the brightness emitted by either of
these<00:05:00.479> fixtures<00:05:00.840> but<00:05:01.710> yes<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.190> tuna<00:05:02.460> Sun<00:05:02.669> is

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
these fixtures but yes the tuna Sun is

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.939 
these fixtures but yes the tuna Sun is
brighter<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.449> most<00:05:04.110> definitely<00:05:04.319> will<00:05:04.800> be<00:05:04.830> a

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
brighter and most definitely will be a

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.740 
brighter and most definitely will be a
big<00:05:05.250> help<00:05:05.490> when<00:05:05.669> it<00:05:05.789> comes<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.180> growing<00:05:06.360> light

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
big help when it comes to growing light

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.869 
big help when it comes to growing light
hungry<00:05:07.139> plants<00:05:07.560> like<00:05:07.770> dwarf<00:05:08.069> hair<00:05:08.310> grassed<00:05:08.639> or

hungry plants like dwarf hair grassed or
baby<00:05:09.150> tears<00:05:09.479> pretty<00:05:09.990> much<00:05:10.169> any<00:05:10.409> foreground

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830

plant<00:05:11.069> along<00:05:11.370> those<00:05:11.580> lines<00:05:11.879> and<00:05:12.210> lastly<00:05:12.690> I

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
plant along those lines and lastly I

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.719 
plant along those lines and lastly I
wanted<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.199> do<00:05:13.409> something<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:13.949> didn't<00:05:14.370> do<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:14.610> my

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
wanted to do something I didn't do in my

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.939 
wanted to do something I didn't do in my
first<00:05:15.029> video<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.659> that<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.199> sound<00:05:16.620> test

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
first video and that is a sound test

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.309 
first video and that is a sound test
using<00:05:17.759> my<00:05:17.879> audio<00:05:18.210> recorder<00:05:18.389> let's<00:05:18.960> see<00:05:19.139> how

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
using my audio recorder let's see how

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:36.429 
using my audio recorder let's see how
loud<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.830> Amazon<00:05:20.250> Sun<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.669> first
