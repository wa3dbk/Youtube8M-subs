00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is I guess underperforming when it comes

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.970 
is I guess underperforming when it comes
to<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.719> having<00:00:51.960> these<00:00:52.320> planes<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
to actually having these planes in the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
to actually having these planes in the
area<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.820> something<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.449> really

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
area is this something that we really

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
area is this something that we really
need<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.170> ready<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> kinks

need and are ready for in the kinks

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.170 
need and are ready for in the kinks
there<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.820> at<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> certain

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
there you know I think at a certain

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.790 
there you know I think at a certain
level<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.870> something<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.410> many

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
level it's something that many

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.189 
level it's something that many
businesses<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.520> benefit<00:00:59.879> from<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.449> Kingston

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
businesses can benefit from and Kingston

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.189 
businesses can benefit from and Kingston
is<00:01:01.289> unique<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> sense<00:01:02.100> where<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.629> it's

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is unique in the sense where it's it's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.990 
is unique in the sense where it's it's
pretty<00:01:04.470> geographically<00:01:05.339> set<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> middle

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
pretty geographically set in the middle

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.679 
pretty geographically set in the middle
of<00:01:06.090> Montreal<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.780> Toronto<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> no

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
of Montreal in Toronto and there is no

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
of Montreal in Toronto and there is no
private<00:01:09.689> aviation<00:01:09.780> service<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.100> Kingston

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
private aviation service out of Kingston

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
private aviation service out of Kingston
so<00:01:12.299> kinks<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:12.990> businesses<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.590> stuck

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so kinks and businesses are stuck

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
so kinks and businesses are stuck
usually<00:01:14.790> chartering<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:15.540> Toronto<00:01:15.930> or

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
usually chartering from Toronto or

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
usually chartering from Toronto or
Montreal<00:01:16.130> which<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.520> necessarily<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
Montreal which is not necessarily a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.730 
Montreal which is not necessarily a
great<00:01:18.450> option<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.049> air<00:01:19.140> sprint<00:01:19.470> actually

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
great option and air sprint actually

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
great option and air sprint actually
provides<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.250> service<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.119> greater

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
provides a service that of greater

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.450 
provides a service that of greater
benefit<00:01:22.409> how<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> different<00:01:23.250> from

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
benefit how is it different from

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
benefit how is it different from
chartering<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:25.110> couple<00:01:25.590> reasons<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
chartering a couple reasons one of the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.359 
chartering a couple reasons one of the
main<00:01:26.490> reasons<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.829> something<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.130> called

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
main reasons is something that is called

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.249 
main reasons is something that is called
positioning<00:01:29.909> charges<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.420> deadhead<00:01:30.810> charges

positioning charges or deadhead charges

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
positioning charges or deadhead charges
so<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.250> charge<00:01:32.579> where<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.360> an
