00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:03:06.770 

it's<00:02:40.379> impossible<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.950> lock<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.519> unlock<00:03:05.780> so

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
it's impossible to lock and unlock so

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.630 
it's impossible to lock and unlock so
basically<00:03:07.110> what<00:03:07.230> we've<00:03:07.380> got<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.769> our<00:03:08.519> original

shot a series of game fans well-to-do
place<00:03:28.579> essentially<00:03:29.579> my<00:03:29.819> job<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:31.190> create

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
place essentially my job is to create

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.920 
place essentially my job is to create
the<00:03:32.640> transition<00:03:33.209> from<00:03:33.390> all<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.810> these

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the transition from all of these

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.069 
the transition from all of these
different<00:03:34.079> layers<00:03:34.640> using<00:03:35.660> positive<00:03:36.660> software

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
different layers using positive software

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.420 
different layers using positive software
called<00:03:37.260> nuke<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:39.739> basically<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.920> looks

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
called nuke and basically this looks

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.280 
called nuke and basically this looks
like<00:03:41.609> it's<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.090> tree<00:03:42.540> at<00:03:42.720> once<00:03:42.870> from<00:03:43.049> top<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
like it's a tree at once from top to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.530 
like it's a tree at once from top to
bottom<00:03:43.670> allows<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.030> build<00:03:45.180> all<00:03:45.450> the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
bottom allows you to build all the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:04:39.280 
bottom allows you to build all the
