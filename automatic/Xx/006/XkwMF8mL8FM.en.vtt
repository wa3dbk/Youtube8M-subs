00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
don't believe it we scored probably the

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.409 
don't believe it we scored probably the
second<00:04:53.919> best<00:04:54.039> goal<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.490> scored<00:04:54.789> on<00:04:54.909> FIFA<00:04:55.240> so

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
second best goal of scored on FIFA so

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.920 
second best goal of scored on FIFA so
far<00:04:56.520> penalty<00:04:57.520> in<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.789> last<00:04:58.120> minute<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.720> I

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
far penalty in the last minute and I

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.219

can't<00:04:59.289> even<00:04:59.770> score<00:05:00.159> that<00:05:00.490> so<00:05:01.450> hopefully<00:05:02.020> it

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
can't even score that so hopefully it

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.839 
can't even score that so hopefully it
says<00:05:02.830> there<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.099> we've<00:05:03.340> only<00:05:03.430> got<00:05:03.610> 10<00:05:03.820> points
