well and they're really putting some
distance<00:02:25.050> between<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.830> now<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.370> lead

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
distance between the now is that lead

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.390 
distance between the now is that lead
gets<00:02:26.940> even<00:02:27.360> bigger<00:02:27.600> well<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> what

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
gets even bigger well this is what
