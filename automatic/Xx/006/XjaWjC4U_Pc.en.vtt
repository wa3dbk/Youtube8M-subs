00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.069
 i to verify both the correct operation of the vehicle and 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.069
 break the engine directions controls the rpm 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:10.969
 in this case 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.739
 has two speeds 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.259
 to give short courses before to comfort them 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.490
 and the simple 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.540
 and the belgium team is working correctly the valve 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 today increases the vehicle's crpm 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.609
 or decrease them 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 can be said by gradually increasing 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.170
 sending pulses 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 simulating computer courses 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.720
 and in this way electronically by recalibrating the valve and 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.210
 how would we detect that there is a problem in the flat valve 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.470
 the singular the pulses here 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.680
 of the computer 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.320
 it would not respond correctly 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.460
 the engine would be at its mines rpm there would be variations this month 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.140
 if I sent him a pulse 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.790
 under the exquisite crpm is working well this way well 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.960
 and if I wanted to feel like it starts 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.920
 to raise the rpm 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 the valve is working in optimal conditions 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.420
 However 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.950
 at a certain time pusterla recommends remove the valve to give 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 a preventive maintenance 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.920
 If we can quote the valve and with this type of maintenance 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.030
 let's carry out that process 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.860
 we already have the valve she 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.300
 the car and we will proceed to give you services 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.160
 you can verify that it is carbonized 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.850
 and paul thek the lawyer showed very cool is not so efficient 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.910
 so we're going to proceed 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.900
 at this time to give them service 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.820
 let's see it by his side and so the other 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.820
 and we are going to take out 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.600
 the piston of the one has left since 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 and we are able to maintain it 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.249
 let's proceed to use them atinan ultrasound 11 22 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.949
 which we also use 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.779
 to give them injectors services 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.969
 and we are going to place the plunger 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
 we are not going to place noval an idea 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.259
 at a given moment it may be connected 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.539
 or we can disconnect them from place there is no problem 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.409
 we will suffer connected at this time 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.419
 and we are going to install
