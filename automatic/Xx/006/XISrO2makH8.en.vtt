00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
you know actual logic or intelligence so

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.830 
you know actual logic or intelligence so
the<00:01:47.250> location<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.180> emotion<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the location of this is that emotion and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.789 
the location of this is that emotion and
reason<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.509> easily<00:01:53.030> separated<00:01:54.030> as

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
reason are not as easily separated as

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.149 
reason are not as easily separated as
some<00:01:55.799> may<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
some may think and I think what this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.499 
some may think and I think what this
leads<00:01:59.430> us<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:01.409> conclude<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.850> guess<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
leads us to conclude I guess is that

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.560 
leads us to conclude I guess is that
well<00:02:04.140> something<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.439> objective<00:02:05.159> morality

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
well something like objective morality

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
well something like objective morality
is<00:02:06.570> simply<00:02:07.140> impossible<00:02:07.320> from<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.190> neurological

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
is simply impossible from a neurological

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.480 
is simply impossible from a neurological
