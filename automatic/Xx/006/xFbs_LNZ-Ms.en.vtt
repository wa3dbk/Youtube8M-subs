 alexander hello operates paul side 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.470
 newmans point.de in this offer explain 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.360
 I you dry my opinion too dry 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 how much dry it is okay chamber 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.889
 Dried fruits eat there are dangers 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.310
 There are advantages to dropbox in a nutshell 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.100
 I drunk what was totally noticed and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.150
 cranberries dried cranberries 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.910
 for example, like to max with these 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 dried date or apricot to yourself 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.820
 but just to dry plums also 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 very cool and rosina I also like 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.719
 it's just the thing you have to think 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.649
 All this dry fruit contains a lot 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 sugar and keeps you my very other 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.530
 videos sugar should maxime you about 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.890
 by maxim was about 80 to 100 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.149
 grams per day that keep an optimal 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 worth first comes from the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.570
 cancer research is therefore 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.289
 Diabetes research comes from mine 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.730
 own tests and comes from many 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.859
 books I've read lies 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 about 80 to 100 grams 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.320
 in other words, around 15 grams 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.830
 per kilogram of body weight 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 that means heavy athletic people 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 People can do a great bit more 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 cool kicked you must take because of that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.330
 you keep watch at dropbox more moderate 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.150
 Consumption because he is very fast with it 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.549
 sugar it is independent for the first time whether that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.770
 pointless galactose whether the fructose is 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.259
 or simply sugar multiple sugars 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.490
 sugar and starch is generally and otherwise 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.850
 at trox you have to stop a bit 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 take care not to take so much to you 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 but is still if you are very 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.079
 locally can sometimes be quite cool 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.670
 a few raisins purely whistled and one 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.770
 a bit drizzled 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.500
 you have some sugar in it again 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.780
 blood circulation or so as a supplement entirely 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.110
 Well 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.509
 In summary, dry fruit consumption very 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.180
 moderately take care so much 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.130
 it is much better, for example 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.439
 first market like eating fresh fruit 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.899
 Do you have much more of it than that? 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.479
 Driver substances in it is high 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.470
 water content in it 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.140
 Generally it is like that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.560
 Great if you have a lot of yours 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.390
 Water consumption per day due to hydrous 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.730
 food vegetables and fruits to yourself 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.380
 Take is a beast consuming water 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.510
 because he is the mineral for a 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.410
 bee and botanicals trainer father 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.470
 vegetable vegetables are super okay I do 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.050
 In a nutshell, I'm too much over dried fruit 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.120
 store because otherwise boring you know 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.860
 my point of view is missing okay but 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.640
 moderate consumption does not exaggerate it 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.200
 if you eat low carb in general 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.360
 no problem if you weight your head 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.900
 have no problem if he be thick who 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.890
 then lose weight wants to get away from it 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.620
 opel is too small 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.010
 and would rather eat fresh fruit 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.940
 as for fruit on the day as well as fruit 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.160
 he needs a cut 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.220
 I say it a handful of fruit a day 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.400
 Sun to the park Follow the hard day course 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.590
 great is healthy but fruit is not so much 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.269
 on the day and also the operation text in 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:21.120
 banana apple pears oranges every day 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:26.190
 Tangerines kg at the moment is the season 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.260
 for those hot artists from Vienna 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.100
 can leave so small red kÃ¤rnten 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.500
 we have again channel apple as 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.450
 channel from ultimately class as 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.910
 extremely much something more in it but 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.920
 about a small handful of fruit 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.310
 butter is completely sufficient 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.530
 Yes, by the very forecast three 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:53.400
 points with actually still on 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.799
 Fastest rebuilt and with cover 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 asfeld plants as because of fruits too 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.209
 fruit juices are very extreme have 50 because 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.620
 just normal sugar in it crazy 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.690
 artificially fed and also the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.950
 fructose and that's what you 're up to 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.980
 maybe from fruit juices 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.700
 unless you make the 56 ad fresh 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.220
 pressed fruit juices with feed materials 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.610
 plant substances as this one 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.980
 a bit with small missing in it 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.440
 okay I think ok but then too 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.940
 Moderate consumption because of the fruit juice 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.490
 often throws them too 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.970
 Fiber away the peel off or off 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.880
 like this 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.610
 in concrete terms, the shell needs it 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.040
 know the whole plan 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.170
 he cooks the shell these dyes the 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.970
 just work the sugar of the 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.690
 fructose slower into the blood 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.420
 submitted 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.030
 it is generally still wants to be like 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.700
 already next to those the daily maximum 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.440
 average dose of sugar per 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.110
 do not cross over with it 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.360
 just healthy long live that okay 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.210
 Everything is okay when the driver comes 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.350
 down otherwise channel subscribe 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.350
 it was actually dry fruit
