00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
target plan and we've tested that target

shooter in front of me is shooting and

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.730 
shooter in front of me is shooting and
we've<00:00:19.270> moved<00:00:19.540> in<00:00:19.720> closer<00:00:20.080> to<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.439> shooting

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
we've moved in closer to the shooting

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.670 
we've moved in closer to the shooting
station<00:00:21.130> we<00:00:22.090> want<00:00:22.300> to<00:00:22.360> continue<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.810> revise

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
station we want to continue to revise

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.340 
station we want to continue to revise
our<00:00:23.949> plan<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.580> test<00:00:24.820> our<00:00:25.000> plan<00:00:25.270> because<00:00:25.539> very

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
our plan and test our plan because very

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.170 
our plan and test our plan because very
often<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.100> targets<00:00:27.490> look<00:00:27.699> differently

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
often the targets look differently

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.320 
often the targets look differently
inside<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.350> box<00:00:29.590> than<00:00:30.100> they<00:00:30.310> do<00:00:30.369> outside<00:00:31.119> the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
inside the box than they do outside the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.360 
inside the box than they do outside the
box<00:00:31.510> so<00:00:32.349> we'll<00:00:32.500> continue<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.949> look<00:00:33.129> at<00:00:33.250> these

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
box so we'll continue to look at these

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.030 
box so we'll continue to look at these
targets<00:00:33.850> as<00:00:34.000> my<00:00:34.420> partner<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:35.019> shooting<00:00:35.920> his

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
targets as my partner is shooting his

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.440 
targets as my partner is shooting his
targets<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:38.550> feel<00:00:39.550> really<00:00:39.760> good<00:00:39.969> about<00:00:40.030> that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
targets I feel really good about that

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.569 
targets I feel really good about that
and<00:00:40.510> as<00:00:40.809> I'm<00:00:40.960> watching<00:00:41.230> these<00:00:41.649> pairs<00:00:42.070> come<00:00:42.430> out

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
and as I'm watching these pairs come out

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.970 
and as I'm watching these pairs come out
of<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.790> traps<00:00:43.059> I'm<00:00:43.300> continuing<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.260> implant

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
are doing as they come out of the traps

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.090 
to that break point of the left most
target<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:25.600> going<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:25.990> make<00:01:26.619> sure<00:01:26.650> that<00:01:26.860> I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
target I'm going to make sure that I

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.730 
target I'm going to make sure that I
again<00:01:27.970> reinforce<00:01:28.570> what<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.080> target<00:01:29.560> line

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
again reinforce what that target line

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.960 
again reinforce what that target line
looks<00:01:30.040> like<00:01:30.250> because<00:01:30.460> I<00:01:30.820> want<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.299> align<00:01:31.750> my

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
looks like because I want to align my

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.210 
looks like because I want to align my
barrel<00:01:33.970> as<00:01:34.150> if<00:01:34.630> again<00:01:35.229> as<00:01:35.350> if<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.650> laser<00:01:35.920> was

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
barrel as if again as if that laser was

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.429 
barrel as if again as if that laser was
going<00:01:36.490> through<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.790> bore<00:01:36.939> align<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:38.049> barrel

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
going through the bore align that barrel

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.960 
going through the bore align that barrel
with<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.590> target<00:01:38.950> line<00:01:39.040> all<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.460> way<00:01:39.490> through

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
with the target line all the way through

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.200 
with the target line all the way through
both<00:01:40.600> targets<00:01:41.200> always<00:01:42.100> having<00:01:42.400> that<00:01:42.520> laser<00:01:42.880> on

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
both targets always having that laser on

00:01:43.210 --> 00:02:03.300 
both targets always having that laser on
the<00:01:43.390> target<00:01:43.720> line<00:01:43.869> I'm<00:01:44.470> ready<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.920> shoot<00:01:50.670> PAH

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.080 

3:30<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.490> 4:30<00:02:06.039> I'm<00:02:07.039> imaging<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:07.729> targets

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
3:30 and 4:30 I'm imaging the targets

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.380 
3:30 and 4:30 I'm imaging the targets
again<00:02:10.330> I'm<00:02:11.330> aligning<00:02:11.870> my<00:02:11.989> barrel<00:02:13.360> with<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
again I'm aligning my barrel with the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.539 
again I'm aligning my barrel with the
target<00:02:14.750> line<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.049> first<00:02:15.260> target<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.739> I'm

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
target line of the first target and I'm

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.699 
target line of the first target and I'm
giving<00:02:17.209> myself<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.629> mental<00:02:18.080> cue<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.470> last

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
giving myself the mental cue the last

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.880 
giving myself the mental cue the last
thing<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.129> do<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.849> tell<00:02:20.000> myself<00:02:20.290> laser<00:02:21.290> focus

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
thing I do just tell myself laser focus

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:35.920 
thing I do just tell myself laser focus
3:30<00:02:22.760> 4:30<00:02:23.360> Oh<00:02:32.530> last<00:02:33.530> pair<00:02:34.450> if<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.660> get<00:02:35.810> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
3:30 4:30 Oh last pair if you get the

first two pairs this is typically the

most common pair to miss at least one of
the<00:02:41.510> targets<00:02:41.930> why<00:02:42.260> because<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.980> get<00:02:43.129> a<00:02:43.160> little

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
the targets why because you get a little
