not pitch forward on the floor that

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.560 
not pitch forward on the floor that
would<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.519> basement<00:00:30.060> obviously<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> do

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
would be a very basement obviously to do

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299 
would be a very basement obviously to do
this<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> wouldn't<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.529> kinetic<00:00:31.859> an<00:00:32.009> anchor

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
this but I wouldn't be kinetic an anchor

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:32.959 
this but I wouldn't be kinetic an anchor
into<00:00:32.520> him

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
into him

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.209 
into him
I<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.300> compress<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.960> five<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.829> compression

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
I think compress and five my compression

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.740 
I think compress and five my compression
is<00:00:35.430> directly<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.030> my<00:00:36.180> left<00:00:36.390> shoulders

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is directly to my left shoulders

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
is directly to my left shoulders
connecting<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> his<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.879> back<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.270> my

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
connecting to his and the back of my

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
connecting to his and the back of my
heel<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.260> way<00:00:43.379> fully<00:00:43.860> connected<00:00:44.340> by<00:00:44.430> count

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
heel that way fully connected by count

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.450 
heel that way fully connected by count
six<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.360> six<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> money<00:00:46.140> count<00:00:46.440> seven<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
six so six is the money count seven and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
six so six is the money count seven and
eight<00:00:47.760> okay<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> leaders<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.410> is

one<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:03.870> compressed<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.920> my

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
one and two I now compressed with my

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
back of my body in two or three and I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.500 
back of my body in two or three and I
connect<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.310> their<00:01:08.520> hands<00:01:08.670> forward<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.390> my

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
connect with their hands forward so my

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.980 
connect with their hands forward so my
body<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.140> expanded<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.780> dummy

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
body is now expanded I'm not the dummy

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
body is now expanded I'm not the dummy
but<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.920> hit<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.130> belly<00:01:14.460> button

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
but but I'm right hit the belly button

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.510 
but but I'm right hit the belly button
so<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.570> torque<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.040> truck<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
so I have torque I then use my truck to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.249 
so I have torque I then use my truck to
twist<00:01:17.790> around<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> true<00:01:18.780> body<00:01:18.990> Lee

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
twist around so it's a true body Lee

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.020 
twist around so it's a true body Lee
left<00:01:19.950> shoulder<00:01:20.280> connecting<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> her<00:01:20.820> left

shoulder and I personally like to put

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.039 
shoulder and I personally like to put
the<00:01:23.130> ball<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.460> my<00:01:23.549> foot<00:01:23.729> down<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.360> five

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the ball of my foot down here five

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
the ball of my foot down here five
because<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.710> gives<00:01:25.890> me<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> lot<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> pump<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
because that gives me a lot of pump to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
because that gives me a lot of pump to
push<00:01:27.090> off<00:01:27.330> an<00:01:27.570> anchor<00:01:27.869> quick<00:01:28.110> round<00:01:28.409> six

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
push off an anchor quick round six

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
push off an anchor quick round six
sometimes<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.240> motivating<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
sometimes this can be very motivating to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
sometimes this can be very motivating to
go<00:01:30.990> forward<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> step<00:01:31.890> forward<00:01:32.189> on

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
go forward you want to step forward on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.319 
go forward you want to step forward on
six<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> by<00:01:34.259> anchor<00:01:34.770> six<00:01:35.159> seven<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
six don't do it by anchor six seven and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
six don't do it by anchor six seven and
eight<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.680> width<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.130> slowly

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
eight and that's the width so slowly

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.030 
eight and that's the width so slowly
I'll<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:39.810> through<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.350> two

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
I'll do it all the way through one two

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.470
