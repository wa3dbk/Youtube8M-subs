00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:16.710
 hello I am in money henrich and me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.689
 I have a question for you 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.849
 want to travel with a ship 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.910
 that neither life vests nor 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:27.029
 Rescue boats on board has the truth 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.740
 it is already on this ship 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.210
 and you are already on the high seas 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.839
 Imagine they are up now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.420
 this trip on this ship and you 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.370
 also have the slight impact side 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.730
 the ship noticed that worried 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.219
 they go to the captain told them 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.770
 Do not worry 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.890
 we have already noticed this lag 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.820
 and who stuff the hour by hour 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.190
 with huge purses yes we have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 even a huge money press 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 board this ensures that our money 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.090
 never goes out 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.890
 and if no storm comes up 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.660
 then you will surely reach your destination 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.349
 if you have this video to the end 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.050
 then you will know why 

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:21.750
 87 of the Germans regularly give their money 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.020
 lose and how they are among the few 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.880
 lucky ones can count the regularly 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.830
 multiply your money, destroy city 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.910
 I make an example of a customer of mine 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.660
 has 1990 each in ten years 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:43.830
 Federal bonds invested and 1990 was 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.030
 He has 85,000 interest rates 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.149
 get in the year 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:56.819
 that was 354 euros for him from today 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.459
 At the time, around 700 mark 2000 were 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:05.160
 Interest rates fell to 5.5 percent 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:10.379
 that was 229 euros for him in the month of 2010 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.930
 at 3 5 percent interest he had 146 euros 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.680
 in the month 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.270
 2014 with a percent whole 41 euro in the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.850
 month 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.670
 That's a minus of 94 percent 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.830
 this is how you look like a retiree 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.440
 is a damn retiree 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.240
 can be 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:39.920
 but in 2014 he came to me and he has for 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:45.610
 his 50,000 euro received 5.5 percent 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:49.610
 that was 229 euros for him in 2015 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.270
 he gets 75 percent and he lies 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.390
 again at 312 euros in the month additional 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.390
 pension a small difference is true 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.740
 Now the big question is what they are 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:14.800
 Consequences for you which are able 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:17.510
 they would need 359 euros every month 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.490
 additional income additional pension 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.070
 to have 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.890
 they would not only need 50,000 euros 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.250
 would need one at a time 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.390
 percent interest 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.760
 500,000 euros it is realistic for 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.800
 some just do not 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.380
 Imagine they offered at home 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.070
 in her spouse and you will find one 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:48.260
 crate her grandfather has buried 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:51.890
 They open it and they find a box 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.170
 full of banknotes ten million marks 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.730
 two million 5 million 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.010
 the question is what can you do today 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.530
 still buy for it 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.180
 at most it is still one 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.140
 reminder right and now 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:16.720
 imagine they find one 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:22.480
 Crate of real gold and real silver 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:25.360
 what would this day be worth a fortune 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.970
 right and that's exactly it 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.880
 difference between transient 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.590
 paper and real imperishable 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.040
 that's the strategy like that 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.210
 most prosperous family churches 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.060
 university foundations since 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.470
 invest centuries and therefore 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:52.210
 about all war crises quake hurricanes 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.770
 to safeguard their ability to preserve and 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.050
 continuously multiply 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.000
 Remember what happened in 2008? 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.310
 is 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.630
 The crisis came so high and the 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.610
 The stock exchange went south, which has something 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.840
 made a tree against it 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.350
 he just kept growing that is 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.960
 has grown fatter and has grown 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.620
 has given investors strong profits 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.440
 bestows 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.990
 because a tree stays completely 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.870
 unimpressed no matter how high or how 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.030
 low interest rates are no matter what 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.330
 currencies we do not care which 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.180
 Government is just tuned as long as that 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:40.390
 Sun shines as long as there is rain and wind 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.220
 There is a tree that grows steadfastly yes 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.220
 and if you want to know her now 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.170
 Get your personal lifeboat 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.950
 and you can do it continuously 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.860
 multiply 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.960
 then just pick up the receiver 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.940
 Hand dial my number and call 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.430
 I give you an hour 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.690
 free the thousands of euros for you 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.850
 can be worth 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.300
 I look forward to her ingrid 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.300
 henrich
