together we talked about all the
components<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.500> go<00:03:22.560> into<00:03:22.650> Cordura<00:03:23.130> aft<00:03:23.549> that

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
components that go into Cordura aft that

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.430 
components that go into Cordura aft that
woven<00:03:24.030> Cordura<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:24.780> allows<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.320> get

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
woven Cordura that allows you to get

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.470 
woven Cordura that allows you to get
that<00:03:25.590> great<00:03:25.890> ventilation<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.910> super<00:03:27.329> high

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
that great ventilation that super high

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.330 
that great ventilation that super high
tensile<00:03:27.780> mesh<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.799> move<00:03:28.980> down<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
tensile mesh if we move down to the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.520 
tensile mesh if we move down to the
knees<00:03:29.519> they're<00:03:29.730> gonna<00:03:29.820> be<00:03:30.000> 800<00:03:30.540> d<00:03:30.720> Cordura<00:03:31.230> on

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
knees they're gonna be 800 d Cordura on

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.050 
knees they're gonna be 800 d Cordura on
the<00:03:31.950> front<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.340> again<00:03:32.549> you're<00:03:32.700> getting<00:03:32.790> these

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
the front so again you're getting these

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.610 
the front so again you're getting these
areas<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.780> see<00:03:33.959> how<00:03:34.049> they<00:03:34.170> multi

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
areas and you see how they multi

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.229 
areas and you see how they multi
stitched<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.190> give<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.610> multiple<00:03:36.000> panels

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
stitched and give you multiple panels

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.539 
stitched and give you multiple panels
like<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:37.049> armadillo<00:03:37.560> protection

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
like that that armadillo protection

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.090

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
armor from Ruka it's Ruka d3o air so

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.920 
armor from Ruka it's Ruka d3o air so
again<00:04:04.590> super<00:04:05.130> beefy<00:04:05.370> super<00:04:05.880> thick<00:04:06.120> ergonomic

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
again super beefy super thick ergonomic

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.449 
again super beefy super thick ergonomic
great<00:04:07.170> coverage<00:04:07.560> there<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:07.890> gonna<00:04:08.010> vent<00:04:08.310> and

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
great coverage there it's gonna vent and

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.740 
great coverage there it's gonna vent and
if<00:04:08.730> we<00:04:08.820> come<00:04:09.000> down<00:04:09.030> here<00:04:09.180> gonna<00:04:09.480> see<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.690> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
if we come down here gonna see on the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.970 
if we come down here gonna see on the
backs<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.170> leg<00:04:10.350> you're<00:04:10.500> gonna<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.769> a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
backs of the leg you're gonna get a

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.890 
backs of the leg you're gonna get a
stretch<00:04:11.459> panel<00:04:11.850> so<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.299> allows<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.690> better

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
stretch panel so it allows for better

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.360 
stretch panel so it allows for better
range<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.320> motion<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.799> that's<00:04:14.070> gonna<00:04:14.250> be

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
range of motion and that's gonna be

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.250 
range of motion and that's gonna be
coupled<00:04:14.760> with<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:15.090> reflectivity<00:04:15.570> on<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
coupled with the reflectivity on the

coupled with the reflectivity on the
front<00:04:16.530> here<00:04:16.709> where<00:04:16.859> my<00:04:17.039> hand<00:04:17.340> is<00:04:17.459> you're<00:04:17.850> gonna

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
front here where my hand is you're gonna

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.670 
front here where my hand is you're gonna
know<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.479> your<00:04:18.630> area<00:04:18.810> where<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.140> access

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
know this is your area where you access

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.009 
know this is your area where you access

might<00:05:38.050> have<00:05:38.200> water<00:05:38.440> on<00:05:38.590> it<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.040> it's

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
might have water on it and it's

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.040 
might have water on it and it's
condensed<00:05:39.640> depending<00:05:40.360> on<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.630> temperature

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
condensed depending on the temperature

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.510 
condensed depending on the temperature
and<00:05:41.080> depending<00:05:41.500> on<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.620> membrane<00:05:42.040> you<00:05:42.220> might

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
and depending on the membrane you might

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.100 
and depending on the membrane you might
get<00:05:42.669> some<00:05:42.820> water<00:05:42.970> who<00:05:43.150> wants<00:05:43.390> to<00:05:43.450> go<00:05:43.570> back<00:05:43.750> in

this<00:05:44.560> eliminates<00:05:45.070> that<00:05:45.160> from<00:05:45.490> happening<00:05:45.820> by

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
this eliminates that from happening by

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.250 
this eliminates that from happening by
creating<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.390> little<00:05:46.510> bit<00:05:46.690> of<00:05:46.780> space<00:05:46.990> think

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
creating a little bit of space think

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.570 
creating a little bit of space think
about<00:05:47.440> like<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.590> pin<00:05:47.830> lock<00:05:47.979> for<00:05:48.220> your<00:05:48.280> button

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580
