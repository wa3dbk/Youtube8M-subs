 the 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.640
 if it has reached its goal 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640
 the unions find unloading along ach 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.689
 for the break to 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.909
 to put the dogs music in a box when we get there I think it is 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.740
 a two-way turn around goal balance and less beautiful is a timeless or promise 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.410
 has to be held 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.240
 stand up for a bit of an electro-tinted so that made it be cynical 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.960
 if its just a little bit my it would be the forest and nissan dealer it is one 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 open door 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.390

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.420
 Michael Jackson until we see a Bob Marley once in a while

 place with the cd of jesus that it was time for the swedish jonas beans 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.479
 under control 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.690
 to turn for the public and over then 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.699
 he same reaction 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.470
 the weaver an animal in advance to solve eo but that bid it is still 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:09.970
 unclear 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.970
 People also see that you are not in it all 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.270
 yes it's just me because people just want home that we like me 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.830
 run somewhere that top people live.de 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.130
 that people also see that working method and ours can only go ahead 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.940
 that I say something to the dragon but now do not experience the two substances to the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.560
 location where it has always been a challenge to bario 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.670
 making sure that people will struggle with it and that is the best part of it 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 all that challenge 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.100
 lately busy working outside in its own studio and space so really 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.190
 a 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.770
 creative processes one time the club doesn't succeed but one 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.930
 go-getter that ensures that you end up making something where you where 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.730
 where you stand as much as possible 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.710
 and the natural look most in veenendaal where i am working with beautiful 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.400
 in short, always make music 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.000
 that is always a pleasure to work with them 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.099
 the film 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.209
 no I am I am sure that country is still far from going 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.909
 it's something personal you know how to make music making music is nothing 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.030
 what an outing 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.099
 had your heart come so that your own feeling is in your skin at that moment 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.609
 and m the one time stupid people who add something are a part 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.620
 from just covering more we have the bid that more energy 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.620
 deliver the score at that time 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:46.609
 next and lebens trying out the plans for the new material and 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:47.819
 by watching on 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.119
 what helps to participate so I'm curious I have a lot to say now 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.119

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.159
 3 it was only intended for the educational network renewed mommy it is 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.099
 of course the rotterdammers 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.999
 the car turned out to be in the name of youtube which is something I know well in your head 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.479
 not only with his own videos but he has his gigs there 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.839
 can of course also find 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.709
 but I do want that as the club to find movies and find those or 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.709
 the Netherlands would or could not be beat 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.680
 in short, a close eye for second place
