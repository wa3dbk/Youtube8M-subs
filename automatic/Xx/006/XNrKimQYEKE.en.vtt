up<00:03:18.129> and<00:03:18.519> then<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.180> can<00:03:19.329> cut<00:03:19.480> them<00:03:19.599> into

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
up and then you can cut them into

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.220 
up and then you can cut them into
squares

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230
