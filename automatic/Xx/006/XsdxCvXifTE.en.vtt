00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.200
 it may be that its followers more because actually that I do not see 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.160
 a lot of luc game are the strains is huge taxing video game 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.400
 accessible to all this is very well drawn but it means at the level of 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.589
 the graphic quality of the man 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.389
 from two to three defeats in 7 not so ambitious the beach for the 

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:28.679
 bank at the visual level half of the jobs a lot of gambling 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.850
 passage as eto'o damage same in which the euro to 94 95 points 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.230
 if today a little bit my in Japanese have said that a way to the union 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 the sun is the obvious global reference 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.270
 there are also there are references to actually in fancy this affair 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.460
 with the bus system 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.729
 the myth 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.650
 the fight everywhere rejected in India 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.140
 2,200 a day 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.180
 there are references like that have a lot of things that 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.680
 to vote he knows the video game well it's a very friendly exercise 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.490
 very very friendly 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.770
 something that reminds me that comics a day I think to be very 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 accessible to everyone 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.390
 the public must not have played in the second act 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
 the video game 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.880
 moreover we can very quickly I mean that but according to can practically for 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280
 to unify his little character 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.750
 five ten minutes after he started playing the page all that time 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.520
 the installation as to know to see from tomorrow day we go we go for 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.290
 the entire afternoon 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.160
 finally died and then sold all the updates while others more 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.360
 still still alive day was spent on 50 megabytes 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.549
 it's easy enough 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.230
 we can connect from anywhere 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.259
 why parents they chose to develop in flash 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.400
 so people to worry about having a tool 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.840
 the advantage then sealed virtually anywhere but the launch in 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.420
 September 2004 they did 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.330
 the first free levels that we did by subscription I was not 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.950
 certainly 5 euros per month to see to see kraft from the start must register 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.020
 to buy the cd rome 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.320
 you have to pay your subscription at this is an investment they all gave the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.170
 party he leads ten same principles since a small free end to 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.929
 lend the player and then after a year 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.589
 basically going to checkout 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.849
 by doing they all took the 2go side doug side and 92 did a 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.150
 cardboard below this threshold of one of the first 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.679
 a review process 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.060
 which is a very risky system because it's 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 I mean to validate some time already in coma and this is 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.780
 not just on 27 and people would have liked to have him go 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.649
 what is the part that is free 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.929
 but in fact we launched in September 2004 went against 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.789
 treviso who was paying subscriptions 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.349
 I believe that nine months after the one at 450 miles subscribers it takes a big 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.599
 party who pays these days the shack that made install unions 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.939
 to draw it will be one for all all the products derived 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.939
 so the hand 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.629
 I already thought the graphic aspect is serious enough that it is extremely 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.169
 light it's so beautiful Swiss I think of him 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.519
 gold the balance since it's a lot more project there is disney classic the universe 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.549
 of world of warcraft 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.650
 to replace him extremely sophisticated visually the monster 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.569
 keystone the villages but that's something else and then maybe also that 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.689
 many nowadays 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.400
 bought he will go buy a license disarming listen extremely 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.169
 dear as we begin a wax statue 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.619
 - we could say that assisted blizzard that makes law 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.989
 seene assisted the video game which is the most he might not spent anymore 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.519
 difficult to bring 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.339
 the world of warcraft universe that more customers 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:34.760
 for us within five minutes 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.130
 for his new neighbor of israel
