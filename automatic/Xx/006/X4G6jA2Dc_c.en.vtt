five bedroom very nice houses a larger
square<00:00:34.170> footage<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.770> think<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> smallest

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
square footage I think the smallest

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
square footage I think the smallest
Woodbridge<00:00:36.120> property<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.960> probably

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
Woodbridge property is probably

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810

hundred<00:00:38.879> square<00:00:39.450> feet<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.649> maybe<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
hundred square feet and maybe the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.910 
hundred square feet and maybe the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
biggest is 26 27 or 28 so definitely

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680

date so taking a ride through one of the
Woodbridge<00:01:08.369> neighborhoods<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.360> they

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
Woodbridge neighborhoods I think they

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
Woodbridge neighborhoods I think they
had<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:09.720> four<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.200> five<00:01:10.350> different<00:01:10.619> models

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
had about four or five different models

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.990 
had about four or five different models
of<00:01:11.460> homes<00:01:11.670> over<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.270> Woodbridge

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.510 

nice<00:01:20.000> properties<00:01:20.570> generous<00:01:21.110> lot<00:01:21.409> sizes<00:01:22.100> with

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
nice properties generous lot sizes with

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.440 
nice properties generous lot sizes with
the<00:01:22.640> Woodbridge<00:01:23.000> homes<00:01:24.549> I'm<00:01:25.549> guessing<00:01:26.180> that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
the Woodbridge homes I'm guessing that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.109 
the Woodbridge homes I'm guessing that
the<00:01:27.409> minimum<00:01:27.950> lot<00:01:28.190> size<00:01:28.490> over<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.000> was

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
the minimum lot size over here was

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.660 
the minimum lot size over here was
probably<00:01:29.390> at<00:01:30.140> least<00:01:30.409> five<00:01:30.710> thousand<00:01:31.340> square

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
probably at least five thousand square

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.580 
probably at least five thousand square
feet<00:01:31.940> because<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.720> footprint<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.380> house

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
feet because the footprint for the house

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.130 
feet because the footprint for the house
is<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.100> large

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.000
