title I've given the emulator and I
start<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> up<00:00:26.599> you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.720> see<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.900> does<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.109> 360

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
start it up you can see it does the 360

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.759 
start it up you can see it does the 360
startup<00:00:29.310> screen<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.510> sort<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> squash

resolution<00:00:33.980> but<00:00:34.980> unfortunately<00:00:35.520> that's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
resolution but unfortunately that's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299 
resolution but unfortunately that's
about<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.180> far<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> gets<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
about as far as it gets because like I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.330 
about as far as it gets because like I
said<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:40.170> completed<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
said I it's just not completed now I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.709 
said I it's just not completed now I
know<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.480> people

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
know I'm going to get a lot of people

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540

calling<00:00:43.110> fake<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.950> tell<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.370> was

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
calling fake but you can tell that was

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.760 
calling fake but you can tell that was
real<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.629> pixels<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.320> just

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
real because the pixels are just

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.869 
real because the pixels are just
absolutely<00:00:47.340> genuine

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
absolutely genuine

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.510 
absolutely genuine
they<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.180> 100%<00:00:48.809> real<00:00:49.320> Pixies<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
they are 100% real Pixies now do you

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
they are 100% real Pixies now do you
have<00:00:50.579> any<00:00:50.850> idea<00:00:51.270> how<00:00:51.750> long<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.110> took<00:00:52.199> me<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
have any idea how long it took me to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740 
have any idea how long it took me to
catch<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.890> those<00:00:52.980> Pixies<00:00:53.489> I'm<00:00:53.699> no<00:00:54.149> math<00:00:54.449> nerd

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
catch all those Pixies I'm no math nerd

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
catch all those Pixies I'm no math nerd
but<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> DS<00:00:55.440> has<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> resolution<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.399> 256<00:00:56.969> by

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this magic number and the emulator will

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
this magic number and the emulator will
be<00:01:24.840> complete<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.439> deducted<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.430> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
