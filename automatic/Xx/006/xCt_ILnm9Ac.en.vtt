too<00:03:07.150> hard<00:03:07.329> about<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.780> area<00:03:08.230> for<00:03:08.650> it's<00:03:08.829> just

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
too hard about this area for it's just

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.819 
too hard about this area for it's just
an<00:03:09.280> introductory<00:03:09.730> area<00:03:10.560> there's<00:03:11.560> these

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
an introductory area there's these

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.349 
an introductory area there's these
hornet<00:03:12.670> helicopters<00:03:13.359> that<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.910> used<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.180> think

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
hornet helicopters that I used to think

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.720 
hornet helicopters that I used to think
we're<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:16.810> hard<00:03:17.079> when<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.440> play<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:18.640> original

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
we're so hard when I play the original

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.800 
we're so hard when I play the original
game<00:03:19.349> as<00:03:20.349> a<00:03:20.410> kid<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:22.480> they're<00:03:22.629> not<00:03:22.750> really

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
game as a kid but they're not really

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.559 
game as a kid but they're not really
that<00:03:23.170> hard<00:03:23.700> especially<00:03:24.700> in<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.269> remake

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
that hard especially in the remake

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.440 
that hard especially in the remake
because<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> lot<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.709> remakes<00:03:27.099> are<00:03:27.450> this

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
because like a lot of remakes are this

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.099 
because like a lot of remakes are this
is<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.690> bit<00:03:28.930> easier<00:03:29.109> than<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.650> original<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.930> it

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
is a bit easier than the original but it

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.720 
is a bit easier than the original but it
looks<00:03:32.379> a<00:03:32.500> lot<00:03:32.650> nicer<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:33.370> do<00:03:35.280> again<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.489> most

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
looks a lot nicer to do again like most

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.280 
looks a lot nicer to do again like most
remakes<00:03:37.150> didn't

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.960

most<00:04:43.970> Megaman<00:04:44.419> games<00:04:44.630> aren't<00:04:44.870> really<00:04:45.139> that

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
most Megaman games aren't really that

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.320 
most Megaman games aren't really that
long
