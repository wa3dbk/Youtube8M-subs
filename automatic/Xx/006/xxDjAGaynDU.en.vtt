 good fighting games people know and take out 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.840
 the bad usually pass by us and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 it happens of course because of their 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 poor quality drove your ideas for 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 Tops by the way, you can in the comments 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.869
 suggest the 10th place worst fights 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.480
 gets star wars masters of teras kasi 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.550
 this is a fighting game released ninety seventh 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
 year in it you can choose characters 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.719
 Star Wars maybe the game will not seem 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 cruel shit fans of star wars but 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.370
 usually to the players, it seems terribly bad 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 because she is not a little nice graphics 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 to the sheet of the combination of punches and the whole game 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.480
 it smells cheap and doesn't make 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.940
 you play no more than 5 minutes ninth 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.050
 place and released for sega genesis well 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.270
 or sega mega drive 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.010
 and also for arcade machines everything turned out 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.020
 it is ninety-sixth year small 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.559
 number of characters still could be 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.600
 survive 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.700
 Yes, and even the graphics were not good for 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.799
 time but quite acceptable but in general 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.929
 the impression this fighting left 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.630
 terrible in it just did not want to play 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.520
 maybe the arcade version was better but i 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 only played version for sega mega drive 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.659
 in the game in total 8 characters background and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.670
 were not very worked out 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.380
 but it was not the worst fighting game in 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.090
 he could play if you didn't 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.240
 there were no analogues at all 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.859
 8th place got a speech that is already 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.020
 was in the dinosaur games top 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.119
 fighting is not terrible after all 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.249
 the very realization that you are fighting 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.929
 huge dinosaurs that can eat 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.939
 people in the background delivers very 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.979
 I'm sorry I could not check out this game 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.529
 when she was still relevant for now 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.479
 judging her rather difficult version a little 

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:47.609
 since she came out on everything for nothing 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.649
 could quit you just look at 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.529
 Because this list is here and arcade 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.489
 machine and sony playstation and 3d and even 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.669
 sega saturn 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:59.459
 and the game boy himself 7th place to the sum of the ninja and 

00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:00.929
 atari jaguar and know that such shit 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.209
 you have not seen for a long time 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.270
 the graphics are so miserable and as far as 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.369
 was acceptable for 94 years does not save 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.200
 even a cooperative game but you have to 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 be good in this game 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.980
 there are not enough ordinary blows with something 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.319
 reminded 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.420
 Mortal Kombat clones under dandy although this 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.489
 the game is much better than the stake and 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.830
 the characters are not bad but in the end nothing 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.459
 it does not give much and only appears 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.230
 in the 10 worst fighting games on the pixel world 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.180
 sixth place got the game pit fighter 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.220
 this is a game about pumped jocks 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.319
 released in the ninetieth year movement 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.299
 blows were recorded by real actors but 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.280
 it did not save this disastrous project 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.360
 even the animation that was filmed from real 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.790
 the actors turned out really 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.769
 By the background, the background is 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.670
 a bunch of screaming men who work 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.920
 several frames 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.660
 strike fighters useless and stupid voice 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.450
 In general, this whole game is wild 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.940
 a cola piece mid awful top and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.799
 simpson suslin for playstation yes 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.690
 let's take the best animated series of those 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.190
 times and make him fighting about 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.379
 in the end came a terrible game 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.660
 for even the very idea of ​​this game is terrible as 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.760
 and she management uncomfortable fights not 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.540
 interesting and the graphics are not very good but 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.370
 can withstand 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.739
 think this is all the rest of the fans 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.840
 Nichrome like I did not even run 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.000
 emulator I recorded this game on disc 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.069
 and even thought to buy a disk but of course 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.370
 same did not do it but as fighting 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.260
 the game is terrible and it does not fix the fourth 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.650
 line top received street fighter for 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.930
 movie 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.000
 and there is not a film with Van Damme is 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.010
 really a game that is made like this 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.989
 terrible that degrades the whole line of games 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.030
 street fighter is expressed in the poor 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.400
 sprites blunt inscriptions and general 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.739
 the style of the game as it was necessary to swell 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.780
 to release a similar slag to release 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.970
 a game about a movie that was supposed to be 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.060
 film adaptation of games and my gosh what is this 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.609
 crap 3 bronze place balls and this 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.950
 pseudo 3d fighting game for two players left 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.049
 on three platforms megadrayve three da 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.849
 also on super snes and play it 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.099
 impossible you are on your screens now 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.870
 see quite a blurry video for 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.180
 better quality video is not easy to find 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.700
 managed the fighters are made up of balls fighting 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.620
 balls backdrops represent screens with 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.709
 some kind of crap oh my god here 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.930
 Boxer revenge takes second place 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.489
 I think each of you remembers this 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.980
 terrible game where very well 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.650
 used bbp and what does this game have 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.479
 terrible graphics bad gameplay poor 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.549
 the plot that the plot can not be called 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.010
 in the game, by the way, three modes and you can 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.599
 play every game only came out on 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.620
 Russian language and it will remain 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.630
 forever and ever 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.540
 hopefully we will never see the sequel and 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.330
 the worst of the worst is recognized step yufu 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.790
 you haven’t played on this yet 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.100
 Game poster we see a black man but 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.380
 you yourself see everything in this game even played 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.389
 and in Mr and this is really the worst 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.880
 fighting all tricks are very dumb 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.419
 characters are cardboard plot yes what's there 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.940
 plot 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.680
 backs shitty awful and panache 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.600
 the management is so poor 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.389
 that it is simply impossible to play normally 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.250
 on this moronic control and so 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.020
 ended another channel top 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.760
