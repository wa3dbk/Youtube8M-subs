00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.770 
being a little bit harsh in the crease I
don't<00:01:42.220> mind<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.430> little<00:01:42.580> bit<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.970> line<00:01:43.509> going

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
don't mind a little bit of a line going

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.660 
don't mind a little bit of a line going
on<00:01:44.020> but<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.530> do<00:01:44.649> like<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.250> make<00:01:45.280> sure<00:01:45.520> this

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
on but I do like to make sure this

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.010 
on but I do like to make sure this
really<00:01:46.060> blend<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.360> on<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.539> outer<00:01:46.659> corner

really blend it on the outer corner

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.330 
really blend it on the outer corner
because<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.619> will<00:01:47.740> just<00:01:47.860> make<00:01:48.009> everything

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
because it will just make everything

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.059 
because it will just make everything
look<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.060> seamless<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.810> smokey<00:01:50.380> then<00:01:50.830> dip<00:01:51.039> it

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.860 
not cracked or kind of dry so I always
put<00:04:17.500> vaseline<00:04:17.680> on<00:04:18.040> before<00:04:18.760> I<00:04:18.790> do<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.239> start<00:04:19.720> my

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
makeup so then hopefully when it comes

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.190 
makeup so then hopefully when it comes
to<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.489> lips<00:04:21.700> it's<00:04:21.850> all<00:04:22.030> been<00:04:22.300> absorbed<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
to the lips it's all been absorbed and

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.320 
to the lips it's all been absorbed and
only<00:04:23.950> apply<00:04:24.160> it<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.400> little<00:04:24.550> bit<00:04:24.729> by<00:04:24.910> little<00:04:24.940> bit

only apply it a little bit by little bit

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.120 
only apply it a little bit by little bit
I<00:04:25.389> always<00:04:25.570> think<00:04:25.960> think<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.350> cake<00:04:26.620> face<00:04:26.889> like

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
I always think think of cake face like

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.530 
I always think think of cake face like
you<00:04:27.490> don't<00:04:27.669> put<00:04:27.910> layers<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.300> layers<00:04:28.419> of

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
you don't put layers and layers of

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.969 
you don't put layers and layers of
foundation<00:04:29.050> on<00:04:29.110> at<00:04:29.260> once<00:04:29.530> because<00:04:29.830> that's

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
foundation on at once because that's

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.770 
foundation on at once because that's
when<00:04:30.160> you<00:04:30.280> start<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.610> look<00:04:30.700> cakey<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.720> the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
when you start to look cakey so it's the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.390 
when you start to look cakey so it's the
same<00:04:31.960> with<00:04:32.229> liquid<00:04:32.590> lipsticks<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.100> want<00:04:33.310> to

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
same with liquid lipsticks you want to

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.950 
same with liquid lipsticks you want to
apply<00:04:33.669> a<00:04:33.700> little<00:04:34.030> bit<00:04:34.150> by<00:04:34.330> little<00:04:34.360> bit<00:04:34.660> and

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
apply a little bit by little bit and

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.900 
apply a little bit by little bit and
then<00:04:35.200> only<00:04:35.560> apply<00:04:35.830> more<00:04:36.340> where<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.700> need<00:04:36.880> it

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
then only apply more where you need it

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.490 
then only apply more where you need it
and<00:04:37.180> that's<00:04:37.780> going<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.050> stop<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.350> from

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
and that's going to stop it from

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.650 
and that's going to stop it from
