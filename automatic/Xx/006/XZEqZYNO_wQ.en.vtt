for<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> counter<00:00:42.840> system<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.649> pretty<00:00:44.129> it's

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
for the counter system it's pretty it's

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.979 
for the counter system it's pretty it's
a<00:00:44.399> pretty<00:00:44.610> good<00:00:44.940> system<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.570> good<00:00:45.809> at

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
it I'm think you can use it as much as I
thought<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.469> actually<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
thought because you actually have to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
thought because you actually have to
time<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.170> every

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
broken for like 10 seconds so you can do

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.649 
broken for like 10 seconds so you can do
a<00:01:18.119> combo<00:01:18.570> into<00:01:19.729> ultimate<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:21.030> quickly<00:01:21.299> and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
guess it will just have to be you would

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.940 
guess it will just have to be you would
have<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.850> get<00:02:54.000> used<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> controls<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.620> how

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
have to get used to the controls to how

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.130 
have to get used to the controls to how
everything<00:02:56.370> works<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.570> new<00:02:57.750> style<00:02:57.989> of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
everything works and it's a new style of

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.990 
everything works and it's a new style of
fighting<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.310> learn

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
fighting you know you have to learn

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.449 
fighting you know you have to learn
everything<00:03:00.569> over<00:03:01.170> again<00:03:01.500> as<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.890> you're<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> new

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
everything over again as if you're a new

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.009 
everything over again as if you're a new
that<00:03:02.730> never<00:03:02.910> played<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> mountain<00:03:03.750> game<00:03:03.870> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
that never played the mountain game to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.229 
that never played the mountain game to
before<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:05.130> guess<00:03:05.340> that's<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> one<00:03:05.970> issue

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
before and I guess that's the one issue

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.570 
before and I guess that's the one issue
that<00:03:06.680> most<00:03:07.680> people<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.069> kind<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.400> coming

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
that most people are kind of coming

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.520 
that most people are kind of coming
across<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.060> they're<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:09.930> able<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.380> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
slumping deal it'll take some time

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.970 
slumping deal it'll take some time
though<00:03:21.329> it's<00:03:21.510> not<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.660> big<00:03:21.780> deal<00:03:21.810> now<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:22.890> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
though it's not a big deal now for the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.310 
though it's not a big deal now for the
drive<00:03:23.130> type<00:03:23.489> okay<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.299> drive<00:03:24.660> type<00:03:24.870> allows<00:03:25.140> you

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
drive type okay so drive type allows you

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.020 
drive type okay so drive type allows you
to<00:03:25.440> use<00:03:25.560> attacking<00:03:26.160> guard<00:03:26.370> i<00:03:26.519> believe<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
to use attacking guard i believe and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.539 
to use attacking guard i believe and
then<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.200> also<00:03:28.470> called<00:03:28.739> outer<00:03:29.130> drive

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
then this is also called outer drive

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.220 
then this is also called outer drive

dashes enough times he gets sent out of
the<00:03:46.109> game<00:03:46.380> for<00:03:46.799> us<00:03:46.920> more<00:03:47.609> like<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:47.970> short<00:03:48.269> period

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the game for us more like a short period

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.690 
the game for us more like a short period
of<00:03:48.660> time<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.829> on<00:03:49.950> generations<00:03:50.519> when

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
of time so can like on generations when

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.520 
of time so can like on generations when
you<00:03:50.940> were<00:03:51.060> doing<00:03:51.299> ultimate<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.290> balance

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you were doing ultimate and the balance

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.900 
you were doing ultimate and the balance
support<00:03:53.010> would<00:03:53.160> come<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.609> help<00:03:53.760> your

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
support would come in to help your

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.090 
support would come in to help your
opponent<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.480> he<00:03:54.959> couldn't<00:03:55.470> use<00:03:55.590> as<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> port

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
opponent and he couldn't use as a port

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.770 
opponent and he couldn't use as a port
for<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.370> 30<00:03:56.640> seconds<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.180> think<00:03:57.510> that's<00:03:57.660> what

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
for like 30 seconds I think that's what

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.440 
for like 30 seconds I think that's what
it<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:59.010> think<00:03:59.640> it's<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.820> yeah<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.299> think

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
it is I think it's that yeah I think

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.330 
it is I think it's that yeah I think
it's<00:04:00.690> like<00:04:00.810> about<00:04:01.019> 30<00:04:01.200> seconds<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:02.100> what

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
it's like about 30 seconds that's what

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.949 
it's like about 30 seconds that's what
happens<00:04:02.670> here<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:02.940> revolution<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.690> can't
