00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.710
 good afternoon today we will look at two 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.320
 clinical examples of patients with the syndrome 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.210
 semantic aphasia 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 semantic aphasia due to 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 focal lesion topic on the temporal 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 occipital regions of the left hemisphere 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.149
 etc. 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.790
 there was paralysis pareto and alice aks 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.969
 for example in a patient with a clinical 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.190
 picture of semantic aphasia observed 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.550
 all making operation is higher 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.690
 specified areas of the cerebral cortex 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.030
 according to computed tomography 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.920
 clinical led not this syndrome 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.710
 expressed in impressively in grammaticals 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.559
 that is the difficulty of all understanding logic 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 grammatical revolutions throughout it 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.460
 impudence 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.510
 namely employees of the union of parts 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.619
 subject matters as prostration as 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.840
 constructive around the hive 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:21.740
 consider the first clinical example 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:21.740
 sick and the right hand here is the right hand 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.650
 left foot where foot 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 draw a circle in the center of the sheet a circle above 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.340
 round square 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:02.850
 under the circle is a triangle to the right of the circle 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 zigzag 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:16.200
 on the left triangle center of the circle put 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.200
 a cloud 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.530
 thus, the patient is marked 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.020
 The following difficulties violation 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.410
 visual perception impairment 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.820
 visually spatial perception 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.730
 difficulty in performing counting 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.640
 operations difficulty anti 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.760
 time there are also difficulties in 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.100
 understanding not semantics of speech when 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.720
 intact the auditory speech bent and 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.890
 consider the patient's rehabilitation plan and 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.130
 it is necessary to work in this case 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.510
 following directions 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.330
 reconnects the word total 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.040
 objectively overcome 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.570
 impaired visual space and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.590
 perception restore body circuit 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.560
 restore the ability to understand 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.320
 math marks do available 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.989
 translation of an ace of text written 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.209
 vertical direction horizontal 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.090
 directions also 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.310
 recommended extra work on 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.150
 warning 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.830
 development is impressive in agrammatism 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.730
 let's go to the second clinical example 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.730
 sick and 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.599
 but 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.920
 as a result of a generalization of clinical 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.990
 symptoms of the patient and come to the conclusion that 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.390
 the presence of this patient is impressive 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.030
 vugar mother isma which is expressed 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.380
 following aspects 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.840
 difficulty understanding portable 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.030
 meaning of the word their difficulty when 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.700
 the establishment of a causal link 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.050
 events up harder for them when perceiving 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.080
 many and grammatical turns in 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.070
 In this case, rehabilitation should 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.020
 pass the next plan is necessary 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.050
 work on understanding the figurative 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.300
 meaning of the word restore opportunity 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.490
 definition of causation 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.320
 of events 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.690
 work on differentiation prompted 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.330
 used designs tackled 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.680
 logical and math problems 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.390
 explain such speech expressions 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.850
 interpret proverbs to pursue 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.520
 work on capturing logical and 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.190
 grammatical mistakes made in 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.290
 text 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.670
 today we reviewed two clinical 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:42.360
 examples of semantic aphasia and 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:46.290
 determination of the directions of their rehabilitation 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.290
 thank you for attention
