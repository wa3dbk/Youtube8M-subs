00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
hey guys this is the supermoto whoo and

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.280 
hey guys this is the supermoto whoo and
you<00:00:06.610> can<00:00:06.790> tell<00:00:07.000> from<00:00:07.360> the<00:00:07.540> title<00:00:07.569> of<00:00:08.109> this

video<00:00:08.770> I<00:00:09.309> got<00:00:10.030> my<00:00:10.299> pick<00:00:10.870> for<00:00:10.900> kit<00:00:11.380> installed<00:00:11.950> so

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
video I got my pick for kit installed so

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:21.060 
video I got my pick for kit installed so
I<00:00:12.490> am<00:00:12.730> now<00:00:12.910> riding<00:00:13.210> a<00:00:13.510> kale<00:00:14.790> x3<00:00:15.790> 30<00:00:16.090> not<00:00:16.450> a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.370 

to<00:00:21.699> give<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:21.940> my<00:00:22.090> first<00:00:22.449> impressions<00:00:23.020> of<00:00:23.170> the

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
to give you my first impressions of the

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.760 
to give you my first impressions of the
kit

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.700 

first<00:00:27.430> off

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
first off

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.400 

so<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.430> was<00:00:30.550> installed<00:00:30.940> with<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.480> jetting

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
so it was installed with the jetting

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.150 
so it was installed with the jetting
that<00:00:32.650> was<00:00:32.860> already<00:00:33.640> there<00:00:33.940> from<00:00:34.300> my<00:00:34.480> mozzie

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that was already there from my mozzie

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.910 
that was already there from my mozzie
foot<00:00:36.160> mozzie<00:00:36.490> exhaust<00:00:36.940> installed<00:00:37.900> and<00:00:38.710> it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
foot mozzie exhaust installed and it

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.590 
foot mozzie exhaust installed and it
seems<00:00:39.130> to<00:00:39.250> be<00:00:39.340> running<00:00:39.489> pretty<00:00:39.820> good<00:00:39.910> I<00:00:40.330> don't

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
seems to be running pretty good I don't

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.380 
seems to be running pretty good I don't
really<00:00:40.960> have<00:00:41.140> any<00:00:41.290> complaints<00:00:41.470> about<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:43.210> its

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
really have any complaints about how its

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.190 
really have any complaints about how its
running<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:45.550> definitely<00:00:46.030> does<00:00:46.239> idle<00:00:46.840> in<00:00:47.110> a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
running it definitely does idle in a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.790 
running it definitely does idle in a
more<00:00:47.410> bumpy<00:00:47.890> manner<00:00:48.129> than<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.610> stock<00:00:48.910> bike

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
more bumpy manner than the stock bike

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.799 
more bumpy manner than the stock bike
there<00:00:50.800> is<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.010> bit<00:00:51.309> more<00:00:51.489> vibration<00:00:52.120> at<00:00:52.449> idle

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
there is a bit more vibration at idle

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.440 
there is a bit more vibration at idle
you<00:00:52.900> can<00:00:53.050> feel<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.350> through<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.530> bars

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.660 

it<00:00:57.080> has<00:00:57.260> changed<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.980> sound<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.610> the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
it has changed the sound of the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.010 
it has changed the sound of the
motorcycle<00:00:59.390> it's<00:00:59.870> got<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.080> lower<00:01:01.480> hello<00:01:02.480> as

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
motorcycle it's got a lower hello as

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.600 
motorcycle it's got a lower hello as
opposed<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.770> higher<00:01:04.190> pitched<00:01:05.950> rasp<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.490> it

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
opposed to a higher pitched rasp that it

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.370 
opposed to a higher pitched rasp that it
had<00:01:07.790> as<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.030> 250<00:01:09.430> it<00:01:10.510> definitely<00:01:11.510> burbles<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.170> lot

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
had as a 250 it definitely burbles a lot

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.800 
had as a 250 it definitely burbles a lot
more<00:01:12.620> through<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.040> buzzy<00:01:13.340> exhaust<00:01:13.810> louder

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
more through the buzzy exhaust louder

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.420 
more through the buzzy exhaust louder
and<00:01:15.080> more<00:01:15.229> forcefully<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> guess<00:01:16.160> there's<00:01:16.370> a

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
and more forcefully I guess there's a

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.870 
and more forcefully I guess there's a
bigger<00:01:16.640> explosion<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.950> more<00:01:18.950> exhaust<00:01:19.310> has<00:01:19.640> to

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
bigger explosion so more exhaust has to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
bigger explosion so more exhaust has to
find<00:01:20.210> its<00:01:20.360> way<00:01:20.450> out

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.600 

in<00:01:25.950> terms<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.370> polls<00:01:26.750> in<00:01:27.750> terms<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.140> power<00:01:28.610> yeah

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
in terms of polls in terms of power yeah

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.860 
in terms of polls in terms of power yeah
there's<00:01:29.910> definitely<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.420> noticeable<00:01:31.170> increase

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
there's definitely a noticeable increase

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.340 
there's definitely a noticeable increase
especially<00:01:33.870> in<00:01:33.990> torque<00:01:34.260> down<00:01:34.440> low<00:01:35.900> because<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
especially in torque down low because it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.900 
especially in torque down low because it
is<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> brand<00:01:37.830> new<00:01:37.950> piston<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.430> cylinder<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
is a brand new piston and cylinder I

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.760 
is a brand new piston and cylinder I
haven't<00:01:39.480> been<00:01:39.630> exploring<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.320> upper<00:01:40.560> rep

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
haven't been exploring the upper rep

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.110 
haven't been exploring the upper rep
ranges<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.370> that<00:01:41.520> won't<00:01:41.700> happen<00:01:41.790> for

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
ranges and that won't happen for

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.700 
ranges and that won't happen for
hundreds<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.720> kilometers<00:01:43.229> really

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
hundreds of kilometers really

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.890 
hundreds of kilometers really
but<00:01:45.280> one<00:01:45.460> nice<00:01:45.700> thing<00:01:45.729> about<00:01:46.000> making<00:01:46.540> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
but one nice thing about making the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.719 
but one nice thing about making the
break-in<00:01:47.710> period<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:48.130> little<00:01:48.369> more<00:01:48.520> manageable

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
break-in period a little more manageable

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.969 
break-in period a little more manageable
and<00:01:49.270> tolerable<00:01:49.930> is<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.229> fact<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:50.560> there<00:01:50.830> is

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
and tolerable is the fact that there is

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.240 
and tolerable is the fact that there is
so<00:01:51.250> much<00:01:51.400> extra<00:01:51.810> grunt<00:01:52.810> down<00:01:53.020> low<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.710> know

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
so much extra grunt down low you know

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.810 
so much extra grunt down low you know
you<00:01:54.310> can<00:01:54.550> short<00:01:54.850> shift<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.360> still<00:01:55.570> get<00:01:55.750> decent

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you can short shift and still get decent

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.560 
you can short shift and still get decent
acceleration<00:01:59.100> in<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.369> meat<00:02:00.610> kind<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.270> middle

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
acceleration in the meat kind of middle

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.680 
acceleration in the meat kind of middle
of<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.780> power<00:02:01.990> Bend

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
of the power Bend

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.950 
of the power Bend
I<00:02:03.750> would<00:02:04.440> say<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.520> acceleration<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.510> just<00:02:06.780> on

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
I would say the acceleration is just on

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.820 
I would say the acceleration is just on
the<00:02:07.140> verge<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.590> being<00:02:07.800> eye-opening

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.740 

sorry<00:02:13.490> this<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.000> road<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.210> requires

so<00:02:43.920> yeah<00:02:44.129> I'm<00:02:44.340> definitely<00:02:44.549> happy<00:02:45.269> with<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
so yeah I'm definitely happy with the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.760 
so yeah I'm definitely happy with the
kit

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
kit

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.890 
kit
I'm<00:02:47.220> sure<00:02:47.430> I'll<00:02:47.550> be<00:02:47.580> even<00:02:47.940> more<00:02:48.090> happy<00:02:48.300> once<00:02:48.720> it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
I'm sure I'll be even more happy once it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.530 
I'm sure I'll be even more happy once it
gets<00:02:49.080> broken<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.100> explore<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
gets broken in and I can explore the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.820 
gets broken in and I can explore the
upper<00:02:51.840> revs<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.100 

complot<00:02:55.340> says<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.790> gets<00:02:56.030> broken<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.930> should

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
complot says it gets broken in it should

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.640 
complot says it gets broken in it should
even<00:02:57.380> give<00:02:57.500> me<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.650> little<00:02:57.830> more<00:02:58.010> power

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.699 

I<00:03:02.680> did<00:03:03.580> some<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:04.090> little<00:03:04.780> bit<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.019> passing<00:03:05.560> on

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
I did some a little bit of passing on

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.250 
I did some a little bit of passing on
the<00:03:05.830> highway<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.340> sixth<00:03:06.700> gear<00:03:06.879> so<00:03:07.599> at<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:07.900> 50

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
the highway in sixth gear so at like 50

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.630 
the highway in sixth gear so at like 50
60<00:03:08.470> miles<00:03:08.890> an<00:03:09.099> hour

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
60 miles an hour

roll on the throttle and sixth-year

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.660 
roll on the throttle and sixth-year
noticeable<00:03:13.180> improvement<00:03:13.810> over<00:03:14.459> when<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.549> was

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
noticeable improvement over when it was

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.440 
noticeable improvement over when it was
a<00:03:15.700> 250<00:03:17.040> big<00:03:18.040> improvement

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.930 

the<00:03:22.840> only<00:03:23.020> other<00:03:23.230> thing<00:03:23.560> now<00:03:23.770> I<00:03:23.800> need<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.400> find

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
the only other thing now I need to find

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.490 
the only other thing now I need to find
out<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:27.180> fuel<00:03:28.180> consumption<00:03:28.870> how<00:03:29.050> much<00:03:29.260> more

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
out is fuel consumption how much more

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.800 
out is fuel consumption how much more

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
range this bike has lost because most

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.140 
range this bike has lost because most

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
dual sport bikes like this have very

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.870 
dual sport bikes like this have very
small<00:03:35.800> fuel<00:03:36.070> tanks<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:38.280> mods<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.520> had<00:03:39.700> done

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
small fuel tanks and the mods I had done

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.540 
small fuel tanks and the mods I had done
before<00:03:40.330> which<00:03:40.660> were<00:03:40.930> full<00:03:41.590> exhaust<00:03:41.950> jet

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
before which were full exhaust jet

before which were full exhaust jet
snorkel<00:03:43.450> removal<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:45.250> took<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.910> hit<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.150> fuel

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
snorkel removal it took a hit in fuel

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.930 
snorkel removal it took a hit in fuel
economy<00:03:47.140> probably<00:03:47.950> took<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.340> good<00:03:48.930> 30<00:03:49.930> K<00:03:50.200> off

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
economy probably took a good 30 K off

economy probably took a good 30 K off
tank<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.090> gas<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:53.110> now<00:03:53.320> I've<00:03:53.530> increased<00:03:53.830> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
tank of gas and now I've increased the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.590 
tank of gas and now I've increased the
displacement<00:03:54.880> by<00:03:55.840> 80<00:03:56.050> cc's<00:03:57.270> so<00:03:58.270> I<00:03:58.300> should

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
displacement by 80 cc's so I should

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.950 
displacement by 80 cc's so I should
definitely<00:03:59.020> use<00:03:59.050> more<00:03:59.440> fuel

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.920 

hopefully<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:04.800> can<00:04:04.980> still<00:04:05.340> get<00:04:05.520> another<00:04:05.930> forget

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
hopefully I can still get another forget

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.390 
hopefully I can still get another forget

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
if it takes a huge hint and I may have

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.610 
if it takes a huge hint and I may have
to<00:04:13.280> invest<00:04:13.640> in<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:14.000> IMS<00:04:14.510> tank<00:04:14.930> for<00:04:15.260> this<00:04:15.349> bike

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
to invest in the IMS tank for this bike

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.969 
to invest in the IMS tank for this bike
which<00:04:15.830> I<00:04:15.950> wanted<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.340> anyways<00:04:17.500> may<00:04:18.500> happen

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
which I wanted to anyways may happen

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.810 
which I wanted to anyways may happen
when<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.160> recoup<00:04:19.669> some<00:04:20.000> dollars<00:04:21.550> expensive<00:04:22.550> kit

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
when I recoup some dollars expensive kit

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.409 
when I recoup some dollars expensive kit
and<00:04:23.919> since<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.040> got<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.250> dealer<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.820> install<00:04:26.240> it

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
and since I got a dealer to install it

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.920 
and since I got a dealer to install it
there<00:04:26.630> was<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.810> fairly<00:04:27.199> hefty<00:04:27.470> labor<00:04:27.860> charge

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
there was a fairly hefty labor charge

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.350 
there was a fairly hefty labor charge
but<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:29.990> think<00:04:30.169> it's<00:04:30.260> worth<00:04:30.470> it

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.020
