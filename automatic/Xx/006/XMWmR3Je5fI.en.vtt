00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 boom last days on emotions 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.430
 last days on the week of 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.839
 emotions on how not to be left 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.460
 overwhelm with emotions 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.830
 so this week we saw some stuff 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.940
 powerful enough to tell us 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.030
 what are our emotions for 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 understand to determine which and 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.970
 the emotion that we really feel is this 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.150
 that it's not something hidden 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.010
 behind we saw how to put the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.779
 things up how are you interested in 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.939
 our emotions how to trust 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.769
 our emotions because in the end our 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.420
 emotions are very interesting our 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.579
 emotions are something hyper 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.140
 powerful and hyper positive even the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.300
 negative emotions 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.790
 we saw that for really what to be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
 happy to have emotions 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.879
 negative I'm glad to have 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 negative emotions and I prefer 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.230
 even have negative emotions that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.910
 positive emotions 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.469
 it sounds weird but actually 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.510
 this is the case why because when I 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.610
 feel a negative emotion that's all 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440
 just a signal that tells me that there 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 I have a point to make life better 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 thing to do about myself and what 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.750
 does that in the end by force that I do it 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 damn I become someone from 2 who 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.810
 looks less and less like emotions 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.460
 negative and which especially much less 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.119
 frustrated you have to know that the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.010
 frustrations 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.600
 if you're frustrated at one point and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 by the way I made a video so on this 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.100
 paul pierre rosnay's challenge who's who 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.689
 there is a fairly simple challenge in fact this is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.939
 to pick up three frustrations a day 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.290
 so three negative points three 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.939
 negative emotions that you go into the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 day actually just find 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.500
 corrective action and what are you doing that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.260
 for a month and I did that during 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.940
 but it has totally hot 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.950
 completely made take off my life a 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.380
 higher level it was really enough 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.940
 of snow and as one knows me and the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.050
 emotions 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.220
 once you're going to do the exercise of 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.170
 this week I hope for you that you 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.460
 did it that will allow better of 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.020
 know how to know 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.970
 function to know in fact everything 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.979
 simply if it's your intellect that 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.020
 speak or if your heart is talking 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.910
 it's important to follow his 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 heart because it's your heart that knows 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.350
 exactly what is what you need 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.760
 for you who know exactly where you have to 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.710
 what are you going to do or not 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.119
 to do with who you should hang out or not 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.280
 hanging killing should not rub the 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.140
 rub shoulders so just makes it go 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.850
 change your way of feeling yourself 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.410
 and frankly it's going to transform david 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.420
 years in in all areas because 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.770
 that in fact and the negative emotions his 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.810
 biggest problem of man because 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.340
 that in fact we are used to 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.650
 to stifle our emotions must not have 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.650
 of emotions must not everything remain lebrun 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.250
 inert without emotion a robot and one is 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.330
 not there to be robots we are here 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.970
 to be human we are here to 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.769
 build a human life he lives a 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.200
 powerful life impacting a free life 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:42.650
 above all and succeed his life 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.680
 we are here for that, so in fact the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.560
 emotions it's gratitude free 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.239
 to have emotions gratitude to know 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.070
 that in fact emotions is something 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.110
 powerful thing that allow me to 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.940
 know where I have to go and actually 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.460
 if I have you need a last key 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.690
 for this week on emotions 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.440
 it was that you feel an emotion 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.300
 negative occupy yourself directly 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.770
 do not leave a lot of emotions 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.120
 Donors do not leave a whole bunch 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.100
 of frustration for fear of sadness 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.780
 rejection of sensations sensation of 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.890
 loneliness and a whole lot of stuff you 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.440
 invade until the end you go 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 so full of emotions 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.220
 negative you could know where 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.490
 go and that's what's called then 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.320
 depression so as soon as you 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.870
 feel a negative emotion boom 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.430
 take action 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.870
 do the exercise of the day of the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.980
 week and you'll see that it's going 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.810
 really to something powerful 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.790
 put corrective action on your 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.740
 emotions immediately and you go 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.330
 see that it's going really but transform 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.980
 your life you will become another 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.350
 no one will you come kaka a lot 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.510
 more serene much quieter 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.690
 much happier and more enthusiastic 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.830
 simply because you are going 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.990
 release a whole lot of negative emotions 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.250
 who in the end we weigh on 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.070
 shoulders must ultimately we 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.750
 slow down braking and that's me it's 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.740
 what I did and frankly my life 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.870
 frankly in trance and has 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.470
 turned into a few days actually in 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.290
 some days 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.849
 I really passed 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.650
 I could make a summit that is 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.299
 phenomenal and I feel a lot more 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.409
 I feel much better and soon 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.209
 that I have a frustration as soon as I have 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.680
 a negative emotion well ben I am 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.939
 occupy what is happening what is it 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.449
 who spends my little mike is a 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.150
 problem 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.829
 ok paper pen ball bic what problem 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.840
 and I coach myself and I see exactly 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.750
 what is the problem I know where to go and 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.789
 I go directly and wood is enough 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.009
 hyper powerful and now here I am 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.210
 feel great and feel good that's 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.830
 very important to be able to develop 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.240
 his life in all areas because 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.440
 if you feel uncomfortable with yourself 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.770
 can not feel good with the 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.810
 other 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.820
 if you communicate badly with you, you will 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.660
 communicated poorly with others if you get 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.789
 not feel well you will not be able 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.710
 to achieve the objectives and its cities 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.060
 in the city to entrepreneurs I 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.410
 could not sell products well 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.680
 and other exciting thing that makes 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.580
 an impact especially mostly az cardboard 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.720
 inside it's the outside it reflects 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.639
 inside simply 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.280
 so it was an interior who is who 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.919
 is negative who is imprisoned on 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.780
 emotions are rejected by yourself 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.490
 completely no emotions that is not 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.520
 emotions I have no emotions ben at 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.639
 final you'll see that hba your life actually 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.830
 are you going to leave him a level 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.270
 mediocre and frankly if you do his 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.070
 exercises are you going to really spend 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.449
 at hyper level powerful at a level 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.889
 superior who is really phenomenal 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.120
