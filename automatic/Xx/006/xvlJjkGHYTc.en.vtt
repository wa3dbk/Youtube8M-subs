basically<00:02:52.349> what<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.500> sub<00:02:56.860> bases<00:02:57.340> are<00:02:57.489> today<00:02:57.879> I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
basically what the sub bases are today I

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.360 
basically what the sub bases are today I
mean<00:02:59.200> basically<00:02:59.680> that's<00:03:00.099> what<00:03:00.220> they<00:03:00.340> are

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
mean basically that's what they are

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.660 
mean basically that's what they are
they're<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.970> early<00:03:01.750> sub<00:03:02.079> bases<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:03.040> subarrays

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
they're the early sub bases of subarrays

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.050 
they're the early sub bases of subarrays
that<00:03:04.150> are<00:03:04.269> now<00:03:04.599> for<00:03:05.010> under<00:03:06.010> $300<00:03:06.670> about<00:03:06.910> I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
that are now for under $300 about I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.550 
that are now for under $300 about I
think<00:03:07.390> they're<00:03:07.510> quote-unquote<00:03:08.110> two<00:03:08.290> hundred

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
think they're quote-unquote two hundred

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.259 
think they're quote-unquote two hundred
two<00:03:08.950> hundred<00:03:08.980> eighty<00:03:09.340> nine<00:03:09.579> dollars<00:03:09.609> hours<00:03:10.150> of

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
two hundred eighty nine dollars hours of

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.140 
two hundred eighty nine dollars hours of
the<00:03:10.329> sub<00:03:10.569> raise<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:12.930> these<00:03:13.930> are<00:03:14.260> our<00:03:15.250> only

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the sub raise and these are our only

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.819 
the sub raise and these are our only
route<00:03:16.389> a<00:03:16.450> little<00:03:16.840> more<00:03:17.170> expensive<00:03:17.410> than<00:03:17.560> that

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
route a little more expensive than that

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.240 
route a little more expensive than that
but<00:03:18.100> basically<00:03:19.049> sort<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.139> same<00:03:20.440> base<00:03:20.709> sort
