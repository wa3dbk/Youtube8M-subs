on Warren dollars in the first video I

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.360 
on Warren dollars in the first video I
showed<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.440> difference<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> testing

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
showed you the difference on the testing

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.580 
showed you the difference on the testing

unbalanced or ball what am i referring
to<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.760> I'm<00:00:18.539> actually<00:00:18.900> talking<00:00:19.289> about<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
to here I'm actually talking about the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.910 
to here I'm actually talking about the
shape<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.369> bowl<00:00:20.630> which<00:00:21.630> sits<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.170> runs<00:00:22.740> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
shape of the bowl which sits and runs on

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.429 
shape of the bowl which sits and runs on
the<00:00:23.070> ground<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.660> neck<00:00:24.900> straight<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the ground and it's neck straight and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.029 
the ground and it's neck straight and
only<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> shape<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:27.500> creates<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.710> teacher

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
only that shape that creates the teacher

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.049 
only that shape that creates the teacher
that<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> bowl<00:00:30.090> should<00:00:30.599> take<00:00:31.700> if<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.759> make<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
that the bowl should take if we make it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.900 
that the bowl should take if we make it
a<00:00:33.390> balance<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.620> straight<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a balance so straight it's like it's a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.630 
a balance so straight it's like it's a
piece<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> circle<00:00:36.980> if<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.129> look<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
piece of the circle if we look at that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.780 
piece of the circle if we look at that
circle<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> center<00:00:40.620> out<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
circle from the center out which is the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.590 
circle from the center out which is the
radius<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.110> same<00:00:43.460> everywhere<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:45.390> we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
radius it's the same everywhere if we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.750 
radius it's the same everywhere if we
were<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> piece<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.250> machine

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
were to take a piece of that and machine

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.270 
were to take a piece of that and machine
the<00:00:47.910> ball<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> shape<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.770> would<00:00:49.950> refer<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the ball to that shape we would refer to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.689 
the ball to that shape we would refer to
it<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> balance<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.300> bottom<00:00:52.460> on<00:00:53.460> an

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it as a balance or bottom on an

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.450 
it as a balance or bottom on an
unbalanced<00:00:54.210> olive<00:00:54.539> oil<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.230> shape<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.739> an

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
unbalanced olive oil the shape is an

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
unbalanced olive oil the shape is an
irregular<00:00:57.090> shape<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.570> other<00:00:57.750> words<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
irregular shape in other words the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.400 
irregular shape in other words the
distance<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> center<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
distance from the center out is not the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.670 
distance from the center out is not the
same<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.460> could<00:01:02.640> create<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.680> by

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
same and I could create that by

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.320 
same and I could create that by
crunching<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.519> bit<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> turning<00:01:06.060> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
crunching this up a bit and turning this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.719 
crunching this up a bit and turning this
into<00:01:06.510> an<00:01:06.689> oval<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.830> we've<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> different

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
into an oval now we've got a different

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.060 
into an oval now we've got a different
radius<00:01:09.030> from<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> edge<00:01:10.350> from

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
radius from here out to that edge from

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.370 
radius from here out to that edge from
here<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> edge<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.840> therefore<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
here out to that edge so therefore the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.810 
here out to that edge so therefore the
radius<00:01:13.560> around<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
radius around it is going to be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
radius around it is going to be
different<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> bowl<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.770> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
different if we make a bowl like that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.910 
different if we make a bowl like that
and<00:01:17.250> most<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> balls<00:01:18.299> over<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> last<00:01:18.930> 60

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and most of the balls over the last 60

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980

or 80 years saw the New Zealand I love
that<00:01:22.200> type<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:23.820> would<00:01:23.970> refer<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.689> an

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
that type we would refer to it as an

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.760 
that type we would refer to it as an
unbalanced<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.470> bottle<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
unbalanced or bottle so what is the

unbalanced or bottle so what is the
upside<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.400> downsides<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.180> playing<00:01:30.509> these

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
two different types of goals if we use

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.440 
two different types of goals if we use

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
think that because they go so narrow

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.810

between the met and the jack is a

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.800 
between the met and the jack is a

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
straight line you'd be forgiven for

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
thinking that these balls are actually

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.800

easier<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.760> play<00:03:23.060> they're<00:03:23.780> not<00:03:25.360> so<00:03:26.360> that's<00:03:26.510> an

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
easier to play they're not so that's an

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.500 
easier to play they're not so that's an
answer<00:03:27.500> as<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.650> why<00:03:28.040> these<00:03:28.100> two<00:03:28.370> balls<00:03:28.850> are<00:03:29.330> so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
answer as to why these two balls are so
