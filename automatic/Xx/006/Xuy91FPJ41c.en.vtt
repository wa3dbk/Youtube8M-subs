00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
patch however they couldn't get it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.620 
patch however they couldn't get it
working<00:01:15.110> properly<00:01:15.140> now<00:01:16.060> not<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.210> mind

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
working properly now not that I mind

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.389 
working properly now not that I mind
that<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.080> doesn't<00:01:18.409> work<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.800> would<00:01:18.950> rather<00:01:19.100> it

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
that it doesn't work I would rather it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.219 
that it doesn't work I would rather it
came<00:01:19.610> out<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.090> did<00:01:20.270> function<00:01:20.720> at<00:01:20.840> least<00:01:21.020> in

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
came out and it did function at least in

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.960 
came out and it did function at least in
a<00:01:21.319> basic<00:01:21.770> format<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.399> that<00:01:22.429> we<00:01:22.640> could<00:01:22.789> have<00:01:22.940> a

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
a basic format so that we could have a

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.969 
a basic format so that we could have a
look<00:01:23.210> see<00:01:23.420> what<00:01:23.810> things<00:01:24.170> needed<00:01:24.560> improving

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
look see what things needed improving

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.950 
look see what things needed improving
and<00:01:25.490> generally<00:01:26.090> have<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.299> good<00:01:26.539> time<00:01:26.690> with<00:01:26.929> it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
and generally have a good time with it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.870 
and generally have a good time with it
but<00:01:27.619> at<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.799> same<00:01:27.979> time<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.460> did<00:01:28.670> make<00:01:28.819> me

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
but at the same time it did make me

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.699 
but at the same time it did make me
slightly<00:01:29.240> sad<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:29.810> couldn't<00:01:29.929> play<00:01:30.380> what

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
slightly sad that I couldn't play what

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:32.800 
slightly sad that I couldn't play what
looked<00:01:30.979> like<00:01:31.039> an<00:01:31.340> absolutely<00:01:31.789> fantastic<00:01:32.060> map

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
looked like an absolutely fantastic map

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.559 
looked like an absolutely fantastic map
but<00:01:33.470> instead<00:01:33.799> we<00:01:34.159> have<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.610> few<00:01:34.819> screenshots<00:01:35.179> to

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
but instead we have a few screenshots to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:36.999 
but instead we have a few screenshots to
look<00:01:35.720> at<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.080> they'll<00:01:36.350> be<00:01:36.470> going<00:01:36.619> up<00:01:36.799> on<00:01:36.920> the

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
look at so they'll be going up on the

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.559 
look at so they'll be going up on the
screen<00:01:37.250> right<00:01:37.429> now<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.880> bottom<00:01:38.030> left<00:01:38.479> hand

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
screen right now in the bottom left hand

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.660 
screen right now in the bottom left hand
corner<00:01:38.780> they'll<00:01:39.560> just<00:01:39.770> flick<00:01:40.100> through<00:01:40.310> slowly

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
corner they'll just flick through slowly

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.010 
corner they'll just flick through slowly
for<00:01:40.909> about<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.119> next<00:01:41.149> couple<00:01:41.479> of<00:01:41.600> minutes<00:01:41.720> or

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
for about the next couple of minutes or

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.869 
for about the next couple of minutes or
so<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.830> does<00:01:43.009> look<00:01:43.250> as<00:01:43.369> if<00:01:43.489> they've<00:01:43.670> put<00:01:43.849> a

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:43.879 
so and it does look as if they've put a

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.630 
so and it does look as if they've put a
lot<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.209> hard<00:01:44.539> work<00:01:44.629> into<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:46.039> of<00:01:46.190> course<00:01:46.369> i

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
lot of hard work into it now of course i

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.309 
lot of hard work into it now of course i
won't<00:01:46.819> go<00:01:47.030> into<00:01:47.060> too<00:01:47.390> much<00:01:47.690> detail<00:01:48.140> because

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
won't go into too much detail because

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.109 
won't go into too much detail because
there's<00:01:48.800> no<00:01:49.009> point<00:01:49.340> now<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:49.940> been

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
there's no point now that it's been

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.270 
there's no point now that it's been
delayed<00:01:50.479> tigger<00:01:51.200> has<00:01:51.379> also<00:01:51.590> said<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:52.039> they

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
delayed tigger has also said that they

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.979 
delayed tigger has also said that they
will<00:01:52.429> do<00:01:52.550> be<00:01:52.789> doing<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.149> little<00:01:53.420> bit<00:01:53.569> more<00:01:53.720> work

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
will do be doing a little bit more work

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.869 
will do be doing a little bit more work
on<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.440> before<00:01:54.860> they<00:01:55.220> release<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.550> out<00:01:55.819> into

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:55.879 
on it before they release it out into

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.850 
on it before they release it out into
the<00:01:56.360> CTE<00:01:56.750> again<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.349> it's<00:01:57.470> going<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.679> look<00:01:57.769> a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
the CTE again so it's going to look a

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.380 
the CTE again so it's going to look a
little<00:01:57.979> bit<00:01:58.190> different<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:59.090> what<00:01:59.239> these

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
little bit different to what these

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.930 
little bit different to what these
screenshots<00:01:59.750> already<00:02:00.379> look<00:02:00.649> like<00:02:00.679> but<00:02:01.580> having

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
screenshots already look like but having

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.150 
screenshots already look like but having
done<00:02:01.970> my<00:02:02.479> own<00:02:02.509> sort<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.170> night<00:02:03.440> version<00:02:03.769> of

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
done my own sort of night version of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.490 
done my own sort of night version of
Cesar<00:02:04.459> shanghaied<00:02:05.030> twice<00:02:05.390> now<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.289> first

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
Cesar shanghaied twice now the first

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.800 
Cesar shanghaied twice now the first
time<00:02:06.769> we<00:02:06.920> did<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.099> was<00:02:07.250> well<00:02:07.849> very<00:02:08.269> dark<00:02:08.599> indeed

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
time we did it was well very dark indeed

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.419 
time we did it was well very dark indeed
but<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.319> looked<00:02:09.500> really<00:02:09.739> cool<00:02:10.009> with<00:02:10.190> all<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
but it looked really cool with all the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.520 
but it looked really cool with all the
smoke<00:02:10.550> effects<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.690> second<00:02:12.050> time<00:02:12.230> we<00:02:12.379> did

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
smoke effects and the second time we did

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.080 
smoke effects and the second time we did
it<00:02:12.560> looked<00:02:12.830> much<00:02:13.069> more<00:02:13.129> like<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.580> midnight

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it looked much more like a midnight

explained<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.859> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
explained that the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.240 
explained that the
they've<00:02:52.689> made<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.900> only<00:02:53.290> five<00:02:53.500> days<00:02:53.530> long<00:02:54.040> is

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
they've made it only five days long is

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.949 
they've made it only five days long is
because<00:02:54.430> there<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.909> a<00:02:54.939> lot<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.209> content<00:02:55.720> in

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
because there is a lot of content in

because there is a lot of content in
there<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:57.069> might<00:02:57.220> sound<00:02:57.489> like<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.790> complete

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
there that might sound like a complete

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.699 
there that might sound like a complete
contradiction<00:02:58.569> as<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.079> why<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.230> want<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.590> make

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
contradiction as to why you want to make

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.289 
contradiction as to why you want to make
it<00:02:59.829> so<00:02:59.980> short<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.670> want<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.939> have<00:03:01.030> time<00:03:01.269> to

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
it so short of you want to have time to

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.720 
it so short of you want to have time to
play<00:03:01.629> all<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.930> content<00:03:02.409> but<00:03:03.069> their<00:03:03.220> idea<00:03:03.549> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
play all the content but their idea is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.399 
play all the content but their idea is
is<00:03:03.909> that<00:03:04.060> if<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.329> play<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.659> content<00:03:05.079> just<00:03:05.260> a

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
is that if you play the content just a

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.110 
is that if you play the content just a
little<00:03:05.650> bit<00:03:05.799> you're<00:03:06.400> still<00:03:06.610> going<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.790> want<00:03:06.970> to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
little bit you're still going to want to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.390 
little bit you're still going to want to
find<00:03:07.360> out<00:03:07.540> more<00:03:07.840> about<00:03:07.900> what's<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:09.040> and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
find out more about what's going on and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.220 
find out more about what's going on and
then<00:03:09.430> they<00:03:10.209> take<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.480> bait<00:03:10.569> or<00:03:10.720> away<00:03:10.870> from<00:03:10.900> you

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
then they take the bait or away from you

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.750 
then they take the bait or away from you
and<00:03:11.409> you<00:03:11.560> have<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.829> wait<00:03:11.980> until<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.400> full<00:03:12.579> game

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
and you have to wait until the full game

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.819 
and you have to wait until the full game
releases<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.510> then<00:03:13.959> you've<00:03:14.110> got<00:03:14.349> this<00:03:14.560> like

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
releases and then you've got this like

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.880 
releases and then you've got this like
small<00:03:15.370> amount<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.849> unload<00:03:16.540> gaming<00:03:17.049> drug<00:03:17.440> left

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
small amount of unload gaming drug left

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.309 
small amount of unload gaming drug left
and<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.670> want<00:03:18.879> more<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.569> will<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:20.049> more

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
and you want more and you will have more

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.080 
and you want more and you will have more
so<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:20.950> by<00:03:21.159> hardline<00:03:21.640> when<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.879> comes

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so you will by hardline when it comes

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.630 
so you will by hardline when it comes
out<00:03:22.269> see<00:03:23.230> how<00:03:23.260> amazing<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:23.829> is<00:03:23.980> that's<00:03:24.280> why

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
out see how amazing that is that's why

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.580 
out see how amazing that is that's why
it's<00:03:25.030> only<00:03:25.209> five<00:03:25.599> days<00:03:25.629> long<00:03:26.140> they<00:03:26.319> want<00:03:26.500> to

it's only five days long they want to

the privilege of seeing this game in May
2014<00:03:36.940> all<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.359> way<00:03:37.510> through<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.079> now<00:03:38.470> februari

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
2014 all the way through to now februari

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.970 
2014 all the way through to now februari
2015<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.959> long<00:03:41.170> time<00:03:41.379> so<00:03:41.680> I've<00:03:41.829> seen

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
2015 and that's a long time so I've seen

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.220 
2015 and that's a long time so I've seen
it<00:03:42.129> go<00:03:42.280> from<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.700> tiny<00:03:43.120> little<00:03:43.389> baby<00:03:43.629> all<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
it go from a tiny little baby all the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
way to a full-sized adult and I have to

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.930 
way to a full-sized adult and I have to
say<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.500> vastly<00:03:48.159> different<00:03:48.609> from<00:03:48.639> when<00:03:48.849> I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
say it's vastly different from when I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.629 
say it's vastly different from when I
first<00:03:48.970> saw<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:50.260> feels<00:03:50.560> very<00:03:51.099> different

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
disappointed that I didn't get a chance

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.020 
disappointed that I didn't get a chance
to<00:06:56.020> play<00:06:56.050> but<00:06:56.440> hopefully<00:06:57.010> it'll<00:06:57.490> be<00:06:57.700> released

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
to play but hopefully it'll be released

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.910 
to play but hopefully it'll be released
at<00:06:58.180> some<00:06:58.210> point<00:06:58.660> in<00:06:58.840> the<00:06:58.990> next<00:06:59.140> seven<00:06:59.500> days<00:06:59.530> or

at some point in the next seven days or

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.280 
at some point in the next seven days or
