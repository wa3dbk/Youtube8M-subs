sniper<00:00:37.920> patches<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.520> guess<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.510> are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
sniper patches I guess so if there are

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.540 
sniper patches I guess so if there are
any<00:00:39.989> patches<00:00:40.260> which<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.890> affect<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> Rican

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

any patches which would affect the Rican
kid<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.239> definitely<00:00:42.360> make<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> video<00:00:43.050> about

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230

kid I will definitely make a video about
and<00:00:43.559> tell<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> guys<00:00:43.980> about<00:00:44.610> all<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> changes

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and tell you guys about all the changes

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
and tell you guys about all the changes
and<00:00:45.840> since<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:46.500> already<00:00:46.680> talking<00:00:47.100> about

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and since we're already talking about

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010 
and since we're already talking about
changes<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.969> thought<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
changes I thought it would be kind of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
changes I thought it would be kind of
fitting<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> first<00:00:49.770> episode<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
fitting for the first episode to do a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
fitting for the first episode to do a
kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> newest<00:00:51.300> video<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.500> will

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
kind of the newest video so we will

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.529 
kind of the newest video so we will
compare<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> bell<00:00:53.370> 53<00:00:53.820> Rican<00:00:54.210> kid<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
compare the bell 53 Rican kid to the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
compare the bell 53 Rican kid to the
benefit<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.140> recon<00:00:55.440> kid<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.280> over<00:00:56.399> all

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
benefit for recon kid just go over all

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
benefit for recon kid just go over all

within your field of view so you can

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980 
within your field of view so you can
basically<00:01:38.100> spin<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> cue<00:01:39.030> button<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.540> just

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
basically spin the cue button or just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
basically spin the cue button or just
spot<00:01:40.170> button<00:01:40.409> anymore<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.979> order<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
spot button anymore in order to get the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.520 
spot button anymore in order to get the
red<00:01:42.119> triangle<00:01:42.450> above<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> enemy's<00:01:43.350> head

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
red triangle above the enemy's head

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
red triangle above the enemy's head
however<00:01:44.460> we'll<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.149> turns<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.689> maybe

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
however we'll see how it turns out maybe

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.600 
however we'll see how it turns out maybe
the<00:01:46.380> spotting<00:01:46.649> mechanic<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.189> actually<00:01:47.490> be

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the spotting mechanic will actually be

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.190 
the spotting mechanic will actually be
better<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.149> don't<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.810> spend<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
better and you don't have to spend the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.260 
better and you don't have to spend the
spot<00:01:49.439> button<00:01:49.710> anymore<00:01:49.939> next<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.149> would

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
spot button anymore next up we would

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179 
spot button anymore next up we would
have<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.780> suppression<00:01:52.290> mechanic<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.890> is

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
have the suppression mechanic that is

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
have the suppression mechanic that is
also<00:01:53.549> being<00:01:53.700> changed<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.299> Belfield<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
also being changed in Belfield for and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.800 
also being changed in Belfield for and
we<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> suppression<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.540> really

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
we all know that suppression is a really

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.440 
we all know that suppression is a really
hot<00:01:57.960> topic<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.850> wear<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> sniper

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
hot topic but and if you wear a sniper

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
hot topic but and if you wear a sniper
in<00:02:00.750> battlefield<00:02:01.350> 3<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> recon<00:02:02.310> player

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
in battlefield 3 or just a recon player

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.709 
in battlefield 3 or just a recon player
in<00:02:02.640> general<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> were<00:02:03.299> using<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
in general and you were using a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.080 
in general and you were using a
bolt-action<00:02:04.020> rifle<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.369> random<00:02:05.850> bullet

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
bolt-action rifle the random bullet

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.819 
bolt-action rifle the random bullet
spread<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.840> suppression<00:02:07.200> basically

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
spread of the suppression basically

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
spread of the suppression basically
rendered<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.340> useless<00:02:08.849> because<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
rendered you useless because you have to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.080 
rendered you useless because you have to
realize<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.200> much<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.560> accuracy<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.160> if

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
realize so much in your accuracy and if

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.790 
realize so much in your accuracy and if
your<00:02:12.300> point<00:02:12.750> blank<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.200> your<00:02:13.319> enemy

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
your point blank on your enemy

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.620 
your point blank on your enemy
shooting<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.310> your<00:02:14.400> suppressed<00:02:14.760> blue<00:02:15.420> will

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
shooting and your suppressed blue will

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
shooting and your suppressed blue will
just<00:02:15.810> go<00:02:15.990> everywhere<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:16.920> against<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
just go everywhere but not against the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.640 
just go everywhere but not against the
target<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:18.900> kind<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> said<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.560> I'm

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
target so this is kind of said and I'm

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.260 
target so this is kind of said and I'm
really<00:02:19.800> happy<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.250> say<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.430> they<00:02:20.820> change<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
really happy to say that they change the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.510 
really happy to say that they change the
mechanic<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.780> battlefield<00:02:22.170> 4<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.010> from<00:02:23.340> now<00:02:23.370> on

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
mechanic in battlefield 4 so from now on

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.370 
mechanic in battlefield 4 so from now on
the<00:02:24.180> only<00:02:24.210> thing<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.840> suppression<00:02:25.140> will

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the only thing that suppression will

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.930 
the only thing that suppression will
actually<00:02:25.740> do<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.010> increasing<00:02:26.490> your<00:02:26.580> scalps

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
actually do is increasing your scalps

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.640 
actually do is increasing your scalps
way<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.570> if<00:02:27.690> you're<00:02:27.780> really<00:02:28.080> skilled<00:02:28.410> players

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
way so if you're really skilled players

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.280 
way so if you're really skilled players
you<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:29.100> skill<00:02:29.640> counter<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.390> scopes<00:02:30.660> way<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
you can skill counter the scopes way and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.830 
you can skill counter the scopes way and
still<00:02:31.470> hit<00:02:31.650> your<00:02:31.680> targets<00:02:32.190> also<00:02:33.120> not<00:02:33.600> all

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
still hit your targets also not all

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.720 
still hit your targets also not all
classes<00:02:34.320> will<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.920> same<00:02:35.160> suppression

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
classes will have the same suppression

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
classes will have the same suppression
level<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.540> example<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.990> Recon<00:02:37.350> as<00:02:37.500> well<00:02:37.680> as

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
level for example the Recon as well as

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.410 
level for example the Recon as well as
the<00:02:37.950> soup<00:02:38.100> orchid<00:02:38.520> will<00:02:38.760> give<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.210> most

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the soup orchid will give you the most

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.630 
the soup orchid will give you the most
impression<00:02:39.750> while<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.040> assault<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
impression while the assault and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.280 
impression while the assault and
engineer<00:02:42.120> will<00:02:42.330> give<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.600> less<00:02:42.840> oppression

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
engineer will give you less oppression

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.020 
engineer will give you less oppression
also<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:43.980> you're<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.250> close<00:02:44.580> in<00:02:44.790> close

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
also if you're really close in close

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.970 
also if you're really close in close
quarters<00:02:45.390> combat<00:02:45.450> situation<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.620> won't<00:02:46.830> get

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
quarters combat situation you won't get

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.040 
quarters combat situation you won't get
as<00:02:47.190> much<00:02:47.430> depression<00:02:48.030> because<00:02:48.330> die<00:02:48.630> set<00:02:48.900> they

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
as much depression because die set they

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.990 
as much depression because die set they
want<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.440> rely<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.830> skill<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.520> close-quarter

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
want to rely on skill in close-quarter

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.330 
want to rely on skill in close-quarter
situations<00:02:51.540> our<00:02:52.470> next<00:02:52.800> point<00:02:53.040> would<00:02:53.310> be

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
situations our next point would be

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.610 
situations our next point would be
rather<00:02:53.820> looked<00:02:54.180> upon<00:02:54.420> us<00:02:54.570> as<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.990> nerf<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.440> guess

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
rather looked upon us as a nerf I guess

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.620 
rather looked upon us as a nerf I guess
which<00:02:56.130> would<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.490> running<00:02:56.880> reduces<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
which would be running reduces the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.690 
which would be running reduces the
accuracy<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.740> if<00:02:58.950> you're<00:02:59.070> running<00:02:59.190> around<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
accuracy so if you're running around a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
accuracy so if you're running around a
lot<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.030> then<00:03:00.210> you're<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:01.320> and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
lot and then you're just going and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.260 
lot and then you're just going and
stereoscope<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.460> think<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:02.970> will<00:03:03.060> actually

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
stereoscope I think it will actually

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.720 
stereoscope I think it will actually
take<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.720> little<00:03:03.960> more<00:03:04.260> time<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.860> steady<00:03:05.640> your

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
take a little more time to steady your

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.430 
take a little more time to steady your
scalp<00:03:06.030> while<00:03:06.240> pressing<00:03:06.510> shift<00:03:06.840> or<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.260> hold

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
scalp while pressing shift or just hold

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.400 
scalp while pressing shift or just hold
your<00:03:07.560> breath<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:07.920> general<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.540> don't<00:03:10.200> think

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
your breath in general so I don't think

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.350 
your breath in general so I don't think
that<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.620> will<00:03:10.830> be<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.160> big<00:03:11.700> thing<00:03:12.030> but

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
that this will be a a big thing but

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.180 
that this will be a a big thing but
maybe<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.780> will<00:03:12.930> be<00:03:13.050> for<00:03:13.770> some<00:03:13.890> people

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
maybe it will be for some people

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.800 
maybe it will be for some people
personally<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.910> don't<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.330> will<00:03:15.480> affect

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
personally I don't think it will affect

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.750 
personally I don't think it will affect
the<00:03:16.050> Recon<00:03:16.320> kid<00:03:16.500> too<00:03:16.710> much<00:03:16.920> however<00:03:17.460> it's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the Recon kid too much however it's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.090 
the Recon kid too much however it's
still<00:03:17.910> affected<00:03:18.450> another<00:03:19.110> new<00:03:19.440> game<00:03:19.650> mechanic

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
still affected another new game mechanic

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.280 
still affected another new game mechanic
would<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:21.239> lean<00:03:21.630> feature<00:03:21.959> which

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
would be the lean feature which

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.720 
would be the lean feature which
basically<00:03:22.590> allows<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.310> peek<00:03:23.520> behind

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
basically allows you to peek behind

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.120 
basically allows you to peek behind
cover<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.420> lets<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.470> sneak<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.800> shot<00:03:26.010> or

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
cover and lets you sneak a shot or

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.949 
cover and lets you sneak a shot or
something<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.670> think<00:03:27.300> in<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> first<00:03:27.840> place

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
something I think in the first place

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.420 
something I think in the first place
they<00:03:28.170> did<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.560> prevent<00:03:28.980> head<00:03:29.160> glitching

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
they did it to prevent head glitching

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.550 
they did it to prevent head glitching
and<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.540> also<00:03:30.690> don't<00:03:30.840> think<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.290> will<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.530> a

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
and I also don't think that it will be a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.530 
and I also don't think that it will be a
big<00:03:31.860> change<00:03:32.070> again<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.640> it's<00:03:33.150> kind<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.360> like

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
big change again and it's kind of like

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.150 
big change again and it's kind of like
the<00:03:33.720> thing<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.050> had<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.230> Far<00:03:34.500> Cry<00:03:34.620> 3<00:03:34.680> if<00:03:35.040> you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
the thing you had in Far Cry 3 if you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.620 
the thing you had in Far Cry 3 if you
played<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.520> game<00:03:35.700> which<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.030> are<00:03:36.270> actually

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
played that game which you are actually

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.780 
played that game which you are actually
automatically<00:03:37.620> leaning<00:03:38.070> around<00:03:38.280> corners<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
automatically leaning around corners and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.699 
automatically leaning around corners and
stuff<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.959> think<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.380> pretty<00:03:40.530> neat

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
stuff and I think it's a pretty neat

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.170 
stuff and I think it's a pretty neat
feature<00:03:40.920> but<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> don't<00:03:41.550> think<00:03:41.670> we<00:03:41.790> will<00:03:41.880> affect

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
feature but I don't think we will affect

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.570 
feature but I don't think we will affect
the<00:03:42.239> Rican<00:03:42.480> kid<00:03:42.570> too<00:03:42.720> much<00:03:43.040> our<00:03:44.040> next<00:03:44.430> point

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
the Rican kid too much our next point

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.340 
the Rican kid too much our next point
would<00:03:44.880> be<00:03:44.910> zeroing<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.080> basically

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
would be zeroing and this is basically

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.630 
would be zeroing and this is basically
really<00:03:46.709> interesting<00:03:47.100> for<00:03:47.310> all<00:03:47.459> your

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
really interesting for all your

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.190 
really interesting for all your
long-range<00:03:47.880> sniper's<00:03:48.540> because<00:03:48.840> now<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.080> can

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
long-range sniper's because now I can

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.010 
long-range sniper's because now I can
basically<00:03:49.610> zero<00:03:50.610> in<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.090> don't<00:03:51.360> know<00:03:51.420> 1,000

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
basically zero in at I don't know 1,000

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.830 
basically zero in at I don't know 1,000
meters<00:03:52.290> point<00:03:53.130> directly<00:03:53.520> with<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.239> crossers

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
meters point directly with the crossers

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.750 
meters point directly with the crossers
at<00:03:54.989> your<00:03:55.140> enemy<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.620> then<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.250> shoot<00:03:56.520> you

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
at your enemy and then just shoot you

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.949 
at your enemy and then just shoot you
don't<00:03:56.910> have<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.239> compensate<00:03:57.540> with<00:03:57.750> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
don't have to compensate with the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.990 
don't have to compensate with the
millets<00:03:58.320> anymore<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.370> go<00:03:59.730> for<00:03:59.940> it

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
millets anymore you can just go for it

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.699 
millets anymore you can just go for it
and<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.630> think<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:01.020> is<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.290> really<00:04:01.620> interesting

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
and I think this is a really interesting

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.530 
and I think this is a really interesting
fact<00:04:02.340> especially<00:04:02.520> paired<00:04:03.000> with<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.270> range

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
fact especially paired with the range

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.150 
fact especially paired with the range
finder<00:04:03.930> which<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:04.320> will<00:04:04.500> talk<00:04:04.680> about<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.950> little

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
finder which we will talk about a little

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.430 
finder which we will talk about a little
bit<00:04:05.280> later<00:04:05.520> on<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.820> video<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.989> last<00:04:07.140> but<00:04:07.350> not

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
bit later on this video but last but not

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.600 
bit later on this video but last but not
least<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.739> just<00:04:07.920> want<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.130> tell<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.370> guys<00:04:08.489> that

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
least I just want to tell you guys that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.280 
least I just want to tell you guys that
there<00:04:08.880> will<00:04:09.000> be<00:04:09.030> reduced<00:04:09.510> Copeland<00:04:10.050> that

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
there will be reduced Copeland that

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.990 
there will be reduced Copeland that
scope<00:04:10.560> them<00:04:10.769> will<00:04:11.040> still<00:04:11.400> be<00:04:11.550> in<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.970> game

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
scope them will still be in the game

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.330 
scope them will still be in the game
however<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:13.080> reduced<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.920> think<00:04:14.160> if

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
however it is reduced and I think if

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.729 
however it is reduced and I think if
you're<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.060> really<00:04:15.300> dark<00:04:15.420> area<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.470> should

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
you're in a really dark area it should

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.240 
you're in a really dark area it should
even<00:04:17.010> be<00:04:17.370> reduced<00:04:18.030> even<00:04:18.239> more<00:04:18.830> okay<00:04:19.830> let's<00:04:20.070> hop

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
even be reduced even more okay let's hop

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.760 
even be reduced even more okay let's hop
over<00:04:20.580> to<00:04:20.609> our<00:04:20.820> gadgets<00:04:21.450> in<00:04:21.570> battlefield<00:04:22.289> 4<00:04:22.350> and

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
over to our gadgets in battlefield 4 and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.640 
over to our gadgets in battlefield 4 and
we<00:04:23.669> will<00:04:23.880> see<00:04:24.120> some<00:04:24.419> old<00:04:24.600> sketches<00:04:25.050> again<00:04:25.350> for

we will see some old sketches again for

we will see some old sketches again for

you<00:04:41.360> will<00:04:41.600> be<00:04:41.720> able<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:41.960> use<00:04:42.140> a<00:04:42.170> range<00:04:42.410> finder

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
you will be able to use a range finder

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.340 
you will be able to use a range finder
which<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.460> actually<00:04:43.700> an<00:04:44.120> attachment<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
which is actually an attachment so and

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.900 
which is actually an attachment so and
you<00:04:45.680> will<00:04:45.800> have<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:46.040> range<00:04:46.220> finder<00:04:46.520> built-in

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
you will have the range finder built-in

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.370 
you will have the range finder built-in
in<00:04:47.090> your<00:04:47.240> scope<00:04:47.450> at<00:04:47.630> all<00:04:47.750> times<00:04:48.050> if<00:04:48.230> you're

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
in your scope at all times if you're

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.860 
in your scope at all times if you're
using<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:48.740> will<00:04:49.490> also<00:04:49.670> get<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:49.940> pld<00:04:50.390> which<00:04:50.750> is

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
using it will also get a pld which is

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.410 
using it will also get a pld which is
basically<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.290> portable<00:04:51.980> soft<00:04:52.220> lamp<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.640> also

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
basically a portable soft lamp and also

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.000 
basically a portable soft lamp and also
we<00:04:53.540> will<00:04:53.690> get<00:04:53.840> some<00:04:54.050> other<00:04:54.230> cool<00:04:54.470> touch<00:04:54.710> months

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
we will get some other cool touch months

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.010 
we will get some other cool touch months
and<00:04:55.220> again<00:04:55.610> those<00:04:55.790> are<00:04:55.850> gadgets<00:04:56.240> but<00:04:56.570> I<00:04:56.810> think

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
and again those are gadgets but I think

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.900 
and again those are gadgets but I think
they<00:04:57.110> were<00:04:57.230> pretty<00:04:57.380> cool<00:04:57.650> new<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:58.610> example

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
they were pretty cool new for example

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.030 
they were pretty cool new for example
d40<00:04:59.330> x<00:04:59.360> zoom<00:04:59.780> scope<00:05:00.050> or<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.320> variable<00:05:00.830> zoom

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
d40 x zoom scope or the variable zoom

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.150 
d40 x zoom scope or the variable zoom
scope<00:05:01.370> which<00:05:01.550> is<00:05:01.700> 14<00:05:02.570> times<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.230> 40<00:05:03.620> times<00:05:03.860> so

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
scope which is 14 times on 40 times so

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.490 
scope which is 14 times on 40 times so
pay<00:05:05.000> attention<00:05:05.030> there<00:05:05.480> but<00:05:05.990> yeah<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.260> those

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
pay attention there but yeah and those

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.770 
pay attention there but yeah and those
are<00:05:06.710> two<00:05:07.130> really<00:05:07.160> cool<00:05:07.580> scopes<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.510> think

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
are two really cool scopes and I think

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.360 
are two really cool scopes and I think
those<00:05:09.050> are<00:05:09.080> going<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.500> be<00:05:09.560> really<00:05:09.950> interesting

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
those are going to be really interesting

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.090 
those are going to be really interesting
as<00:05:10.460> well<00:05:10.640> last<00:05:11.480> but<00:05:11.630> not<00:05:11.660> least<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:12.230> our<00:05:12.560> new

and yeah I think we will see how it
turns<00:05:29.210> out<00:05:29.420> if<00:05:29.660> then<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.080> same<00:05:30.860> kid<00:05:31.100> can<00:05:31.280> use

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
turns out if then the same kid can use

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.220 
turns out if then the same kid can use
the<00:05:31.640> radio<00:05:31.880> spawn<00:05:32.180> beating<00:05:32.510> as<00:05:32.600> well<00:05:32.840> as<00:05:32.960> DC

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
the radio spawn beating as well as DC

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.620 
the radio spawn beating as well as DC
for<00:05:33.470> even<00:05:34.250> if<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.490> know<00:05:34.580> what<00:05:34.730> I<00:05:34.760> mean<00:05:34.820> okay

sniper<00:05:38.900> rifles<00:05:39.410> in<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.740> before<00:05:40.130> together

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
sniper rifles in that before together

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.910 
sniper rifles in that before together
with<00:05:41.210> maybe<00:05:41.480> a<00:05:41.600> bigger<00:05:42.230> one<00:05:42.560> hit<00:05:42.710> kill

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
with maybe a bigger one hit kill

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.590 
with maybe a bigger one hit kill
potential<00:05:43.250> but<00:05:43.820> i<00:05:43.850> would<00:05:44.030> say<00:05:44.150> that<00:05:44.180> start<00:05:44.510> out

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
potential but i would say that start out

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.320 
potential but i would say that start out
with<00:05:44.810> bolt<00:05:45.050> action<00:05:45.290> rifles<00:05:45.620> so<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.820> first<00:05:47.000> gun

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
with bolt action rifles so the first gun

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.900 
with bolt action rifles so the first gun
on<00:05:47.450> our<00:05:47.600> list<00:05:47.840> would<00:05:48.050> be<00:05:48.110> DC<00:05:48.590> SLO<00:05:48.920> for<00:05:49.190> which<00:05:49.460> is

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
on our list would be DC SLO for which is

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.210 
on our list would be DC SLO for which is
a<00:05:50.060> chinese<00:05:50.600> bolt-action<00:05:51.050> rifle<00:05:51.560> followed<00:05:52.100> by

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
a chinese bolt-action rifle followed by

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.460 
a chinese bolt-action rifle followed by
the<00:05:52.280> m40a5<00:05:52.850> we<00:05:53.660> also<00:05:53.840> know<00:05:54.080> a<00:05:54.110> little<00:05:54.320> bit

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
the m40a5 we also know a little bit

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.470 
the m40a5 we also know a little bit
about<00:05:54.650> his<00:05:54.800> Scout<00:05:55.070> elite<00:05:55.220> and<00:05:55.550> we<00:05:55.910> also<00:05:56.090> know

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
about his Scout elite and we also know

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.120 
about his Scout elite and we also know
the<00:05:56.870> SV<00:05:57.110> 98<00:05:57.470> Jane<00:05:58.040> d90<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:58.790> DM<00:05:59.750> 9jp<00:06:00.320> however

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
the SV 98 Jane d90 and DM 9jp however

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.730 
the SV 98 Jane d90 and DM 9jp however
their<00:06:01.370> three<00:06:01.940> more<00:06:02.300> rifles<00:06:02.780> to<00:06:02.960> get<00:06:03.110> or<00:06:03.350> to<00:06:03.560> see

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
their three more rifles to get or to see

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.190 
their three more rifles to get or to see
which<00:06:04.310> would<00:06:04.490> be<00:06:04.610> 338<00:06:05.420> recon<00:06:05.810> which<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.080> a

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
which would be 338 recon which is a

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.590 
which would be 338 recon which is a
bullpup<00:06:06.650> design<00:06:06.710> sniper<00:06:07.430> rifle<00:06:07.850> so<00:06:08.300> I<00:06:08.330> think

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
bullpup design sniper rifle so I think

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.060 
bullpup design sniper rifle so I think
it's<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.900> first<00:06:09.110> one<00:06:09.260> we<00:06:09.410> had<00:06:09.590> in<00:06:09.620> battlefield

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
it's the first one we had in battlefield

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.400 
it's the first one we had in battlefield
so<00:06:10.160> far<00:06:10.370> which<00:06:10.580> is<00:06:10.610> pretty<00:06:10.910> exciting<00:06:11.260> also<00:06:12.260> we

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
so far which is pretty exciting also we

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.800 
so far which is pretty exciting also we
will<00:06:12.530> have<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:12.920> srr<00:06:13.610> 61<00:06:14.270> which<00:06:14.450> is<00:06:14.600> actually

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
will have the srr 61 which is actually

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.710 
will have the srr 61 which is actually
the<00:06:15.110> m200<00:06:15.740> intervention<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.820> if<00:06:17.240> every<00:06:17.510> one<00:06:17.570> of

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
scam because I don't think it actually

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.640 
scam because I don't think it actually
has<00:06:28.490> been<00:06:28.730> shown<00:06:29.120> yet<00:06:29.360> and<00:06:29.570> if<00:06:29.900> you<00:06:30.350> look<00:06:30.500> it<00:06:30.590> up

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
has been shown yet and if you look it up

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.290 
has been shown yet and if you look it up
in<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:30.830> internet<00:06:31.220> it<00:06:31.670> looks<00:06:31.850> exactly<00:06:31.970> the

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
in the internet it looks exactly the

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.780 
in the internet it looks exactly the
same<00:06:32.390> as<00:06:32.510> the<00:06:32.690> CSL<00:06:33.110> off<00:06:33.200> or<00:06:33.440> so<00:06:34.070> maybe<00:06:34.550> it's

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
same as the CSL off or so maybe it's

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.610 
same as the CSL off or so maybe it's
just<00:06:34.850> a<00:06:35.030> place<00:06:35.210> horrible<00:06:35.360> but<00:06:35.960> we'll<00:06:36.380> see<00:06:36.590> how

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620

SME 98 might actually do more than 100
damage<00:07:07.680> however<00:07:08.610> am<00:07:09.029> it's<00:07:09.509> still<00:07:09.659> the<00:07:09.809> alpha

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080

damage however am it's still the alpha
will<00:07:10.319> see<00:07:10.499> in<00:07:10.559> the<00:07:10.620> better<00:07:10.830> how<00:07:11.039> it<00:07:11.099> turns<00:07:11.339> out

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
will see in the better how it turns out

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.850 
will see in the better how it turns out
and<00:07:11.759> yeah<00:07:12.599> I<00:07:12.810> think<00:07:12.990> this<00:07:13.050> was<00:07:13.259> already<00:07:13.710> the

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
and yeah I think this was already the

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.709 
and yeah I think this was already the
first<00:07:14.099> episode<00:07:14.460> of<00:07:14.490> respawn<00:07:14.909> recon<00:07:15.270> I<00:07:15.419> really

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:15.719 
first episode of respawn recon I really

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:17.779

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
said before since we're already so much

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.290
