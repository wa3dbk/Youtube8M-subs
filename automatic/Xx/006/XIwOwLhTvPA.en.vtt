it texture but also has a very neutral
flavor<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.699> we're<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
flavor as well so we're not going to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.789 
flavor as well so we're not going to
destroy<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> flavor<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> crab<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> then

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
fresh thyme you can just use your

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.399 
fresh thyme you can just use your
fingers<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.049> sprinkle<00:01:07.229> tiny

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
fingers and just a little sprinkle tiny

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.500 
fingers and just a little sprinkle tiny
little<00:01:07.740> pinch<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.280> strong<00:01:08.970> flavor<00:01:09.299> but

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
little pinch in there strong flavor but

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.359 
little pinch in there strong flavor but
again<00:01:09.780> quite<00:01:10.110> neutral<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.159> going

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
again quite neutral so that's not going

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.940
