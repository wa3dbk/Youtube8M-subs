00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.030
 I was so bad we prepared first 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.019
 hello to all a few years ago we 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.720
 came to make a small assessment on this 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.610
 historical gem called the park 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.390
 tech taste is in the heart of the city 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.520
 Chamonix 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.740
 and then a few years later 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.289
 we're back we're just doing another 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.239
 record for a little what has changed in 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.469
 this green space which is one of 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.120
 last green spaces of the 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.550
 downtown then already a what 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.499
 regards access to the park cost and side 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.670
 downtown 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:54.219
 force is to find that not big 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:56.769
 thing has changed in the feet of 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.929
 the old hotel cost must be said 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.609
 that these buildings like the rest of the park 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.039
 we are not too much for another or held 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.010
 informed about projects or about this 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.020
 that we are considering for this space is for 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 the moment force is to note that me 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 it is the expectation anyway 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.270
 so the hotel cost it was a hotel 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 very popular in the 19th century and which has 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.340
 welcomed many pioneers of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.860
 mountaineering with the park so is located 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.420
 just behind us we are really at 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.600
 foot of what was once called the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.970
 Hill crest or ducrettet hill 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.470
 we even say that it would not have organized 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.140
 executions a certain time in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.150
 anyway this hill is part of 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.320
 park was costing and we'll see that park 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.450
 he has a history extremely 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.950
 interesting that they are well seen from 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 update today we can 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 imagine today activity when 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.009
 even I do not have much to do 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.140
 to bring people back to this park 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.640
 is giving him the life he deserves in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.649
 anyway it's true that today the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.320
 finding it is final it's 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.810
 wasteland everywhere we vaguely have a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.850
 little bit restore the wall of the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.440
 turret that is behind but otherwise is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.110
 absolutely nothing done is tags 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.330
 everything is pretty dirty that drags 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.220
 we do not really know it's a place that is 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.350
 completely abandoned was 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.350
 fourth dimension in the heart of chamonix 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.720
 here is the little turret by costing who 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.310
 is a tower they once served 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.620
 the observation post 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.630
 so far we were in a park place 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.860
 hotelier in fact and so the customers who 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.230
 had stayed in the valley of the property 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.740
 from the top of this tower she with 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.750
 a telescope 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.940
 I observed associating them with the mont blanc 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.500
 so far we observe we observe everything 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 the entire climb of the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.650
 mont blanc tca as it was done at 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.090
 this time then the time we are 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.250
 in the early stages mountaineering the mount 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.950
 white will become a fashionable ascent 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.600
 but it's still an expedition there is everything 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.580
 a lot of things around here and there I 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.560
 a little fun little lists that 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 gives you a little bit of what it was 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.390
 the time when we will see that we will have 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.500
 change a lot 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.910
 so in fact it's the list of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.130
 provisions for the song of Mont Blanc 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.530
 at the london hotel in chamonix on the 12th 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.390
 August 1851 then the customers leave 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.770
 with 60 bottles of ordinary wine six 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.450
 bottles of bordeaux 10 of 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.580
 saint-georges 15 of saint-jean 3 of 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.470
 cognac one of raspberry syrup 6 of 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.210
 champagne lemonade wines loaf of bread 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.940
 said little cheese chi chocolate package 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.920
 six packs on top 4 prunes 4ne 4 not 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 framed a bag of salt packets 4 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.310
 candle of wax if lemon 4 legs of wax 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.170
 sheep 4 button shoulders six pieces 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.300
 Vaud a piece of beef with large 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.460
 poultry and 35 chicken for a total of 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.620
 456 francs so that's it gives you a 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.120
 little idea of how 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.660
 mountaineering at the time it was a real 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.970
 conquest 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.580
 today we would have to think about going back to 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.180
 the conquest of stars that for now 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.180
 remain rather closed 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.330
 here we are in the path of the folate 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.830
 is lined with very very beautiful walls that 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.730
 are made with moraine blocks on 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.730
 will see right after why 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.660
 the park was costing it's actually located on 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.770
 an old moraine of a glacier that 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.269
 was going to become a few thousand 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.190
 years later the sea of ​​ice 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.829
 this death is the front-end that has been 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.919
 deposited here at the time by this glacier 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.080
 whose remains are clearly visible 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.360
 those big erratic blocks that were 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.250
 so moved deposited here by the glacier 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.810
 who are under my feet but who formed 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.660
 also just now as we saw and 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.900
 well the walls that surround this path of 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.900
 madness 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.340
 before leaving the park we will go to 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.550
 the discovery of another place 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.550
 historical 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.870
 behind me the villa of the spinette 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.770
 wonderful examples of architectured 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.599
 last century 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.490
 we are in the art nouveau built by 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.050
 a joseph chamoniard cost and did not 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.750
 retained for a few years a 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.000
 historical character of chamonix who has 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.590
 been mayor of the city who is also a 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.479
 historical figure of the world of 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.620
 mountaineering its wounds which is called 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.940
 maurice herzog 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.879
 so that's the first climb 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.009
 the annapurna especially with him lachenal 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.620
 since the house was bought by the 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.280
 chamonix town hall and over the years 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.750
 different projects succeed each other in the 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.669
 tries to realize one of his 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.940
 projects little by little the house gets 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.940
 dilapidated 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.940
 before coming out and leaving the park 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.040
 cost hoping it does not stay too 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.710
 long in this state we will discover 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.710
 the great mystery of the residence astoria 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.630
 the residence astoria so who is 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.000
 built really goes to the outskirts 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.889
 immediate parks end up besides 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.050
 to access this residence the 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.990
 workers they had to break this part 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.220
 from the wall that border the path of madness 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.810
 so are they going to rebuild it go they 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.330
 leave the apartment she just in 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.039
 down in the complete night because we 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.780
 imagine that if we go up the wall and 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.260
 once the harkis are there will have 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.940
 their leaves 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.919
 the gentleman who lives there he is going to be 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.419
 in the dark then we will sacrifice the 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.130
 trees are we going to sacrifice the wall 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.870
 the future will tell us not the other 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.940
 mystery of this residence is its 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.350
 Access priori since it brings 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.510
 that she has no car access does not have any 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.639
 parking is no garage we are told that 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.680
 it's a municipal will not to 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.210
 to build 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.490
 car parks were because of age in the 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.230
 center finally comes I imagine renters 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.890
 who should bring his grand piano 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.890
 on hair 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.960
 ok great fusion of all this is that this 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.340
 park that for now they stay in 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.780
 the state where we found it a few months ago 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.160
 years where it was already many years 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.200
 before that is completely 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.570
 abandoned it would be nice if we could 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.400
 have the hope of reappropriating this 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.170
 historical space that could become 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.310
 playful where we could make 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.710
 animations anyway they 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.780
 would come back to life and what have I 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:18.090
 again the last space of 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.090
 historic greenery in the center shooting united
