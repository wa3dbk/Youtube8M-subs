background<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.750> indeed<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> really

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

folks where it's coming from and we can

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
folks where it's coming from and we can
cut<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.410> is<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> diagram<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.790> Paul

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
cut to it this is a diagram that Paul

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170 
cut to it this is a diagram that Paul
made<00:01:30.210> himself<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:31.290> yes<00:01:32.160> on<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.880> diagram

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
made himself there yes on this diagram

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.660 
made himself there yes on this diagram
you<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.259> earth<00:01:34.410> is<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.830> green<00:01:35.040> circle

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you see the earth is the green circle

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.060 
you see the earth is the green circle
and<00:01:35.940> there's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> line<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.590> through<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and there's a line going through it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
and there's a line going through it
which<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.580> geosynchronous<00:01:39.119> satellite

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
which is the geosynchronous satellite

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
which is the geosynchronous satellite
ring<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.740> ring<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.160> satellites<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
ring that is the ring of satellites that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
ring that is the ring of satellites that
encircles<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.509> earth<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> we're<00:01:43.500> looking<00:01:43.830> at

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
encircles the earth and we're looking at

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.469 
encircles the earth and we're looking at
an<00:01:44.070> edge<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.820> essentially<00:01:45.300> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
an edge on which is essentially the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.860 
an edge on which is essentially the
equator<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.100> asteroid<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.150> is<00:01:48.330> passing

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
equator the the asteroid now is passing

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.930 
equator the the asteroid now is passing
from<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.229> bottom<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.770> top<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.850> are

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
from the bottom to the top and there are

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.420 
from the bottom to the top and there are
little<00:01:51.210> time<00:01:51.750> tags<00:01:52.050> indicating<00:01:52.650> at<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.190> time

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
little time tags indicating at what time

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.250 
little time tags indicating at what time
it<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.760> at<00:01:54.120> what<00:01:54.390> point<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.750> we're<00:01:54.900> getting

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
it is at what point and we're getting

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.410 
it is at what point and we're getting
very<00:01:55.470> close<00:01:55.620> to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.100> actual<00:01:56.940> closest

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
very close to the actual closest

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.930 
very close to the actual closest
approach<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.440> just<00:01:58.890> below<00:01:59.430> that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
approach so it is just below that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.300 
approach so it is just below that
satellite<00:02:00.630> ring<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.170> very<00:02:01.620> soon<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.010> will

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
satellite ring and very soon it will

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
satellite ring and very soon it will
pass<00:02:02.490> within<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.330> ring<00:02:03.510> which<00:02:03.720> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
pass within the ring which is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.240 
pass within the ring which is
essentially<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.440> time<00:02:04.650> of<00:02:04.830> closest<00:02:05.159> approach

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
essentially the time of closest approach

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.460 
essentially the time of closest approach
and<00:02:05.970> facts<00:02:06.210> are<00:02:06.450> worried<00:02:06.720> about<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.020> worried

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
and facts are worried about that worried

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.100 
and facts are worried about that worried
about<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.429> any<00:02:08.640> possibility<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.869> one

farther away ten times farther away than
our<00:02:50.689> uncertainty<00:02:51.199> so<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.579> on<00:02:52.790> an<00:02:52.879> orbit

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
our uncertainty so it is on an orbit

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.479 
our uncertainty so it is on an orbit
which<00:02:54.049> would<00:02:54.230> mean<00:02:54.439> that<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.949> could<00:02:55.159> come<00:02:55.340> back

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
which would mean that it could come back

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.580 
which would mean that it could come back
yes<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.329> fact<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.689> that<00:02:56.750> diagram<00:02:57.260> as<00:02:57.500> you

yes and in fact in that diagram as you

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.890 
yes and in fact in that diagram as you
recall<00:02:57.949> you<00:02:58.579> could<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.329> effect<00:02:59.659> of<00:02:59.780> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
recall you could see the effect of the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.899 
recall you could see the effect of the
earth<00:03:00.049> on<00:03:00.439> the<00:03:00.620> Sun<00:03:00.859> on<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.099> asteroid<00:03:01.400> if

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
earth on the Sun on the asteroid if

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.429 
earth on the Sun on the asteroid if
there<00:03:02.090> was<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.209> significant<00:03:02.810> ending<00:03:03.199> of<00:03:03.319> its

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
there was a significant ending of its

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.229 
there was a significant ending of its
trajectory<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.189> the<00:03:04.340> asteroid<00:03:04.849> orbit<00:03:05.120> will

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
trajectory so the asteroid orbit will

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.039 
trajectory so the asteroid orbit will
change<00:03:05.510> quite<00:03:05.689> a<00:03:05.810> bit

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
change quite a bit

close approach its period around the Sun

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.099 
close approach its period around the Sun
was<00:03:12.310> 366<00:03:13.310> days<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:14.120> after<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:14.900> close

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.460 
actually will shrink a little it's open
above<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.519> Sun<00:03:19.759> so<00:03:20.329> when<00:03:20.750> will<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:20.959> come<00:03:21.319> back

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
above the Sun so when will it come back

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.949 
above the Sun so when will it come back
and<00:03:21.530> where<00:03:21.979> will<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.370> come<00:03:22.400> back<00:03:22.699> to<00:03:22.909> well<00:03:23.449> will

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
and where will it come back to well will

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.749 
and where will it come back to well will

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.949 
Lance was talking about the the
information<00:03:52.159> that<00:03:52.699> the<00:03:52.909> radar<00:03:53.329> can<00:03:53.659> give<00:03:53.810> us

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
information that the radar can give us

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.050 
information that the radar can give us
Lance's<00:03:54.560> information<00:03:55.129> is<00:03:55.250> very<00:03:55.459> helpful<00:03:55.699> in

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
Lance's information is very helpful in

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.330 
Lance's information is very helpful in

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.520 
miles that's as close as it will get and
then<00:04:37.450> we'll<00:04:37.630> start<00:04:37.840> heading<00:04:37.960> up

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
then we'll start heading up

then we'll start heading up
and<00:04:40.040> that's<00:04:40.310> at<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.520> point<00:04:40.850> where<00:04:41.180> folks<00:04:41.810> in

Europe and then finally North America as
its<00:04:45.470> heading<00:04:45.860> out<00:04:46.040> is<00:04:46.550> about<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.030> time<00:04:47.270> that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
its heading out is about the time that

its heading out is about the time that
we'll<00:04:48.080> be<00:04:48.230> able<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.530> see<00:04:48.740> it<00:04:48.830> yes<00:04:49.070> it's<00:04:49.280> going

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
we'll be able to see it yes it's going

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.670 
we'll be able to see it yes it's going
from<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.910> far<00:04:50.090> south<00:04:50.420> now<00:04:51.200> it's<00:04:51.380> over<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
from the far south now it's over the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.320 
from the far south now it's over the
equator<00:04:51.950> and<00:04:52.280> we'll<00:04:52.460> be<00:04:52.550> heading<00:04:52.970> straight

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
equator and we'll be heading straight

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.630 
equator and we'll be heading straight
north<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:53.960> going<00:04:53.990> essentially<00:04:54.890> near<00:04:55.520> the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
north and going essentially near the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.110 
north and going essentially near the
North<00:04:55.820> Pole

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
North Pole

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.810 
North Pole
so<00:04:56.540> now<00:04:56.720> we<00:04:56.780> will<00:04:56.990> have<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.530> polar<00:04:57.860> in<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.610> sky

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
so now we will have the polar in the sky

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.160 
so now we will have the polar in the sky
and<00:04:59.090> we'll<00:04:59.210> have<00:04:59.390> a<00:04:59.420> chance<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.840> see<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.080> from

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
and we'll have a chance to see it from

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.960 
and we'll have a chance to see it from
the<00:05:00.260> northern<00:05:00.620> hemisphere<00:05:00.770> now<00:05:01.100> all<00:05:01.670> right

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
the northern hemisphere now all right

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.660 
the northern hemisphere now all right
the<00:05:02.780> counter<00:05:03.110> is<00:05:03.230> zero<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.860> has<00:05:03.890> passed
