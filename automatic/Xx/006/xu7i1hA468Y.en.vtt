00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:03.689
 It is malicious on April 29 this year 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.930
 Park- 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.789
 Multi 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.839
 Though it is one line proof 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.219
 The one with built-in pickup is released 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.219
 It has been 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.760
 Yoshio Kajitani is the cause of the crime of mound though 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.449
 For example, external exchange 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.669
 It has come out 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.390
 This is a crowded thing 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.150
 It is this place when it is somehow 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 Listen to the same special thing or from the best abandoned side 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750
 I liked the next Chidaka 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.740
 There are also things that can be said to pick up the sound 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.430
 Those 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.360
 This time is it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.650
 Because it is built-in 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.650
 I will try to explain what 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.400
 It is matching result now from time to time 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.239
 Digital content was done 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.920
 But it is in a state 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.410
 Sound comes out after the competition 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.680
 It is said 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.970
 I think there are not many people who feel North America 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.690
 From 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.130
 But from the boat tournament 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.740
 Gather 3861 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.770
 The power is a little unique so it's unique 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.390
 It will be low in the middle of the forest, so normal actaddic 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.010
 With many uploads 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.070
 But things 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.190
 In the form of central use-interference with Pakistan 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.220
 Though I'm eliminating 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
 I just think I'm working on No. 2 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.290
 I will say 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.010
 I will buy it 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.650
 Also, for the reverb, it is a guitar amplifier 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.310
 As there are many things which enter 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.320
 I can use sl and it is very interesting personally after that 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.330
 I thought that I released 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.500
 Just as I said before, it was accurate 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.270
 Even 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.600
 I would like to talk about dramas 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 Original thing 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.769
 but 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.769
 Sound that comes out after that 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.599
 I think that the lyrics are very interesting that this is exposed 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.179
 For example 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.179
 On the other hand clarified information update 2 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.699
 One side also 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.699
 Production of client equipment 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.039
 Western Union Company 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
 This is a part of this 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.039
 This once base 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.649
 Some countries are not themselves 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.649
 I think in the bork after return 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.259
 this is 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.719
 What to take as this item 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.179
 Straight 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.949
 Seems to be able 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.479
 By people 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.479
 is there 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.380
 Just cut 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.429
 Hashishita Diary 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.629
 Failure 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.629
 Pulled 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.549
 Because 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.729
 Big 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.119
 If 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.119
 I will list up the freedom block 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.669
 Even if I let out about No. 16 earlier 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.399
 It is beautiful recently 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.519
 The timing is also very beautiful 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.079
 For example, there is me 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.520
 The point that I did a quick search and Yoshida I finally got it 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.620
 Proposal 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.400
 update1 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.859
 the only 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.569
 Anan run person in charge 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.609
 It's like that 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.870
 You can set up a store, this is in the chair country 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.569
 Amp .8 minutes 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.819
 Film 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.379
 I did this and told Bob Dylan in a series of tones 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:26.670
 However 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.569
 I will 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:28.610
 Become 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.629
 There are various models like sl but basically 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:33.520
 Or change 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.570
 Touchch Fitch 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.379
 However I left 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.360
 Put on disposable 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.090
 Ne 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.529
 f1 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.529
 next 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.870
 Just not 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.599
 Originally by the store 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:54.930
 Not this 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.849
 mpa 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.099
 Because I am doing it for a long time 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.089
 If you try to go to f1 test, it is not a commemorative photo at Baba 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.659
 Is it 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:03.699
 Because 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.699
 This kind of scout 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.669
 Japanese drama that 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.900
 It is the sky from July 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.330
 Until now I thought that I was going to go ahead and it was quite difficult, that article 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.430
 Won 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.979
 It's easy too 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.979
 I got another countless video 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.589
 Because it will be one form, it is by all means 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:30.080
 Although this is possible and tired in the game 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.770
 Such a thing is actually 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.099
 I said I wanted to 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.270
 Even if there is such a thing, your dogs are various 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.969
 Because there is 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.969
 This is a person who has come before me 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:44.240
 If you are doing drama 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.180
 I am thinking of being a panda and I am the guitarist in Tokyo 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.160
 It is connected by whether there is a sector 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.710
 Just by experimenting 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.480
 You can get along better with liquid strikes 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.650
 I think there are many benefits 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.850
 Please try to use aed to correct the difference between the city's three axes
