00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.010 
use any of these rod holders directly in
the<00:01:28.860> freedom<00:01:29.070> track<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> screw<00:01:30.840> ball

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the freedom track so the screw ball

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.140 
the freedom track so the screw ball
simply<00:01:31.470> slides<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.990> then<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> twist<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
simply slides right in then you twist it

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.660 
simply slides right in then you twist it
to<00:01:36.150> tighten<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:37.100> then<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.220> locked<00:01:38.460> right

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to tighten it up then it's locked right

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
to tighten it up then it's locked right
in<00:01:38.820> place<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.170> take<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.710> rod

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
in place then you can take your rod
