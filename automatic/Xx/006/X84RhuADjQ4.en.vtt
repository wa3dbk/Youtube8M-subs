00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
well the next step is to jump into this

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.880 
well the next step is to jump into this
water<00:00:37.480> don't<00:00:37.809> worry<00:00:37.960> there's<00:00:38.230> no<00:00:38.350> zombies<00:00:38.739> or

any sort of well there could be some
weird<00:00:40.300> stuff<00:00:40.510> in<00:00:40.660> there<00:00:40.809> but<00:00:40.840> once<00:00:41.680> you're<00:00:41.890> in

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949

weird stuff in there but once you're in
this<00:00:42.100> nasty-looking<00:00:42.519> water<00:00:42.940> swim<00:00:43.360> through

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
this nasty-looking water swim through

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:53.910 
this nasty-looking water swim through
this<00:00:43.690> pipe<00:00:51.629> okay<00:00:52.629> so<00:00:52.690> you<00:00:52.930> see<00:00:53.290> how<00:00:53.410> people<00:00:53.620> are

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
this pipe okay so you see how people are

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.500 
this pipe okay so you see how people are
starting<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.309> disappear<00:00:54.820> up<00:00:54.970> front<00:00:55.239> that's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
starting to disappear up front that's

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.920 
starting to disappear up front that's
where<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:55.930> glitch<00:00:56.199> is<00:00:56.229> going<00:00:56.470> to<00:00:56.530> take<00:00:56.710> place

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
where this glitch is going to take place

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.479 
where this glitch is going to take place
so<00:00:58.930> once<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.290> get<00:00:59.470> here<00:00:59.920> I<00:01:00.010> know<00:01:00.159> it's<00:01:00.309> kind<00:01:00.430> of

through the pipe and you're gonna be out
of<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.380> map<00:01:11.530> it's<00:01:11.740> as<00:01:11.979> simple<00:01:12.340> as<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.670> from

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
of the map it's as simple as that from

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.030 
of the map it's as simple as that from
here<00:01:13.360> you<00:01:13.570> can<00:01:13.600> explore<00:01:14.110> wherever<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.860> want

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040

to go to an extent pretty much where the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.310 
to go to an extent pretty much where the
water<00:01:18.100> ends<00:01:18.340> that's<00:01:19.299> where<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.630> ends<00:01:19.869> you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
water ends that's where it ends you

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.899 
water ends that's where it ends you
can't<00:01:20.619> go<00:01:20.799> too<00:01:20.860> much<00:01:21.159> further<00:01:21.400> out<00:01:21.580> however
