00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
 Hello 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.040
 Kyowa Leather Vending Machine For Winter Cigarette Buying Vending Machine 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.720
 Sideways because it was good with the agus vending machine 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.749
 eh 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.050
 However 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.119
 So I'm not a person 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.730
 In 1 before 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.579
 I ended up with a vending machine at the Taiyaki store 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.649
 I am doing the replacement work of eh tires 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.800
 Former vending machines are next to vending machines that buy cigarettes 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.690
 Because there is something new to Ikawa's new woman in the department store 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840
 I saw it, but it looks like this 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 Moisten a blend of fruits named Tropicana 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 is not it 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 It was a little bit because there was a movie 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.580
 The peach in the prefecture is so law 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.230
 An example of the same Fusoko glucose 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.690
 Is not it 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.940
 It is right 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.210
 Raw material name 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.570
 Yes, I'm going to be Tsunami mixed on the policy of drinking 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.510
 Who is the raw material name 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.300
 I already have 15 oranges 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.330
 As it is written here 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.510
 But it's about 15 times more orange 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.970
 After all it is called Kirin Beverage 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.260
 It's about time you got calories 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.659
 If you have low calories 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.149
 Oh 48 calories per 100 grams 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.520
 about it 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.410
 What is it like? 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.840
 815 is included 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.630
 In expectation 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.630
 Pink line Ichikawa City 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.200
 Chinese 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 Unexpectedly orange color 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.890
 Expected around 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.340
 Overwinter looks orange 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.059
 Right 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.989
 Perfectly orange and colored 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.069
 Though 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.279
 The foot I was responding to 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.279
 After all you lose it high rating 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.549
 I do not know well, but how is it 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.709
 What will it be? 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.709
 I'm drinking 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.939
 I want to run a trail 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.399
 If you taste 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.819
 8 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:40.849
 that 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849
 More than delicious 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.759
 I leave that on the platter, but I have 15 people every day 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.039
 Former grapes are put and it is 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.039
 It should be easy with 9 people 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.029
 It seems to be overwintering 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:00.880
 Percentage 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.179
 Pretty cheap 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.179
 32 low 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:07.620
 Grandly orange 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.989
 I also feel like three people 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.609
 Is it local? 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.359
 I will go on a little more 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.459
 Aso if it is already dropped 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.109
 I think I'm going to be a cartoonist 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.559
 doing 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.039
 That's nostalgic 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.849
 It feels like the opposition orange is too high 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.729
 Though 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.899
 It is not bad 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.109
 Yes you drink 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.109
 It is not said that it was said from mass six days 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.349
 That looks good for the body 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.619
 I feel 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.909
 It's easy but I would like you to scrutinize
