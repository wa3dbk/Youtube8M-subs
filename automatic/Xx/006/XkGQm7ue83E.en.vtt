00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
time I'll draw lots of lines and then

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.970 
time I'll draw lots of lines and then
erased<00:02:28.090> most<00:02:28.269> of<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.600> afterwards<00:02:29.080> until<00:02:29.290> my

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
erased most of them afterwards until my

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.380 
erased most of them afterwards until my
brain<00:02:30.220> sort<00:02:30.519> of<00:02:30.640> said<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.940> me<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.209> looks
