00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
strange that now I've grew up to be not

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.070 
strange that now I've grew up to be not
only<00:01:15.700> acting<00:01:16.420> in<00:01:16.510> one<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.720> my<00:01:16.810> very<00:01:16.990> favorite

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.890 

I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:26.370> it's<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> greatest<00:01:26.910> idea<00:01:27.240> i<00:01:27.660> think

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
I think it's the greatest idea i think

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
I think it's the greatest idea i think
it's<00:01:28.020> unbelievable<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:28.890> makes<00:01:29.070> sense

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's unbelievable and it makes sense

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.560 
it's unbelievable and it makes sense
because<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> park<00:01:29.940> was<00:01:30.090> open<00:01:30.360> right<00:01:30.540> now

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
because if a park was open right now

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.510 
because if a park was open right now
look<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.140> parks<00:01:31.410> that<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.250> that

animation the challenge with that is

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.650 
animation the challenge with that is
creating<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.460> real<00:02:42.700> reaction<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.630> know

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
creating a real reaction you know

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.650 
creating a real reaction you know
because<00:02:43.990> if<00:02:44.440> you're<00:02:44.680> acting<00:02:45.180> they<00:02:46.180> saw<00:02:46.630> I

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
because if you're acting they saw I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.850 
because if you're acting they saw I
don't<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:46.840> who<00:02:47.020> said<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.560> made<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.710> lot

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
don't know who said it but it made a lot

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
of sense they say acting is reacting you

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.990 
of sense they say acting is reacting you
know<00:02:50.080> someone<00:02:50.350> says<00:02:50.650> something<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.610> don't

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.270 
know someone says something you don't
say<00:02:52.390> your<00:02:52.540> next<00:02:52.780> line<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.470> just<00:02:53.500> react<00:02:53.950> you

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
say your next line you just react you

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.460

line with by which you reacted or with
which<00:02:59.470> with<00:03:00.040> that's<00:03:00.730> how<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:00.910> react<00:03:01.270> someone

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
which with that's how you react someone

which with that's how you react someone
says<00:03:01.810> something<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.170> react<00:03:02.560> now<00:03:02.950> someone

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
says something you react now someone

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.090 
says something you react now someone
gives<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.970> look<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.540> react<00:03:04.900> if<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.920> just

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
gives you a look you react if you just

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.370 
gives you a look you react if you just
be<00:03:06.220> present<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.000> moment<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.720> look<00:03:08.230> at

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
be present in the moment and you look at

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.530 
be present in the moment and you look at
something<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:09.040> easy<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.940> act<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:10.390> when

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
something it's easy to act but when

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.910 
something it's easy to act but when
nothing<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:10.990> there<00:03:11.200> can<00:03:11.380> be<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.560> little<00:03:11.680> crazy

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
nothing is there can be a little crazy

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.410 
nothing is there can be a little crazy
when<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.310> little<00:03:12.520> different<00:03:12.850> difficult<00:03:13.240> and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
when you little different difficult and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.690 
when you little different difficult and
so<00:03:14.080> we<00:03:14.830> just<00:03:15.010> tried<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.459> recreate<00:03:16.360> we<00:03:16.690> try<00:03:16.900> to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
so we just tried to recreate we try to

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.640 
so we just tried to recreate we try to
simulate<00:03:18.700> some<00:03:19.600> sort<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.900> emotional<00:03:20.140> response

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
simulate some sort of emotional response

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.070 
simulate some sort of emotional response
by<00:03:20.800> giving<00:03:21.250> us<00:03:21.820> something<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.390> react<00:03:22.690> off<00:03:22.900> of

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
by giving us something to react off of

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.960 
by giving us something to react off of
so<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.830> cameras<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.310> nice<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.489> tight<00:03:24.730> like

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
so the cameras in nice and tight like

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.190 
so the cameras in nice and tight like
this<00:03:25.180> one<00:03:25.450> right<00:03:25.570> here<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.870> don't<00:03:26.019> see

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
this one right here and you don't see

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.810 
this one right here and you don't see
anything<00:03:26.410> outside<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.250> frame<00:03:27.580> right

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
anything outside of this frame right

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.060 
anything outside of this frame right
here<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.690> know<00:03:28.720> they'll<00:03:29.350> have<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.620> dinosaur

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
here you know they'll have a dinosaur

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.979 
here you know they'll have a dinosaur
right<00:03:30.430> there<00:03:30.730> but<00:03:31.090> it'll<00:03:31.239> be<00:03:31.269> like<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.510> person

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
right there but it'll be like a person

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.690 
right there but it'll be like a person
wearing<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.440> dinosaur<00:03:32.890> helmet<00:03:33.250> or<00:03:33.400> maybe<00:03:33.640> a

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
wearing a dinosaur helmet or maybe a

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.250 
wearing a dinosaur helmet or maybe a
puppet<00:03:34.180> or<00:03:34.510> something<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.050> could<00:03:35.140> really

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
puppet or something that I could really

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.740 
puppet or something that I could really
look<00:03:35.680> at<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.820> was<00:03:36.970> important<00:03:37.450> in

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
look at and and that was important in

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.100 
look at and and that was important in
key<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.320> kind<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:38.860> creating<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.340> emotional

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
key to kind of creating that emotional

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.180 
key to kind of creating that emotional
relationship<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.260> actually<00:03:41.680> does<00:03:41.890> exist

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
relationship that actually does exist

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.640

between Owen and his creatures like you

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.800 
between Owen and his creatures like you
need<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.980> feel<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.489> he<00:03:46.060> cares<00:03:46.330> about<00:03:46.630> them

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
need to feel like he cares about them
