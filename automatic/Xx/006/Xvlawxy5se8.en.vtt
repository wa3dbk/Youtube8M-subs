00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 All are well with my dear swami friends 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.200
 morocco 7 today i would like to show 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.389
 you an entertaining fight on Fri-Sau 8th 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 at15 level on ruinberg map many 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.880
 consider this fri sau somehow themselves say 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.279
 that she can't play her 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.859
 I did not like it drags on like 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.010
 armored but in essence and all 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.730
 punch and she has nothing but 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.040
 guns with good ohm dpm and excellent 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.989
 accuracy is it really 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.989
 partially yes really wrote can 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 to be not the most nagibator skaya but in skilled 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.920
 hands and luck in general she can 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 excellent bending and as you can see 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.649
 the player hit the top of the list everyone else 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.730
 tanks of the seventh level that is below 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 level 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.289
 and it gives a chance to our hero just 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.000
 to tear everyone here to shreds immediately 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.339
 goes to attack knowing that he should 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 dominate and he begins 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.200
 shoot with e25 naturally 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 German Fri-Sau 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.830
 too overestimated her strength she 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.640
 played incorrectly got up and at15 and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.189
 quickly dismantled but still in this 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.009
 british fri-sa very high dpm i 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.040
 one on one she is very good at analyzing 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.430
 classmate well, and the tanks below in general 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.799
 just fly away in the hangar may be at at15 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.210
 not the best booking though 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.579
 Overall, it is not bad 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.220
 and find in the top, in principle, you can 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.700
 great to tank especially if you know 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.920
 plus this fri sau fall off is 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 the fact that she has very good angles 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.500
 horizontal pickups meaning you can 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.570
 shoot from the corner there somehow 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.200
 seriously turn the body set 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.049
 damage to the enemy will be harder for you 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.799
 punch and at15 uses this chip by 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.240
 full rides here kv-3 man broke away from 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.340
 groups of their own 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.400
 allies and he is alone here which means 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.490
 that pdp him at15 of course it will be 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.770
 punch besides kv-3 can not always 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.690
 cause damage as you can see 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.230
 shoots somewhere in the hull although it could 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.430
 go out latin on the roof here he is at all 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.910
 can and at15 naturally uses it 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.520
 and very quickly examines the Soviet tyazha 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.260
 well, plus she tries to knock him go 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.720
 so that the square-3 could not twist and in general 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.420
 it is all quite true, that's why 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.000
 needed this apt-3 go ahead there 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.550
 when you could wait for your 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 allies and the three of us have at least something 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.470
 to make 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.190
 T29 and black prince come at15 very 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.630
 quickly t29 sends to the hangar and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.380
 opponents can't even normally you 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.380
 king weaknesses at-15 and cause damage 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.250
 now black prince falls into 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.200
 there is a choke on the roof but he did it then 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.130
 when I already lost most of my 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.370
 strength and at15 perfectly held 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.180
 british harp and good under him 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.820
 disassembled 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.459
 Well, here it is natural black prince already 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.530
 service starts when lost almost all 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.120
 his strength is true what was he thinking 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.090
 earlier it is not clear and . trying to pierce 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.040
 black prince to the tower but fail it 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.250
 do all the same there is armor pretty 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.650
 much and here she decides to shoot at 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.780
 corps and destroys black prince 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.340
 Well, here from eshko could very much 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 not bad here to talk 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.560
 and dismantled almost all the enemies here 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.820
 who were near you can now go to 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.980
 the base here is worth E25 and t-43 naturally 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.510
 German Fri-Shka could not do anything here 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.530
 make in a frontal shootout and at15 her 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.530
 disassembled and 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.260
 t-43 begins to roll back because 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.000
 which is natural also his chances 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.169
 there is still a little bit of 537 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.290
 just as long as you're out from here . 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.770
 realizes your over dpm rides and smashes 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.750
 all enemies are just shocked 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.750
 they know where to go though I would be on 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.970
 place without art tried to spin from 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.199
 Well, after all, it is not so fast and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.260
 if shot down 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:38.500
 you pop it could it be here quietly 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.960
 twist but she didn't and 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.580
 so went to the hangar stayed 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.100
 last opponent boss can say 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.100
 t69 top enemy tank of the eighth 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.120
 level rolls away from the back leaves 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.300
 the enemy she inflicts damage on him t69 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.150
 rolls back though he might try 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.699
 there from the drum to be weak spots and if 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.310
 would be a space two times you would be 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.860
 finished though here it is very convenient for me 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.010
 it was still shooting distance 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.190
 so close and but in any case with 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.789
 his drum could be easy 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.770
 disassemble ptshku well here he leaves 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.410
 determines does not break it again 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.349
 heals out any weak places just 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.520
 flying somewhere apparently the only thing 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.380
 it occurred to him to spin at15 he 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.470
 approaching but the head turns 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.020
 just trying to knock down the t69 caterpillar but 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.979
 it is not even required because it succeeds 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.530
 set it on fire and it burns well and here is a 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.039
 medals in this battle warrior main caliber 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:53.500
 steel wall medal of the pool as well 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:56.380
 detailed result of 8052 damage and 10 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.590
 frags the result is generally pretty 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.470
 good in the opposing team no matter how 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.650
 strangely best played t-60 fake 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.020
 then from but in general opponents of course 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.370
 sagrads extremely bad they did not commit 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.940
 errors because of what 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.889
 and played here is a detailed report and in 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.420
 the whole fight I personally liked it 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.270
 quite vigorous when 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.520
 no and slow fri-sau but even she 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.400
 sometimes bends well and that's all friends 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.490
 I wish you good luck and do not forget 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.360
