you bring it more this way we're in an

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.070 
you bring it more this way we're in an
open<00:02:40.140> area<00:02:40.940> well<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.240> might<00:02:42.450> land<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:42.990> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
open area well it might land it in the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.620 
open area well it might land it in the
trees<00:02:43.350> bro<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.550> stop<00:02:44.910> return<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.480> home

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
trees bro can you stop return to home

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.570 
trees bro can you stop return to home
and<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.230> then<00:02:46.440> take<00:02:46.680> control<00:02:46.920> ok<00:02:47.280> all

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.480 
and then and then take control ok all
right<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:48.710> think<00:02:49.710> it's<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.100> go<00:02:50.160> straight

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
right I think it's going to go straight

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.200 
right I think it's going to go straight
down<00:02:50.610> into<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.210> trees<00:02:51.450> man<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.290> think

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
down into the trees man is what I think

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.690 
down into the trees man is what I think
so<00:02:54.210> if<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.660> were<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.110> when<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.490> like

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
so if I were you when it's like

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.790 
so if I were you when it's like
20<00:02:57.210> feet<00:02:57.390> up<00:02:57.570> from<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.960> trees<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.260> would<00:02:58.620> bring

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
20 feet up from the trees I would bring

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.610 
20 feet up from the trees I would bring
it<00:02:58.950> back<00:02:59.130> but<00:02:59.990> if<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.080> could<00:03:01.200> bring<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.470> back

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it back but if you could bring it back

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.470

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
little closer to us you know I mean just

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.790 
little closer to us you know I mean just
just<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.580> don't<00:04:02.880> land<00:04:03.600> in<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.170> trees<00:04:04.470> like

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
just so don't land in the trees like

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.520 
just so don't land in the trees like
that's<00:04:05.070> maybe<00:04:05.670> good<00:04:06.090> i<00:04:06.120> don't<00:04:06.540> know<00:04:06.630> right

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
that's maybe good i don't know right

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.270 
that's maybe good i don't know right
yeah<00:04:07.950> right<00:04:08.880> there<00:04:09.120> return<00:04:09.990> to<00:04:10.110> home<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.470> there

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
yeah right there return to home it there

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.210 
yeah right there return to home it there
you<00:04:11.430> go<00:04:11.550> ok<00:04:11.880> cool<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.300> it's<00:04:12.330> activated<00:04:13.220> return

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
you go ok cool so it's activated return

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.820 
you go ok cool so it's activated return
to<00:04:14.400> homs<00:04:14.580> activated<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:15.990> see<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.350> trying<00:04:16.739> to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
to homs activated so see it trying to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.910 
to homs activated so see it trying to
balance<00:04:17.520> itself<00:04:18.180> out<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.750> as<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.380> gets<00:04:19.560> closer

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
balance itself out and as it gets closer

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.289 
balance itself out and as it gets closer
to<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> ground<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.730> seems<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.270> gets

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
to the ground it seems like it gets

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.950 
to the ground it seems like it gets
lower<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.380> gyro<00:04:23.190> works<00:04:23.850> better<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.810> look

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
lower and the gyro works better so look

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.110 
lower and the gyro works better so look
at<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.169> look<00:04:25.620> at<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.800> see<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.100> it's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
at that look at that see that it's

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.240 
at that look at that see that it's
they're<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.960> ground<00:04:28.199> wasn't<00:04:28.590> even<00:04:28.919> look<00:04:29.160> at

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
they're the ground wasn't even look at

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.770 
they're the ground wasn't even look at
that<00:04:29.280> any<00:04:29.820> way<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.000> write<00:04:30.180> look<00:04:30.419> at<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.600> right

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
that any way to write look at that right

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.500 
that any way to write look at that right
went<00:04:30.990> on<00:04:31.110> an<00:04:31.229> even<00:04:31.500> spot<00:04:31.800> did<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.190> see<00:04:32.370> that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
went on an even spot did you see that

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.060 
went on an even spot did you see that
it's<00:04:33.510> sensed<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.110> kurt<00:04:34.410> i<00:04:34.560> think<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.800> sense

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
it's sensed that kurt i think it sense

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.969 
it's sensed that kurt i think it sense
that<00:04:35.250> curve<00:04:35.550> was<00:04:35.790> there<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.180> moved<00:04:36.979> that

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
that curve was there and it moved that

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.860 
that curve was there and it moved that
was<00:04:38.130> cool<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.639> anyway<00:04:38.970> that's<00:04:39.210> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
was cool so anyway that's the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.800 
was cool so anyway that's the
blade<00:04:40.430> whatever<00:04:41.430> just<00:04:41.699> refer<00:04:42.389> back<00:04:42.540> to<00:04:42.600> the

blade whatever just refer back to the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.740 
blade whatever just refer back to the
