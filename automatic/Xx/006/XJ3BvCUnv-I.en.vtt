so I'm going to do is open the little

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:20.859 
so I'm going to do is open the little
pouch<00:00:09.750> here<00:00:11.840> ok<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.049> then<00:00:13.670> unravel<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.030> cable

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.599 

we<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> that's<00:00:23.160> already<00:00:23.430> been

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
other end that's free so there's a
couple<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.080> ways<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.560> measure<00:00:28.740> how<00:00:29.070> long<00:00:29.130> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
couple of ways to measure how long you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.099 
couple of ways to measure how long you
want<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.699> rope<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.449> already<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
the length width we can just measure it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
the length width we can just measure it
up<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.430> cut<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.480> length<00:00:36.690> if

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
up to that and cut it to that length if

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.690 
up to that and cut it to that length if
not<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:38.520> you're<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> want<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.649> is
