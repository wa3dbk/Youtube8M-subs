00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
just because it's gonna be a cool

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.559 
just because it's gonna be a cool
program<00:02:03.829> i'm<00:02:04.280> also<00:02:04.490> going<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.819> start

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
program i'm also going to start

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.139 
program i'm also going to start
transitioning<00:02:06.140> sort<00:02:06.619> of<00:02:06.770> into<00:02:07.159> some<00:02:07.549> spray

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
transitioning sort of into some spray

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.210 
transitioning sort of into some spray
paint<00:02:08.179> stuff<00:02:08.569> over<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> summer<00:02:09.800> someone<00:02:10.130> be

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
paint stuff over the summer someone be

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.559 
paint stuff over the summer someone be
able<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.399> learn<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.670> do<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.880> on<00:02:11.030> airsoft<00:02:11.180> guns

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
able to learn to do that on airsoft guns

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.210 
able to learn to do that on airsoft guns
but<00:02:12.319> I'm<00:02:12.349> gonna<00:02:12.500> practice<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:12.950> nerve<00:02:13.130> because

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
but I'm gonna practice on nerve because

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.550 
but I'm gonna practice on nerve because
there's<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:13.670> much<00:02:13.790> cheaper<00:02:14.260> because<00:02:15.260> they

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
there's so much cheaper because they

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.470 
there's so much cheaper because they
have<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.160> lot<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.310> different<00:02:16.730> layers<00:02:17.239> and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
have just a lot of different layers and

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.850 
have just a lot of different layers and
stuff<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> little<00:02:18.049> bit<00:02:18.170> harder<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.620> do

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
stuff so it's a little bit harder to do

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.120 
stuff so it's a little bit harder to do
them<00:02:19.209> airsoft<00:02:20.209> guns<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.590> I'll<00:02:21.709> learn<00:02:21.890> and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
them airsoft guns but I'll learn and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.350 
them airsoft guns but I'll learn and
I'll<00:02:22.190> figure<00:02:22.340> out<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.700> moving<00:02:22.940> parts<00:02:23.209> and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
I'll figure out the moving parts and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.300 
I'll figure out the moving parts and
stuff<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.049> got<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.260> for<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:24.500> $21<00:02:25.040> shipped
