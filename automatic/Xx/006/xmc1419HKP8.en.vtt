00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
my stuff brainstorming right now i'll

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.929 
my stuff brainstorming right now i'll
probably<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.849> shock<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.090> do<00:04:03.329> it<00:04:04.609> no<00:04:05.609> three

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
probably for a shock to do it no three

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.710

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
minutes but when you look at the big

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.849 
minutes but when you look at the big
picture<00:04:12.959> when<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.230> have<00:04:13.379> a<00:04:13.409> night<00:04:13.650> like
