now<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.329> like<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.659> bit<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:03.989> time<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.500> bit

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
now this is like a bit of time this bit

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.559 
now this is like a bit of time this bit
I'm<00:03:05.040> guessing<00:03:06.469> so<00:03:07.469> this<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:09.060> time<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.329> I

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
I'm guessing so this is the time that I

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.640 
I'm guessing so this is the time that I
have<00:03:09.719> to<00:03:09.840> do<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.019> because<00:03:10.139> oxley<00:03:10.439> have<00:03:10.530> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
have to do this because oxley have to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.809 
have to do this because oxley have to
get<00:03:10.769> rid<00:03:10.889> of<00:03:10.949> all<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.129> bits<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.669> show

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
get rid of all the bits to it to show

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.670 
get rid of all the bits to it to show
