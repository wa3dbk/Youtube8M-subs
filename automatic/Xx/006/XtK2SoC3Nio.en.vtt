00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
pigtails and a cross like that just so

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.140 
pigtails and a cross like that just so
because<00:00:33.810> my<00:00:33.960> head<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> wrong<00:00:34.530> shape<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:36.120> I

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
because my head is the wrong shape and I

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.060 
because my head is the wrong shape and I
haven't<00:00:36.360> got<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> shelf<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.380> back<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
haven't got a shelf at the back if that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.460 
haven't got a shelf at the back if that
makes<00:00:38.310> sense<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.060> um<00:00:39.690> his<00:00:39.960> eyes<00:00:40.200> tend

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
makes sense to you so um his eyes tend

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.430 
makes sense to you so um his eyes tend
to<00:00:40.710> slip<00:00:41.699> off<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:41.940> head<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.199> have

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to slip off my head so I have to have

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.670 
to slip off my head so I have to have
like<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.969> creator<00:00:44.969> shelf<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.809> back<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.500> my

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
like a creator shelf at the back with my

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
like a creator shelf at the back with my
hair<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.609> in<00:00:48.390> order<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.609> stay<00:00:50.609> which<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> quite

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
hair and in order to stay which is quite

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.750 
hair and in order to stay which is quite

yep pretty massive so with the fee there
put<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.270> flat<00:01:32.200> bit<00:01:32.439> that's<00:01:32.950> directly<00:01:33.670> below

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
put the flat bit that's directly below

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.109 
put the flat bit that's directly below
you<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.450> be<00:01:34.829> at<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:35.920> bottom<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.280> your<00:01:36.310> head<00:01:36.549> and

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.450 
put the V over then get a pull the V
down<00:01:40.960> because<00:01:41.829> you<00:01:41.890> want<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.100> bit<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.369> be

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
down because you want that bit to be

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.609 
down because you want that bit to be
nice<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.880> flat<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.960> then<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:44.259> see<00:01:44.469> these

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
nice and flat and then you see these

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.740 
nice and flat and then you see these
bits<00:01:44.890> here<00:01:45.009> just<00:01:45.429> gonna<00:01:45.579> tack<00:01:45.850> them<00:01:46.179> so<00:01:46.630> that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
bits here just gonna tack them so that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.289 
bits here just gonna tack them so that
you've<00:01:46.840> got<00:01:46.869> two<00:01:47.200> neat<00:01:47.380> folds<00:01:47.860> if<00:01:48.610> anyone<00:01:49.000> has

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
you've got two neat folds if anyone has

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.089 
you've got two neat folds if anyone has
ever<00:01:49.420> done<00:01:49.509> Hospital<00:01:50.200> corners<00:01:50.439> in<00:01:50.709> their<00:01:50.890> life

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
ever done Hospital corners in their life

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:57.859 
ever done Hospital corners in their life
on<00:01:51.849> a<00:01:51.909> bed<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.319> pretty<00:01:53.950> much<00:01:54.069> like<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:55.349> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
on a bed this is pretty much like it so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.139 
on a bed this is pretty much like it so
there<00:01:58.869> we<00:01:59.020> go<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:02:00.399> I'm<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.610> going<00:02:00.849> to

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
there we go and then I'm just going to

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.699 
there we go and then I'm just going to
secure<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.899> tie<00:02:05.170> there<00:02:05.709> so<00:02:06.579> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.819> see<00:02:07.709> any

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
secure and tie there so you can see any

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.740 
secure and tie there so you can see any
bits<00:02:09.160> just<00:02:09.549> need<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.880> kind<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.090> go<00:02:10.239> like<00:02:10.269> that

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
bits just need to kind of go like that

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.710 
bits just need to kind of go like that
make<00:02:11.590> sure<00:02:11.799> it's<00:02:11.980> covering<00:02:12.280> all<00:02:12.430> your<00:02:12.489> bit<00:02:12.760> at

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
make sure it's covering all your bit at

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.650 
make sure it's covering all your bit at
the<00:02:13.810> back<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:15.130> take<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.519> bit<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:19.480> this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
the back and take this bit so I do this

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.860 
the back and take this bit so I do this
camera<00:02:20.290> which<00:02:20.590> way<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.980> way<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.690> look<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
camera which way that way so you look a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.990 
camera which way that way so you look a
bit<00:02:22.989> like<00:02:23.079> a<00:02:23.139> floppy<00:02:23.620> bunny<00:02:24.100> in<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.459> moment<00:02:24.819> and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
bit like a floppy bunny in a moment and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.430 
bit like a floppy bunny in a moment and
take<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.359> bit<00:02:25.510> back<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.019> then<00:02:26.109> you<00:02:26.230> just

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
take that bit back and then you just

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:35.339 
take that bit back and then you just
give<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.620> double<00:02:26.799> tie

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.899 

like<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:37.530> simply<00:02:38.530> if<00:02:39.249> you<00:02:39.340> want<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.730> nice

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
like that and simply if you want a nice

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.080 
like that and simply if you want a nice
little<00:02:40.150> bow<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:41.019> can<00:02:41.049> do<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.409> by<00:02:41.530> here<00:02:42.090> that's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
little bow you can do it by here that's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.819 
little bow you can do it by here that's
kind<00:02:43.389> of<00:02:43.450> sits<00:02:43.629> like<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.379> let's<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.739> do

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
kind of sits like that so let's just do

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.069 
kind of sits like that so let's just do
it<00:02:44.980> quickly<00:02:45.189> just<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.549> show<00:02:45.639> you<00:02:46.060> I've<00:02:46.900> got

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
it quickly just to show you I've got

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.190 
it quickly just to show you I've got
enough<00:02:48.359> leftover<00:02:49.359> bits<00:02:49.659> and<00:02:49.840> White's<00:02:50.049> gonna

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
enough leftover bits and White's gonna

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.830 
enough leftover bits and White's gonna
this<00:02:50.560> stubby

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
this stubby

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.990 
this stubby
yeah<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:56.250> there<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.340> go<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.639> then<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.819> can
