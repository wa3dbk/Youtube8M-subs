00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.460
 hello to all here maxime the gravity of the alleged facts as I am 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.610
 happy to see you in this new video 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.760
 regarding the update of kraft mac tapas points 5 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.360
 so I'll explain a little bit how it works when you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.030
 explain how to show you how rainy snow works and how 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 different interactions that like that can have with the elements of the game 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.970
 so the fingertips for example that torches do not go out under the 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.560
 rain 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.040
 this is already a very good point since it aroused a lot 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.970
 interrogations 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.640
 e so now we know how to settle here neither the snow nor the rain united states the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.340
 torches 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.910
 that's a very good point you could see also at the beginning of the video in 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.670
 the boundary between the two 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.470
 between the youngest age the republican pact 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 finally I think we do not pay much attention when we go through 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.360
 and it's not a major problem 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.760
 by cons a problem a little bigger there I fart a blockade to see if 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.650
 happy 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.080
 the company can note the snowballs but still do not have either 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.370
 always with the call 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.930
 it does not move for the 100 th I wanted to test just the behaviors 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.240
 for example with the block of the isÃ¨re 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.479
 with the stairs too since we saw that the world was posing a few 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.040
 century problems then 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.220
 and the snow passes through 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.750
 so we're going to test these blocks 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.370
 two farm 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.540
 juan posed some because here we go back what the order protect from 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.310
 the rain 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.310
 I put some glass blocks 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.260
 we have a lot of people doing verandas towards it so it's true that 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.810
 this is practice it's interesting to test it so the snow the rain of 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.780
 tomorrow is going through 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.549
 so that bof blah blah 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.950
 we will have to settle today 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.460
 very quickly as soon as possible once you have completed portal 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.800
 so I also tested percent of the stone stairs cases just need 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.159
 that I find lady 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.449
 a little free hand the wiki 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.509
 and end up then stone staircase which is stone 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:23.959
 so 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.949
 here are some stone stairs 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.649
 we have a lot of weight of houses that are made that stone stairs or 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.439
 in wood 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 knowing that both in the same behavior see what it gives 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.019
 so results well it's raining too through so that's the very average 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.019
 it will have to be corrected quickly 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.739
 I will also test with slabs what we often have for houses whose 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.739
 the roofs are made as of 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 so I will test that too 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.679
 so under the teeth and by count it does not rain 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.009
 here's 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.469
 small test result always very interesting 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.349
 he can not under the slabs 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.729
 it's a good info 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.539
 Ben listen and that's it 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.099
 not much else to say e 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.339
 The behaviour 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:14.759
 the state its basic 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.609
 I'll see you soon in a new video Thank you for having 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.529
 watched very soon
