Denmark<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.410> believe<00:00:55.800> strongly

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
Denmark and I really believe strongly

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.330 
Denmark and I really believe strongly
that<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> muhammed<00:00:57.539> crisis<00:00:58.020> did<00:00:58.530> change<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that the muhammed crisis did change a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.459 
that the muhammed crisis did change a
lot<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> history<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.840> Denmark<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
lot of the history in Denmark and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.529 
lot of the history in Denmark and
therefore<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.280> suggested<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
therefore I have suggested that the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.440 
therefore I have suggested that the
Mohammed<00:01:03.899> crisis<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.559> coming<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.180> list

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Mohammed crisis is coming on that list

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810 
Mohammed crisis is coming on that list
so<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> Danish<00:01:07.890> pupils<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.640> be

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
so that the Danish pupils will be

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.450 
so that the Danish pupils will be
educated<00:01:08.960> also<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.320> Mohamed<00:01:10.710> crisis<00:01:11.159> here
