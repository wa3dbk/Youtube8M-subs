 to give points so fast 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.480

 proof of a good sense of anticipation 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.420
 but the Italian tice's pass was 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.280
 still a little phoned 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.969
 cannon departure from wenger men and the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.090
 transformation 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.079
 a word of help to the 10 0 with just

 8000 game 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.690
 but as they had reacted well face 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.640
 to the English the last time the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.850
 Italians were going to recover from this blow 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.010
 hard thanks to a superb balloon worn 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.720

 progress the Scots can not 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 stop him and Paris is in ambush in 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.540
 take the opportunity to give the ball to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.970
 furnaces that crosses the line and 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.830
 flatten a nice try that rewards a 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.330
 Italian collective effort 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.840
 the first opportunity is the right of the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.280
 transalpine who returns to the score 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.870
 this action perfectly illustrates to 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.030
 how much the mall may be angina 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.200

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.970
 corner transformation 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.400
 but the Italians come back to five 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.480
 points 10 to 5 and are truly 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.000
 enter the party 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.130
 in the 16th minute there they succeeded if 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.500
 countries writing easy the score going to 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.750

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.239
 period 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.150
 in the 27th minute one discipline 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.690
 Italian offered a penalty rather 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.250
 easy 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.900
 an eagle who have benefited for 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.550
 give eight points back to his 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.550
 team 16 to 8 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.640
 a little before the break the success was 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.100
 this time the Italian kick of 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.709
 dimon penalty found the pole and at 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.569
 rebound is the Italian giovanni battista 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.910
 venditti who was the fastest 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.910
 to grab the balloon and get to 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.709
 flatten despite the Scottish defender 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.540
 also showing a beautiful 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.540
 dexterity to make no forward 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.900
 the referee appealed to the tmb muse and 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:09.800
 the pictures showed that candidate 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:11.390
 had flattened reductive and italy 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.830
 marquette at the best time and at 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.780
 minadt had only to pass the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.400
 transformation and both teams 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.950
 return to the locker room on the score 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.950
 undecided 16 to 15 for cos 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.810
 a Scottish victory would mean a 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.700
 second success on the last 10 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.110
 tournament matches and the locals were 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.240
 close to escape on the board 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.820
 display after the good interior of the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.500
 process and 22 Italian and 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.760
 song franking of love that 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.890
 was going to steenvoorde 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.050
 unfortunately forward while 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.860
 the back spin to test the italians 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.510
 could breathe 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.280
 the arbitrator's decision 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.890
 no doubt that it is towards the end of 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.390
 match that everything was going to be played at 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.750
 few minutes of the whistle 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.820
 final 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.340
 Italy dominated and push for 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.890
 score but were sanctioned in 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.890
 scrimmage five meters from the Scottish goal 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.580
 we could not find the key and 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.140
 Italians could launch a counter 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.060
 attack after seven mistakes the half 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.060
 opening that will prove crucial 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.070
 the Italians held the ball in the 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.320
 22 their maul still creating danger and 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.170
 causing the temporary exclusion of the 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.330
 replacing bentiri this yellow card for 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.580
 his first selection and his team on 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.560
 his goal line before miss watson 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.760
 he too is very slow his first 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.600
 no cool selection 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.600
 the maul that follows 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.370
 the referee sanctions his team by a 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.530
 penalty test to the great joy of 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.740
 Italian fans and players on 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.740
 the lawn 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.520
 watson also taking a yellow card 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.860
 for the form but the sanction was 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.890
 justified and the visitors deserved their 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.890
 victory 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.640
 end of the match successful transformation not 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.030
 comfortable and vintage whistle final 22 19 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.860
 for italy the azzurri can 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.990
 start celebrating this success the second

 second Italian victory in 14 games 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.210
 but it comes at the right time for

 men of jacques brunel 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.890
