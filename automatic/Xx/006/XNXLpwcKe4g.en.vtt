00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.210
 [applause] 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.090
 Hello everyone, I sang this part 15 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.190
 minecraft mechanisms in this part I you 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:21.510
 show a shred of my club maker and their types 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.050
 Well, a little bit of theory means it should 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.519
 It was probably in the first issue 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 mechanism as it is the basis of general 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 all minecraft redstone and who on 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.110
 small for but it's all garbage in general 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.370
 let's begin the first treasure maker which 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.840
 I want to build it the most in my 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 the usual 5-channel I call it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.210
 channel 5-channel 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.719
 bedbug maker which is made of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.500
 Inverters, that is, he tries so 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.730
 building an odd number of inverter 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 so here we spend 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:24.929
 redstone so here so here so here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:27.080
 so here he looks like that is he 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.700
 5-channel 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.509
 Well, that is, it works like this 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.470
 let's say we connect 3 pistons here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.450
 weight they will work differently this 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.000
 may even be useful nickname 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:49.100
 some case is valid if hold 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.100
 so glad became so 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.400
 let's say it will turn on 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.400
 on and off i mean wrong 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.870
 built in general these sounds besyat 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.110
 we cut down by so it turns off then 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.600
 there is this the most in my but ordinary bug 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.160
 maker that is, it is the most docks 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.740
 first by the way claude maker 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.200
 Well, which I learned so to say about 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.170
 which i found out 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.040
 but it is not so important now in general 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.630
 but this is bad so let's say that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.700
 we must allow two exits goes first 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.060
 and the second is already delayed because 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.110
 all these tekke must go through 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:44.800
 each of the inverter is sucks of course 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:52.570
 but we have a replacement for this bug maker is 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:03:00.209
 back let 's say let's do it like this 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:03.220
 here and here and so grab the club maker so 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.750
 This is how the code works, we have a game 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.290
 two outputs completely identical works 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.290
 They are good 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:26.190
 so here's a super job good quota 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:28.440
 maker is generally the only negative 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.829
 Well, before it was a minus if you go far 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:38.730
 from him tulu everything he turns off also 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:42.180
 cool what u configured like this 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.319
 he can speed small put in 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.680
 Overall very useful 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:51.510
 also i use well what's on like 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.530
 of this which year maker and there we will admit more 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.489
 such a claude maker and that is the more 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:10.170
 the greater the delay let's say one more thing 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:12.000
 are the maker and well, even more necessary in a well 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.450
 general such is the maker that is, he can 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.549
 tune up then i use such 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.769
 club maker and but the sense is not easy 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.780
 using this is my favorite fruit maker you 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.070
 could see in the previous parts 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:36.450
 so it works has two ways 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:38.630
 completely the same that is here in general 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.539
 you understand he is also tuned but 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:47.520
 cons in him the fact that he burns out after 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.800
 In addition, we suppose to put a large 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.139
 speed vampire blows out early or 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.020
 late have to use the last 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.800
 speed because last speed 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.000
 he does not coast 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.580
 absolutely but how would I like this 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.590
 here's a maker so that previous versions 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.740
 when there were lags squabbles makers that is 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.010
 you leave the game who is out of the game 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.060
 go out in general and the club maker 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.040
 stop you go back to 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.350
 the game let's roll back to the club card 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.500
 maker must again before running the same 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.650
 year maker has always worked 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.840
 he is very comfortable very light 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.750
 use in general another cat maker 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.940
 I'll show you my complete nonsense but 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.230
 some people like this 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:41.230
 enjoyed up in it like its all here 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:49.580
 makers have a minus here is a code maker 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:51.790
 It has two ways but there is no such thing but how 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.610
 you may notice 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:59.540
 The signal here is very unstable. 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.630
 4 set as you can see one 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.310
 block this one this one here so the piston 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.750
 works start working 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:12.920
 earlier than it closes long and 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:18.230
 go away i'll tell you maker here at all 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:20.330
 shit in general, I told like everything is there 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.430
 still some were bedbug maker i remember 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.450
 used before on and already forgot 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:32.950
 how are they built in general can I still 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:35.780
 tell about new devices like there 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.990
 what is an inverter for blah blah blah it 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.190
 nobody is interested in everything so by the way 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.320
 treasure maker which is shown to you here 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.750
 very cool in general on this 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.230
 ends 15 part of Minecraft 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.860
 mechanism with you was bill subscribe 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.130
