00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.610
 in that day 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.570
 Hi everyone, our tutorial today is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 on the nail domino that we have 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:23.570
 hand made super cute little girls gone 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.570
 easy will also learn 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.500
 Good here to be faster 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 The first step is two layers of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.300
 black enamel 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.149
 I already went to advance, okay? 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 I already took off the badges now too. 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.460
 People are going to do the dominoes. 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:53.010
 We're going to use white cloth paint. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.550
 So let's get started so it's good, so it's 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.800
 explain to you I made the pieces of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 domino like that in the little finger started with 12 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.200
 That 's what I've seen in 23 sequels. 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:13.470
 3 and 4 4 and 5 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.360
 and here on thumb 5 and 6 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.360
 ok let's go then 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.969
 ah 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 we do in the middle of the nail 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:36.240
 the little card to separate the numbers 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:09.269
 what I'm going to do the numbers number one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:16.500
 down 212 and next fear the same 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:18.739
 thing I start with the bit here in the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.739
 medium 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.319
 the superstar 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.269
 like this 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:55.400
 there's part 2 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:55.400
 and is third with 123 next to everything 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.269
 the same thing 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.280
 the risk of the environment 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:37.760
 with 23 and on the underside until its 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.760
 number 4 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.270
 right next in 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:19.200
 now here is part 4 and 5 234 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:31.040

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:47.590

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:58.389

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:31.760
 then I hope to dry a little pass that 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.570
 hand that had not yet passed and stepped 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.230
 a shine to look more beautiful 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.230

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.970

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.970
