alright now it is ready to fire let me
back<00:01:25.490> up<00:01:34.420> why<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:36.770> easier<00:01:37.310> not<00:01:37.850> awkward<00:01:38.030> what's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
back up why is easier not awkward what's

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.510 
back up why is easier not awkward what's
happening<00:01:39.140> there<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.920> stock<00:01:40.250> is

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
happening there is that the stock is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520 
happening there is that the stock is
transferring<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.420> recoil<00:01:41.780> into<00:01:42.080> your<00:01:42.229> body

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
transferring the recoil into your body

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.310 
transferring the recoil into your body
so<00:01:42.800> your<00:01:43.220> thigh<00:01:43.460> is<00:01:43.820> taking<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.390> where<00:01:44.900> instead

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
so your thigh is taking it where instead

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.690 
so your thigh is taking it where instead
of<00:01:45.380> your<00:01:45.560> having<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.100> other<00:01:46.220> one<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.430> have<00:01:46.460> is

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
of your having the other one you have is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.180 
of your having the other one you have is
this<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.390> that<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.530> sit<00:01:48.740> there<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:48.920> fire

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
this and that you can sit there and fire

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.080 
this and that you can sit there and fire
that<00:01:49.430> all<00:01:49.640> day<00:01:49.790> long<00:01:54.009> now<00:01:55.009> how<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.280> do<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:55.850> one

it's a price issue to you know this is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.120 
it's a price issue to you know this is
this<00:02:07.759> one's<00:02:07.910> a<00:02:07.970> hundred<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.630> means<00:02:08.690> 75

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
this one's a hundred that means 75

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.970 
this one's a hundred that means 75
that<00:02:10.550> one's<00:02:10.700> 150<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.050> they're<00:02:12.170> all<00:02:12.319> virtually

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
that one's 150 so they're all virtually

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.030 
that one's 150 so they're all virtually
the<00:02:13.130> same<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.490> team<00:02:14.319> you're<00:02:15.319> firing<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.740> load

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
the same I team you're firing a load

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.350 
the same I team you're firing a load
you've<00:02:16.760> heard<00:02:16.910> us<00:02:17.000> talk<00:02:17.030> about<00:02:17.150> the

than<00:03:24.790> once<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:26.260> really<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> best<00:03:26.860> way<00:03:27.040> to

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
than once the really the best way to

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.540 
than once the really the best way to
hold<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.490> is<00:03:28.090> like<00:03:28.330> this<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.040> with<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.280> side

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
hold it is like this and with this side

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.820 
hold it is like this and with this side
of<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.300> know<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.750> way<00:03:31.960> when<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.590> comes

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
of it you know so that way when it comes

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.060 
of it you know so that way when it comes
back<00:03:33.010> there's<00:03:33.370> nothing<00:03:33.490> coming<00:03:33.790> back<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.150> it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
back there's nothing coming back on it

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.140 
back there's nothing coming back on it
okay<00:03:36.070> all<00:03:36.550> right<00:03:36.610> this<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:36.910> where<00:03:37.030> you're

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
okay all right this is where you're

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.990 
okay all right this is where you're
firing<00:03:37.300> pin<00:03:37.540> comes<00:03:37.750> through<00:03:38.790> right<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:39.940> you

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
firing pin comes through right and you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.500 
firing pin comes through right and you
see<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.330> split<00:03:40.690> right<00:03:40.870> there

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
see that split right there

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.690 
see that split right there
the<00:03:43.510> idea<00:03:43.840> behind<00:03:44.020> that<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.980> when<00:03:45.520> the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
the idea behind that is that when the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.060 
the idea behind that is that when the
after<00:03:46.600> its<00:03:46.750> fired<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:49.660> raises<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.140> up<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.950> you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
after its fired it raises it up and you

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.590 
after its fired it raises it up and you
pull<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.370> out

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
pull it out

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.090 
pull it out
that's<00:03:52.840> your<00:03:53.050> ejector<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.530> all<00:03:53.770> three<00:03:54.010> of

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
that's your ejector and all three of

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.570 
that's your ejector and all three of
them<00:03:54.190> happen

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.750 

empar<00:03:59.580> spit<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.060> haven't<00:04:00.660> done
