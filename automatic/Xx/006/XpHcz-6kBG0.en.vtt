00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.680
 welcome to this new video and good 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.960
 Well, this time I bring you 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.330
 gameplays of revolution and expectable 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.250
 about something super important people 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.710
 that's how you saw it in the title in 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.830
 fed up and can ultimate ninja storm 4 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.690
 will come in Latin Spanish so it's people 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.660
 something completely unexpected strange and 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.340
 I do not know whether to say important but good or 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.710
 be important I think that in what is 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.410
 the world of dubbing because obviously what 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.059
 is in the world but let's say the 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.070
 importance of the Latino public 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.140
 it is also not, however, good 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.180
 I did not take that much importance with 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.339
 about what it say the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.120
 impact that has on me since the voices 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.799
 in Latin they are not what I most 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.290
 would like to hear above all the voice of 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.750
 naruto the voice of sakura that really does not 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.580
 changed with respect to what is the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.990
 first season, however, I do not say 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.630
 that is bad in fact I'm seeing a 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.890
 route in the flex and I am in the Latin 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.229
 only to know how the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.690
 voices the only thing I know is that they spin has 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.360
 the voice of gofio 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.920
 and well, I'm going to give you a little bit of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.050
 details about what this is 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.390
 information people more or less so that 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.190
 know how is the wave going ok and is that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.320
 good the dubbing actor alfonso 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.600
 obregón is the one who performs the voice of kaká 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.640
 chingue naruto in latin spanish and 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.040
 confirmed his participation on Facebook 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.950
 with that character for the video game of 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.470
 naruto 4 very good this was what 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.500
 confirms or is what confirms that he played 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.420
 come completely in Latin Spanish 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.370
 for our territory I suppose that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.780
 in general for Latin America that is not 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.910
 nothing more for what is Mexico since 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.260
 well, this dubbing or dubbing 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.600
 of the series are usually done here in 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.850
 Mexico and this is how they can be located in 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.030
 what is the latin territory ok is 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.330
 something that I hope will happen and that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.820
 I want to stay let's say that's what a 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.590
 little the fact that the game despite 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.030
 to come located exclusively for 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.100
 we only good in that language 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.170
 there are times that this happens for example the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.000
 case of the call of duty if you buy it 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.200
 in Latin it only comes in Latin 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 less 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.430
 let's say that in the case of xbox and so 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.470
 came not the precision 3 to be 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.450
 bluray good if you can get what 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.970
 that were the two languages but not in this 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.500
 case only came in that language 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.129
 I did something that took me a little 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.260
 wave then I wait almost as it comes 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.970
 Japanese and English comes as 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.620
 select languages in the game and 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.080
 obviously, you can choose the one 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.959
 you like it, I hope you have Japanese 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.700
 English and Latin because if not if I go to 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.280
 get a little wave maybe it would be 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.680
 curious or let's say for people more 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.230
 young people who do not understand Japanese or 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.390
 they do not read or others or do not know how to actually read 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.220
 for example children who play in 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.110
 adult and one can read for example 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.380
 you can hear the Latin voices or that 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.329
 the truth is pretty good but it would be 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.270
 well nice enough that we do not 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.150
 they will force to listen 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.800
 or let's say to have only one language 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.930
 in the game it would not be good if 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.220
 they will leave as well as Japanese and English 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.290
 so that we can enjoy it in the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.340
 language that seems to us most then 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.990
 good people, I hope you have them 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.610
 liked this information do not forget 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.170
 Arzolay share it with your friends and 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.910
 leave me here the comments what do you think 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.040
 with respect to what will come in Spanish 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.600
 latina let's hear voices that do not 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.920
 we've heard in the series in Latin and 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.270
 we're going to listen to you here in the game 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.070
 because plants are supposed to 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.630
 then good people, I hope that you 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.100
 I liked that I said goodbye we see the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.640
