00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.159
 Glover camera

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.680
 Eilenburg 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 my gates camera shows unfortunately uses

 flight days 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 Rockenbauch 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 or allowed 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
 we know that Torsten Holm is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.720
 can cross the border 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 First we have to enlarge our garden 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 have trouble 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 The next day I will never again 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.740
 for lower 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 You do not really see Corey here 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.500
 what are you looking for? 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.730
 I will 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.110
 Take better care of yourself next day 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.110
 over time 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 I think 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.640
 whenever I loose my childhood days 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 Unis warrior 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780
 with the pope 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 I just wanted to say loaded 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.920
 every second act and Brad Rutter or maybe every day 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 but not more than a few dead a day 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 That's what I wanted to say 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 let's do it 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 he has pictures 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:22.649

 Award for Liu in relation 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.119
 therefore 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.539
 just hold down the d-mark button, then it's faster 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.879
 Dr the controller is vibrating degrees 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.879
 if you do so 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:19.019
 dapd dapd have dapd on 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.019
 but thanks to the flames 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.419
 it was 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.419
 the orbiter Marcus black sash 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.379
 I already have two bands 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.379
 So these are not my idea yet 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.599
 information 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.639
 Dursti square kilometer floor or broken glass chassis would need now 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.929

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.929
 he was still or grass and 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.339
 everyone stood and 2 Graz 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.459
 Children are broken but earth 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.459
 I also know the right ones I'm still waiting for on earth 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.939
 would need my stuff now 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
 laughs 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.579
 in front of Apple it is logical that the now not granted 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.039
 and still has a lot to do 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.039
 It looked like a pony grade from the top 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 now we make the head similar 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.870

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.120
 the optimized Raúl is 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 translated, I believe it's love as Gerd Harms thinks 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.789
 Flames and poets rather the first row 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.349
 and who goes 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.199

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.960
 participation 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.020
 So who climbs like Gerd Heinze André Chenier 2 is from 1 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.520
 Chapeau Claque Tibet 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.279
 Member can do sports 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.650
 Now we do it, I think 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.419
 I'm an expert, they do not have to explain that to me 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.129
 OK 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.270
 the Bundesbank 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.429
 like a renunciation not serious yet takes a bit ours 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.789
 Now he has the wheelchair 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.789
 and that's all right 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.999
 "Everyone thinks now the project needs it 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.999
 a tuft on the Main 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.669
 RTC in beersel then finished with the known 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.689
