00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
about the UV lighting system that you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.860 
about the UV lighting system that you
did<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.350> UV<00:01:26.100> reactive<00:01:26.310> cable<00:01:27.119> management

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
did a UV reactive cable management

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.860 
did a UV reactive cable management
as<00:01:28.350> well<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.800> UV<00:01:29.460> reactive<00:01:29.640> SATA<00:01:30.270> cables<00:01:30.660> and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
as well as UV reactive SATA cables and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.050 
as well as UV reactive SATA cables and
we<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.150> UV<00:01:33.380> light<00:01:34.380> cathodes<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> lights

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
we have a UV light cathodes so it lights

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.810 
we have a UV light cathodes so it lights
up<00:01:36.320> one<00:01:37.320> unique<00:01:37.590> thing<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.280> case<00:01:38.580> the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
DF 85 is it has the hot swappable SSD

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.990 
DF 85 is it has the hot swappable SSD
babe<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.580> your<00:01:44.640> SSD
