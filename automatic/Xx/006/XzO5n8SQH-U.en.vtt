00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.680
 good friends i 'm serious jorge and such as 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.540
 I thought obviously if they were going to 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.210
 ask maybe they did not put it or such 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.760
 yes, but they're going to ask me that 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.430
 that I come to answer our 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.880
 theme is the beginning and the brooks that 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.910
 He passed 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.970
 3 so that the four of us will not see them 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.550
 still good let's start 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.230
 we all know that the groups are about 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.449
 changos 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.570
 that were less advanced than 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.680
 us when I found them they coben and 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.870
 they have not very advanced weapons and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.899
 good 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.390
 that the brutes do not go out in the yard 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.540
 it owes everything that started in the pain 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.719
 as we can see if we already play that the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.579
 jealousy were the elites who were 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.790
 mainly as in the following 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.710
 quarters but the prophets did something 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.600
 called the Great Schism that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.840
 they put with the against young because 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.480
 they did not want to continue 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.930
 that's how they started doing things 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.050
 as for example putting groups of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.970
 elite what made us think of a 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.610
 situation between elites and bruce 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 we understand even though the leader died 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.960
 we killed and that left him very weakened 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.870
 because he was the leader of all the pasta 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.690
 bruce follow the other file 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.720
 and still at the end of the first law 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.360
 that there was a war between elites centuries 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.650
 that still after the hard others 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.610
 six years or that few six years 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.400
 and although there were casualties from all sides 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.260
 in the end the elites were the winners 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.910
 they were followed by our planets and they were 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.090
 to burn the planet and kill many 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.939
 others 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.350
 and they took the armament groups 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.350
 because I did not want to make that fight 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 it is saved 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 since it was a little common currency 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.069
 advanced to put stamps 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.110
 with this we are going to assume that the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.030
 gross hair when do not go in because 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.800
 they are extinct or they are too are very 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.060
 few to keep fighting those who are 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.470
 they are playing and they are doing 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.010
 things the males we entered well a 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.470
 Once the hard elite war ended 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.860
 the white elite we know among the three 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.010
 genres was named how could you 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.200
 say then as king of your planet 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.930
 central was the king of the planet 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.250
 dyn 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.700
 the inquisitor in one of his books 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.680
 he mentions that he says I know that the human 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.060
 I left behind still alive and always 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 look for it 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.879
 this leaves us assuming that it could 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.859
 be looking further back exactly in 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.620
 the impressive ones stayed so what 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.270
 we can see maybe in the campaign I was going to 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.760
 planet 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.800
 as I told him the white elite was the one 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.020
 he was as governor martÃ­n of the planet 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.870
 some elected adults and others not 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.720
 he said when a war between the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.520
 what could explain why 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.780
 from young to storm and excellent behavior 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.330
 they are enemies maybe there are some people 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.690
 good that we see a campaign maybe 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.610
 come maybe not but that does not want 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.280
 say that not all elites are bad 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.450
 and that is not before and most likely is 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.450
 that is in the good 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.430
 plus 343 industries told us in one of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.050
 the interviews that we all were going to 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.080
 surprise the arrival from ex 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.030
 inquisitor so we can 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.580
 suppose what you mean with the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.290
 Inquisitor, we can assume that the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.140
 inquisitor to look for master jeep 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.280
 he left his rank or that the storm charges 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.950
 he made a new inquisitor 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.650
 or just that the bada me like that 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.540
 called the inquisitor of halo 3 and halo 2 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.730
 he had a son and he inherited the position 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.299
 then we could see an elite more 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.549
 strong one better better strategy and bad 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.320
 maybe like the sanin tea halo wars but 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.600
 obviously not because he died in halo 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.669
 wars unless it has survived 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.289
 a sword a fall as several 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.289
 kilometers and a planetary exploration 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.000
 what leaves us thinking maybe the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.920
 inquisitor is alive maybe he is 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.740
 looking for more guy maybe we get in 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.360
 the halo 4 campaign but not with its 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.040
 inquisitor rank maybe with the rank 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.830
 I had before how we can observe 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.560
 that he was a yellow zealot maybe what 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.940
 let's see with that range or maybe make two 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.400
 homicides by maybe just 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.890
 he no longer wanted to fight no further 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.470
 to look for teachers those are the tips 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.590
 the odds we have remember 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.110
 still two months to the 4 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.180
 so do not expect us to get too much 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.340
 more information and we will see more 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.130
 in detail 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.370
 this is the subject of these two questions 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.470
 now they have more questions I know 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.040
 he answered with everything I know all that 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.040
 They found 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.970
 of explanation of why the hammer 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.210
 gravitational comes out in halo 4 is simple 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.740
 when the elites fought against 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.990
 others 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.699
 the interest of 20 were is that they lost 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.699
 We should be very much lied to 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.710
 most likely they took 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.860
 armament groot only weapons 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.110
 powerful that we could explain 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.260
 since as we know in our games 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.390
 for example to act when they leave 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.470
 While losing every moment that what 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.470
 we can put 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.900
 and now the armament group and that's why 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:58.280
 appears on the team calendar 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.220
 and this 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.750
 thanks for watching the video 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.750
 until next /
