and<00:00:24.359> Lee<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> thought<00:00:25.260> would<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.680> pretty

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and Lee that I thought would be pretty

installation guide where you can see

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
installation guide where you can see
that<00:00:42.270> we've<00:00:42.420> got<00:00:42.629> sort<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.469> layout<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> the

that we've got sort of a layout of the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.799 
that we've got sort of a layout of the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.799 
installation anyway so let's have a look
at<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.430> case<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> basically<00:00:51.300> we've<00:00:51.600> got<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
at this case so basically we've got a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
at this case so basically we've got a
five<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.379> quarter<00:00:52.530> inch<00:00:52.710> bait<00:00:53.070> power<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
five and a quarter inch bait power and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
five and a quarter inch bait power and
reset<00:00:54.239> switches<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:54.930> front<00:00:55.199> USB<00:00:55.500> ports<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
reset switches two front USB ports and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.209 
reset switches two front USB ports and
then<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.180> go<00:00:57.360> around<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.980> side<00:00:59.190> here

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
then if we go around to the side here

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
then if we go around to the side here
you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.879> you've<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.270> lots<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you can see you've got lots of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.860 
you can see you've got lots of
ventilation<00:01:01.109> holes<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.879> side<00:01:03.120> panel<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
ventilation holes and the side panel is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.190 
ventilation holes and the side panel is
actually<00:01:04.140> removed<00:01:04.949> by<00:01:05.610> taking<00:01:06.240> off<00:01:06.390> six

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
actually removed by taking off six

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.609 
actually removed by taking off six
screws<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.600> I'm<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.020> sure<00:01:10.320> how

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
screws I'm not I'm not really sure how

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.250 
screws I'm not I'm not really sure how
much<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.360> system

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
much I like to see this kind of system

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
much I like to see this kind of system
for<00:01:13.290> removing<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> side<00:01:14.189> panel<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.570> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
for removing a side panel with with so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
for removing a side panel with with so
many<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:16.140> manufacturers<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.549> list

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
many other manufacturers going to list

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
many other manufacturers going to list
and<00:01:18.030> even<00:01:18.119> Lee<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.509> Lee<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.170> list

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and even Lee and Lee going to list

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
and even Lee and Lee going to list
across<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.670> their<00:01:20.820> case<00:01:21.060> line<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.540> seems

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
across a lot of their case line it seems

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
across a lot of their case line it seems
like<00:01:21.990> kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> step<00:01:22.710> backwards<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.580> have

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
like kind of a step backwards to have

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.020 
like kind of a step backwards to have
such<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> such<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> clunky<00:01:25.799> system<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.700> but

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
such a such a clunky system for this but

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
such a such a clunky system for this but
I<00:01:27.270> mean<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.020> case<00:01:28.229> has<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> lot<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> other

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
I mean the case has a lot of other

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:29.990 
I mean the case has a lot of other
things<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
things going for it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
things going for it
so<00:01:30.240> let's<00:01:30.930> talk<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.560> about<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.040> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
first of all you can install one three

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.749 
first of all you can install one three
and<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.020> half<00:01:34.170> inch<00:01:34.409> drive<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.460> install

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
and a half inch drive you can install

and a half inch drive you can install
one<00:01:36.060> five<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> quarter<00:01:36.750> inch<00:01:36.960> drive<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.350> we

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
one five and a quarter inch drive as we

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
one five and a quarter inch drive as we
saw<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> front<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.759> neatest<00:01:39.030> thing
