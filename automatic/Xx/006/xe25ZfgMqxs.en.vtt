00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
So, he's going to lift it up that pipe,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.800
and that's made it past the first

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.840
past the first elbow,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.240
and into the second elbow now.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.020
Now we're in the main chimney,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.540
and we're putting a third,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.500
third length on,

00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:01.583
this is twenty-seven feet,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.600
Now, you can see where the,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.780
where the ash is coming out of the chimney.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.470
You're probably at the top there,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.500
you can always feel the cap,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.940
So, now all we do is

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.120
hook a drill on that,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.400
and spin it,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.200
and you lay down,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680
and (speech indecipherable.)

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.875
So, you can see the ash falling

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.300
as you spin it, and creosote.

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:07.609
That pipe is brand new,

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.248
so there isn't going to anything in that but,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.020
Okay, that's our chimney sweep.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.060
