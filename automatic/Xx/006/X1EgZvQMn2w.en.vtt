00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.190 
where the real damage was done this is
just<00:02:03.090> terrible<00:02:03.990> terrible<00:02:04.950> terrible<00:02:05.520> terrible

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
just terrible terrible terrible terrible

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
just terrible terrible terrible terrible
this<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.530> happens<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> spill

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this is what happens when you spill

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
this is what happens when you spill
water<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.119> even<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.080> water<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
water on even if it's a bit of water it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.619 
water on even if it's a bit of water it
would<00:02:11.009> leak<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:11.610> seep<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.030> through<00:02:12.060> here

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
would leak it would seep in through here

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.230 
would leak it would seep in through here
so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
so

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.660 
so
was<00:02:13.840> sitting<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.410> counter<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.520> had<00:02:15.640> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
was sitting on the counter and you had a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
was sitting on the counter and you had a
bit<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.940> water<00:02:16.060> spill<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:17.290> might<00:02:17.590> get<00:02:17.770> in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
bit of water spill it might get in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.200 
bit of water spill it might get in
through<00:02:18.160> here<00:02:18.430> now<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.700> won't<00:02:18.910> see<00:02:19.060> any

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
through here now you won't see any

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.730 
through here now you won't see any
damage<00:02:19.390> right<00:02:19.690> away<00:02:19.900> which<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.260> what<00:02:20.410> happened

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
damage right away which is what happened

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.550 
damage right away which is what happened
with<00:02:20.830> me<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.970> over<00:02:22.390> time<00:02:22.630> it'll<00:02:22.900> build<00:02:23.080> up<00:02:23.320> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
with me but over time it'll build up and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.560 
with me but over time it'll build up and
he<00:02:23.650> said<00:02:23.860> because<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.220> laptop<00:02:24.700> heats<00:02:25.060> up<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
he said because the laptop heats up and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.240 
he said because the laptop heats up and
then<00:02:25.660> cools<00:02:25.930> down<00:02:26.050> all<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.830> condensation

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
then cools down all that condensation

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.080 
then cools down all that condensation
takes<00:02:27.880> place<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.860> get<00:02:29.860> damage<00:02:30.220> at<00:02:30.910> one

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
takes place and you get damage at one

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.860 
takes place and you get damage at one
point<00:02:31.300> or<00:02:31.540> another<00:02:31.570> which<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:34.360> covered<00:02:34.690> by

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
point or another which is not covered by

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.180 
point or another which is not covered by
any<00:02:35.280> warranty<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:37.240> yeah<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.410> my<00:02:38.740> damaged

any warranty so yeah this is my damaged

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.370 
any warranty so yeah this is my damaged
computer<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:39.790> virtually<00:02:40.390> useless<00:02:40.630> up<00:02:41.140> until

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
computer it's virtually useless up until

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.300 
computer it's virtually useless up until
I<00:02:41.440> fix<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:42.960> whether<00:02:43.960> or<00:02:44.050> not<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.290> fix<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.010> don't

I fix it whether or not I fix it I don't
know<00:02:45.690> $900<00:02:46.690> seems<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.170> little<00:02:47.290> bit<00:02:47.500> too<00:02:47.620> much<00:02:47.800> to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
know $900 seems a little bit too much to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.700 
know $900 seems a little bit too much to
spend<00:02:49.300> on<00:02:49.450> fixing<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.900> computer<00:02:50.380> that's<00:02:50.530> only

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
spend on fixing a computer that's only

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.890 
spend on fixing a computer that's only
worth<00:02:53.280> 1104<00:02:54.280> ever<00:02:54.430> voice<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.180> $300

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
worth 1104 ever voice so that $300

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.370 
worth 1104 ever voice so that $300
warranty<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.650> gone<00:02:57.900> might<00:02:58.900> as<00:02:58.990> well<00:02:59.080> just<00:02:59.260> get

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
warranty is gone might as well just get

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.130 
warranty is gone might as well just get
another<00:02:59.440> one<00:02:59.910> just<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.660> what<00:03:01.780> happens

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
another one just this is what happens

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.650 
another one just this is what happens
when<00:03:02.320> any<00:03:02.700> liquid<00:03:03.700> comes<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.090> contact<00:03:04.330> with

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
when any liquid comes in contact with

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.420 
when any liquid comes in contact with
your<00:03:04.900> computer<00:03:05.350> it's<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:06.010> gonna<00:03:06.100> get<00:03:06.280> ruined

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
your computer it's just gonna get ruined

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.080 
your computer it's just gonna get ruined
so<00:03:07.590> simple<00:03:08.590> advice<00:03:08.860> don't<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.730> keep<00:03:10.000> it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
so simple advice don't do that keep it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.960 
so simple advice don't do that keep it
away<00:03:10.180> from<00:03:10.270> any<00:03:10.510> liquid<00:03:11.550> keep<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.670> away<00:03:12.730> from

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
away from any liquid keep it away from

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.990 
away from any liquid keep it away from
water<00:03:13.530> anything<00:03:14.530> that's<00:03:14.830> wet<00:03:15.690> obvious<00:03:16.690> advice

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
water anything that's wet obvious advice

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.430 
water anything that's wet obvious advice
karyam<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:20.470> not<00:03:20.620> much<00:03:20.710> I<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:20.890> do<00:03:21.100> about<00:03:21.130> it
