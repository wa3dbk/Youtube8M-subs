right now as you can see and the way I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.230 
right now as you can see and the way I
shift<00:01:01.040> really<00:01:01.430> straight<00:01:01.670> for<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.090> is<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
shift really straight for this is the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.080 
shift really straight for this is the
basic<00:01:02.750> most<00:01:03.110> straightforward<00:01:03.350> way<00:01:04.090> going

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
basic most straightforward way going

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.940 
basic most straightforward way going
along<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:05.600> my<00:01:05.780> bike<00:01:06.020> for<00:01:06.260> everyday<00:01:06.650> riding

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
along and on my bike for everyday riding

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.000 
along and on my bike for everyday riding
I<00:01:07.220> normally<00:01:07.700> shift<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.180> right<00:01:08.380> around<00:01:09.380> five<00:01:09.710> to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
I normally shift it right around five to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.300 
I normally shift it right around five to
six<00:01:10.280> thousand<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:10.970> my<00:01:11.660> average<00:01:12.170> shift<00:01:12.860> area<00:01:13.250> I

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
six thousand is my average shift area I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.100 
six thousand is my average shift area I
don't<00:01:13.580> take<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.090> up<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:14.510> anything<00:01:14.810> higher

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
don't take it up to like anything higher

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.870 
don't take it up to like anything higher
normally<00:01:15.560> but<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:15.920> I'm<00:01:16.010> at<00:01:16.130> six<00:01:16.370> thousand

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
normally but so I'm at six thousand

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.910 
normally but so I'm at six thousand
forty<00:01:17.180> three<00:01:17.330> miles<00:01:17.510> an<00:01:17.690> hour<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.590> second

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
forty three miles an hour and second

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
forty three miles an hour and second
gear<00:01:19.330> simply<00:01:20.330> killed<00:01:21.140> throttle

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
gear simply killed throttle

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.200 
gear simply killed throttle
pull<00:01:23.190> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.370> clutch<00:01:23.810> shift<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.670> let<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
pull in the clutch shift up let out the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.710 
pull in the clutch shift up let out the
clutch<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.230> get<00:01:28.380> back<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> throttle

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
clutch and then get back on the throttle

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.820 
clutch and then get back on the throttle
really<00:01:30.720> straightforward<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.800> was

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
really straightforward really and I was

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.980 
really straightforward really and I was
just<00:01:32.040> slowed<00:01:32.220> down<00:01:32.400> quite<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.730> bit<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
just slowed down quite a bit get you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.380 
just slowed down quite a bit get you
another<00:01:34.260> view<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.370> bit<00:01:35.460> quicker<00:01:35.820> or<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
another view a little bit quicker or a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.850 
another view a little bit quicker or a
little<00:01:36.660> bit<00:01:36.780> faster<00:01:37.200> view<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> should<00:01:37.650> say

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
little bit faster view I should say

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.399 
little bit faster view I should say
coming<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.930> here

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
coming up here

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.410 
coming up here
but<00:01:42.009> nothing<00:01:42.429> really<00:01:42.579> changes<00:01:42.939> you<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:43.240> want

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
but nothing really changes you just want

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.179 
but nothing really changes you just want
to<00:01:43.479> get<00:01:43.539> faster<00:01:44.049> at<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.439> everything<00:01:44.859> so

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
to get faster at it and everything so

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.569 
to get faster at it and everything so
don't<00:01:46.060> worry<00:01:46.210> about<00:01:47.069> don't<00:01:48.069> worry<00:01:48.189> about<00:01:48.340> it

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
don't worry about don't worry about it

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.740 
don't worry about don't worry about it
too<00:01:48.700> much<00:01:48.729> it's<00:01:49.090> something<00:01:49.329> really<00:01:49.450> simple

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
too much it's something really simple

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.999 
too much it's something really simple
you<00:01:49.929> actually<00:01:50.140> on<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.259> bike<00:01:50.439> so<00:01:50.469> we're<00:01:50.799> going

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
you actually on the bike so we're going

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.830 
you actually on the bike so we're going
we're<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.189> first<00:01:51.340> gear<00:01:51.700> taking<00:01:52.420> up<00:01:52.509> to<00:01:52.600> six

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
we're in first gear taking up to six

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.059 
we're in first gear taking up to six
clutch<00:01:53.679> in<00:01:53.859> throttle<00:01:54.340> out<00:01:54.549> oh<00:01:54.850> man<00:01:55.390> my<00:01:55.689> bad<00:01:56.069> bad

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
clutch in throttle out oh man my bad bad

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.440 
clutch in throttle out oh man my bad bad
explanation<00:01:57.310> we'll<00:01:57.729> try<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.939> get<00:01:58.119> here<00:01:58.329> the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
explanation we'll try to get here the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.330 
explanation we'll try to get here the
second<00:01:58.840> gear<00:01:58.959> shift<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.469> little<00:01:59.770> bit<00:01:59.979> slower<00:02:00.219> so

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
second gear shift a little bit slower so

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.919 
second gear shift a little bit slower so
I<00:02:00.459> can<00:02:00.579> actually<00:02:00.700> talk<00:02:00.969> fast<00:02:01.329> enough<00:02:01.599> for<00:02:01.750> you

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
I can actually talk fast enough for you

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.260 
I can actually talk fast enough for you
so<00:02:02.770> we're<00:02:02.890> going<00:02:03.039> I'm<00:02:03.789> going<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.000> kill<00:02:04.179> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
so we're going I'm going to kill the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.209 
so we're going I'm going to kill the
throttle<00:02:04.599> pulling<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.929> clutch<00:02:05.109> shift<00:02:05.439> up<00:02:05.770> let

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
throttle pulling the clutch shift up let

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.089 
throttle pulling the clutch shift up let
the<00:02:06.310> clutch<00:02:06.520> out<00:02:06.700> get<00:02:07.060> back<00:02:07.209> on<00:02:07.359> the<00:02:07.420> throttle

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the clutch out get back on the throttle

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.280 
the clutch out get back on the throttle
now<00:02:09.099> then<00:02:09.369> what<00:02:10.149> changes<00:02:10.599> when<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.929> do<00:02:11.110> this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
now then what changes when you do this

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.210 
now then what changes when you do this
faster<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:13.440> closing<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> throttle<00:02:14.590> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
faster is closing the throttle and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.640 
faster is closing the throttle and
pulling<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:15.970> clutch<00:02:16.269> happens<00:02:17.200> almost<00:02:17.590> at

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
pulling in the clutch happens almost at

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.160 
pulling in the clutch happens almost at
the<00:02:17.739> same<00:02:17.890> time<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.340> as<00:02:18.519> I'm<00:02:18.870> starting<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.900> kill

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the same time so as I'm starting to kill

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.930 
the same time so as I'm starting to kill
the<00:02:20.319> throttle<00:02:20.769> I<00:02:20.950> actually<00:02:21.430> pull<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.849> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
the throttle I actually pull in the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.770 
the throttle I actually pull in the
clutch<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.910> can<00:02:24.940> see<00:02:25.269> you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
clutch just like that so you can see you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.180 
clutch just like that so you can see you
can<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.079> watch<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.560> by<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.769> time<00:02:26.829> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
can just watch like by the time the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.339 
can just watch like by the time the
clutch<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.549> all<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> way<00:02:27.849> pulled<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.900> RPMs

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
clutch is all the way pulled in the RPMs

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.720 
clutch is all the way pulled in the RPMs
have<00:02:29.500> dropped<00:02:29.769> back<00:02:29.920> down<00:02:30.190> I'm<00:02:30.459> not<00:02:30.610> on

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
have dropped back down I'm not on

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.430 
have dropped back down I'm not on
throttle<00:02:30.910> at<00:02:31.150> all<00:02:31.269> right<00:02:31.450> now<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:31.900> that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
throttle at all right now so that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.710 
throttle at all right now so that
happens<00:02:33.430> more<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:33.730> less<00:02:33.849> at<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.000> exact<00:02:34.480> same

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
happens more or less at the exact same

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.650 
happens more or less at the exact same
time<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:35.049> step<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.579> killing<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.329> throttle

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
time so step one of killing the throttle

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.330 
time so step one of killing the throttle
and<00:02:37.750> step<00:02:37.959> two<00:02:38.230> I'm<00:02:38.650> pulling<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.129> clutch

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and step two I'm pulling in the clutch

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.930 
and step two I'm pulling in the clutch
happens<00:02:40.239> at<00:02:40.480> nearly<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.959> exact<00:02:41.290> same<00:02:41.500> time

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
happens at nearly the exact same time

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.430 
happens at nearly the exact same time
and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.330 

the<00:02:46.920> same<00:02:47.160> thing<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.460> be<00:02:47.610> said<00:02:47.880> about<00:02:49.340> steps

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the same thing can be said about steps

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.020 
the same thing can be said about steps
four<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.210> five<00:02:51.810> which<00:02:52.290> would<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.940> letting<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
four and five which would be letting the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.840 
four and five which would be letting the
throttle<00:02:54.360> back<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.310> reapplying

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
throttle back out and reapplying

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.110 
throttle back out and reapplying
throttle<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.410> again<00:02:59.040> step<00:02:59.310> one<00:02:59.550> pull<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
throttle so again step one pull in the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.559 
throttle so again step one pull in the
clutch

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
clutch

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.780 
clutch
now<00:03:02.049> step<00:03:02.980> one<00:03:03.189> kill<00:03:03.879> Keys<00:03:04.060> rattle

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
now step one kill Keys rattle

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.770 
now step one kill Keys rattle
step<00:03:06.420> two<00:03:06.569> pull<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.409> clutch<00:03:08.299> step<00:03:09.299> three

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
step two pull in the clutch step three

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.819 
step two pull in the clutch step three
shift<00:03:10.170> up<00:03:11.390> step<00:03:12.390> four<00:03:12.689> is<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.290> let<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
shift up step four is to let out the

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.069 
shift up step four is to let out the
clutch<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.370> then<00:03:14.849> step<00:03:15.120> 5<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.629> to<00:03:15.659> reapply

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
clutch and then step 5 is to reapply

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.259 
clutch and then step 5 is to reapply
your<00:03:16.110> throttle<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.280> again<00:03:17.579> we're<00:03:17.939> in<00:03:18.030> fourth

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
your throttle so again we're in fourth

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.539 
your throttle so again we're in fourth
gear<00:03:18.510> fifty-five<00:03:19.110> miles<00:03:19.349> an<00:03:19.530> hour<00:03:19.650> about

gear fifty-five miles an hour about
5,500<00:03:21.329> rpm<00:03:21.720> I'm<00:03:22.500> going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> kill<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> throttle

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
5,500 rpm I'm going to kill the throttle

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.309 
5,500 rpm I'm going to kill the throttle
pulling<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.849> clutch<00:03:24.030> shift<00:03:24.390> up<00:03:24.750> let<00:03:25.200> the

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
pulling the clutch shift up let the

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.869 
pulling the clutch shift up let the
clutch<00:03:25.500> back<00:03:25.709> out<00:03:25.920> get<00:03:26.099> back<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.489> throttle

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
clutch back out get back on the throttle

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.960 
clutch back out get back on the throttle
and<00:03:27.950> when<00:03:28.950> you're<00:03:29.129> shifting<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.670> want<00:03:29.879> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and when you're shifting you want the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.640 
and when you're shifting you want the
clutch<00:03:30.239> pull<00:03:30.510> ends<00:03:30.659> to<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:30.900> very<00:03:31.140> fast<00:03:31.440> you

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
clutch pull ends to be very fast you

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.920 
clutch pull ends to be very fast you
don't<00:03:31.799> need<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.129> be<00:03:32.909> easy<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:33.750> anything

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
don't need to be easy on it or anything

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.300 
don't need to be easy on it or anything
like<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.500> only<00:03:34.620> time<00:03:34.859> that<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:35.129> really

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
like that the only time that you really

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.800 
like that the only time that you really
need<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.519> let<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.790> clutch<00:03:35.970> out<00:03:36.120> slowly<00:03:36.180> while

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
need to let the clutch out slowly while

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.199 
need to let the clutch out slowly while
shifting<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.769> while<00:03:38.220> you're<00:03:38.430> taking<00:03:38.640> off<00:03:38.970> from

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
shifting is while you're taking off from

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.729 
shifting is while you're taking off from
like<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.359> red<00:03:39.599> light<00:03:39.629> or<00:03:39.840> from<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.230> stop<00:03:40.470> and

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
like a red light or from the stop and

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
video segment here is a pre-tensioning

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.670 
video segment here is a pre-tensioning
your<00:03:53.970> shift<00:03:54.720> lever<00:03:55.049> there's<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.379> little<00:03:55.560> bit<00:03:55.650> of

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
your shift lever there's a little bit of

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.379 
your shift lever there's a little bit of
play<00:03:55.889> in<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.099> shift<00:03:56.310> lever<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.239> just

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
play in the shift lever and you just

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.789 
play in the shift lever and you just
tuck<00:03:57.599> your<00:03:57.750> toe<00:03:57.959> underneath<00:03:58.290> them<00:03:58.470> in<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.620> push

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
tuck your toe underneath them in a push

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.949 
tuck your toe underneath them in a push
up<00:03:58.980> slightly<00:03:59.280> before<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.790> shift<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.659> has<00:04:00.780> kind

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
up slightly before you shift it has kind

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.569 
up slightly before you shift it has kind
of<00:04:01.019> eliminate<00:04:01.500> some<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.920> space<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.489> the

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
of eliminate some of the space in the

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.710 
of eliminate some of the space in the
gap<00:04:02.819> of<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.659> entire<00:04:04.319> motion<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.489> guess<00:04:06.480> I'm

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
gap of the entire motion so I guess I'm

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.430 
gap of the entire motion so I guess I'm
just<00:04:06.810> going<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.049> show<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.200> what<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.319> was

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
just going to show you what I was

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.140 
just going to show you what I was
talking<00:04:07.739> about<00:04:07.769> here<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.400> my<00:04:08.579> writing<00:04:08.909> video

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
talking about here in my writing video

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.240 
talking about here in my writing video
about<00:04:09.329> pre-tensioning<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.769> shift<00:04:11.040> lever

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
about pre-tensioning the the shift lever

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.069 
about pre-tensioning the the shift lever
hopefully<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.849> can<00:04:11.940> see<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.389> pretty<00:04:12.900> well

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
hopefully you can see this pretty well

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.449 
hopefully you can see this pretty well
here<00:04:13.349> I'm<00:04:13.500> not<00:04:13.590> sure<00:04:13.650> ever<00:04:13.919> using<00:04:14.099> my<00:04:14.160> GoPro

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
here I'm not sure ever using my GoPro

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.159 
here I'm not sure ever using my GoPro
still<00:04:14.669> for<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:14.849> but<00:04:15.419> so<00:04:15.569> here's<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> shifter

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
still for this but so here's the shifter

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.270 
still for this but so here's the shifter
on<00:04:16.260> my<00:04:16.349> bike<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.859> can<00:04:16.979> see<00:04:17.099> there's<00:04:17.250> a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
on my bike and you can see there's a

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.569 
on my bike and you can see there's a
little<00:04:17.400> bit<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.639> play<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:19.010> see<00:04:20.010> if<00:04:20.160> it's

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
little bit of play in it and see if it's

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.700 
little bit of play in it and see if it's
a<00:04:20.669> neutral<00:04:21.030> right<00:04:21.120> now<00:04:21.329> when<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.349> said<00:04:22.560> pre

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
a neutral right now when I said pre

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.950 
a neutral right now when I said pre
tension<00:04:23.160> I'd<00:04:23.760> put<00:04:24.000> my<00:04:24.120> toe<00:04:24.180> underneath<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.840> it

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
tension I'd put my toe underneath of it

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.900 
tension I'd put my toe underneath of it
and<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.199> just<00:04:25.440> bring<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.919> up<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.250> little<00:04:26.400> bit<00:04:26.669> like

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
and I just bring it up a little bit like

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.670 
and I just bring it up a little bit like
that<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.389> that's<00:04:27.870> something<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.289> takes<00:04:28.590> a

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
that and that's something that takes a

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.990 
that and that's something that takes a
little<00:04:28.770> bit<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:28.949> while<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.220> get<00:04:29.340> used<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:29.849> is

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
little bit a while to get used to it is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.370 
little bit a while to get used to it is
mainly<00:04:30.270> it's<00:04:30.780> more<00:04:30.960> important<00:04:31.320> for

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
mainly it's more important for

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.060 
mainly it's more important for
clutchless<00:04:31.889> upshifting<00:04:33.260> but<00:04:34.260> it's<00:04:34.919> still

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
clutchless upshifting but it's still

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
clutchless upshifting but it's still
something<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.490> can<00:04:35.580> kind<00:04:35.729> of<00:04:35.789> think<00:04:35.910> of

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
something that you can kind of think of

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.640 
something that you can kind of think of
make<00:04:36.300> shifts<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.870> little<00:04:37.080> bit<00:04:37.199> smoother<00:04:37.620> a

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
make shifts just a little bit smoother a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.680 
make shifts just a little bit smoother a
little<00:04:37.680> bit<00:04:37.919> nicer<00:04:38.340> some<00:04:38.639> people<00:04:39.030> don't

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
little bit nicer some people don't

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.520 
little bit nicer some people don't
really<00:04:39.780> think<00:04:39.930> about<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.260> but<00:04:40.380> that's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
really think about that but that's

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.710 
really think about that but that's
something<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:40.860> found<00:04:41.099> out<00:04:41.280> from<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.820> few<00:04:42.539> other

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
something I found out from a few other

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.120 
something I found out from a few other
fellow<00:04:43.020> riders<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.590> stuff<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.919> that<00:04:43.979> was<00:04:44.070> a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
fellow riders and stuff and that was a

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.529 
fellow riders and stuff and that was a
recommendation<00:04:44.400> they<00:04:44.820> give<00:04:44.970> me<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.330> I'm<00:04:45.389> just

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
recommendation they give me so I'm just

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.300 
recommendation they give me so I'm just
passing<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.380> when<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.949> have<00:04:47.070> your<00:04:47.160> foot

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
passing it on so when you have your foot

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.100 
passing it on so when you have your foot
underneath<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.820> it<00:04:47.940> you're<00:04:48.330> just<00:04:48.510> pushing<00:04:48.720> up

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
underneath of it you're just pushing up

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.600 
underneath of it you're just pushing up
just<00:04:49.500> slightly<00:04:49.710> on<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.919> nuts<00:04:50.130> enough<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.430> shift

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
just slightly on a nuts enough to shift

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.250 
just slightly on a nuts enough to shift
it<00:04:50.909> like<00:04:51.060> right<00:04:51.300> there<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:51.840> don't<00:04:51.930> want<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.199> do

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
it like right there you don't want to do

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.080 
it like right there you don't want to do
that<00:04:52.409> you<00:04:52.620> don't<00:04:52.710> actually<00:04:52.919> want<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.220> move<00:04:53.400> the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
that you don't actually want to move the

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.500 
that you don't actually want to move the
entire<00:04:54.120> link<00:04:54.750> up<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.349> just<00:04:55.560> want<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:56.449> put<00:04:57.449> your

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
entire link up you just want to put your

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.820 
entire link up you just want to put your
foot<00:04:57.659> underneath<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.289> pick<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.560> up<00:04:58.710> a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
foot underneath it and pick it up a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.960 
foot underneath it and pick it up a
little<00:04:58.919> bit<00:04:59.159> and<00:04:59.310> then<00:04:59.669> when<00:04:59.789> you<00:04:59.880> actually

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
little bit and then when you actually

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.300 
little bit and then when you actually
pull<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.419> clutch<00:05:00.449> go<00:05:00.990> ahead<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.320> pull<00:05:02.250> all

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
pull in the clutch go ahead and pull all

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.659 
pull in the clutch go ahead and pull all
the<00:05:02.340> way<00:05:02.460> up<00:05:02.610> there<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.120> go<00:05:03.300> simple<00:05:03.690> as<00:05:03.780> that

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
the way up there you go simple as that

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.260 
the way up there you go simple as that
that's<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.389> kind<00:05:06.840> of<00:05:06.930> go<00:05:06.990> through

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
that's it kind of go through

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.029 
that's it kind of go through
the<00:05:08.630> shiftings<00:05:09.050> again<00:05:09.289> here<00:05:09.530> so<00:05:09.740> if<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:09.889> want

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
the shiftings again here so if you want

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.890 
the shiftings again here so if you want
to<00:05:10.069> see<00:05:10.160> a<00:05:10.190> little<00:05:10.280> bit<00:05:10.370> faster

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.690 

really<00:05:14.530> straightforward<00:05:14.770> really<00:05:15.220> simple<00:05:15.580> and

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
really straightforward really simple and

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.460 
really straightforward really simple and
my<00:05:15.850> method<00:05:16.060> right<00:05:16.300> there<00:05:16.540> there's<00:05:17.080> really<00:05:17.260> not

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
my method right there there's really not

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.770 
my method right there there's really not
much<00:05:17.710> shift<00:05:18.070> shock<00:05:18.310> at<00:05:18.520> all<00:05:18.639> if<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.360> let<00:05:19.570> if

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
much shift shock at all if you let if

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.030 
much shift shock at all if you let if
you<00:05:19.870> start<00:05:20.080> applying<00:05:20.320> throttle<00:05:22.830> quickly<00:05:23.830> like

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
you start applying throttle quickly like

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.480 
you start applying throttle quickly like
if<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.250> don't<00:05:25.410> let<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.560> clutch<00:05:26.800> out<00:05:26.980> before

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
if you don't let the clutch out before

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.400 
if you don't let the clutch out before
you<00:05:27.639> start<00:05:27.700> to<00:05:28.240> add<00:05:28.450> throttle<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:29.080> can<00:05:29.169> be<00:05:29.260> like

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
you start to add throttle it can be like

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.350 
you start to add throttle it can be like
a<00:05:29.440> little<00:05:29.530> bit<00:05:29.740> jumpy<00:05:30.070> like<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:31.030> bike<00:05:31.210> will

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
a little bit jumpy like the bike will

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.490 
a little bit jumpy like the bike will
jump<00:05:31.570> forward<00:05:31.870> kinda<00:05:32.080> like<00:05:32.200> if<00:05:32.290> you're<00:05:32.380> doing

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
jump forward kinda like if you're doing

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.780 
jump forward kinda like if you're doing
a<00:05:32.710> wheelie<00:05:32.889> or<00:05:33.130> something<00:05:33.400> like<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.669> you

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
a wheelie or something like that you

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.890 
a wheelie or something like that you
know<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.540> just<00:05:34.570> make<00:05:34.960> sure<00:05:35.110> that<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:36.040> know<00:05:36.160> you

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
know so just make sure that you know you

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.460 
know so just make sure that you know you
you<00:05:37.900> get<00:05:38.500> your<00:05:38.620> timing<00:05:38.889> down<00:05:39.070> on<00:05:39.550> you're

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
you get your timing down on you're

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.140 
you get your timing down on you're
reapplying<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.740> throttle<00:05:42.220> step<00:05:42.460> or<00:05:42.669> step<00:05:42.880> five

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
reapplying of throttle step or step five

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.810 
reapplying of throttle step or step five
and<00:05:43.540> you<00:05:44.500> should<00:05:44.770> be<00:05:44.919> just<00:05:44.950> fine<00:05:45.490> but<00:05:45.520> that's
