his opponent was mined out I mean if

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.150 
his opponent was mined out I mean if
you're<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.180> boxers<00:00:39.600> position<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.920> float

you're in boxers position you just float

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
you're in boxers position you just float
to<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.340> corners<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> superior<00:00:43.020> Viking

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
mean boxer may have tried to force a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.130 
mean boxer may have tried to force a
draw<00:00:50.550> earlier<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.360> his<00:00:51.510> unit<00:00:51.809> count<00:00:52.020> is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
draw earlier but now his unit count is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.529 
draw earlier but now his unit count is
just<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.559> too<00:00:52.680> low<00:00:53.090> rate<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
just a little too low rate is going to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.139 
just a little too low rate is going to
catch<00:00:54.719> them<00:00:54.930> off<00:00:55.110> guard<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> huge

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
catch them off guard and there is a huge

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.250 
catch them off guard and there is a huge
