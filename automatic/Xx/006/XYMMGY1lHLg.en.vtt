00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.840
 yes because so far worked well with a quick game found 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.049
 then had to intervene 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.260

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.109

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.909

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.200
 Improve pitch and then percent because we have the title but otherwise the one else 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.940

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 me myself 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.770
 as he us 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770

 Century was the mood in court we have the teams 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.569
 the better to prevent 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.669
 This does not always help 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.669
 with the 4 1 at the window life situations 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.799

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.290
