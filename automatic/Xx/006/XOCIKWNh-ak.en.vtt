00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:14.699 
usually while back in the day I started

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.179 
usually while back in the day I started
with<00:00:14.910> these<00:00:15.500> messenger<00:00:16.500> bags<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.039> would

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
with these messenger bags that would

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.400 
with these messenger bags that would
slay<00:00:17.460> across<00:00:17.849> one<00:00:18.240> shoulder<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.259> would

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
slay across one shoulder and I would

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.960 
slay across one shoulder and I would
switch<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:20.039> through<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> night<00:00:20.700> one

for about a couple years and then my

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.159 
for about a couple years and then my
shoulder<00:00:25.829> said<00:00:26.070> enough<00:00:26.579> I<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.689> pain<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
looking around at modular belt systems I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
looking around at modular belt systems I
kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> heard<00:00:34.290> about<00:00:34.469> him<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.760> what

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
think tanks sells a modular system which

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.899 
think tanks sells a modular system which
is<00:00:39.000> actually<00:00:39.690> fairly<00:00:40.320> inexpensive<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> they

itself what's really cool about it I got
the<00:00:55.920> thin<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:56.670> come<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.999> three

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
the thin one they come in three

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.509 
the thin one they come in three
different<00:00:57.390> varieties<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.739> thin<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.159> doesn't

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
different varieties the thin one doesn't

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.759 
different varieties the thin one doesn't
have<00:00:59.729> a<00:00:59.760> pad<00:01:00.269> so<00:01:00.659> it's<00:01:00.839> nice<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.109> light<00:01:01.530> but

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
have a pad so it's nice and light but

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.250 
have a pad so it's nice and light but
it's<00:01:02.010> thick<00:01:02.339> enough<00:01:02.639> so<00:01:02.909> I<00:01:03.569> feel<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.019> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it's thick enough so I feel like it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.920 
it's thick enough so I feel like it's
durable<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.800> safe<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.390> locking

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
durable and safe it's got these locking

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.539 
durable and safe it's got these locking
mechanisms<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.190> that<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.120> clip<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> on

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
mechanisms on it so that as I clip it on

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.550 
mechanisms on it so that as I clip it on
it<00:01:11.549> doesn't<00:01:11.970> slide<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.720> forth<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.409> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it doesn't slide back and forth some of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.500 
it doesn't slide back and forth some of
these<00:01:13.710> belts<00:01:14.070> don't<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.210> little

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
these belts don't have this little

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.990 
these belts don't have this little
stopper<00:01:15.870> right<00:01:16.050> here<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.620> it<00:01:17.340> unsliced

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
stopper right here and it unsliced

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
stopper right here and it unsliced
itself<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> through<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> night<00:01:19.230> because<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
itself and through the night because of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
itself and through the night because of
the<00:01:19.740> weight<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.370> starts<00:01:20.820> loosening<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.420> with

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the weight it starts loosening up with

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
the weight it starts loosening up with
these<00:01:22.230> things<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.770> place<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.370> doesn't<00:01:23.550> loosen

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
these things in place it doesn't loosen

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.020 
these things in place it doesn't loosen
up<00:01:24.120> at<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> adjust<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.430> side<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
up at all so I adjust it to my side and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.360 
up at all so I adjust it to my side and
then<00:01:27.120> it<00:01:27.300> doesn't<00:01:27.450> move<00:01:27.690> all<00:01:27.960> night<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> other

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
then it doesn't move all night the other

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.790 
then it doesn't move all night the other
thing<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.760> this<00:01:30.060> belt<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.590> these

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
thing about this belt is it's got these

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.060 
thing about this belt is it's got these
little<00:01:32.100> loops<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.080> kind<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.620> act<00:01:34.830> as

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
little loops on it so the kind of act as

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.530 
little loops on it so the kind of act as
Stoppers<00:01:35.930> each<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.260> these<00:01:37.410> pouches<00:01:37.800> um<00:01:38.550> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
Stoppers each of these pouches um you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.930 
Stoppers each of these pouches um you
can<00:01:39.720> either<00:01:40.130> slide<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
can either slide it all the way in

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.790 
can either slide it all the way in
through<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.330> belt<00:01:42.540> or<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.230> got<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.410> velcro

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
that's just the way I roll so I needed a

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.400 
that's just the way I roll so I needed a
lens<00:02:22.900> pouch<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:24.130> could<00:02:24.370> fit<00:02:24.700> my<00:02:24.960> 7200<00:02:25.960> as<00:02:26.110> my

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
longest one and I found this it's the

checked this morning and the belt itself

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.940 
checked this morning and the belt itself
at<00:05:24.729> least<00:05:25.000> for<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.300> unpadded<00:05:25.720> one<00:05:26.080> runs<00:05:26.560> in

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
dollars I think depending on the size

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.610 
dollars I think depending on the size
that<00:05:31.270> you<00:05:31.390> decide<00:05:31.780> because<00:05:32.080> it<00:05:32.200> comes<00:05:32.410> in<00:05:32.500> a

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
that you decide because it comes in a

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.760 
that you decide because it comes in a
variety<00:05:32.800> of<00:05:33.070> sizes<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:34.360> pouches<00:05:34.770> themselves

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
variety of sizes the pouches themselves

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.890 
variety of sizes the pouches themselves
