to achieve that silky smooth water

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440 
to achieve that silky smooth water
effect<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.580> sure<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.940> may<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.240> seen

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
effect that I'm sure you may have seen

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.540 
effect that I'm sure you may have seen
in<00:00:15.630> several<00:00:15.839> outdoor<00:00:16.529> photos<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.100> have

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
in several outdoor photos that have

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.390 
in several outdoor photos that have
moving<00:00:18.090> water<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.539> some<00:00:18.750> sort<00:00:19.100> now<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> achieve

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
moving water of some sort now to achieve

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.429 
moving water of some sort now to achieve
this<00:00:20.730> effect<00:00:20.939> there<00:00:21.480> are<00:00:21.570> basically<00:00:21.960> three

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
this effect there are basically three

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
this effect there are basically three
components<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.400> those<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.539> ISO<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:26.090> f-stop

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
components and those are ISO the f-stop

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
components and those are ISO the f-stop
and<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.810> shutter<00:00:28.019> speed<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:28.590> camera<00:00:29.010> by

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and the shutter speed of your camera by

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
and the shutter speed of your camera by
adjusting<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.179> settings<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.080> achieve

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
adjusting these settings you can achieve

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
adjusting these settings you can achieve
the<00:00:31.529> effect<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.369> we're<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.610> start<00:00:32.850> out

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the effect and we're going to start out

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.959 
the effect and we're going to start out
with<00:00:33.059> ISO<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.800> ISO<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.309> essentially<00:00:35.820> your

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
with ISO the ISO is essentially your

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.569 
with ISO the ISO is essentially your
camera<00:00:36.270> sensitivity<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> purposes

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
camera sensitivity but for the purposes

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.430 
camera sensitivity but for the purposes
of<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.180> video<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.809> worry<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
of this video don't worry about that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
of this video don't worry about that
just<00:00:40.469> set<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.219> 100<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.690> should<00:00:42.930> be

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
just set it at 100 and you should be

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.299 
just set it at 100 and you should be
good<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.320> go

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
good to go

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.270 
good to go
and<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.809> you're<00:00:46.289> unsure<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> do

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and also if you're unsure of how to do

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.790 
and also if you're unsure of how to do
this<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:48.149> sure<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.539> consult<00:00:49.230> your<00:00:49.350> camera's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
this be sure to consult your camera's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
this be sure to consult your camera's
owner's<00:00:50.340> manual<00:00:50.760> every<00:00:51.059> camera<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> little

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
owner's manual every camera is a little

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
owner's manual every camera is a little
bit<00:00:51.870> different<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.890> you'll<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.610> how

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
bit different so you'll have to look how

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.639 
bit different so you'll have to look how
to<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.329> specifically<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.289> camera

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
to do that specifically on your camera

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.860 
to do that specifically on your camera
but<00:00:55.860> once<00:00:56.039> you've<00:00:56.190> done<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:57.570> set<00:00:57.780> your

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
but once you've done that and set your

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.529 
but once you've done that and set your
ISO<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.379> 100<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.160> set<00:00:59.489> next<00:01:00.239> you'll

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
ISO at 100 you're all set next you'll

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750 
ISO at 100 you're all set next you'll
want<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.750> deal<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> aperture<00:01:01.890> now

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
want to deal with the aperture now

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
want to deal with the aperture now
depending<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> lens<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.379> your

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
depending on the lens you have your

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.570 
depending on the lens you have your
aperture<00:01:06.049> range<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.409> vary<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.369> you're

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
aperture range can vary but you're

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
aperture range can vary but you're
probably<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.869> small<00:01:10.260> aperture

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
probably going to want a small aperture

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.219 
probably going to want a small aperture
an<00:01:11.130> aperture<00:01:11.729> tries<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.390> confuse<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.990> by

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
an aperture tries to confuse you by

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.830 
an aperture tries to confuse you by
making<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:14.549> number<00:01:14.939> mean<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> smaller

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
making the big number mean the smaller

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620 
making the big number mean the smaller
aperture<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.700> you're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> go

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
aperture but you're going to want to go

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
aperture but you're going to want to go
towards<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.259> bigger<00:01:19.770> numbers<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
towards those bigger numbers so that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929 
towards those bigger numbers so that
you're<00:01:21.270> letting<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.750> less<00:01:22.020> light<00:01:22.369> because<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you're letting in less light because the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.570 
you're letting in less light because the
key<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.540> silky<00:01:25.380> smooth<00:01:25.710> water<00:01:25.890> effect<00:01:26.369> is

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
key to this silky smooth water effect is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.149 
key to this silky smooth water effect is
to<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.689> long<00:01:27.990> shutter<00:01:28.350> speed<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.950> when

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to have a long shutter speed and when

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
to have a long shutter speed and when
you<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> long<00:01:29.700> shutter<00:01:29.939> speed<00:01:30.090> you're

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you have a long shutter speed you're

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.690 
you have a long shutter speed you're
letting<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> light<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> higher

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
letting in a lot of light so that higher

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.660 
letting in a lot of light so that higher
f-stop<00:01:33.240> number<00:01:33.770> is<00:01:34.770> how<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
f-stop number is how you kind of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
f-stop number is how you kind of
compensate<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> keep<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> exposure<00:01:37.229> within

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
compensate to keep the exposure within

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
compensate to keep the exposure within
the<00:01:37.829> proper<00:01:38.189> range

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the proper range

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.270 
the proper range
but<00:01:39.869> moving<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> shutter<00:01:40.770> speed<00:01:40.950> where

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
but moving on to the shutter speed where

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
but moving on to the shutter speed where
the<00:01:41.460> meat<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.420> effect<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:43.110> takes

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the meat of this effect really takes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.920 
the meat of this effect really takes
place<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.820> shutter<00:01:45.270> speed<00:01:45.659> between

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
place you want a shutter speed between

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.160 
place you want a shutter speed between
maybe<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.799> quarter<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.610> second<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.330> five

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
maybe a quarter of a second to five

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.870 
maybe a quarter of a second to five
seconds<00:01:49.710> somewhere<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.280> range<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
seconds somewhere in that range is a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.289 
seconds somewhere in that range is a
good<00:01:51.119> place<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.360> start<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.759> basically<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
good place to start and basically this

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
good place to start and basically this
is<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.600> personal<00:01:54.869> preference<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.830> can<00:01:55.860> take

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
is all personal preference you can take

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.240 
is all personal preference you can take
a<00:01:56.189> photo<00:01:56.659> see<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.960> water<00:01:58.259> looks<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.920> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a photo see how the water looks if it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
a photo see how the water looks if it
looks<00:01:59.490> still<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.330> too<00:02:00.479> choppy<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.560> can

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
looks still kind of too choppy you can

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.320 
looks still kind of too choppy you can
increase<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.369> length<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.880> shutter<00:02:03.119> speed

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
increase the length of the shutter speed

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.779 
increase the length of the shutter speed
from<00:02:03.689> maybe<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.170> quarter<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> second<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.610> two

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
from maybe a quarter of a second to two

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.419 
from maybe a quarter of a second to two
seconds<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.590> you're<00:02:07.860> still<00:02:07.979> feeling

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
seconds and then if you're still feeling

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
seconds and then if you're still feeling
that<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.970> could<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.239> even<00:02:09.360> smoother<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.410> know

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that it could be even smoother you know

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.890 
that it could be even smoother you know
try<00:02:10.769> three<00:02:11.640> seconds<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.299> just<00:02:12.360> kind<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> work

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
try three seconds and just kind of work

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.199 
try three seconds and just kind of work
down<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.380> range<00:02:14.010> until<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.610> find<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.000> shutter

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
down the range until you find a shutter

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.539 
down the range until you find a shutter
speed<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:17.130> play<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
speed that you like as you play with the

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.430 
speed that you like as you play with the
shutter<00:02:17.790> speed<00:02:18.000> we'll<00:02:18.690> probably<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> go

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
shutter speed we'll probably have to go

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.759 
shutter speed we'll probably have to go
back<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> aperture<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.730> kind<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.420> adjust

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
back to the aperture and kind of adjust

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.610 
back to the aperture and kind of adjust
and<00:02:22.769> either<00:02:23.280> float<00:02:24.030> close<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.049> aperture<00:02:25.319> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and either float close the aperture to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.830 
and either float close the aperture to
let<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:25.950> less<00:02:26.130> light<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.489> you're<00:02:26.750> having<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
let and less light if you're having a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.509 
let and less light if you're having a
longer<00:02:28.230> shutter<00:02:28.410> speed<00:02:28.799> towards<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.280> five

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
longer shutter speed towards that five

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.910 
longer shutter speed towards that five
second<00:02:30.000> end<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.269> things<00:02:30.420> or<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:31.470> you're<00:02:31.739> moving

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
second end of things or if you're moving

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.039 
second end of things or if you're moving
forward<00:02:32.760> toward<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.269> quarter<00:02:33.660> second

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049

shutter<00:02:34.530> speed<00:02:34.700> obviously<00:02:35.700> off<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.390> go<00:02:36.510> back

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
shutter speed obviously off to go back

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.789 
shutter speed obviously off to go back
to<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.989> f-stop<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:39.049> open<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.170> up<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.440> bit<00:02:40.470> to

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
to the f-stop and open it up a bit to

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.229 
to the f-stop and open it up a bit to
let<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.310> light<00:02:41.580> that's<00:02:41.849> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> give

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
let in that light that's going to give

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.960 
let in that light that's going to give
you<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> proper<00:02:42.810> exposure<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.579> know<00:02:44.730> that's

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
you a proper exposure so I know that's

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.240 
you a proper exposure so I know that's
pretty<00:02:45.329> confusing<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.920> get<00:02:47.100> out

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
pretty confusing but if you get out

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.440 
pretty confusing but if you get out
there<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.579> start<00:02:47.850> playing<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
there and start playing with the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.930 
there and start playing with the
settings<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:49.620> kind<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.250> easiest<00:02:50.670> way

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
settings that's kind of the easiest way

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.420 
settings that's kind of the easiest way
to<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.269> feel<00:02:51.510> for<00:02:51.540> what<00:02:51.959> all<00:02:52.230> those<00:02:52.799> various

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.880 
to get a feel for what all those various
