00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 imagine in the doctor's office 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.569
 evaluating some blood tests 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.019
 suddenly the doctor frowns and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.559
 says he does not have high uric acid the one 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.179
 you answer and suddenly remember that 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.760
 someone once told him that he had to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.939
 leave beer and red meat because 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.390
 had episodes of gout then if there's 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.560
 foods that exacerbate this condition 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 definitely with some adjustments in the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.570
 diet we can take those chemicals to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.790
 healthy level and that's what this 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 edition said the kitchen our 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.290
 proposal for a tasty meal without 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 raise even more the uric acid consists 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.780
 in roasted potatoes seasoned with 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.910
 paprika and rosemary accompanied by a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.329
 grilled breast with oil 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.360
 very aromatic coriander this menu and for 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.930
 the final sweet about brownies with cheese 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.180
 fat cream and raspberries as well 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 they start half an hour of taste and health 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.390
 welcome to another edition you want the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.920
 kitchen from the the mosque and being the 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.190
 society so so 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.710
 settle eat very well that great 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.960
 host here we are again with the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.780
 chef professor and nutritionist cristian 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.490
 rivera who today deepens in their 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.950
 knowledge as a nutritionist 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.640
 precisely true to help us 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.960
 design a menu that is tasty that is 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.490
 healthy and that everything on everything is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.980
 beneficial for people who have that 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.830
 very high uric acid level and 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.170
 they need to reduce it and it's interesting 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.580
 because uric acid and how they have the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.990
 word that not everyone understands 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.850
 so for everyone 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.520
 understand drop by drop that is a kind of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.800
 arthritis is an inflammation and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.140
 conjunctures and happens in all 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.840
 joints is when the uric acid does not 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.530
 we can remove it from the body clear well 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.670
 which is increased to levels where 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.650
 place inside the painting and bring 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.379
 discomfort pain 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.060
 they say that a lot of pain a lot of pain is not 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.680
 I have an idea of how an episode of that is 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.599
 but to the people who have suffered it 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.629
 blessed they say it is very very painful 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.090
 but it is also interesting the fact 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.129
 that if the condition is very critical the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.410
 doctor will probably give you some 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.910
 medication but the first thing that is going to 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 to say is to modify the diet so 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.349
 only with what you ingest something 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.909
 that it is necessary that it is pleasant 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.220
 true because we all like to eat 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.440
 we need to eat and eat nothing 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.349
 more start and you can solve your 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.870
 problem so you can metabolize well 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.090
 that's a problem that happens because 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.859
 a metabolization of the purine occurred 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.590
 which is a component of proteins 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.739
 Exactly the same thing I'm learning 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.299
 a lot is very interesting because when 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.980
 is metabolizing these meats 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.950
 specifically meats from sources 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.930
 red if the network is higher than 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.470
 Lamb of the ice cream 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.660
 then consuming a lot or frequent 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.690
 of this same 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.420
 with reducing the amount or changing the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.980
 protein source we already started that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.870
 the body gives the opportunity to 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.670
 remove light naturally and 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.110
 value of pain 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.120
 Well, let's start with a 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.500
 classic recipe is for everything for nothing what 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.790
 first thing we're going to be doing is 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.260
 We will be working with some potatoes 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.210
 in which we will be complementing 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.740
 later on, so what are the 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.750
 potatoes that I could be using on the day 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.290
 today I'm using the wellington pin 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.950
 cheiros and they look like little fingers 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.960
 pinger single this and the interesting thing 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.780
 these chips that have a low 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.870
 starch content so they are digested 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.930
 pretty easy they have enough fibers 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.790
 that helped me extract all the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.650
 we are going to eat them with the 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.240
 house and we're going to eat with everything and home 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.670
 so what I'm going to do is fine 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.310
 easy to choose our peeled potatoes 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.920
 I chop them and I'm going to add oil 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.030
 extra virgin olive the aie simply 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.030
 as to cover them 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.330
 I 'm going to take the fresh rosemary 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.580
 love is my favorite and what 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.370
 interesting of the rosemary oil that we 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.220
 helps to eliminate like mint 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.110
 that's what those mint species 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.360
 They help eliminate toxins from the body and 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.980
 that's exactly what we need is 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:41.850
 what we need a little bit of salt and 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:44.160
 of pepper and here I have what I'm using 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.190
 more in the kitchen in which an excellent 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.190
 coloring that flavor is a damn 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.650
 so what we do is simply what 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.169
 marine was the navy we go a little bit and 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.779
 we are going to put them in the oven at 350 degrees 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.659
 for about 40 minutes and it will put 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:09.370
 well golden because it's super are going 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.370
 to caramelize so we're going 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.080
 a palette of flavors 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.849
 then we will put in the oven and 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.930
 I have some here so I can 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.930
 see her very well 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.800
 this is this is the color and this what 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.600
 We are looking for 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.670
 We are looking for some golden chips 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.870
 think sounded but very important 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.430
 seasoned with the same flavors 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.680
 natural that already has candles and not 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.660
 we have to add too much because 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.910
 part from what it is to clean the 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.830
 system is trying to eliminate all 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.080
 correct over seasonings 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.850
 specifically the colors before and 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.250
 try the cinema integration of this 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.950
 very well, it is fantastic 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.370
 also the potato is super nutritious is a 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.250
 food that pleases everyone at all 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.380
 ages children will be 12 this the young 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.450
 of the elderly also of course 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.160
 and it's something that satisfies our 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.840
 disguises centers to feel that no 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.820
 eating this type of potatoes unlike 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.590
 to another type of potatoes and kike city 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.760
 maybe you can consume it you stay 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.920
 more or less equal for the amount of 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.840
 fiber that is perfect good then 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.210
 but this is not the only thing that will be 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.669
 at the table for you there will be a clear 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.980
 because we have said that it is 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.050
 important to modify the consumption of meat 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.840
 but particularly red meat not 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.240
 we have it then we have to leave the 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.160
 complex other meat white meat for the 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.210
 oven we can use please 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.130
 this chicken sleep let's go to the fish and 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.780
 the same way the grains the proteins of 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.850
 clear vegetable sources of course 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.980
 but then we are going to accompany these 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.170
 potatoes of a breast and let's make a 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.450
 grilled chicken breast with a sauce 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.520
 cilantro an oil decide and for 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.080
 perform well the flavor and so when 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.600
 you test is the chick you think 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.060
 totally different from the chick that 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.760
 ate before now, how beautiful is with me 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.500
 very well do not withdraw that after this 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.280
 brief pause we continue with more here in 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.280
 the kitchen 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.560
