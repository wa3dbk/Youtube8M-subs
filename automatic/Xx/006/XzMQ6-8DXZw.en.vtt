00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
process the actual bridge would be here

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
process the actual bridge would be here
and<00:00:44.840> here<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> gatehouse<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:47.480> have

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and here will be the gatehouse I have

and here will be the gatehouse I have
spent<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.440> time<00:00:49.739> by<00:00:50.550> hand<00:00:50.879> without

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
spent a lot of time by hand without

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
spent a lot of time by hand without
using<00:00:51.510> single<00:00:52.020> player<00:00:52.170> commands<00:00:52.469> we're

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
using single player commands we're

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.150 
using single player commands we're
moving<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.579> tire<00:00:54.239> mount<00:00:54.480> inside<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.170> have

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
moving this in tire mount inside I have

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010 
moving this in tire mount inside I have
to<00:00:56.190> fill<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> water<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.239> blocks<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to fill up the water with blocks and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.099 
to fill up the water with blocks and
then<00:00:58.680> use<00:00:58.890> TNT<00:00:59.510> for<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
then use TNT for a little bit of

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.609 
then use TNT for a little bit of
controlled<00:01:01.800> demolition<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.470> see

and have the water kind of flow into the
river<00:02:09.880> nicely<00:02:10.390> make<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.110> look<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> little<00:02:11.380> bit

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
river nicely make it look a little bit

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.589 
river nicely make it look a little bit
more<00:02:11.680> natural<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:14.110> also<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.620> find<00:02:14.830> a

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
more natural and I also have to find a

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.930 
more natural and I also have to find a
gate<00:02:16.599> design<00:02:16.959> I've<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.099> filled<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.400> up<00:02:18.459> with

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
gate design I've just filled it up with

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.300 
gate design I've just filled it up with
wood<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.390> now<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.040> going<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.190> look

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
wood for now but it's not going to look

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.220 
wood for now but it's not going to look
like<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.849> have<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.330> finish<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.959> off<00:02:23.019> as

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
like that I have to finish that off as

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.229 
like that I have to finish that off as
well<00:02:23.380> as<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:25.660> design<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:27.190> kept<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.030> adding

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
well as for design I just kept on adding

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:28.680 
well as for design I just kept on adding
layers

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
layers

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.020 
layers
I<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.650> turned<00:02:29.860> out<00:02:30.130> like<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.790> honest

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
I just turned out like this to be honest

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.770 
I just turned out like this to be honest
I<00:02:31.530> got<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> couple<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.340> upside<00:02:34.269> down<00:02:34.420> stairs

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
I got a couple of upside down stairs

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.940 
I got a couple of upside down stairs
here<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:36.150> got<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.180> cover<00:02:38.140> song<00:02:38.380> fence<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.590> just

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
here I got a cover song fence and just

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.750 
here I got a cover song fence and just
as<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.940> said<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.239> added<00:02:43.540> layers<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
as I said I just added layers and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.000 
as I said I just added layers and
eventually<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.910> got<00:02:46.030> thicker<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:47.739> added

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
eventually it got thicker and I added

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.039 
eventually it got thicker and I added
all<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.340> design<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:48.880> cobblestone<00:02:49.750> stairs

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
all this design with cobblestone stairs

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.180 
all this design with cobblestone stairs
and<00:02:50.350> stuff<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.709> that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
and stuff like that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.580 
and stuff like that
I<00:02:51.220> also<00:02:51.910> added<00:02:52.120> these<00:02:52.299> wooden<00:02:52.600> buttons<00:02:52.810> for

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
I also added these wooden buttons for

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.539 
I also added these wooden buttons for
any<00:02:53.769> did<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.950> bit<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.100> woods<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.370> I

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
any did a bit of woods and this is it I

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.949 
any did a bit of woods and this is it I
had<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.579> find<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.940> way<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.120> keep<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.480> waterfall

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
had to find a way to keep the waterfall

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.280 
had to find a way to keep the waterfall
and<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:04.510> did<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.170> by<00:03:05.350> adding<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.510> water

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
and I did that by adding this the water

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.970 
and I did that by adding this the water
flows<00:03:08.950> down<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.819> side<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.269> wall

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
flows down to the side of the wall

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.360 
flows down to the side of the wall
empties<00:03:11.980> through<00:03:12.190> here<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:13.380> then<00:03:14.380> leads<00:03:15.130> out

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
empties through here and then leads out

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.229 
empties through here and then leads out
for<00:03:15.670> this<00:03:15.790> bottom<00:03:16.359> layer<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.700> little<00:03:19.060> space

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
for this bottom layer so a little space

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.270 
for this bottom layer so a little space
here<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.600> work<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.260> don't<00:03:20.739> know<00:03:21.130> what<00:03:21.220> I'm

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
here to work with I don't know what I'm

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.190 
here to work with I don't know what I'm
going<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.430> be<00:03:21.519> doing<00:03:21.639> with<00:03:21.819> it<00:03:21.850> yet<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:23.079> just

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
going to be doing with it yet it's just

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.960 
going to be doing with it yet it's just
I<00:03:23.380> had<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.590> find<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.829> way<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:23.980> keep<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.609> gravel

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
I had to find a way to keep the gravel

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.080 
I had to find a way to keep the gravel
path<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.680> just<00:03:27.010> made<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.340> makeshift

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
path so I just made this makeshift

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.410 
path so I just made this makeshift
tunnel<00:03:28.600> here<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:30.609> will<00:03:30.700> pass<00:03:30.970> through

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
tunnel here and that will pass through

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.420 
tunnel here and that will pass through
the<00:03:31.720> temple<00:03:33.480> whoops<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:36.069> will<00:03:36.190> pass<00:03:36.370> through

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
the temple whoops it will pass through

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.930 
the temple whoops it will pass through
liyan<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.359> underbelly<00:03:38.109> of<00:03:38.230> this<00:03:38.380> temple<00:03:38.940> come

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
liyan the underbelly of this temple come

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.210 
liyan the underbelly of this temple come
up<00:03:40.060> from<00:03:40.269> here<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.630> then<00:03:41.440> we<00:03:41.470> need<00:03:41.560> up<00:03:41.889> to<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
up from here and then we need up to the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.670 
up from here and then we need up to the
mountain<00:03:42.579> side<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:44.230> will<00:03:44.319> lead<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.530> a

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
mountain side and it will lead to a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.220 
mountain side and it will lead to a
small<00:03:45.040> cave<00:03:45.310> which<00:03:46.299> will<00:03:46.510> then<00:03:46.660> pass<00:03:46.959> through

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
small cave which will then pass through

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.760 
small cave which will then pass through
to<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.739> other<00:03:47.889> side

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
to the other side

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.650 
to the other side
so<00:03:50.770> I<00:03:51.990> mean<00:03:52.990> it's<00:03:53.110> looking<00:03:53.380> pretty<00:03:53.560> amazing<00:03:54.130> I

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
so I mean it's looking pretty amazing I

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.390 
so I mean it's looking pretty amazing I
honestly<00:03:55.660> didn't<00:03:55.930> expect<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.350> but<00:03:57.100> as<00:03:57.280> well

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
honestly didn't expect this but as well

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.000 
honestly didn't expect this but as well
I<00:03:57.430> spent<00:03:57.730> 10<00:03:57.970> hours<00:03:58.210> building<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.740> so<00:03:59.740> we<00:03:59.830> can

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
I spent 10 hours building it so we can

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.810 
I spent 10 hours building it so we can
just<00:04:00.160> imagine<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:02.160> probably<00:04:03.160> adding<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.640> little

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
just imagine I probably adding a little

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.940 
just imagine I probably adding a little
bit<00:04:03.910> more<00:04:04.000> greenery<00:04:04.450> these<00:04:05.440> trees<00:04:05.800> were

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
bit more greenery these trees were

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.150 
bit more greenery these trees were
actually<00:04:06.420> fireplaces<00:04:07.530> but<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.680> thought<00:04:09.010> it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
actually fireplaces but I thought it

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.990 
actually fireplaces but I thought it
needed<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.430> bit<00:04:09.550> of<00:04:09.580> her<00:04:10.590> green<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:12.160> added<00:04:12.880> these

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
needed a bit of her green so added these

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.199 
needed a bit of her green so added these
trees<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:14.310> probably<00:04:15.310> add<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> couple<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.940> vines

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
trees I probably add a couple of vines

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.880 
trees I probably add a couple of vines
and<00:04:17.170> stuff<00:04:17.410> like<00:04:17.560> that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
and stuff like that

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.000 
and stuff like that
so<00:04:18.040> I<00:04:18.780> won't<00:04:19.780> be<00:04:20.110> doing<00:04:20.290> any<00:04:20.440> building<00:04:20.799> on<00:04:20.890> this

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
so I won't be doing any building on this

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.330 
so I won't be doing any building on this
video<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.960> will<00:04:22.960> be<00:04:23.200> keeping<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:23.620> updated<00:04:23.740> I
