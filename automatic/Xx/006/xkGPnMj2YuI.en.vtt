we are now officially in business with
our<00:00:25.939> mountain

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.440 

right<00:00:42.280> better<00:00:42.640> I<00:00:42.730> guess<00:00:42.940> better<00:00:43.300> than

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
right better I guess better than

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.300 
right better I guess better than
something<00:00:43.900> else<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:47.620> example<00:00:47.980> this<00:00:48.100> guy

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
something else for example this guy

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.430 
something else for example this guy
though<00:00:49.240> I<00:00:49.270> I<00:00:49.420> don't<00:00:49.990> imagine<00:00:50.230> he<00:00:50.920> is<00:00:52.440> easily

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
though I I don't imagine he is easily

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:04.329 
though I I don't imagine he is easily
going<00:00:53.830> to<00:00:53.920> survive

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:14.130 

mmm<00:01:05.409> it's<00:01:06.409> pretty<00:01:06.500> good

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.460 

yes<00:01:14.770> we'll<00:01:14.950> try<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.220> draw<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.290> pretty

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
yes we'll try to draw the this is pretty

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.490 
yes we'll try to draw the this is pretty
good<00:01:20.680> with<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.860> frost<00:01:21.159> titan

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.460 

try<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> save<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.760> for<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.350> sort<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
try to save it for that sort of the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.970 
try to save it for that sort of the
cutthroat

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:47.700 

if<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:34.610> can<00:01:34.730> draw<00:01:34.910> out<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.120> pacifism<00:01:35.510> great

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.960 

if<00:01:48.250> not<00:01:48.490> I<00:01:48.549> guess<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.299> Dragon<00:01:49.750> will

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.430 

I<00:01:57.060> mean<00:01:57.690> we<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.900> be<00:01:58.020> relatively<00:01:58.410> sure<00:01:59.600> that<00:02:00.600> he

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
I mean we can be relatively sure that he

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.530 
I mean we can be relatively sure that he
doesn't<00:02:01.620> have<00:02:01.770> another<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> life<00:02:03.150> link<00:02:03.390> in

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
doesn't have another like a life link in

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450 
doesn't have another like a life link in
his<00:02:03.660> hand<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.050> we've<00:02:04.230> didn't<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.160> first<00:02:05.310> time

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
his hand or we've didn't the first time

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.210 
his hand or we've didn't the first time
because<00:02:05.730> he<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.660> life<00:02:06.870> like<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
because he just would have life like the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.660 
because he just would have life like the
day<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:08.490> rather<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.790> pacifism<00:02:10.400> no<00:02:11.400> he's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
day or rather than pacifism no he's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.440 
day or rather than pacifism no he's
gonna<00:02:11.820> pass<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.230> that's<00:02:14.240> probably<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.300> mistake

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
gonna pass it that's probably a mistake

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.610 
gonna pass it that's probably a mistake
but<00:02:15.900> I'll<00:02:16.500> take<00:02:16.680> it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.820 

getting<00:02:23.489> close<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.060> frost<00:02:24.330> titan<00:02:25.519> will

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
getting close to the frost titan will

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.559 
getting close to the frost titan will
dragen<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.040> up<00:02:30.560> shock<00:02:31.560> open<00:02:31.920> i<00:02:32.420> guess<00:02:33.420> i<00:02:33.510> could

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
dragen it up shock open i guess i could

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.550 
dragen it up shock open i guess i could
shock<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.019> alabaster<00:02:34.980> mage<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.909> my<00:02:36.090> turn

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
shock the alabaster mage on my turn

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.750 
shock the alabaster mage on my turn

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
kill the alabaster mage if he killed my

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.569 
kill the alabaster mage if he killed my
dragon<00:02:47.360> he<00:02:48.360> found<00:02:48.629> another<00:02:48.780> aura<00:02:49.579> it's

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:04:04.620 

not<00:03:48.940> bad<00:03:49.440> not<00:03:50.440> bad<00:03:50.470> at<00:03:50.770> all

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:14.520 

you<00:04:05.200> use<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.680> bus<00:04:05.860> two<00:04:06.010> plus<00:04:06.190> two<00:04:06.220> that's<00:04:07.050> fine

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.920 

I<00:04:14.620> definitely<00:04:15.190> want<00:04:15.490> to<00:04:15.520> land<00:04:15.730> here<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.810> we

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
I definitely want to land here there we

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:35.310 
I definitely want to land here there we
go<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.560> are<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:19.030> business

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:55.040 

and<00:04:35.500> another<00:04:36.340> one<00:04:36.490> coming<00:04:36.820> next<00:04:36.970> turn

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.580 

so<00:04:56.060> if<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.150> got<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.330> plus<00:04:57.509> two<00:04:57.690> plus<00:04:57.720> two<00:04:58.050> I

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
so if you got the plus two plus two I

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.189 
so if you got the plus two plus two I
don't<00:04:58.800> want<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.069> lose<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.930> can't<00:05:00.930> really<00:05:01.050> avoid

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
don't want to lose I can't really avoid

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:11.519 
don't want to lose I can't really avoid
losing<00:05:04.490> my<00:05:05.490> frost<00:05:05.819> titan

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:18.029 

for<00:05:12.129> one<00:05:12.279> of<00:05:12.369> them<00:05:12.489> at<00:05:12.609> least<00:05:12.639> but<00:05:13.499> i<00:05:16.889> think<00:05:17.889> i

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
for one of them at least but i think i

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:38.080 
for one of them at least but i think i
have<00:05:18.069> to<00:05:18.339> attack<00:05:18.609> her

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.390 

attack<00:05:38.930> with<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.139> dipped<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.860> probably<00:05:40.220> attack

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
attack with a dipped I probably attack

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.050 
attack with a dipped I probably attack
with<00:05:40.520> that<00:05:40.639> up<00:05:41.650> well<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:42.680> guess<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.550> did<00:05:43.669> throw<00:05:43.970> it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
with that up well I guess I did throw it

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.050 
with that up well I guess I did throw it
away<00:05:44.150> for<00:05:44.240> free<00:05:44.419> if<00:05:44.870> he<00:05:44.960> doesn't<00:05:45.350> have<00:05:45.500> the

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
away for free if he doesn't have the

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.250 
away for free if he doesn't have the
