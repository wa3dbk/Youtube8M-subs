a<00:02:19.930> QR<00:02:20.850> barcode<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:22.110> did<00:02:23.110> try<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.350> go<00:02:23.590> to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
a QR barcode I did try to go to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.039 
a QR barcode I did try to go to
youtube.com<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
youtube.com the

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.280 
youtube.com the
slash<00:02:26.830> pair<00:02:27.190> on<00:02:27.430> Safari<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.989> did<00:02:29.170> not

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
slash pair on Safari and that did not

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.550 
slash pair on Safari and that did not
work<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.920> think<00:02:30.040> that's<00:02:30.340> only<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:31.560> laptops

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
work so I think that's only for laptops

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.370 
work so I think that's only for laptops
