realism where the perfection of the
sculpt<00:02:32.620> should<00:02:32.800> not<00:02:32.950> only<00:02:33.070> end<00:02:33.220> up<00:02:33.310> at<00:02:33.550> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
sculpt should not only end up at the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.759 
sculpt should not only end up at the
skin<00:02:33.910> level<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.390> also<00:02:34.540> internally<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.560> was

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
skin level but also internally it was

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.640 
skin level but also internally it was
the<00:02:35.920> emotion<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.030> internalized<00:02:37.900> spirit

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
there is some confusion about is it a

thing<00:06:04.650> isn't<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:04.949> trying<00:06:05.189> to<00:06:05.249> fool<00:06:05.460> people<00:06:05.490> but

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:05.999 
thing isn't it trying to fool people but

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.869 
thing isn't it trying to fool people but
that<00:06:06.150> is<00:06:06.389> what<00:06:06.599> what<00:06:06.870> happens<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.499> I<00:06:08.069> spent<00:06:08.639> a

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
that is what what happens and I spent a

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.570 
that is what what happens and I spent a
lot<00:06:09.150> of<00:06:09.210> tension<00:06:09.659> a<00:06:10.020> lot<00:06:10.169> of<00:06:10.349> time<00:06:10.560> on<00:06:11.490> this

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
lot of tension a lot of time on this

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.939 
lot of tension a lot of time on this
finer<00:06:11.999> detail<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:13.289> there<00:06:13.499> isn't<00:06:13.620> any<00:06:13.740> of<00:06:13.860> those

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
finer detail so there isn't any of those

the<00:06:21.449> story<00:06:21.509> is<00:06:22.610> the<00:06:23.610> evolution<00:06:24.479> of<00:06:24.659> a<00:06:24.930> piece

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
the story is the evolution of a piece

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.119 
the story is the evolution of a piece
takes<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:27.360> takes<00:06:27.659> years<00:06:27.899> it<00:06:28.169> really<00:06:28.649> does<00:06:28.860> from

takes it takes years it really does from
very<00:06:29.819> often<00:06:30.120> maybe<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.419> core<00:06:30.659> the<00:06:30.839> piece<00:06:31.050> is

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
very often maybe the core the piece is

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.550 
very often maybe the core the piece is
done<00:06:31.379> in<00:06:31.710> say<00:06:32.370> six<00:06:32.639> months<00:06:33.169> but<00:06:34.169> then<00:06:34.349> there's

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
done in say six months but then there's

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.170

look at a piece I said I could improve

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.619 
look at a piece I said I could improve
that<00:06:37.949> that<00:06:38.189> could<00:06:38.339> get<00:06:38.459> better<00:06:38.699> I<00:06:39.029> could
