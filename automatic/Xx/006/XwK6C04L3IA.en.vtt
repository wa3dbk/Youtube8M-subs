 they come with a very good finish and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.180
 lovely is a little rough 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.960

 and good starting here we will comment 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 what comes in between 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.970
 what is a bit how are you seeing 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 chubby for this part of here 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 well they will have done that for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.189
 to make the most of space 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.909
 because they really could have done it 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.909
 flatter 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.950
 bring two illustrations 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.719
 very very cool 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.920
 I dare say they are 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.650
 illustrations 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.040
 about stories from comics and 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.400
 novels 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.210
 with a brief description annotation of 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.210
 Luke Skywalker 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.539
 here we see another 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.520
 It's a pretty good cover box 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.569
 hard 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.910
 and with a finish with the symbols of a 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.120
 so bright color 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.180
 the box we can see also what is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 pretty tough tough 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.780
 of cardboard 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.780
 with respect to the books it is necessary to say 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.879
 good if we buy it separately each 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.550
 book would be much more expensive than 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.710
 We buy lux edition 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.710
 and the covers are exactly the same 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.519
 only that difference between the addition 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.110
 normality of looks that good the lateral 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:56.410
 of the books come with an effect 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.630
 in the Jedi path comes with an effect like that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.670
 as rough and rough feeling in the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.480
 pages in the leaves 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.180
 in the book of hits 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.940
 we see that they have added here a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.940
 different cut for each group of leaves 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.290
 in this book of the Jedi path 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.700
 let's see what a manual for 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.670
 for Jedi initiates and good is a work 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.680
 essential for every fan of the saga 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.590
 from star wars 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.380
 at the beginning we see that there is a list of 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.660
 names with a description here and 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.330
 they come to be therefore all the owners all 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.900
 the hands through which this 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.530
 book 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.280
 and they are well known are gioda conde 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.010
 dooku neck jean obi wan kenobi anakin 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.310
 skywalker ahsoka tano the padawan of 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.790
 anakin in the war in the clone wars 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.120
 of Sirius or Luke Skywalker these books 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.599
 above all this were found by 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.240
 luke skywalker a lot a long time ago 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.790
 after 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.159
 of having defeated the republic 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.789
 so then let's see in all the 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.229
 book throughout the book let's see 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.120
 annotations of all owners all 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.479
 the hands through which these have passed 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.419
 books is a very curious detail because 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.390
 they are as if they were annotations of 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.480
 students 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.860
 we see the prophecy crossed out as if they were 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.210
 government ge secret documents 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.210
 a lot of symbology throughout the book 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.840
 we see what the Jedi code is with the 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.840
 annotations 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.880
 but here is a map too but it's a 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.910
 old map do not come all the all 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.340
 the planets 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.780
 he explains you then 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.680
 how to become a jedi 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.910
 from the initial state that is when 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.970
 you are initiated as is the laser sword 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.139
 the different forms of combat like 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.139
 must be a padawan 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.449
 but here later there is a bestiary 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.230
 the different tests by which he has 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:29.490
 to spend a yeti to become 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.160
 in teacher that never appear in the 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.230
 films 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.310
 how should they be dressed 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:42.350
 the history of the sith have a lot 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.220
 of interesting things 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.220
 in this book 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.689
 if we go to the book of seven has 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:55.960
 also a very curious effect 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:59.139
 of brightness in the letters and in the finish 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.919
 well a main notation here of light 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.699
 that on the first page and this book is 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.699
 rather well 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:13.899
 a group of manuscripts 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.630
 that have been going through the hands of the 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:18.090
 sith 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.009
 well in very very cool illustrations 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.960
 as well 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.189
 look a bit then also the story 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.110
 that as I have already told in this book 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.289
 is based also on the comics is 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.469
 extracted from comics and novels 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:37.139
 Here he explains everything they do 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:39.689
 those who are the Jedi who have 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:42.030
 gone to the dark side or here comes another 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:45.450
 bestiary 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.080
 some manuscripts of the sith in his 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.539
 original language 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.159
 because you will not understand anything but if 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:56.349
 small translations appear 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:56.349
 they added later 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.770
 here it appears for example 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.920
 as if they were written in a notebook 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.870
 of pictures and annotations from time to time 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.000
 when from time to time 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.630
 and we return again to the effect of 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.630
 leaves here 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:21.110
 with a design 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:26.120
 very cool in these we see that they look 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:28.330
 totally manuscripts are written to 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.330
 hand 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.630
 this is more oval than the others 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.630
 Changing 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:41.430
 and well, it also explains the 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.430
 armor that bring two doses 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:51.260
 and well this is all for editing 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.260
 collector thank you very much
