and the sugar in the grape juice turns
to<00:02:08.190> alcohol<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.729> how<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:08.880> get<00:02:09.060> wine<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.990> the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
to alcohol that's how we get wine in the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.830 
to alcohol that's how we get wine in the
glass<00:02:10.350> it's<00:02:11.040> mostly<00:02:11.459> water<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.510> thirteen

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
glass it's mostly water if it's thirteen

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
glass it's mostly water if it's thirteen
percent<00:02:13.050> alcohol<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.590> pretty<00:02:13.740> much

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
percent alcohol you can pretty much

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
percent alcohol you can pretty much
guarantee<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.340> almost<00:02:14.820> all<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.209> rest<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.540> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
guarantee that almost all the rest of it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.420 
guarantee that almost all the rest of it
is<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.840> water<00:02:16.410> which<00:02:16.830> came<00:02:17.040> from<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.220> grapes

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
is just water which came from the grapes

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.270 
is just water which came from the grapes
to<00:02:17.580> start<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:17.910> alcohol<00:02:18.950> acid<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.130> there's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
to start with alcohol acid and there's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.470 
to start with alcohol acid and there's
dozens<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.760> different<00:02:20.880> asses<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.390> have

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
dozens of different asses we have

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.870 
dozens of different asses we have
different<00:02:21.780> flavors<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.700> flavorings<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
different flavors and flavorings the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.320 
different flavors and flavorings the
aroma<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> taste

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.450 

so<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.050> first<00:02:29.290> thing<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.530> do<00:02:29.710> when<00:02:29.950> you're

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
so the first thing you do when you're

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.450 
so the first thing you do when you're
assessing<00:02:30.640> one<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.180> look<00:02:31.420> at<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:32.460> what

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
assessing one is you look at it what

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.830 
assessing one is you look at it what
does<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.730> tell<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.060> well<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.450> tells<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.720> how

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
does it tell you well it tells you how

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.960 
does it tell you well it tells you how
old<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.140> wine<00:02:35.290> necessarily<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.950> or<00:02:36.310> maybe<00:02:36.730> how

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
old the wine necessarily is or maybe how

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.780 
old the wine necessarily is or maybe how
rich<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:38.350> color<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:39.010> vary<00:02:39.190> quite<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.460> lot<00:02:39.610> from

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
rich the color can vary quite a lot from

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.090 
rich the color can vary quite a lot from
very<00:02:40.030> very<00:02:40.060> pale<00:02:40.450> silver<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> deep<00:02:41.860> deep

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
very very pale silver to a deep deep

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.160 
very very pale silver to a deep deep
gold<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.390> things<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.660> affect<00:02:44.020> those

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
gold and the things that affect those

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.420 
gold and the things that affect those
colors<00:02:44.530> are<00:02:44.710> things<00:02:44.860> like<00:02:44.980> whether<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.340> been

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
colors are things like whether it's been

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.890 
colors are things like whether it's been
aged<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.700> oak<00:02:45.880> whether<00:02:46.390> it's<00:02:46.540> got<00:02:46.630> lots<00:02:46.750> of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
aged in oak whether it's got lots of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.870 
aged in oak whether it's got lots of
sugar<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.380> or<00:02:48.070> they<00:02:48.190> came<00:02:48.370> from<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.580> country

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
sugar in it or they came from a country

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.280 
sugar in it or they came from a country
like<00:02:48.970> Australia<00:02:49.480> where<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.630> grapes<00:02:49.870> are<00:02:50.050> very

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
like Australia where the grapes are very

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.660 
like Australia where the grapes are very
very<00:02:50.470> ripe<00:02:50.710> so<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.070> more<00:02:51.220> color<00:02:51.460> in<00:02:51.520> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
very ripe so you get more color in the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.720 
very ripe so you get more color in the
glass<00:02:54.510> nice<00:02:55.510> smell<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.130> before<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.370> smell<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
glass nice smell it before you smell it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.890 
glass nice smell it before you smell it
you<00:02:57.850> want<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.060> go<00:02:58.120> too<00:02:58.210> good<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.420> swirl<00:02:58.690> like

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
you want to go too good to swirl like

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.290 
you want to go too good to swirl like
this<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.380> it's<00:02:59.500> not<00:02:59.650> just<00:02:59.860> showing<00:03:00.580> off<00:03:00.670> it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
this and it's not just showing off it

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.790 
this and it's not just showing off it
actually<00:03:01.420> releases<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.990> lot<00:03:02.020> more<00:03:02.290> aroma<00:03:02.560> out

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
actually releases a lot more aroma out

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.260 
actually releases a lot more aroma out
of<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.920> glass<00:03:03.100> maybe<00:03:03.430> two<00:03:03.610> or<00:03:03.640> three<00:03:03.730> times<00:03:04.060> as

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
of the glass maybe two or three times as

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.540 
of the glass maybe two or three times as
much<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.130> put<00:03:06.280> your<00:03:06.400> nose<00:03:06.520> in<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:09.430> what

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
wine in Britain now and the reason why

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.280 
wine in Britain now and the reason why
it<00:04:26.010> works<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.550> because<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.360> quite<00:04:27.660> tall<00:04:27.990> and

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
it works is because it's quite tall and

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.230 
it works is because it's quite tall and
it<00:04:28.949> doesn't<00:04:29.340> allow<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.820> get<00:04:29.970> your<00:04:30.090> nose
