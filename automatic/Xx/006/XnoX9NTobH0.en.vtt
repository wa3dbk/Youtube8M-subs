00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
with these and beta it was absolutely

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.740 
with these and beta it was absolutely
insane<00:01:03.720> or<00:01:04.720> nice<00:01:04.960> shooting<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.549> yes<00:01:07.299> so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
insane or nice shooting and but yes so

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.569 
insane or nice shooting and but yes so
they've<00:01:08.590> dropped<00:01:08.770> them<00:01:08.979> down<00:01:09.130> i<00:01:09.159> think<00:01:09.490> by

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
they've dropped them down i think by

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.749 
they've dropped them down i think by
about<00:01:09.729> fifty<00:01:10.119> percent<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:12.100> they<00:01:12.249> have

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
about fifty percent think they have

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.300 
about fifty percent think they have
increased<00:01:13.389> the<00:01:13.539> range<00:01:13.749> in<00:01:14.109> my<00:01:14.289> opinion<00:01:14.619> but

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
increased the range in my opinion but

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.889 
increased the range in my opinion but
have<00:01:15.609> dropped<00:01:15.880> down<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.270> power<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.719> them

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
have dropped down the power of them

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.580 
have dropped down the power of them
slightly<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:17.649> i<00:01:18.639> find<00:01:19.179> that<00:01:19.420> you're<00:01:20.139> looking
