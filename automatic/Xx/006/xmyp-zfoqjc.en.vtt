whatever<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.370> use<00:02:42.459> grasp<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.000> dead

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
whatever I just use grasp of the dead

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.720 
whatever I just use grasp of the dead
because<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> we<00:02:44.100> clear<00:02:45.100> out<00:02:45.250> some<00:02:45.459> jars

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
because it's a a we clear out some jars

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.600 
because it's a a we clear out some jars
faster<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.720> use<00:02:46.870> firebomb<00:02:47.500> roomed<00:02:48.459> with

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
faster and I use firebomb roomed with

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.820 
faster and I use firebomb roomed with
flash<00:02:48.970> fire<00:02:49.239> because<00:02:50.019> instead<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.500> exploding

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
flash fire because instead of exploding

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.479 
flash fire because instead of exploding
a<00:02:51.220> skull<00:02:51.670> bounces<00:02:52.150> between<00:02:52.300> multiple<00:02:52.870> targets

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
a skull bounces between multiple targets

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.870 
a skull bounces between multiple targets
okay<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.680> yeah<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.830> idea<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.430> give<00:02:57.670> what

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
okay so yeah the idea is to give what

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.800 
okay so yeah the idea is to give what
your<00:02:58.030> goal<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.660> here<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:58.870> go<00:02:59.790> 908<00:03:00.790> okay<00:03:01.360> 909

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
your goal so here we go 908 okay 909

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.540 
your goal so here we go 908 okay 909
let's<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.260> call<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.440> 909<00:03:03.040> thousand<00:03:03.459> gold

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
let's just call it 909 thousand gold

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:18.870 
let's just call it 909 thousand gold
right<00:03:03.790> now<00:03:03.910> okay<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:04.690> 441<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:06.160> here<00:03:06.340> we<00:03:06.400> go

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
so i got 9 20 so that means i made

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.940 
so i got 9 20 so that means i made
eleven<00:04:40.639> thousand<00:04:41.090> gold<00:04:41.620> eleven<00:04:42.620> thousand

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
eleven thousand gold eleven thousand

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.159 
eleven thousand gold eleven thousand
gold<00:04:43.070> in<00:04:43.430> one<00:04:43.760> minute<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.180> little<00:04:44.930> bit<00:04:45.050> more

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
gold in one minute a little bit more

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.950 
gold in one minute a little bit more
than<00:04:45.229> i<00:04:45.350> made<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.620> huh<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:46.630> don't<00:04:47.630> do<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:47.750> one

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
than i made it huh so don't do it one

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.200 
than i made it huh so don't do it one
more<00:04:47.990> time<00:04:48.110> just<00:04:48.320> uh<00:04:48.830> yeah<00:04:49.639> there<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:49.880> go<00:04:49.940> like

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
more time just uh yeah there you go like

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.670 
more time just uh yeah there you go like
just<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.570> little<00:04:50.780> a<00:04:50.810> little<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.380> little<00:04:51.470> more

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
just a little a little a little more

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.320 
just a little a little a little more
than<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.830> minute<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.280> can<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:53.030> can<00:04:53.150> do<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
than a minute so you can you can do the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.680 
than a minute so you can you can do the
math<00:04:53.450> here<00:04:53.660> let's<00:04:54.380> just<00:04:54.500> round<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.280> down<00:04:55.690> or

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
math here let's just round it down or

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.820 
math here let's just round it down or
less<00:04:56.870> just<00:04:56.900> right<00:04:57.110> let's<00:04:57.260> keep<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.470> at<00:04:57.560> eleven

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
less just right let's keep it at eleven

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.050 
less just right let's keep it at eleven
thousand<00:04:58.039> eleven<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.460> actually<00:04:58.729> pretty<00:04:58.880> low

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
thousand eleven is actually pretty low

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.270 
thousand eleven is actually pretty low
but<00:04:59.810> let's<00:05:00.050> just<00:05:00.110> say<00:05:00.260> eleven<00:05:00.740> thousand<00:05:01.130> gold

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
but let's just say eleven thousand gold

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.710 
but let's just say eleven thousand gold
at<00:05:02.240> every<00:05:02.870> two<00:05:03.080> minutes<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:05.120> 10<00:05:05.449> minutes

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
at every two minutes so in 10 minutes

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.760 
at every two minutes so in 10 minutes
that's<00:05:06.139> what<00:05:06.340> 55<00:05:07.340> k<00:05:08.289> so<00:05:11.169> 60<00:05:12.169> minutes<00:05:12.500> how<00:05:12.620> much

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
that's what 55 k so 60 minutes how much

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.060 
that's what 55 k so 60 minutes how much
is<00:05:12.919> that<00:05:12.950> what<00:05:13.880> is<00:05:13.970> that<00:05:14.169> 330<00:05:15.169> something<00:05:15.950> like

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
is that what is that 330 something like

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.070 
is that what is that 330 something like
that<00:05:16.600> so

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
that so

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.089 
that so
easily<00:05:18.919> see<00:05:19.129> how<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.370> can<00:05:19.520> be<00:05:19.819> making<00:05:21.099> upwards

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
easily see how I can be making upwards

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.179 
easily see how I can be making upwards
of<00:05:22.580> 350<00:05:23.210> thousand<00:05:23.840> with<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.169> with<00:05:25.039> this

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
of 350 thousand with the with this

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:29.080 
of 350 thousand with the with this

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
technique in an hour so 350,000 gold in

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.429 
technique in an hour so 350,000 gold in
an<00:05:29.180> hour<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.479> if<00:05:29.569> you<00:05:29.689> can<00:05:29.810> find<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:30.080> better<00:05:30.229> way
