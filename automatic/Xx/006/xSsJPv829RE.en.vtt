00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
the difference on this video I'm sure

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.170 
the difference on this video I'm sure
but<00:02:24.270> there<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> difference<00:02:25.959> on<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:28.060> it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
but there is a difference on what it

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180 
but there is a difference on what it
does<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.170> I'm<00:02:29.290> gonna<00:02:29.440> go<00:02:29.650> back<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.040> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
does is and I'm gonna go back to the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.300 
does is and I'm gonna go back to the
forced<00:02:30.489> HD<00:02:30.940> right<00:02:31.150> now<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.680> squeeze<00:02:33.040> both

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
forced HD right now so squeeze both

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.270 
forced HD right now so squeeze both
trigger<00:02:33.700> pull<00:02:34.570> them<00:02:34.720> down<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.200> press<00:02:36.130> this

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
trigger pull them down and press this

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.759 
trigger pull them down and press this
both<00:02:36.519> keys<00:02:36.930> both<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.170> control<00:02:38.560> pad<00:02:38.739> buttons

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
both keys both the control pad buttons

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.870 
both keys both the control pad buttons
so<00:02:41.769> now<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.100> back<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.310> force<00:02:42.670> high

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
so now it's back to force high

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.060 
so now it's back to force high
definition<00:02:43.269> now<00:02:44.200> even<00:02:44.530> if<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.709> turn<00:02:44.890> your

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
definition now even if you turn your

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.580 
definition now even if you turn your
console<00:02:45.549> walking<00:02:46.000> if<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.209> unplug<00:02:46.510> it

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
console walking if you unplug it

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.620 
console walking if you unplug it
it<00:02:47.890> saves<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.519> setting<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.360> it's<00:02:49.510> gonna

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
it saves this setting so it's gonna

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.840 
it saves this setting so it's gonna
remain<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.380> setting<00:02:50.799> so<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.459> think<00:02:51.549> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
remain in this setting so I think the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.340 
remain in this setting so I think the
only<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> reset<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.049> do<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
only way to reset it is to do that

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.090 
only way to reset it is to do that
