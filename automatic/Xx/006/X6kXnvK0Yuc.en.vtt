00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.129
 is that it is a very heterogeneous market 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.030
 a very heterogeneous quality then 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:13.610
 there are certainly institutions and there are 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.309
 institutions to graduates of very good 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.850
 universities of very good institutes 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.580
 which of course have a profitability 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.550
 very high is that it is worth the effort 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.900
 financially that their families do for 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.239
 have that is that cardboard that is worth 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.050
 both in the market but rigged with 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.539
 that there are unfortunately not many 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.999
 Higher education entities 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.120
 institutes and universities that play a 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:46.060
 little with this dream the dream of being 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.970
 professional 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.190
 and then young people and little families 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.930
 informed 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.260
 they satisfy that dream with apparently 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.370
 little investment or investment that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.200
 it is within your reach no pensions as of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.910
 200 soles per month 300 soles per month 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.250
 how good it looks like good business to 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.370
 to be able to achieve a university degree 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.740
 technical title unfortunately pass 35 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.300
 years of that investment is very burdensome 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.850
 in relative terms for those families 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.229
 and the reward in the labor market is not 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.479
 it happens and there is very low return almost null 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.240
 in many cases for young people who are going to 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.020
 institutes to very low universities 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.119
 prestige of very low equipment 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.700
 No connection with the sector 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.070
 productive and what needs 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.780
 it's called because the university is kind 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.750
 garage they call it no subsidiaries type garage 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.180
 that remain on the second floor of chifas not 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.240
 of restaurants 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.850
 who play with this illusion of 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.810
 many young people we have calculated that the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.760
 Professional underemployment is 35% or one 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 of every three professionals 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.649
 university students do not end up working 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.369
 and an occupation for which it was not 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.060
 necessary 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.590
 have invested 16 years of his life to 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.690
 get a professional title 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.019
 university in a wait since 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.330
 then with this greater demand for 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.569
 professionals that the new 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.390
 technologies and economic growth 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.290
 general was absorbing that super 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.120
 professional employment but 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.239
 surprisingly that was not 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.019
 happening and we think it's because the 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.170
 quality offer of relevance of 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.290
 higher education has not been growing 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.299
 at the pace that companies demanded that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.530
 it would be a bit the overview of what 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.700
 what do we believe 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.790
 is happening with education 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.459
 superior in recent years then the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 idea would be that this cinema would assume a 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.940
 role we see is not true of umbrella for 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.770
 that all this 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.890
 and pull forward and there are two legs of this 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.040
 effort on the one hand the issue of achieving 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.750
 that accreditation has credibility 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.350
 prestige and therefore have the badge 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.470
 of not being accredited by the cinema does 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.780
 have value to society that are already 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.910
 young families have not 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.300
 certain guarantee that if there is a 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.380
 institution accredited by the cinema makes 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.870
 backed by the good world bank 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.520
 that's fine then I do not have to 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.210
 worry so much about a power of the 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.830
 scam that would be a system value 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.650
 secondly make a whole system 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.190
 of labor information that helps these 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.810
 young people to make better decisions not 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.990
 how much they earn, not what they have 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.200
 studied 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.110
 abc technical university professions 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.160
 what they have studied in to that kind of 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.520
 institutions 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.600
 we are not in a system then 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.560
 planning 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.810
 state to the Soviet 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.600
 where are we going to go to this we close it to 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.940
 this the idea is that with these systems 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.250
 of accreditation and information not the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.680
 market work better a certain 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.020
 then what they do not have chapitas 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.000
 that reveal a very low employability 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.130
 good the idea is that consumers 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.860
 better informed 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.860
 now they are not going to consume that product
