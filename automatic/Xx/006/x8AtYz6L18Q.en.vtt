amps 15 amps so that's 45 minutes that

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.160 
amps 15 amps so that's 45 minutes that
little<00:03:12.040> compressor<00:03:12.340> maybe<00:03:12.610> draws<00:03:12.909> maybe<00:03:13.599> 10

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
little compressor maybe draws maybe 10

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.860 
little compressor maybe draws maybe 10
amps<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.819> you're<00:03:15.819> looking<00:03:16.120> at<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.390> know<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.690> lot

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.030 
amps so you're looking at you know a lot
of<00:03:16.900> amperage<00:03:17.290> they're<00:03:17.530> going<00:03:17.769> through<00:03:17.920> this

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
of amperage they're going through this

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.979 
of amperage they're going through this
is<00:03:18.160> how<00:03:18.190> many<00:03:18.400> hours<00:03:18.430> 15<00:03:19.420> 15<00:03:19.750> 15<00:03:19.870> times<00:03:24.989> you
