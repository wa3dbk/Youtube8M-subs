both for yourself and for your horses
now<00:00:42.670> since<00:00:43.030> mosquitoes<00:00:43.510> are<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.720> problem

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
now since mosquitoes are the problem

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.360 
now since mosquitoes are the problem
what<00:00:44.140> we<00:00:44.230> want<00:00:44.410> to<00:00:44.530> do<00:00:44.650> is<00:00:44.769> decrease<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.250> risk

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
what we want to do is decrease the risk

of getting bitten by mosquitoes and
there<00:00:47.410> are<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.500> couple<00:00:47.590> ways<00:00:47.860> they<00:00:48.070> can<00:00:48.129> do<00:00:48.280> that

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
there are a couple ways they can do that

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.610 
there are a couple ways they can do that
one<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.540> trying<00:00:49.900> to<00:00:50.050> get<00:00:50.170> rid<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.379> mosquitoes

the fewer mosquitoes around the less
risk<00:00:53.110> is<00:00:53.260> going<00:00:53.470> to<00:00:53.559> be<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:54.580> other<00:00:54.699> approach

avoid<00:03:47.340> those<00:03:47.579> areas<00:03:48.060> or<00:03:48.420> try<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.630> cut<00:03:48.900> grass

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
avoid those areas or try to cut grass

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.020 
avoid those areas or try to cut grass
cut<00:03:49.470> vegetation<00:03:49.980> back<00:03:50.160> from<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> edges<00:03:50.880> of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
cut vegetation back from the edges of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.849 
cut vegetation back from the edges of
ponds<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.750> mosquito<00:03:52.140> breeding<00:03:52.290> grounds

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
ponds and the mosquito breeding grounds

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.680

as<00:03:52.980> well<00:03:53.549> as<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.790> see<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.060> pond<00:03:54.359> here

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
as well as you see this pond here

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.880 
as well as you see this pond here
there's<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> large<00:03:55.140> amount<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.470> standing<00:03:55.859> water

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
there's a large amount of standing water

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.530 
there's a large amount of standing water
that's<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.489> perfect<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:57.090> mosquito

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
that's just perfect for mosquito

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.500 
that's just perfect for mosquito
breeding<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.140> things<00:03:59.040> like<00:03:59.190> aerating<00:03:59.880> ponds

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
breeding and things like aerating ponds

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.660

or<00:04:00.780> increasing<00:04:01.200> water<00:04:01.380> movement<00:04:01.769> can<00:04:02.400> make<00:04:02.549> it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
or increasing water movement can make it

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.250 
or increasing water movement can make it
less<00:04:02.850> likely<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.299> mosquito<00:04:03.750> larvae<00:04:04.109> are

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
less likely that mosquito larvae are

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.890 
less likely that mosquito larvae are
going<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.500> be<00:04:04.590> able<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.799> successfully<00:04:05.040> grow

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
going to be able to successfully grow

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.970 
going to be able to successfully grow
now<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.230> even<00:04:07.560> with<00:04:07.709> all<00:04:07.859> the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
now we know that even with all the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.199 
now we know that even with all the
measures<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.310> take<00:04:08.519> we're<00:04:08.730> not<00:04:08.850> going<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.120> get

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
measures we take we're not going to get

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.030 
measures we take we're not going to get
rid<00:04:09.329> of<00:04:09.359> all<00:04:09.540> mosquitoes<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.620> something<00:04:10.920> else

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
rid of all mosquitoes so something else

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.559 
rid of all mosquitoes so something else
we<00:04:11.160> want<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.579> is<00:04:11.700> decrease<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.209> chance<00:04:12.450> of

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
we want to do is decrease the chance of

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.240 
we want to do is decrease the chance of
getting<00:04:13.049> bitten<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.560> there<00:04:14.010> are<00:04:14.069> few<00:04:14.220> things

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
getting bitten and there are few things

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.099

that<00:04:14.519> we<00:04:14.579> can<00:04:14.730> do<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.940> achieve<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.480> one<00:04:15.930> is

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
that we can do to achieve that one is

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.479 
that we can do to achieve that one is
avoiding<00:04:16.440> high-risk<00:04:16.799> times<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.310> day
