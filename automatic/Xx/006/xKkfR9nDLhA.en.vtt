00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
casting technique which is very

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.429 
casting technique which is very
important<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.320> presenting<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> fly<00:00:18.439> so

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
important for presenting the fly so

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.689 
important for presenting the fly so
first<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> show<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> how

back<00:01:43.940> timing<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.750> very<00:01:45.170> crucial<00:01:45.530> in

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
back timing is very crucial in
