okay this one's about an overview of a

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.700 
okay this one's about an overview of a
pulse<00:00:10.760> 21<00:00:11.980> Lennox<00:00:12.980> furnace

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.440 

okay<00:00:17.710> first<00:00:18.040> thing<00:00:18.220> I<00:00:18.310> wanted<00:00:18.610> to<00:00:18.670> point<00:00:19.210> out

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
okay first thing I wanted to point out

okay first thing I wanted to point out
some<00:00:19.840> of<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:19.960> parts<00:00:20.350> on<00:00:20.530> this<00:00:20.680> thing<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:22.750> you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
some of the parts on this thing if you

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.670 
some of the parts on this thing if you
look<00:00:23.320> in<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.460> very<00:00:24.700> center<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:26.230> is<00:00:26.470> the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
look in the very center that is the

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.280 
look in the very center that is the
inducer<00:00:27.270> it's<00:00:28.270> not<00:00:28.420> an<00:00:28.540> inducer<00:00:28.960> it's<00:00:29.050> force

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
inducer it's not an inducer it's force

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.850 
inducer it's not an inducer it's force

the<00:00:33.250> combustion<00:00:33.640> chamber<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:35.410> does<00:00:35.710> not<00:00:35.890> run

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
the combustion chamber it does not run

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.170 
the combustion chamber it does not run
all<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.460> time<00:00:40.200> over<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.380> the<00:00:41.530> right<00:00:42.180> that's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
all the time over to the right that's

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:53.939 
all the time over to the right that's
the<00:00:43.450> gas<00:00:43.660> valve<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.300> what<00:00:52.539> I've<00:00:52.660> been<00:00:52.870> told<00:00:53.710> is

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
the gas valve and what I've been told is

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.099 
the gas valve and what I've been told is
the<00:00:53.980> expansion<00:00:54.579> chamber<00:00:55.710> down<00:00:56.710> below<00:00:57.219> there

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the expansion chamber down below there

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.669 
the expansion chamber down below there
you'll<00:00:59.109> see<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.710> those<00:01:00.250> fittings<00:01:01.679> that's

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
you'll see the those fittings that's

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.700 
you'll see the those fittings that's
going<00:01:03.010> into<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.730> gas<00:01:04.210> flapper<00:01:04.870> and<00:01:04.900> orifice

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.390 

in<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.860> center<00:01:09.250> here

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.110 

that's<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.550> air<00:01:15.700> flapper<00:01:16.030> valve<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:18.120> probably

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
that's the air flapper valve I probably

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.630 
that's the air flapper valve I probably
should<00:01:19.360> have<00:01:19.450> done<00:01:19.600> this<00:01:19.750> earlier<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.640> started

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
should have done this earlier I started

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.010 
should have done this earlier I started
showing<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:21.970> different<00:01:22.090> parts<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.750> but<00:01:22.990> I

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
showing you different parts to it but I

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.120 
showing you different parts to it but I
don't<00:01:23.110> think<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.380> ever<00:01:23.440> really<00:01:23.770> showed<00:01:24.010> you

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
don't think I ever really showed you

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.100 
don't think I ever really showed you
where<00:01:24.310> everything<00:01:24.610> was<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.180> I'm<00:01:25.660> finally

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
where everything was so I'm finally

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.940 
where everything was so I'm finally
getting<00:01:26.320> around<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.650> it<00:01:28.650> there's<00:01:29.650> your

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
getting around to it there's your

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.140 
getting around to it there's your
ignition<00:01:30.220> control<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:32.650> units<00:01:33.160> did<00:01:33.340> not<00:01:33.610> use

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
ignition control these units did not use

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.680 
ignition control these units did not use
and<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:34.930> see<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:36.610> had<00:01:36.730> a<00:01:36.760> spark<00:01:37.270> igniter

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
and I have see they had a spark igniter

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.830 
and I have see they had a spark igniter
that's<00:01:38.050> this<00:01:38.890> line<00:01:39.760> right<00:01:40.030> down<00:01:40.270> here<00:01:40.600> and

here is the flame sense probe Bob again

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.430 
here is the flame sense probe Bob again
we've<00:01:47.710> got<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.300> Honeywell<00:01:49.840> fan<00:01:50.200> and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
we've got this is a Honeywell fan and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.320 
we've got this is a Honeywell fan and
limit<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:53.280> there's<00:01:54.280> only<00:01:54.400> two<00:01:54.670> wires<00:01:54.910> going

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
limit but there's only two wires going

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.820 
limit but there's only two wires going
to<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.810> they're<00:01:55.900> going<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.350> rights<00:01:56.620> there

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
to it and they're going to rights there

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.380 
to it and they're going to rights there
to<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.070> limit<00:01:57.400> so<00:01:57.550> it's<00:01:57.670> only<00:01:57.880> used<00:01:58.150> as<00:01:58.360> a

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
here will sense that let's take a look

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.970 
here will sense that let's take a look
at<00:03:01.070> how<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.220> fan<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.850> controlled

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
at how the fan is controlled

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.130 
at how the fan is controlled
okay<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.130> fan<00:03:04.370> controls<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:05.120> here<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.930> is

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
okay the fan controls in here this is

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
okay the fan controls in here this is
one<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.590> kind<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.490> morpha<00:03:13.940> date<00:03:15.160> fan

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
one of the kind of morpha date fan

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.400 
one of the kind of morpha date fan
controls<00:03:16.730> they<00:03:17.030> have<00:03:17.210> gotten<00:03:17.840> away<00:03:17.960> from

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
controls they have gotten away from

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.550 
controls they have gotten away from
using<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.220> heat<00:03:20.150> operated<00:03:20.690> fan<00:03:20.930> switch<00:03:21.260> such

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
using the heat operated fan switch such

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.870 
using the heat operated fan switch such
as<00:03:21.710> a<00:03:21.770> Honeywell<00:03:22.130> showed<00:03:22.490> you<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.670> little

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
as a Honeywell showed you a little

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.320 
as a Honeywell showed you a little
earlier<00:03:23.210> and<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:24.380> they<00:03:24.530> started<00:03:24.980> using

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
earlier and then they started using

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.670 
earlier and then they started using
timers<00:03:29.170> okay<00:03:30.170> that's<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.680> part<00:03:30.950> right<00:03:31.070> here

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
timers okay that's this part right here

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.860 
timers okay that's this part right here
when<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.400> valve<00:03:34.640> receives<00:03:35.180> power<00:03:35.480> through

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
when the valve receives power through

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.070 
when the valve receives power through
this<00:03:36.020> yellow<00:03:36.320> right<00:03:36.620> here<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:38.180> tells<00:03:38.660> this

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
this yellow right here that tells this

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.800 
this yellow right here that tells this
thing<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.620> start<00:03:40.040> timeing<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:41.680> then<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
thing to start timeing and then the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.910 
thing to start timeing and then the
blowers<00:03:45.230> hooked<00:03:45.470> up<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:50.770> if<00:03:51.770> you

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
blowers hooked up to it and if you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.640 
blowers hooked up to it and if you
notice<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.580> says<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.270> delay<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.530> it's

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
notice this says on delay and it's

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.680 
notice this says on delay and it's
adjustable<00:03:55.190> from<00:03:55.700> looks<00:03:55.940> like<00:03:56.120> thirty<00:03:56.510> to

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
adjustable from looks like thirty to

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.190 
adjustable from looks like thirty to
sixty<00:03:56.930> seconds<00:03:57.800> so<00:03:58.670> you<00:03:58.790> can<00:03:59.090> delay<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.870> fan

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
sixty seconds so you can delay the fan

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.850 
sixty seconds so you can delay the fan
on<00:04:00.910> by<00:04:01.910> adjusting<00:04:02.570> that<00:04:02.720> between<00:04:03.080> 30<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.590> 60

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
on by adjusting that between 30 and 60

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.520 
on by adjusting that between 30 and 60
seconds<00:04:06.459> now<00:04:07.459> here<00:04:08.150> you'll<00:04:08.930> see<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.350> off

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
seconds now here you'll see the off

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.760 
seconds now here you'll see the off
delay<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:10.370> here<00:04:10.580> again<00:04:10.910> we've<00:04:11.330> got<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.770> timing

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
delay and here again we've got a timing

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.930 
delay and here again we've got a timing
set<00:04:13.070> from<00:04:13.340> 120<00:04:14.150> seconds<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.840> 240<00:04:15.830> seconds<00:04:16.310> so

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
set from 120 seconds to 240 seconds so

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.580 
set from 120 seconds to 240 seconds so
this<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.480> timer<00:04:17.840> this<00:04:18.140> is<00:04:18.290> one<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.500> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
this is just a timer this is one of the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.960 
this is just a timer this is one of the
things<00:04:18.739> he<00:04:18.859> used<00:04:19.100> for<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.340> little<00:04:19.520> while<00:04:19.730> in

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
things he used for a little while in

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.390 
things he used for a little while in
there<00:04:20.150> until<00:04:20.510> they<00:04:20.630> decided<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.200> put<00:04:21.500> IFC's

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
there until they decided to put IFC's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.190 
there until they decided to put IFC's
and<00:04:22.610> everything<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.180> incorporate<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
and everything and incorporate the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.600 
and everything and incorporate the
timers<00:04:24.590> in<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.770> IFC<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:28.040> essentially<00:04:28.580> a

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
timers in the IFC so it's essentially a

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.020 
timers in the IFC so it's essentially a
time<00:04:28.940> delay<00:04:29.300> relay<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:31.070> has<00:04:31.280> an<00:04:31.580> adjustable

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
time delay relay it has an adjustable

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.560 
time delay relay it has an adjustable
delay<00:04:32.450> on<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.169> an<00:04:33.320> adjustable<00:04:33.770> delay<00:04:34.190> off

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.320 

okay<00:04:39.570> here<00:04:39.810> we're<00:04:39.990> looking<00:04:40.170> at<00:04:41.180> where<00:04:42.180> I've

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
okay here we're looking at where I've

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.440 
okay here we're looking at where I've
taken<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.780> cover<00:04:43.020> off<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.910> can<00:04:44.910> see<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.330> the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
taken the cover off you can see on the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.830 
taken the cover off you can see on the
right<00:04:46.430> where<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.580> air<00:04:47.700> flapper<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.750> can

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
right where the air flapper is you can

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.220 
right where the air flapper is you can
see<00:04:48.990> where<00:04:49.140> this<00:04:49.290> thing<00:04:49.350> is<00:04:50.840> right<00:04:51.840> in<00:04:51.990> there

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
see where this thing is right in there

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.170 
see where this thing is right in there
that's<00:04:52.470> access<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:54.140> flame<00:04:55.140> sensor<00:04:55.470> and

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
that's access to the flame sensor and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.060 
that's access to the flame sensor and
the<00:04:57.180> spark<00:04:57.510> plug<00:04:57.780> I'm<00:04:58.560> going<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.830> show<00:04:59.010> you

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
the spark plug I'm going to show you

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.820 
the spark plug I'm going to show you
those<00:04:59.340> things<00:04:59.700> in<00:04:59.850> a<00:04:59.940> second<00:05:00.420> here<00:05:00.660> but<00:05:01.650> that's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
those things in a second here but that's

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.670 
those things in a second here but that's
how<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.100> generally<00:05:02.670> can<00:05:02.850> access<00:05:03.450> them<00:05:06.680> okay

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
how you generally can access them okay

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.940 
how you generally can access them okay
here<00:05:07.950> we<00:05:08.070> have<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.310> look<00:05:08.610> from<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.910> overhead<00:05:09.950> or

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
here we have a look from the overhead or

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.300 
here we have a look from the overhead or
the<00:05:11.160> ductwork<00:05:11.730> where<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.210> plenum<00:05:12.540> would<00:05:12.660> be

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
the ductwork where the plenum would be

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.430 
the ductwork where the plenum would be
and<00:05:14.310> right<00:05:14.910> there<00:05:15.120> in<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.270> center<00:05:15.570> that<00:05:16.380> is

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
and right there in the center that is

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.290 
and right there in the center that is
the<00:05:16.920> combustion<00:05:17.310> chamber<00:05:17.820> it's<00:05:17.910> made<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.210> the

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
the combustion chamber it's made of the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
the combustion chamber it's made of the
cast<00:05:18.570> iron<00:05:20.450> one<00:05:21.450> thing<00:05:21.630> about<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:21.990> whole

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
cast iron one thing about this whole

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.220 
cast iron one thing about this whole
first<00:05:22.590> everything<00:05:23.190> is<00:05:23.430> heavy<00:05:23.960> this<00:05:24.960> thing<00:05:25.020> is

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
first everything is heavy this thing is

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.200 
first everything is heavy this thing is
a<00:05:25.320> heaviest<00:05:25.710> dang<00:05:26.190> thing<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.670> ever<00:05:26.850> had<00:05:27.060> to

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
a heaviest dang thing you ever had to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.140 
a heaviest dang thing you ever had to
move<00:05:28.310> except<00:05:29.310> for<00:05:29.460> maybe<00:05:29.610> some<00:05:29.880> of<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.030> old

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
move except for maybe some of the old

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.790 
move except for maybe some of the old
oil<00:05:32.900> right<00:05:33.900> down<00:05:34.860> there

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
oil right down there

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.090 
oil right down there
you<00:05:37.800> can<00:05:38.040> see<00:05:39.260> those<00:05:40.260> two<00:05:40.620> spark<00:05:41.010> plugs

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
you can see those two spark plugs

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:51.350 
you can see those two spark plugs
looking<00:05:41.790> things<00:05:46.100> right<00:05:49.370> okay<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.850> one<00:05:51.060> on<00:05:51.210> the

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
looking things right okay the one on the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.030 
looking things right okay the one on the
top<00:05:51.600> is<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:51.870> flame<00:05:52.170> set<00:05:52.500> through<00:05:52.740> one<00:05:52.920> the

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
top is a flame set through one the

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.790 
top is a flame set through one the
bottom<00:05:53.400> is<00:05:53.490> actually<00:05:53.640> just<00:05:53.970> a<00:05:54.120> spark<00:05:54.240> plug

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
bottom is actually just a spark plug

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
bottom is actually just a spark plug
very<00:05:55.800> similar<00:05:56.190> to<00:05:56.310> automotive<00:05:56.820> spark<00:05:57.090> plug

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.950 

now<00:06:02.820> how<00:06:03.030> this<00:06:03.240> thing<00:06:03.510> works<00:06:03.870> you<00:06:05.600> can't<00:06:06.600> see

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
now how this thing works you can't see

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.340 
now how this thing works you can't see
it<00:06:07.080> very<00:06:07.110> well<00:06:09.020> try<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.080> get<00:06:10.260> in<00:06:10.410> there<00:06:12.350> Seattle

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
it very well try to get in there Seattle

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.260 
it very well try to get in there Seattle
Pike<00:06:13.710> there<00:06:14.070> it's<00:06:14.280> kind<00:06:14.520> of<00:06:14.580> blurred<00:06:14.910> there<00:06:15.150> it

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
Pike there it's kind of blurred there it

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.480 
Pike there it's kind of blurred there it
is<00:06:15.390> that<00:06:16.170> little<00:06:16.320> pipe<00:06:16.590> there<00:06:16.860> that's<00:06:17.070> coming

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
is that little pipe there that's coming

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:26.180 
is that little pipe there that's coming
from<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:19.010> air<00:06:20.010> flapper<00:06:24.650> that<00:06:25.650> comes<00:06:25.920> from<00:06:26.100> the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
from the air flapper that comes from the

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.820 
from the air flapper that comes from the
air<00:06:26.370> flapper<00:06:26.760> goes<00:06:27.720> into<00:06:28.290> the<00:06:28.410> combustion

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
air flapper goes into the combustion

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.630 
air flapper goes into the combustion
chamber<00:06:30.770> right<00:06:31.770> there's<00:06:32.070> the<00:06:32.280> combustion

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
chamber right there's the combustion

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:40.300 
chamber right there's the combustion
chamber<00:06:34.220> looking<00:06:35.220> on<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.460> other<00:06:35.670> side

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.590 

okay<00:06:41.310> you<00:06:41.370> can<00:06:41.610> see<00:06:41.850> there<00:06:42.150> where<00:06:42.600> the<00:06:44.600> gas

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
okay you can see there where the gas

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.990 
okay you can see there where the gas
Inlet<00:06:46.080> tube<00:06:46.410> is<00:06:46.650> that's<00:06:47.460> from<00:06:47.730> the<00:06:47.820> gas

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
Inlet tube is that's from the gas

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.880 
Inlet tube is that's from the gas
flapper<00:06:48.660> and<00:06:49.550> it<00:06:50.550> comes<00:06:50.820> in<00:06:51.120> to<00:06:51.390> the<00:06:51.890> inlet

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
flapper and it comes in to the inlet

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:59.540 
flapper and it comes in to the inlet
portion<00:06:55.490> of<00:06:56.490> the<00:06:56.790> combustion<00:06:57.180> chamber<00:06:58.550> okay

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
portion of the combustion chamber okay

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.070 
portion of the combustion chamber okay
there's<00:06:59.790> the<00:06:59.970> exit<00:07:00.450> from<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.720> combustion

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
there's the exit from the combustion

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.730 
there's the exit from the combustion
chamber<00:07:02.240> it<00:07:03.240> makes<00:07:03.540> us<00:07:03.780> cutesleep<00:07:04.290> ooh<00:07:04.530> little

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
chamber it makes us cutesleep ooh little

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.450 
chamber it makes us cutesleep ooh little
loop<00:07:05.130> goes<00:07:05.820> down<00:07:07.010> under<00:07:08.240> comes<00:07:09.240> back<00:07:09.570> up<00:07:10.460> goes

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
loop goes down under comes back up goes

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.520 
loop goes down under comes back up goes
over<00:07:11.850> to<00:07:11.940> what<00:07:12.150> they<00:07:12.300> call<00:07:12.570> the<00:07:12.750> resonator<00:07:13.410> I

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
over to what they call the resonator I

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.410 
over to what they call the resonator I
suppose<00:07:14.370> that's<00:07:14.700> supposed<00:07:15.060> to<00:07:15.180> eliminate

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
suppose that's supposed to eliminate

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.830 
suppose that's supposed to eliminate
some<00:07:15.930> of<00:07:15.960> the<00:07:16.140> noise<00:07:16.800> for<00:07:17.130> this<00:07:17.310> thing<00:07:17.840> and

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
some of the noise for this thing and

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.260 
some of the noise for this thing and
then<00:07:18.960> it<00:07:19.110> comes<00:07:19.380> in<00:07:19.650> to<00:07:19.950> remember<00:07:20.670> what<00:07:20.880> this

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.270 
then it comes in to remember what this

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.870 
then it comes in to remember what this
thing<00:07:21.570> is<00:07:21.650> there's<00:07:22.650> a<00:07:22.740> name<00:07:22.950> for<00:07:22.980> it<00:07:23.400> it's<00:07:23.670> kind

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 
thing is there's a name for it it's kind

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.540 
thing is there's a name for it it's kind
of<00:07:23.940> an<00:07:24.030> expansion<00:07:24.450> sort<00:07:24.990> of<00:07:25.110> tank<00:07:25.920> on<00:07:26.160> there

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.330 

and<00:07:29.550> when<00:07:29.880> it<00:07:29.970> comes<00:07:30.180> on<00:07:30.360> the<00:07:30.480> bottom<00:07:30.930> event<00:07:31.350> it

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
and when it comes on the bottom event it

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.100 
and when it comes on the bottom event it
goes<00:07:32.670> into<00:07:33.030> the<00:07:33.270> secondary<00:07:33.750> heat<00:07:34.050> exchanger

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
goes into the secondary heat exchanger

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.080 
goes into the secondary heat exchanger
you<00:07:37.110> can<00:07:37.260> see<00:07:37.590> you<00:07:38.190> see<00:07:38.370> that<00:07:38.520> secondary<00:07:38.880> heat

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 
you can see you see that secondary heat

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.640 
you can see you see that secondary heat
exchanger<00:07:39.540> down<00:07:39.690> there<00:07:39.900> at<00:07:39.990> the<00:07:40.050> bottom<00:07:40.260> I

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.650 
exchanger down there at the bottom I

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.800 
exchanger down there at the bottom I
will<00:07:41.400> have<00:07:41.610> the<00:07:41.760> heat<00:07:41.880> exchanger<00:07:42.360> out<00:07:42.540> of<00:07:42.690> this

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:42.810 
will have the heat exchanger out of this

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.940 
will have the heat exchanger out of this
thing<00:07:43.020> and<00:07:43.050> we'll<00:07:43.290> give<00:07:43.440> it<00:07:43.470> a<00:07:43.590> little<00:07:43.620> closer

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:43.950 
thing and we'll give it a little closer

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.960 
thing and we'll give it a little closer
inspection<00:07:44.340> then<00:07:45.680> but<00:07:46.680> that's<00:07:47.520> pretty<00:07:47.850> much

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:47.970 
inspection then but that's pretty much

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.130 
inspection then but that's pretty much
the<00:07:48.270> way<00:07:48.390> it<00:07:48.420> looks<00:07:48.750> inside<00:07:49.230> there<00:07:49.910> and<00:07:51.140> that's

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:52.140 
the way it looks inside there and that's

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.860 
the way it looks inside there and that's
pretty<00:07:52.440> much<00:07:52.560> all<00:07:52.830> the<00:07:53.130> parts<00:07:55.010> that<00:07:56.750> that<00:07:57.750> are

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:57.870 
pretty much all the parts that that are

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.630 
pretty much all the parts that that are
in<00:07:57.990> this<00:07:58.170> thing<00:07:58.380> I<00:07:58.500> mean<00:07:58.650> there's<00:07:58.830> a<00:07:58.890> fan<00:07:59.100> and

00:07:59.630 --> 00:07:59.640 
in this thing I mean there's a fan and

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.490 
in this thing I mean there's a fan and
so<00:08:00.060> on<00:08:00.240> like<00:08:00.420> that<00:08:00.600> like<00:08:00.840> any<00:08:01.020> furnace<00:08:01.380> would

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 
so on like that like any furnace would

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:09.980 
so on like that like any furnace would
have<00:08:05.570> that's<00:08:06.570> kind<00:08:06.960> of<00:08:06.990> a<00:08:07.110> look<00:08:07.320> around<00:08:08.600> at<00:08:09.600> the

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:09.990 
have that's kind of a look around at the

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.940 
have that's kind of a look around at the
Lenox<00:08:10.440> pulse<00:08:10.940> 21
