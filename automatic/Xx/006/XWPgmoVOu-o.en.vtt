00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.210 

so<00:04:30.810> if<00:04:30.870> we<00:04:30.960> start<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.230> finish<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:31.710> came<00:04:32.070> out

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
so if we start to finish this came out

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.550 
so if we start to finish this came out
in<00:04:32.340> about<00:04:32.430> three<00:04:32.820> minutes<00:04:32.970> from<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.200> time<00:04:34.230> it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
in about three minutes from the time it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.830 
in about three minutes from the time it
took<00:04:34.710> us<00:04:34.860> initially<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:36.060> mix<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.390> batter<00:04:36.540> and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
took us initially to mix the batter and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.210 
took us initially to mix the batter and
get<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.170> other<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:37.770> this<00:04:37.920> is<00:04:37.980> something

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
get in the other so this is something

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.030 
get in the other so this is something
that<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.520> be<00:04:38.640> prepared<00:04:39.420> ahead<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.830> batter

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
that can be prepared ahead the batter

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.880 
that can be prepared ahead the batter
can<00:04:41.250> be<00:04:41.370> made<00:04:41.580> ahead<00:04:41.730> of<00:04:41.880> time<00:04:42.740> cherries<00:04:43.740> are

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
can be made ahead of time cherries are

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.580 
can be made ahead of time cherries are
all<00:04:43.980> ready<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:44.370> when<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> moment<00:04:45.390> comes
