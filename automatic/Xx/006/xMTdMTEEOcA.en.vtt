00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
how's it going strife here and today

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.220 
how's it going strife here and today
we're<00:00:02.220> doing<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.760> bomb<00:00:03.179> event<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.990> drug

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
we're doing the bomb event in the drug

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.470 
we're doing the bomb event in the drug
fractal<00:00:04.710> so<00:00:05.069> last<00:00:05.279> week<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.580> put<00:00:05.790> up<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.120> full

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
fractal so last week I put up a full

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.000 
fractal so last week I put up a full
walkthrough<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> dredge<00:00:07.379> fractal<00:00:07.830> with

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
walkthrough for the dredge fractal with

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.419 
walkthrough for the dredge fractal with
the<00:00:08.220> cannon<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.120> ice<00:00:09.690> elemental<00:00:10.019> event<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the cannon and ice elemental event and I

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.640 
the cannon and ice elemental event and I
did<00:00:11.610> mention<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:12.059> had<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> bomb<00:00:12.540> as<00:00:12.809> well<00:00:13.170> so

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
did mention I had the bomb as well so

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.770 
did mention I had the bomb as well so
that's<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.429> but<00:00:15.210> as<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.570> see

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that's what this is but as you can see

here when you first come into this room
there's<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.880> be<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.240> big<00:00:18.600> pack<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> dredge

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619

there's going to be a big pack of dredge
you<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.760> either<00:00:20.880> run<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.480> corner<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
you can either run to this corner to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
you can either run to this corner to
kind<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.439> ls<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.279> next<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.119> melee

kind of ls them all next to you to melee

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.980 
kind of ls them all next to you to melee
or<00:00:24.779> if<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.859> don't<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.460> much<00:00:26.849> dps<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.840> your

or if you don't have as much dps in your

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.500 
or if you don't have as much dps in your
group<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.769> pull<00:00:29.609> them<00:00:29.789> back<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
group you can pull them back into that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.150 
group you can pull them back into that
initial<00:00:30.990> hallway<00:00:31.320> where<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> started<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
initial hallway where I started this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.370 
initial hallway where I started this
video<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:33.719> back<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> start

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
video if you go back to the start

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.660 
video if you go back to the start
there's<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:34.920> corner<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> left

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
there's like a little corner on the left

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
there's like a little corner on the left
side<00:00:35.969> where<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.390> actually<00:00:36.540> LS<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> pull

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
side where you can actually LS and pull

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.020 
side where you can actually LS and pull
knobs<00:00:39.020> but<00:00:40.020> there<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:41.340> four<00:00:41.579> veterans

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
knobs but there are like four veterans

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
knobs but there are like four veterans
only<00:00:42.360> i<00:00:42.390> believe<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.500> assuming<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.100> group

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
only i believe so assuming your group

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
only i believe so assuming your group
does<00:00:44.460> kill<00:00:44.789> fast<00:00:45.090> enough<00:00:45.420> even<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.840> people<00:00:46.140> do

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
does kill fast enough even if people do

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
does kill fast enough even if people do
get<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.710> you'll<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.460> you'll<00:00:47.640> pretty

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
get down you'll see that you'll pretty

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
get down you'll see that you'll pretty
much<00:00:47.910> instantly<00:00:48.450> rally<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.309> clear

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
much instantly rally so you can clear

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.130 
much instantly rally so you can clear
that<00:00:50.760> group<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.360> fighting<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.050> at

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that group just by fighting them all at

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
that group just by fighting them all at
the<00:00:52.230> same<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> using<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> proper

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the same time and using the proper

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.330 
the same time and using the proper
skills<00:00:54.440> from<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.620> we're<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> come<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
skills from there we're going to come to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
skills from there we're going to come to
this<00:00:56.550> corner<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.480> again<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
this corner now and again it's like a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.869 
this corner now and again it's like a
lof<00:00:58.559> spot<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.190> pull<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> dredge

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
lof spot where you can pull the dredge

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.500 
lof spot where you can pull the dredge
to<00:01:00.210> melee<00:01:00.629> them<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.980> talking<00:01:02.760> about<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.239> bomb

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to melee them so talking about this bomb

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
to melee them so talking about this bomb
event<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.049> already<00:01:04.140> mentioned<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
event I already mentioned that the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.460 
event I already mentioned that the
cannon<00:01:05.369> events<00:01:05.670> much<00:01:05.850> easier<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
cannon events much easier because this

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.679 
cannon events much easier because this
initial<00:01:07.890> group<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.270> seven

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
initial group right here of like seven

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.920 
initial group right here of like seven
or<00:01:09.780> eight<00:01:09.960> dredge<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:11.280> keep<00:01:11.580> spawning<00:01:12.390> based

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
or eight dredge they keep spawning based

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
or eight dredge they keep spawning based
on<00:01:13.229> time<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> group<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
on time so if you are in a group that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.359 
on time so if you are in a group that
doesn't<00:01:15.390> kill<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> quickly<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
doesn't kill that quickly it can get a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.070 
doesn't kill that quickly it can get a
bit<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.909> difficult<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.840> can't

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
bit more difficult because you can't

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.320 
bit more difficult because you can't
keep<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.100> spawn<00:01:20.640> time<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.150> these

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
keep up with the spawn time of these

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.710 
keep up with the spawn time of these
dredge<00:01:22.640> assuming<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.939> kill<00:01:24.180> fast<00:01:24.450> enough

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
dredge assuming you can kill fast enough

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.179 
dredge assuming you can kill fast enough
though<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.080> bomb<00:01:25.229> events<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.740> too<00:01:25.979> bad

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
though the bomb events not too bad

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.819 
though the bomb events not too bad
overall<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:27.840> many<00:01:28.080> people<00:01:28.439> may<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.770> realize

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
overall what many people may not realize

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.660 
overall what many people may not realize
is<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.000> every<00:01:30.960> two<00:01:31.860> bombs<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
is that every two bombs that you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
is that every two bombs that you
detonate<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> door<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.530> backpack<00:01:35.220> in

this<00:01:35.610> room<00:01:36.110> responds<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> do

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
this room responds so what we can do

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.069 
this room responds so what we can do
here<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:38.880> run<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.840> kill

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
here is we can actually run up to kill

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.780 
here is we can actually run up to kill
the<00:01:40.200> second<00:01:40.530> pack<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.369> won't<00:01:41.490> pull

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the second pack because they won't pull

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
the second pack because they won't pull
all<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.119> way<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> bottom<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.799> once

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
all the way to the bottom and then once

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
all the way to the bottom and then once
you<00:01:44.159> clear<00:01:44.490> them<00:01:44.700> they're<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you clear them they're not going to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.910 
you clear them they're not going to
respond<00:01:46.170> until<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> detonate<00:01:47.009> two<00:01:47.640> bombs<00:01:48.920> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
respond until you detonate two bombs so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.020 
respond until you detonate two bombs so
that's<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> make<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.610> part<00:01:50.909> pretty

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that's going to make this part pretty

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.660 
that's going to make this part pretty
manageable<00:01:52.040> you're<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> finish

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
manageable you're just going to finish

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 
manageable you're just going to finish
off<00:01:53.970> clearing<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> last<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> dredge<00:01:55.560> up

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
off clearing the last of the dredge up

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.139 
off clearing the last of the dredge up
here<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.280> plant<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> first

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
here and then we can plant the first

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
here and then we can plant the first
three<00:02:00.840> bombs<00:02:01.079> since<00:02:01.920> you're<00:02:02.070> under<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> for

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
three bombs since you're under that for

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.249 
three bombs since you're under that for
bomb<00:02:02.820> threshold<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.600> plant<00:02:03.810> three<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
bomb threshold you can plant three and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.880 
bomb threshold you can plant three and
only<00:02:04.350> get<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.860> extra<00:02:05.159> group<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.149> respawn

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
only get one extra group to to respawn

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.430 
only get one extra group to to respawn
so<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.340> takes<00:02:08.550> seven<00:02:08.910> bombs<00:02:09.179> total<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.959> destroy

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so it takes seven bombs total to destroy

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.240 
so it takes seven bombs total to destroy
the<00:02:10.649> door<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.670> by<00:02:11.879> doing<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.569> three

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
the door so by doing it the three

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.650 
the door so by doing it the three
then<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.640> method<00:02:14.030> you're<00:02:14.180> only<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.600> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
then for method you're only going to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.630 
then for method you're only going to
have<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.930> fight<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:15.410> group<00:02:15.680> after<00:02:16.130> initially

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
have to fight one group after initially

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.160 
have to fight one group after initially
clearing<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.390> then<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.630> can<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:17.930> run

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
clearing it and then you can just run

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.710 
clearing it and then you can just run
through<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:19.310> di<00:02:19.730> grow<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> rest<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.540> ones

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
through to di grow the rest of the ones

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.250 
through to di grow the rest of the ones
that<00:02:20.840> spawn<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.360> right<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:23.570> we<00:02:23.780> finish

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
that spawn so right now we finish

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.990 
that spawn so right now we finish
clearing<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.710> backpack<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.730> have<00:02:25.850> some

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
clearing the backpack and we have some

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.170 
clearing the backpack and we have some
downtime<00:02:26.270> before<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.080> front<00:02:27.290> pack<00:02:27.560> responds

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
downtime before the front pack responds

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.810 
downtime before the front pack responds
so<00:02:29.180> we're<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.660> grab<00:02:29.840> three<00:02:30.140> bombs<00:02:30.440> and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
so we're going to grab three bombs and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.800 
so we're going to grab three bombs and
then<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:31.970> want<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.150> make<00:02:32.300> sure<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.720> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
then you want to make sure that you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.040 
then you want to make sure that you
plant<00:02:33.080> them<00:02:33.260> all<00:02:33.470> at<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> same<00:02:33.860> time<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.870> just

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
plant them all at the same time so just

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.720 
plant them all at the same time so just
count<00:02:39.350> with<00:02:39.500> your<00:02:39.650> group<00:02:39.890> right<00:02:40.130> here<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
count with your group right here and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030 
count with your group right here and
then<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.630> plant<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.990> bombs<00:02:42.200> assuming

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
then you can plant the bombs assuming

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.650 
then you can plant the bombs assuming
there's<00:02:43.220> no<00:02:43.310> dredge<00:02:43.610> around<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> dredge<00:02:44.270> to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
there's no dredge around the dredge to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.610 
there's no dredge around the dredge to
destroy<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.770> bottoms<00:02:46.100> if<00:02:46.280> they're<00:02:46.430> nearby<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
destroy the bottoms if they're nearby so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.580 
destroy the bottoms if they're nearby so
you<00:02:49.489> want<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.880> try<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.930> either<00:02:51.050> keep<00:02:51.410> them

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
you want to try and either keep them

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.020 
you want to try and either keep them
away<00:02:51.770> from<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.040> bombs<00:02:52.250> or<00:02:52.520> here<00:02:52.730> we're<00:02:52.880> just

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
away from the bombs or here we're just

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.360 
away from the bombs or here we're just
going<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.209> run<00:02:53.360> out<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.010> can<00:02:55.070> see<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.280> the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
going to run out so you can see in the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.430 
going to run out so you can see in the
top<00:02:55.520> right<00:02:55.760> corner<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.720> three<00:02:56.989> bombs<00:02:57.200> did

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
top right corner the three bombs did

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.680 
top right corner the three bombs did
almost<00:02:57.620> half<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.700> board<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.450> doors

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
almost half of the board the doors

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.020 
almost half of the board the doors
health<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.830> do<00:03:01.010> need<00:03:01.220> seven<00:03:01.580> total<00:03:01.730> though

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
health you do need seven total though

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.420 
health you do need seven total though
the<00:03:02.450> if<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.290> do<00:03:03.440> six<00:03:03.680> boxes<00:03:03.890> are<00:03:04.190> going<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.370> be

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
the if you do six boxes are going to be

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.030 
the if you do six boxes are going to be
a<00:03:04.459> little<00:03:04.730> sliver<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.120> health<00:03:05.450> left<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:06.739> from

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
a little sliver of health left so from

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.900 
a little sliver of health left so from
there<00:03:07.220> we're<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:07.520> going<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.700> basically

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
there we're just going to basically

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.640 
there we're just going to basically
repeat<00:03:08.570> what<00:03:08.720> we<00:03:08.750> just<00:03:08.840> did<00:03:09.200> we're<00:03:09.440> going<00:03:09.590> to

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
repeat what we just did we're going to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.979 
repeat what we just did we're going to
go<00:03:09.800> back<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.400> front<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.880> clear<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
go back to the front and clear the

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.600 
go back to the front and clear the
initial<00:03:12.500> front<00:03:12.739> group<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.160> then<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.310> can<00:03:13.459> see

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
initial front group and then you can see

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.490 
initial front group and then you can see
the<00:03:13.730> back<00:03:13.910> group<00:03:14.150> spawn<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:14.840> there's<00:03:15.110> not<00:03:15.290> too

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the back group spawn but there's not too

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.140 
the back group spawn but there's not too
many<00:03:15.620> dredge<00:03:16.010> because<00:03:16.459> we<00:03:16.550> only<00:03:16.730> plan<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
many dredge because we only plan the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.630 
many dredge because we only plan the
three<00:03:17.420> bombs<00:03:17.630> if<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:18.890> plant<00:03:19.130> four<00:03:19.430> bombs

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
three bombs if you do plant four bombs

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000 
three bombs if you do plant four bombs
or<00:03:20.090> even<00:03:20.480> six<00:03:20.750> bombs<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.440> don't<00:03:21.739> kill

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
or even six bombs and don't kill

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.380 
or even six bombs and don't kill
anything<00:03:22.250> there's<00:03:22.640> going<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.030> huge

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
anything there's going to be a huge

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.789 
anything there's going to be a huge
amount<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.750> dredge<00:03:23.959> back<00:03:24.200> here<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.650> it's

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
amount of dredge back here and it's

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.979 
amount of dredge back here and it's
going<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.040> be<00:03:25.190> really<00:03:25.400> hard<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.989> manage

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
going to be really hard to manage

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.530 
going to be really hard to manage
killing<00:03:27.560> them<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.850> at<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.090> point<00:03:29.150> you're

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
killing them so at that point you're

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.840 
killing them so at that point you're
either<00:03:29.690> going<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.170> have<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.890> like<00:03:31.280> death<00:03:31.549> sir

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
either going to have to like death sir

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.220 
either going to have to like death sir
or<00:03:32.269> you<00:03:32.360> can<00:03:32.570> use<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:32.959> thief<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.950> stealth

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
or you can use like a thief to stealth

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.080 
or you can use like a thief to stealth
before<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.470> April<00:03:37.040> thirtieth<00:03:37.250> patch<00:03:37.700> the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
before the April thirtieth patch the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.180 
before the April thirtieth patch the
stealth<00:03:38.510> method<00:03:38.930> was<00:03:39.080> rather<00:03:39.410> easy<00:03:39.739> but<00:03:40.160> I

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
stealth method was rather easy but I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.850 
stealth method was rather easy but I
have<00:03:40.489> heard<00:03:40.760> from<00:03:41.030> some<00:03:41.360> thief's<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:42.140> after

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
have heard from some thief's that after

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.770 
have heard from some thief's that after
that<00:03:43.010> patch<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.610> dredge<00:03:43.880> they<00:03:44.239> destroy<00:03:44.630> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
that patch the dredge they destroy the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.740 
that patch the dredge they destroy the
bombs<00:03:44.959> much<00:03:45.320> more<00:03:45.640> frequently<00:03:46.640> now<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.630> it's

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
bombs much more frequently now so it's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.039 
bombs much more frequently now so it's
harder<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:48.110> use<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.530> stealth<00:03:48.769> method<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.989> I

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
harder to use the stealth method so I

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.199 
harder to use the stealth method so I
would<00:03:51.350> say<00:03:51.500> if<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.680> can<00:03:52.100> kill<00:03:52.519> this<00:03:52.820> way<00:03:53.030> it's

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
would say if you can kill this way it's

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.479 
would say if you can kill this way it's
pretty<00:03:53.420> easy<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:54.019> can<00:03:54.530> try<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.799> self<00:03:55.100> method

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
pretty easy you can try the self method

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.530 
pretty easy you can try the self method
it<00:03:55.610> may<00:03:55.730> take<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:55.970> few<00:03:56.060> tries<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:58.420> besides<00:03:59.420> that

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it may take a few tries but besides that

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.690 
it may take a few tries but besides that
this<00:03:59.690> event<00:04:00.140> can<00:04:00.709> get<00:04:00.890> rather<00:04:01.040> annoying<00:04:01.459> if

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
this event can get rather annoying if

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.430 
this event can get rather annoying if
you<00:04:01.820> don't<00:04:02.000> know<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.360> proper<00:04:02.780> mechanics<00:04:03.260> to

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
you don't know the proper mechanics to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.240 
you don't know the proper mechanics to
do<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.760> rather<00:04:04.760> easily<00:04:05.739> then<00:04:06.739> up<00:04:06.860> here<00:04:06.890> when

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
do it rather easily then up here when

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.380 
do it rather easily then up here when
you<00:04:07.340> aren't<00:04:07.459> fighting<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.970> dredge<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
you aren't fighting the dredge the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.440 
you aren't fighting the dredge the
oscillators<00:04:09.019> are<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.530> main<00:04:10.150> dread<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.299> want

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
oscillators are the main dread you want

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.120 
oscillators are the main dread you want
to<00:04:11.510> watch<00:04:11.600> out<00:04:11.780> for<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.290> ones<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.620> put<00:04:12.860> the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
to watch out for the ones that put the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.920 
to watch out for the ones that put the
shockwave<00:04:13.850> on<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.120> ground<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.540> as<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.750> saw

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
shockwave on the ground and as you saw

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.960 
shockwave on the ground and as you saw
earlier<00:04:14.959> can<00:04:15.709> down<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.190> rather<00:04:16.400> easily<00:04:16.700> it

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
earlier can down you rather easily it

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.479 
earlier can down you rather easily it
does<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.150> ton<00:04:17.390> of<00:04:17.419> damage<00:04:17.630> especially<00:04:18.200> in<00:04:18.919> the

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
does a ton of damage especially in the

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.339 
does a ton of damage especially in the
40s<00:04:20.919> shield<00:04:21.919> of<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.280> Avenger<00:04:23.090> on<00:04:23.419> guardian

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
40s shield of the Avenger on guardian

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.040 
40s shield of the Avenger on guardian
can<00:04:24.650> absorb<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.430> shock<00:04:25.460> waves<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.240> believe

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
can absorb the shock waves I believe

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.869 
can absorb the shock waves I believe
but<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.770> only<00:04:27.860> problem<00:04:28.129> is<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.430> shield<00:04:28.639> does

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
but the only problem is the shield does

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.249 
but the only problem is the shield does
die<00:04:29.120> rather<00:04:29.780> quickly<00:04:30.139> sometimes<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:33.110> is

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
die rather quickly sometimes so that is

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.589 
die rather quickly sometimes so that is
option<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.770> use<00:04:33.889> though<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:35.270> at<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:35.419> point

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
option to use though so at this point

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.050 
option to use though so at this point
we've<00:04:35.840> cleared<00:04:36.199> out<00:04:36.409> the<00:04:36.490> backpack<00:04:37.490> again<00:04:37.669> and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
we've cleared out the backpack again and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.270 
we've cleared out the backpack again and
we<00:04:38.479> just<00:04:38.509> have<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.840> few<00:04:39.110> mobs<00:04:39.319> from<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.979> front

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
we just have a few mobs from the front

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.730 
we just have a few mobs from the front
pack<00:04:40.460> respawning<00:04:41.199> again<00:04:42.199> you<00:04:42.319> just<00:04:42.500> want<00:04:42.680> to

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
pack respawning again you just want to

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.350 
pack respawning again you just want to
get<00:04:42.830> four<00:04:43.159> bombs<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.639> time<00:04:43.879> you<00:04:44.060> can<00:04:44.210> have<00:04:44.330> a

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
get four bombs this time you can have a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.439 
get four bombs this time you can have a
guardian<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:46.340> kind<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.639> distract<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.240> mobs

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
guardian just kind of distract the mobs

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.360 
guardian just kind of distract the mobs
while<00:04:47.720> four<00:04:48.259> of<00:04:48.379> your<00:04:48.530> group<00:04:48.740> are<00:04:48.949> planning

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
while four of your group are planning

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.790 
while four of your group are planning
the<00:04:49.460> bombs<00:04:49.669> if<00:04:49.909> some<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.270> dredger<00:04:50.629> up<00:04:53.800> so

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
the bombs if some of the dredger up so

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.379 
the bombs if some of the dredger up so
at<00:04:54.860> this<00:04:54.889> point<00:04:55.159> again<00:04:55.460> just<00:04:55.759> plant<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.180> four

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
at this point again just plant the four

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.689 
at this point again just plant the four
bombs<00:04:56.569> at<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.960> same<00:04:57.169> time<00:04:57.440> there's<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.370> weird

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
bombs at the same time there's a weird

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.670 
bombs at the same time there's a weird
bug<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.509> I've<00:04:59.659> noticed<00:04:59.870> where<00:05:00.289> even<00:05:00.590> though

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
bug that I've noticed where even though

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.339 
bug that I've noticed where even though
you<00:05:00.740> plant<00:05:01.099> for<00:05:01.430> at<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.669> same<00:05:01.879> time<00:05:02.229> one<00:05:03.229> of

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
you plant for at the same time one of

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.119 
you plant for at the same time one of
them<00:05:03.469> is<00:05:03.500> going<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:04.520> take<00:05:05.210> longer<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:06.169> detonate

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
them is going to take longer to detonate

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.270 
them is going to take longer to detonate
so<00:05:07.849> you'll<00:05:08.030> see<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.419> here<00:05:08.690> but<00:05:09.039> when<00:05:10.039> three

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
so you'll see that here but when three

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.219 
so you'll see that here but when three
of<00:05:10.310> them<00:05:10.460> detonate<00:05:10.819> one<00:05:11.180> more<00:05:11.449> pack<00:05:11.659> of<00:05:11.960> dread

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
of them detonate one more pack of dread

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.749 
of them detonate one more pack of dread
you're<00:05:12.409> going<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.680> respond<00:05:13.069> you'll<00:05:13.310> see<00:05:13.520> just

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
you're going to respond you'll see just

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.730 
you're going to respond you'll see just
try<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:14.479> keep<00:05:14.690> them<00:05:14.900> off<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.349> final<00:05:15.710> bottom

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
try and keep them off that final bottom

try and keep them off that final bottom
you<00:05:16.129> can<00:05:16.159> even<00:05:16.819> use<00:05:17.180> like<00:05:17.449> sanctuary<00:05:18.080> or<00:05:18.169> just

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
you can even use like sanctuary or just
