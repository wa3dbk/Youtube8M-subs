because I loved one piece so this

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.170 
because I loved one piece so this
chapter<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.689> feels<00:00:25.430> incredibly<00:00:26.430> short<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.029> mean

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
chapter it feels incredibly short I mean

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.240 
chapter it feels incredibly short I mean
there's<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> lot<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.039> actually

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
there's a lot going on but it's actually

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.780 
there's a lot going on but it's actually
a<00:00:29.550> short<00:00:30.060> chapter<00:00:30.630> only<00:00:30.960> 16<00:00:31.619> pages<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.520> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
a short chapter only 16 pages which I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
a short chapter only 16 pages which I
mean<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.480> better<00:00:33.660> than<00:00:33.840> nothing<00:00:33.989> because

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
mean it's better than nothing because

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
mean it's better than nothing because
like<00:00:34.590> honestly<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.100> did<00:00:35.250> not<00:00:35.280> expect<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.790> chapter

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
like honestly I did not expect a chapter

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.520 
like honestly I did not expect a chapter
this<00:00:36.270> week<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> guess<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.110> better<00:00:37.140> than

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
this week so I guess that is better than

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
this week so I guess that is better than
nothing<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> short

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
nothing but it is kind of a short

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.330 
nothing but it is kind of a short
chapter<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.440> there<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> lot<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> different

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

detention actually having you know the
fighting<00:02:12.930> fish<00:02:13.110> but<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.440> kind<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.769> seems<00:02:14.430> a

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
fighting fish but it kind of seems a

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.800 
fighting fish but it kind of seems a
little<00:02:14.670> bit<00:02:14.819> pointless<00:02:15.120> since<00:02:15.629> he

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
little bit pointless since he

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.750 
little bit pointless since he
technically<00:02:16.230> got<00:02:16.500> owned<00:02:16.800> at<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.340> end<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.670> this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
technically got owned at the end of this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.930 
technically got owned at the end of this
chapter<00:02:18.030> since<00:02:18.390> he<00:02:18.510> was<00:02:18.629> technically<00:02:19.050> wrecked

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
chapter since he was technically wrecked

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.460 
chapter since he was technically wrecked
it<00:02:20.940> felt<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.480> reveal<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:22.140> really

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
it felt like that reveal was really

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.610 
it felt like that reveal was really
technically<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.400> nothing<00:02:23.760> uh<00:02:24.200> who<00:02:25.200> knows<00:02:25.410> he

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
technically for nothing uh who knows he

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.559 
technically for nothing uh who knows he
might<00:02:25.739> get<00:02:25.920> back<00:02:26.099> up<00:02:26.310> next<00:02:26.489> chapters<00:02:27.000> continue

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
might get back up next chapters continue

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.750 
might get back up next chapters continue
to<00:02:27.660> fight<00:02:27.840> we<00:02:28.019> have<00:02:28.110> no<00:02:28.260> idea<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.190> mean<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.640> I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
to fight we have no idea but I mean if I

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.670 
to fight we have no idea but I mean if I
think<00:02:30.000> about<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.629> seems<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.500> kind

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
think about it just seems like it's kind

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.830 
think about it just seems like it's kind
of<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.830> waste<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.160> reveal<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.849> finish<00:02:33.810> him

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840

I<00:03:10.889> guess<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.850> overall<00:03:12.239> artwork<00:03:12.630> two<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
I guess the overall artwork two of the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.720 
I guess the overall artwork two of the
chapter<00:03:13.350> was<00:03:13.470> really<00:03:13.709> nice<00:03:13.889> I<00:03:14.100> that's<00:03:14.459> one

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
chapter was really nice I that's one

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.920 
chapter was really nice I that's one
thing<00:03:14.850> i<00:03:14.970> should<00:03:15.150> do<00:03:15.209> want<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.420> point<00:03:15.510> out<00:03:15.630> even

thing i should do want to point out even

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.509 
thing i should do want to point out even

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
though this chapter is a really nice

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.849 
though this chapter is a really nice
chapter<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.780> overall<00:03:19.200> artwork<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.829> the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
chapter the overall artwork of the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.229 
chapter the overall artwork of the
panels<00:03:20.310> look<00:03:20.430> pretty<00:03:20.700> nice<00:03:20.790> i<00:03:20.850> mean<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.150> not

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
the best artwork of all time it comes to
