00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.249 

our<00:00:10.519> beading<00:00:10.879> lesson<00:00:11.240> for<00:00:11.420> today<00:00:11.660> is<00:00:11.870> about

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
our beading lesson for today is about

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.080 
our beading lesson for today is about
making<00:00:12.589> a<00:00:12.679> coiled<00:00:13.070> bracelet<00:00:13.610> from<00:00:13.759> memory

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
making a coiled bracelet from memory

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.269 
making a coiled bracelet from memory
wire<00:00:14.299> and<00:00:14.570> beads<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.559> take<00:00:15.740> a<00:00:15.769> look<00:00:15.949> at<00:00:16.099> these

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
wire and beads so take a look at these

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.190 
wire and beads so take a look at these
bracelets<00:00:16.670> right<00:00:17.119> here<00:00:17.450> and<00:00:17.689> you'll<00:00:18.110> see

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
bracelets right here and you'll see

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.109 
bracelets right here and you'll see
there<00:00:18.529> it's<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:18.890> very<00:00:18.919> simple<00:00:19.369> concept<00:00:19.640> but

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
there it's a very simple concept but

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.609 
there it's a very simple concept but
there<00:00:20.270> are<00:00:20.390> some<00:00:20.539> tips<00:00:20.779> that<00:00:20.990> make<00:00:21.140> this<00:00:21.380> a

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
there are some tips that make this a

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.589 
there are some tips that make this a
little<00:00:21.800> bit<00:00:22.009> more<00:00:22.160> intricate<00:00:22.460> looking<00:00:23.029> even

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
little bit more intricate looking even

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.880 
little bit more intricate looking even
though<00:00:23.720> all<00:00:23.930> you're<00:00:24.140> doing<00:00:24.349> is<00:00:24.470> stringing

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
though all you're doing is stringing

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.189 
though all you're doing is stringing
beads<00:00:24.920> onto<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.609> wire<00:00:25.699> I<00:00:26.150> like<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:26.900> use<00:00:27.019> this

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
beads onto the wire I like to use this

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.019 
beads onto the wire I like to use this
technique<00:00:27.650> with<00:00:27.859> a<00:00:27.890> variety<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.369> rounds

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
technique with a variety of rounds

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.720 
technique with a variety of rounds
because<00:00:29.570> by<00:00:30.259> changing<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.070> size<00:00:31.339> you<00:00:31.699> can

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
because by changing the size you can

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.220 
because by changing the size you can
really<00:00:32.119> change<00:00:32.330> up<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:32.660> texture<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.080> the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
really change up the texture of the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.140 
really change up the texture of the
bracelet<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:33.830> give<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:34.129> some<00:00:34.309> really<00:00:34.460> kind<00:00:35.089> of

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
bracelet and give it some really kind of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.270 
bracelet and give it some really kind of
intricate<00:00:35.540> looking<00:00:35.780> effects<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.379> also<00:00:36.890> like<00:00:37.160> to

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
intricate looking effects I also like to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.009 
intricate looking effects I also like to
use<00:00:37.309> variegated<00:00:38.059> stones<00:00:38.360> for<00:00:38.660> this<00:00:38.780> because

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
use variegated stones for this because

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.469 
use variegated stones for this because
that<00:00:39.170> also<00:00:39.680> creates<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.309> look<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:40.850> texture<00:00:41.269> even

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
that also creates a look of texture even

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.060 
that also creates a look of texture even
though<00:00:42.110> they<00:00:42.260> don't<00:00:42.530> actually<00:00:42.739> have<00:00:42.949> a

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
though they don't actually have a

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.250 
though they don't actually have a
textured<00:00:43.460> surface<00:00:43.940> they<00:00:44.540> kind<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.930> the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
textured surface they kind of the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.070 
textured surface they kind of the
variation<00:00:45.559> in<00:00:45.979> color<00:00:46.220> on<00:00:46.549> those<00:00:47.239> stone<00:00:47.839> beads

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
variation in color on those stone beads

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.359 
variation in color on those stone beads
makes<00:00:48.500> them<00:00:48.680> look<00:00:48.830> a<00:00:48.920> little<00:00:48.949> bit<00:00:49.159> more

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:49.369 
makes them look a little bit more

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:51.399 
makes them look a little bit more
textured<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.690> what<00:00:50.869> you'll<00:00:50.989> need<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.260> start

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
textured so what you'll need to start

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.560 
textured so what you'll need to start
out<00:00:51.619> with<00:00:51.769> is<00:00:51.979> a<00:00:52.040> memory<00:00:52.400> wire<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.909> memory

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
out with is a memory wire and memory

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.810 
out with is a memory wire and memory
wire<00:00:53.750> comes<00:00:54.049> in<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.229> coil<00:00:54.409> like<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:55.250> has

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
wire comes in a coil like this it has

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.579 
wire comes in a coil like this it has
been<00:00:56.089> tempered<00:00:56.540> so<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.049> retains<00:00:57.199> its

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
been tempered so that it retains its

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.890 
been tempered so that it retains its
shape<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:59.000> don't<00:00:59.180> need<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.449> use<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> clasp

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
shape and you don't need to use a clasp

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.869 
shape and you don't need to use a clasp
it<00:01:00.500> also<00:01:00.650> comes<00:01:00.979> in<00:01:01.129> different<00:01:01.159> colors<00:01:01.729> so

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
it also comes in different colors so

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.280 
it also comes in different colors so
that's<00:01:02.000> something<00:01:02.659> to<00:01:02.720> keep<00:01:02.839> in<00:01:02.960> mind<00:01:03.110> when

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
that's something to keep in mind when

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.500 
that's something to keep in mind when
you're<00:01:03.409> planning<00:01:03.619> your<00:01:03.769> design<00:01:04.189> now<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.119> friend

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
you're planning your design now a friend

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.270 
you're planning your design now a friend
asked<00:01:05.659> me<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.080> know<00:01:06.200> how<00:01:06.380> do<00:01:06.439> you<00:01:06.619> begin<00:01:07.009> when

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
asked me you know how do you begin when

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.620 
asked me you know how do you begin when
you<00:01:07.369> haven't<00:01:07.610> made<00:01:07.729> any<00:01:07.759> jewelry<00:01:08.360> where<00:01:08.540> do

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
you haven't made any jewelry where do

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.390 
you haven't made any jewelry where do
you<00:01:08.720> start<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:09.619> suggested<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.159> her<00:01:10.369> that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
you start and I suggested to her that

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.010 
you start and I suggested to her that
she<00:01:10.670> might<00:01:10.820> want<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.090> get<00:01:11.210> some<00:01:11.479> different

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
she might want to get some different

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.830 
she might want to get some different
colors<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.590> round<00:01:13.070> beads<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.450> reason<00:01:14.720> is

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
colors of round beads and the reason is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.410 
colors of round beads and the reason is
because<00:01:14.870> it's<00:01:15.380> very<00:01:15.860> simple<00:01:16.400> shape<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.000> you

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
because it's very simple shape and you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.970 
because it's very simple shape and you
don't<00:01:17.600> feel<00:01:17.750> overwhelmed<00:01:17.780> by<00:01:18.500> how<00:01:18.680> they<00:01:18.830> go

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
don't feel overwhelmed by how they go

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.290 
don't feel overwhelmed by how they go
together<00:01:19.130> because<00:01:19.580> they<00:01:19.700> already<00:01:20.060> go

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
together because they already go

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.660 
together because they already go
together<00:01:20.570> they're<00:01:20.810> all<00:01:20.840> round<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:22.160> are<00:01:22.430> using

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
together they're all round we are using

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.310 
together they're all round we are using
some<00:01:22.970> different<00:01:23.300> sizes<00:01:23.480> here<00:01:23.810> we<00:01:23.960> have<00:01:24.080> eight

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
some different sizes here we have eight

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.070 
some different sizes here we have eight
four<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:24.980> six<00:01:25.520> millimeter<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.240> again<00:01:26.840> kind

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
four and six millimeter and again kind

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.840 
four and six millimeter and again kind
of<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:27.350> color<00:01:27.620> palette<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.430> know<00:01:28.520> this<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:28.820> a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
of that color palette you know this is a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.720 
of that color palette you know this is a
warm<00:01:29.180> with<00:01:29.960> some<00:01:30.170> Browns<00:01:30.440> in<00:01:30.770> there<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:31.220> pulled

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
warm with some Browns in there I pulled

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.520 
warm with some Browns in there I pulled
this<00:01:31.850> from<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> color<00:01:32.420> wheel<00:01:32.510> and<00:01:32.960> anytime

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
this from the color wheel and anytime

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.770 
this from the color wheel and anytime
you<00:01:33.860> need<00:01:34.310> some<00:01:34.490> help<00:01:34.670> deciding<00:01:35.210> on<00:01:35.330> colors<00:01:35.630> of

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you need some help deciding on colors of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.330 
you need some help deciding on colors of
course<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.140> can<00:01:36.290> go<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.590> color<00:01:36.800> wheel<00:01:37.040> and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
course you can go to the color wheel and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.490 
course you can go to the color wheel and
look<00:01:38.240> at<00:01:38.390> color<00:01:38.600> palettes<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.140> work<00:01:39.290> well

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
look at color palettes that work well

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.160 
look at color palettes that work well
together<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:41.030> get<00:01:41.240> started<00:01:41.720> you'll<00:01:41.960> need<00:01:42.050> a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
together so to get started you'll need a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.320 
together so to get started you'll need a
couple<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.530> tools<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:43.550> need<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.729> memory<00:01:44.120> wire

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
couple of tools you need a memory wire

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.390 
couple of tools you need a memory wire
cutter<00:01:44.659> any<00:01:44.930> time<00:01:45.200> you're<00:01:45.350> using<00:01:45.380> memory<00:01:46.100> wire

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
cutter any time you're using memory wire

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.149 
cutter any time you're using memory wire
the<00:01:47.090> reason<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.510> because<00:01:47.630> these<00:01:48.050> are<00:01:48.320> tempered

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
the reason is because these are tempered

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.340 
the reason is because these are tempered
also<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:49.940> they<00:01:50.060> don't<00:01:50.270> get<00:01:50.720> damaged<00:01:51.170> by<00:01:51.290> the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
also so they don't get damaged by the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.080 
also so they don't get damaged by the
memory<00:01:51.680> wire<00:01:51.860> because<00:01:52.370> it's<00:01:52.549> such<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.760> tough

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
memory wire because it's such a tough

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.850 
memory wire because it's such a tough
wire<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.600> cut<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.049> can<00:01:54.229> take<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.409> little<00:01:54.710> notch

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
wire to cut you can take a little notch

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.430 
wire to cut you can take a little notch
out<00:01:55.190> of<00:01:55.340> your<00:01:55.580> regular<00:01:56.360> wire<00:01:56.720> cutters<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
out of your regular wire cutters and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.050 
out of your regular wire cutters and
you'll<00:01:57.799> probably<00:01:57.920> hear<00:01:58.220> us<00:01:58.250> say<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:58.909> again

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
you'll probably hear us say that again

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.899 
you'll probably hear us say that again
this<00:01:59.240> season<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.500> also<00:02:00.680> want<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.100> use<00:02:01.190> some

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
this season you also want to use some

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.450 
this season you also want to use some
special<00:02:02.210> pliers<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.260> have<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.920> bail<00:02:04.250> making

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
special pliers that have a bail making

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.690 
special pliers that have a bail making
tip<00:02:04.909> this<00:02:05.750> has<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:05.960> small<00:02:06.350> cylindrical<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.520> one

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
tip this has a small cylindrical on one

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.369 
tip this has a small cylindrical on one
side<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.239> larger<00:02:08.569> one<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> other<00:02:09.049> side

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
side and a larger one on the other side

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.070 
side and a larger one on the other side
this<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.190> easier<00:02:10.549> than<00:02:10.819> using<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.720> kind<00:02:12.019> of

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
this is easier than using the kind of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.750 
this is easier than using the kind of
cone-shaped<00:02:12.739> round<00:02:13.010> nosed<00:02:13.190> pliers<00:02:13.220> because

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
cone-shaped round nosed pliers because

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.550 
cone-shaped round nosed pliers because
you<00:02:14.060> can<00:02:14.209> really<00:02:14.450> get<00:02:14.659> good<00:02:14.900> leverage<00:02:15.080> on<00:02:15.440> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
you can really get good leverage on the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.830 
you can really get good leverage on the
wire<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.670> we'll<00:02:16.849> start<00:02:17.090> out<00:02:17.209> by<00:02:17.359> cutting<00:02:17.569> just

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
wire so we'll start out by cutting just

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.309 
wire so we'll start out by cutting just
a<00:02:18.019> few<00:02:18.260> rings<00:02:18.499> here<00:02:19.510> my<00:02:20.510> tip<00:02:20.689> for<00:02:20.719> cutting<00:02:21.139> wire

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
a few rings here my tip for cutting wire

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.720 
a few rings here my tip for cutting wire
is<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.859> just<00:02:22.099> sort<00:02:22.249> of<00:02:22.340> pull

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
is to just sort of pull

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.000 
is to just sort of pull
these<00:02:22.879> loops<00:02:23.209> apart<00:02:23.659> so<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:24.830> tell

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
these loops apart so that you can tell

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.220 
these loops apart so that you can tell
where<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.340> are<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.720> use<00:02:26.870> an<00:02:27.080> odd

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
where you are and I like to use an odd

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.589 
where you are and I like to use an odd
number<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.620> strands<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.940> usually<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.450> my

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
number of strands and I usually have my

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.350 
number of strands and I usually have my
ends<00:02:29.870> kind<00:02:30.049> of<00:02:30.200> overlapping<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.670> I'll<00:02:32.090> go<00:02:32.330> with

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
ends kind of overlapping so I'll go with

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.500 
ends kind of overlapping so I'll go with
my<00:02:32.569> three<00:02:33.530> here<00:02:33.860> now<00:02:34.640> go<00:02:34.790> ahead<00:02:34.909> and<00:02:35.120> cut<00:02:35.299> this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
my three here now go ahead and cut this

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.830 
my three here now go ahead and cut this
with<00:02:36.409> my<00:02:36.590> memory<00:02:36.860> wire<00:02:37.040> cutter<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:38.540> I'll

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
with my memory wire cutter and then I'll

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.890 
with my memory wire cutter and then I'll
loop<00:02:39.230> one<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.739> ends<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:41.269> loop<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.660> like

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
loop one of the ends and to loop I like

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.720 
loop one of the ends and to loop I like
to<00:02:42.019> roll<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.349> against<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.950> natural<00:02:43.099> curve<00:02:43.519> of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
to roll it against the natural curve of

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.039 
to roll it against the natural curve of
the<00:02:43.819> wire<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.330> just<00:02:44.629> think<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:44.900> easier

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
the wire I just think it's easier

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.839 
the wire I just think it's easier
because<00:02:45.620> you're<00:02:45.860> not<00:02:46.040> trying<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.370> force<00:02:46.640> that

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
because you're not trying to force that

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.640 
because you're not trying to force that
tempered<00:02:47.239> wire<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.629> keep<00:02:47.810> coiling<00:02:48.379> you're

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
tempered wire to keep coiling you're

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.309 
tempered wire to keep coiling you're
actually<00:02:49.010> going<00:02:49.160> back<00:02:49.780> okay<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.170> have<00:02:51.260> a

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
actually going back okay so you have a

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.589 
actually going back okay so you have a
nice<00:02:51.560> loop<00:02:51.829> on<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.099> end<00:02:52.129> of<00:02:52.340> your<00:02:52.400> wire<00:02:52.670> now

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
nice loop on the end of your wire now

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.630 
nice loop on the end of your wire now
you're<00:02:53.810> ready<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.110> start<00:02:54.319> stringing<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.459> what

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
you're ready to start stringing so what

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.000 
you're ready to start stringing so what
you<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:55.910> do<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.360> add<00:02:56.989> these<00:02:57.290> beads<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.799> groups

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
you can do is add these beads in groups

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.479 
you can do is add these beads in groups
of<00:02:58.220> three<00:02:58.549> five<00:02:59.090> or<00:02:59.420> seven<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.250> think<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.370> it

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
of three five or seven and think of it

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.440 
of three five or seven and think of it
as<00:03:01.640> little<00:03:02.209> color<00:03:02.420> blocks<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.940> get<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.269> few

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
as little color blocks so you get a few

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
as little color blocks so you get a few
beads<00:03:05.690> on<00:03:05.900> here<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.500> can<00:03:06.650> see<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.920> pattern

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
beads on here and you can see a pattern

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.789 
beads on here and you can see a pattern
starting<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.970> develop<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:09.230> main<00:03:09.410> things<00:03:09.709> to

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
starting to develop the main things to

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.559 
starting to develop the main things to
keep<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.160> mind<00:03:10.190> about<00:03:10.549> adding<00:03:11.120> these<00:03:11.239> beads

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
keep in mind about adding these beads

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.900 
keep in mind about adding these beads
are<00:03:11.750> try<00:03:12.349> not<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.680> be<00:03:12.829> too<00:03:13.069> repetitive<00:03:13.280> about

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
are try not to be too repetitive about

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.349 
are try not to be too repetitive about
the<00:03:14.660> size<00:03:14.900> or<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.530> color<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.090> number<00:03:17.329> of

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
the size or the color so the number of

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.930 
the size or the color so the number of
beads<00:03:17.629> isn't<00:03:18.019> quite<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.349> important<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:19.549> you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
beads isn't quite so important but you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.369 
beads isn't quite so important but you
know<00:03:20.060> here<00:03:20.359> I'm<00:03:20.510> adding<00:03:20.690> three<00:03:21.109> four

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
know here I'm adding three four

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.199 
know here I'm adding three four
millimeters<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.459> have<00:03:22.640> three<00:03:22.940> six

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
millimeters and I have three six

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.300 
millimeters and I have three six
millimeters<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.989> those<00:03:24.620> look<00:03:24.799> good<00:03:24.920> together

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
millimeters and those look good together

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.580 
millimeters and those look good together
you<00:03:25.489> wouldn't<00:03:25.730> want<00:03:25.910> necessarily<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.410> same

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
you wouldn't want necessarily the same

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.400 
you wouldn't want necessarily the same
size<00:03:27.889> all<00:03:28.220> in<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.459> row<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:29.989> would<00:03:30.139> just<00:03:30.169> slide

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
size all in a row so I would just slide

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.960 
size all in a row so I would just slide
these<00:03:30.620> all<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.950> way<00:03:30.980> around<00:03:31.310> until<00:03:31.519> I<00:03:31.700> get<00:03:31.760> to

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
these all the way around until I get to

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.050 
these all the way around until I get to
the<00:03:32.060> end<00:03:32.209> keep<00:03:33.079> adding<00:03:33.650> beads<00:03:33.859> now<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.849> can

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the end keep adding beads now you can

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.849 
the end keep adding beads now you can
see<00:03:35.269> here<00:03:35.480> on<00:03:35.599> this<00:03:35.780> bracelet<00:03:36.169> that<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.620> never

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
see here on this bracelet that I never

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.940 
see here on this bracelet that I never
added<00:03:37.340> beads<00:03:37.579> that<00:03:37.819> are<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.090> same<00:03:38.299> either<00:03:38.950> to

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
added beads that are the same either to

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.250 
added beads that are the same either to
the<00:03:40.099> loops<00:03:40.280> here<00:03:40.609> so<00:03:41.269> they're<00:03:41.450> not<00:03:41.569> same<00:03:41.900> next

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
the loops here so they're not same next

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.199 
the loops here so they're not same next
to<00:03:42.319> each<00:03:42.440> other<00:03:42.620> they're<00:03:43.010> not<00:03:43.040> same<00:03:43.519> across

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
to each other they're not same across

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.210 
to each other they're not same across
the<00:03:44.750> loops<00:03:44.930> either<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.680> gives<00:03:45.889> it<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.069> more

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
the loops either this gives it a more

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.920 
the loops either this gives it a more
intricate<00:03:46.549> looking<00:03:46.940> effect<00:03:47.060> even<00:03:47.599> though<00:03:47.720> all

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
intricate looking effect even though all

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.259 
intricate looking effect even though all
you're<00:03:48.109> doing<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.650> varying<00:03:49.459> your<00:03:49.489> beads<00:03:49.910> onto

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
you're doing is varying your beads onto

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.720 
you're doing is varying your beads onto
the<00:03:50.569> Strand<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.980> one<00:03:52.190> thing<00:03:52.370> you'll<00:03:52.489> notice

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
the Strand so one thing you'll notice

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.670 
the Strand so one thing you'll notice
during<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.419> season<00:03:53.599> is<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.049> everybody<00:03:54.500> has

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
during this season is that everybody has

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.580 
during this season is that everybody has
a<00:03:54.709> different<00:03:55.069> method<00:03:55.160> for<00:03:55.400> making<00:03:55.730> wrap<00:03:56.090> loops

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
a different method for making wrap loops

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.349 
a different method for making wrap loops
what<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.680> do<00:03:57.829> is<00:03:58.130> start<00:03:58.669> out<00:03:58.790> with<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:58.940> head<00:03:59.150> pin

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
what you do is start out with a head pin

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.140 
what you do is start out with a head pin
and<00:03:59.419> a<00:03:59.720> bead<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.200> my<00:04:01.069> method<00:04:01.400> for<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.700> is<00:04:01.940> to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
and a bead and my method for this is to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.030 
and a bead and my method for this is to
take<00:04:02.329> my<00:04:02.480> round<00:04:02.690> nose<00:04:02.930> pliers<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.709> I'm<00:04:03.859> just

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
take my round nose pliers and I'm just

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.589 
take my round nose pliers and I'm just
going<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.310> make<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.669> little<00:04:04.970> ninety<00:04:05.359> degree

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
going to make a little ninety degree

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.180 
going to make a little ninety degree
angle<00:04:06.019> here<00:04:06.049> at<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.440> top<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.919> it's<00:04:07.129> just

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
angle here at the top and it's just

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.460 
angle here at the top and it's just
about<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.700> same<00:04:07.940> width<00:04:08.660> as<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.930> tip<00:04:09.319> of<00:04:09.440> my

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
about the same width as the tip of my

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.770 
about the same width as the tip of my
pliers<00:04:09.829> then<00:04:10.639> I'm<00:04:10.910> going<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.239> move<00:04:11.329> my<00:04:11.540> pliers

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
pliers then I'm going to move my pliers

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.319 
pliers then I'm going to move my pliers
over<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.590> roll<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.310> back<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:14.000> make<00:04:14.150> that

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
over and roll it back to make that

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.289 
over and roll it back to make that
perfect<00:04:14.690> loop<00:04:15.250> I'll<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.489> roll<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:16.970> toward

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
perfect loop I'll just roll it toward

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.050 
perfect loop I'll just roll it toward
the<00:04:17.359> stem<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:18.919> so<00:04:19.340> it's<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.579> circle<00:04:19.940> at

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
the stem like that so it's a circle at

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.189 
the stem like that so it's a circle at
the<00:04:20.180> top<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.510> your<00:04:20.660> stick

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
the top of your stick

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.080 
the top of your stick
then<00:04:21.949> you're<00:04:22.190> holding<00:04:22.550> your<00:04:22.669> chain<00:04:22.910> nose

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
then you're holding your chain nose

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.750 
then you're holding your chain nose
pliers<00:04:23.360> hold<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.410> loop<00:04:24.710> inside<00:04:25.250> there<00:04:25.550> and

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
pliers hold that loop inside there and

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.460 
pliers hold that loop inside there and
then<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.120> use<00:04:26.300> my<00:04:26.330> fingers<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:27.080> wrap<00:04:27.260> this

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
then I use my fingers to wrap this

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.100 
then I use my fingers to wrap this
around<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.760> make<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:29.090> very<00:04:29.210> neat<00:04:29.630> coil

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
around you can make this very neat coil

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.620 
around you can make this very neat coil
or<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:30.890> can<00:04:31.039> double<00:04:31.400> coil<00:04:31.640> over<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> top<00:04:32.390> of

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
or you can double coil over the top of

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.080 
or you can double coil over the top of
your<00:04:33.020> original<00:04:33.289> so<00:04:34.280> just<00:04:34.490> kind<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.669> work<00:04:34.880> your

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
your original so just kind of work your

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.070 
your original so just kind of work your
way<00:04:35.120> back<00:04:35.479> up

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
way back up

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.860 
way back up
the<00:04:36.889> stem<00:04:37.190> toward<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.729> loop<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.210> then

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
the stem toward the loop and then

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.960 
the stem toward the loop and then
instead<00:04:39.199> of<00:04:39.259> trying<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.680> get<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:40.009> really

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
instead of trying to get this really

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.119 
instead of trying to get this really
tight<00:04:41.180> against<00:04:41.629> here<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:42.080> would<00:04:42.680> just<00:04:42.860> come<00:04:43.009> in

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
tight against here I would just come in

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.010 
tight against here I would just come in
with<00:04:43.250> my<00:04:43.460> regular<00:04:43.819> wire<00:04:44.210> cutter<00:04:44.539> not<00:04:44.810> my

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
with my regular wire cutter not my

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.279 
with my regular wire cutter not my
memory<00:04:45.289> wire<00:04:45.440> cutter<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:45.919> cut<00:04:46.009> this<00:04:46.759> away<00:04:46.940> and

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
memory wire cutter and cut this away and

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.439 
memory wire cutter and cut this away and
then<00:04:48.289> I<00:04:48.379> have<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.560> nice<00:04:48.770> little<00:04:48.819> dangle<00:04:49.819> now

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
then I have a nice little dangle now

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.210 
then I have a nice little dangle now
we're<00:04:50.599> going<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.870> make<00:04:50.990> three<00:04:51.229> of<00:04:51.440> these<00:04:51.620> to

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
we're going to make three of these to

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.490 
we're going to make three of these to
attach<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.729> each<00:04:53.000> end<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.539> bracelet<00:04:53.900> and

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
attach to each end of the bracelet and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.339 
attach to each end of the bracelet and
that's<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.729> you<00:04:56.419> know<00:04:56.449> it's<00:04:56.780> just<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:57.199> way<00:04:57.319> of

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
that's just you know it's just a way of

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.589 
that's just you know it's just a way of
adding<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.889> designer<00:04:58.250> touch<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.240> end

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
adding a designer touch to the end

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.290 
adding a designer touch to the end
that's<00:05:00.409> like<00:05:00.710> saying<00:05:01.310> your<00:05:01.639> stamp<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:02.150> you
