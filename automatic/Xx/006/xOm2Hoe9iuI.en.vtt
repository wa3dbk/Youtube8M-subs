right<00:00:02.580> there<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.000> where<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.449> tapped<00:00:03.929> into<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
right there is where I tapped into the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.320 
right there is where I tapped into the
the<00:00:06.660> intercooler<00:00:07.170> line<00:00:07.910> right<00:00:08.910> after<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the intercooler line right after the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.070 
the intercooler line right after the
turbo<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.809> get<00:00:10.080> boost<00:00:11.090> I've<00:00:12.090> got<00:00:12.420> two<00:00:12.719> gauges

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
turbo to get boost I've got two gauges

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.099 
turbo to get boost I've got two gauges
here<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> snow<00:00:14.309> performance

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
here one for the snow performance

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.170 
here one for the snow performance
water-methanol<00:00:16.109> injection<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:18.000> other

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
water-methanol injection and the other

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.210 
water-methanol injection and the other
for<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.960> gauge<00:00:19.199> which<00:00:19.439> i've<00:00:19.650> had<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.010> here

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
for this gauge which i've had up here

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.130 
for this gauge which i've had up here
for<00:00:20.430> probably<00:00:20.730> two<00:00:21.060> three<00:00:21.330> years<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:21.750> never

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
for probably two three years now never

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.060 
for probably two three years now never
hooked<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.560> till<00:00:22.859> mom<00:00:27.439> let<00:00:28.439> me<00:00:28.470> turn<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> little

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
hooked up till mom let me turn a little

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.359 
hooked up till mom let me turn a little
light<00:00:29.220> up<00:00:29.369> mode<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.349> let's<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:32.009> where<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
light up mode on and let's see where is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.720 
light up mode on and let's see where is
it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.030 
it
yeah<00:00:32.969> there<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.890> right<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
yeah there it is right here this is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.200 
yeah there it is right here this is
where<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> put<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.270> tee<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.160 

so<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> could<00:00:43.230> hook<00:00:43.380> up<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.770> both<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> snow

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so I could hook up to both the snow

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
so I could hook up to both the snow
performance<00:00:46.440> reader<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.020> analog<00:00:49.920> gauge

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
performance reader and the analog gauge

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.890 
performance reader and the analog gauge
itself<00:00:51.440> let's<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.800> happens

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
itself let's see what happens

a different actuator in the transmission
and<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.840> tuner<00:01:10.200> let's<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.190> what<00:01:11.369> we're<00:01:11.550> putting

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and a tuner let's see what we're putting

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.570 
and a tuner let's see what we're putting
out<00:01:11.940> boost<00:01:12.270> twice

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

great<00:01:22.330> both<00:01:22.450> gauges<00:01:22.990> are<00:01:23.200> working

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.080 

right<00:01:27.350> now

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 

get<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> flat<00:01:33.750> here<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> open<00:01:34.469> it<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
get on a flat here and open it up and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.420 
get on a flat here and open it up and
see<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:35.729> what<00:01:35.939> now

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
see what we're really what now

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.510 
see what we're really what now
okay<00:01:38.430> from<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> sounds<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:41.130> sounds

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
okay from the sounds of it it sounds

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480 
okay from the sounds of it it sounds
like<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.820> got<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.530> sleek<00:01:43.530> around<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:44.190> gauge

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
like I got a sleek around this gauge

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.740 
like I got a sleek around this gauge
here

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.810 

here<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:55.010> tell<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.370> leaking

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
here it but the can tell it's leaking

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.360 
here it but the can tell it's leaking
from<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.990> gauge<00:01:57.230> there<00:01:57.530> somewhere<00:01:58.010> off<00:01:58.130> to

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
from that gauge there somewhere off to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.390 
from that gauge there somewhere off to
take<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.610> look<00:01:58.850> at<00:01:59.000> that<00:01:59.980> probably<00:02:00.980> just<00:02:01.160> needs

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
take a look at that probably just needs

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.640 
take a look at that probably just needs
to<00:02:01.520> be<00:02:01.640> tightened<00:02:02.060> up<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.780> was<00:02:02.870> about<00:02:03.080> 30<00:02:03.350> psi

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
to be tightened up that was about 30 psi

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.610 
to be tightened up that was about 30 psi
right<00:02:04.220> there<00:02:04.550> with<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.210> little<00:02:05.450> leak<00:02:05.750> not

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
right there with that little leak not

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.420 
right there with that little leak not
that<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.920> would<00:02:07.040> make<00:02:07.190> much<00:02:07.490> difference<00:02:07.750> I

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
that it would make much difference I

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.370 
that it would make much difference I
want<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.520> get<00:02:10.580> as<00:02:10.729> much<00:02:10.940> as<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.630> can<00:02:11.900> into<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
want to get as much as I can into the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:03:03.250 
want to get as much as I can into the
ends<00:02:12.530> me

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.440 

so<00:03:03.890> yeah<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.599> little<00:03:05.599> bit<00:03:05.720> more<00:03:05.930> than<00:03:06.110> 30<00:03:06.409> psi

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
so yeah a little bit more than 30 psi

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.119 
so yeah a little bit more than 30 psi
I'm<00:03:08.450> gonna<00:03:08.569> shifts<00:03:09.110> it'll<00:03:09.319> jump<00:03:09.590> up<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.920> little

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
I'm gonna shifts it'll jump up a little

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.610 
I'm gonna shifts it'll jump up a little
bit<00:03:10.340> but<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.700> looks<00:03:10.879> like<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> steady<00:03:12.049> output<00:03:12.290> of

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
bit but it looks like a steady output of

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.220 
bit but it looks like a steady output of
about<00:03:12.739> 30<00:03:13.700> psi<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.330> what<00:03:14.690> we're<00:03:14.870> getting<00:03:15.140> out

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
about 30 psi is what we're getting out

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.160 
about 30 psi is what we're getting out
of<00:03:15.260> here<00:03:15.379> this<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.519> with<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> bone<00:03:17.720> stock

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
of here this is with a bone stock

00:03:18.170 --> 00:04:08.110 
of here this is with a bone stock

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.710 

not<00:04:09.120> bad

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
not bad

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.559 
not bad
I've<00:04:10.410> heard<00:04:10.740> you<00:04:11.430> don't<00:04:11.640> want<00:04:11.819> to<00:04:11.910> go<00:04:12.060> any<00:04:12.270> more

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
I've heard you don't want to go any more

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.270 
I've heard you don't want to go any more
than<00:04:12.840> 35<00:04:13.620> psi<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:15.019> 38<00:04:16.019> psi<00:04:16.620> is<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:17.040> really

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
than 35 psi and 38 psi is like really

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.400 
than 35 psi and 38 psi is like really
pushing<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.850> limit<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.329> this<00:04:18.540> on<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.169> stock

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
pushing the limit on this on the stock

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.280 
pushing the limit on this on the stock
air<00:04:19.680> turbos<00:04:20.389> so<00:04:21.389> looks<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:21.989> we're<00:04:22.169> getting

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
air turbos so looks like we're getting

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.110 
air turbos so looks like we're getting
pretty<00:04:22.530> good<00:04:22.650> boost<00:04:22.980> out<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:23.550> thing<00:04:23.820> I

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
pretty good boost out of this thing I

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.600 
pretty good boost out of this thing I
always<00:04:24.990> wanted<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.410> know<00:04:25.470> now<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:26.160> know<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
always wanted to know now I can know I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.830 
always wanted to know now I can know I
like<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.389> personally<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.960> like<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:29.840> analog

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
like that personally I like the analog

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.450 
like that personally I like the analog
round<00:04:31.290> gauge<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.740> lot<00:04:31.889> better<00:04:32.040> than<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
round gauge is a lot better than the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.879 
round gauge is a lot better than the
digital<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.150> think<00:04:34.050> it's<00:04:34.169> just<00:04:34.320> more<00:04:34.560> fun<00:04:34.590> to

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
digital I think it's just more fun to

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.010 
digital I think it's just more fun to
watch
