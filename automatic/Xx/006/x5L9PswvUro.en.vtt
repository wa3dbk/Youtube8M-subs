we<00:02:16.700> got<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> fair<00:02:17.120> result

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.849 

the<00:02:25.609> predicted<00:02:26.180> second<00:02:26.659> half<00:02:26.810> onslaught<00:02:27.319> came

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
the predicted second half onslaught came

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:37.080 
the predicted second half onslaught came
to<00:02:28.040> pass

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.540 

an<00:02:38.090> early<00:02:38.540> penalty<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.680> deficit<00:02:40.159> haft

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.890 

rain<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.819> wind<00:02:46.000> meant<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.599> whittlin

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
rain and wind meant that the whittlin

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.960 
rain and wind meant that the whittlin
pack<00:02:47.110> would<00:02:47.349> bat<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.769> away<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.190> hopefully<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
pack would bat it away and hopefully the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.420 
pack would bat it away and hopefully the
defense<00:02:49.000> would<00:02:49.510> break<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.980> took<00:02:51.099> a<00:02:51.159> drop

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
defense would break and it took a drop

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:05.410 
defense would break and it took a drop
goal<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:52.150> even<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.629> scores

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.000

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
one more mistake and the visitors would

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.010 
one more mistake and the visitors would
go<00:03:08.160> ahead<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:11.490> infringement<00:03:11.940> close<00:03:12.840> to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
those half and we had to go with the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.220 
those half and we had to go with the
elements<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:32.900> then<00:03:32.989> second<00:03:33.440> half<00:03:33.560> these

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
elements and then second half these

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.180

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
conditions were horrendous

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.370 
conditions were horrendous
you<00:03:37.580> like<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.849> decide<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.630> keep<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.959> 6<00:03:39.170> nil

you like to decide to keep it to 6 nil

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.290 
you like to decide to keep it to 6 nil
at<00:03:39.500> halftime<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:40.220> think<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:40.940> made<00:03:41.180> the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
at halftime I think that made the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.699 
at halftime I think that made the
difference<00:03:41.420> because<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:42.019> managed<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.349> battle

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
difference because we managed to battle

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.440 
difference because we managed to battle
it<00:03:42.800> out<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.040> second<00:03:43.459> half<00:03:43.640> everybody<00:03:44.330> was

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
it out the second half everybody was

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.250 
it out the second half everybody was
freezing<00:03:44.660> cold

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
freezing cold

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.199 
freezing cold
yeah<00:03:45.440> but<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.160> thought<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.459> was<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.580> sensational

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
yeah but I thought it was a sensational

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.850 
yeah but I thought it was a sensational
drop<00:03:47.450> goal<00:03:47.690> which<00:03:47.900> came<00:03:48.170> from<00:03:48.290> nowhere

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
drop goal which came from nowhere

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.580 
drop goal which came from nowhere
yeah<00:03:49.040> just<00:03:49.730> sorted<00:03:50.060> all<00:03:50.150> out<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:50.630> yeah<00:03:51.349> but<00:03:51.530> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
yeah just sorted all out so yeah but the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.140 
yeah just sorted all out so yeah but the
puck<00:03:51.769> limper<00:03:52.069> forward<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.760> never<00:03:52.880> come<00:03:53.120> to

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
puck limper forward so you never come to

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.089 
puck limper forward so you never come to
Tempe<00:03:53.599> if<00:03:53.750> they<00:03:53.989> go<00:03:54.500> away<00:03:54.620> easily

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
Tempe if they go away easily

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.710 
Tempe if they go away easily
so<00:03:55.370> where<00:03:55.549> is<00:03:55.670> these<00:03:55.849> lots<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.269> look<00:03:56.450> forward

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
so where is these lots of look forward
