variations<00:00:08.250> out<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> Italian<00:00:09.210> game<00:00:09.420> also

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
variations out of the Italian game also

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.169 
variations out of the Italian game also
known<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> JUCO<00:00:10.679> piano<00:00:11.040> it's<00:00:11.820> actually

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
known as the JUCO piano it's actually

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.700 
known as the JUCO piano it's actually
not<00:00:12.300> an<00:00:12.480> opening<00:00:12.870> that's<00:00:12.960> preferred<00:00:13.440> by

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
not an opening that's preferred by

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
not an opening that's preferred by
grandmasters<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.120> considered

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
grandmasters because it's considered

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.200 
grandmasters because it's considered
somewhat<00:00:15.990> jarash<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> ideas<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.000> as

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
somewhat jarash and the ideas are not as

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.029 
somewhat jarash and the ideas are not as
deep<00:00:18.449> as<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.170> would<00:00:19.260> find<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.859> for

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
deep as what you would find and for

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
deep as what you would find and for
example<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.580> Queen's<00:00:20.820> Gambit<00:00:21.449> or<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.930> roy

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
example the Queen's Gambit or the roy

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.310 
example the Queen's Gambit or the roy
lopez<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> spanish<00:00:23.310> game<00:00:23.779> but<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
lopez or the spanish game but it's a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.870 
lopez or the spanish game but it's a
good<00:00:25.500> way<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.859> started<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.490> with

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
good way to get started I think with

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.820 
good way to get started I think with
very<00:00:27.119> straightforward<00:00:27.900> developing<00:00:28.439> move<00:00:28.619> so

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
very straightforward developing move so

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.999 
very straightforward developing move so
the<00:00:28.949> Italian<00:00:29.340> game<00:00:29.490> starts<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.060> E<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
the Italian game starts with E for and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.540 
the Italian game starts with E for and
if<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.160> opponent<00:00:32.640> responds<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.510> E<00:00:33.780> 5<00:00:34.550> you'd

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
if your opponent responds with E 5 you'd

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
if your opponent responds with E 5 you'd
proceed<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.329> what's<00:00:36.780> probably<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> most

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
proceed with what's probably the most

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.830 
proceed with what's probably the most
logical<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.430> expected<00:00:38.940> move<00:00:39.090> Knight<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> f3

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
logical and expected move Knight to f3

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.360 
logical and expected move Knight to f3
attacking<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> e5<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:42.600> let's<00:00:43.140> say<00:00:43.379> black

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
attacking the e5 on now let's say black

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
attacking the e5 on now let's say black
brings<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.840> Knight<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.500> c6<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.820> Italian

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
brings out this Knight to c6 the Italian

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
brings out this Knight to c6 the Italian
game<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> characterized<00:00:49.530> by<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.129> move<00:00:50.399> right

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
game is characterized by this move right

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930 
game is characterized by this move right
here<00:00:50.820> Bishop<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> c4<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.680> opposed<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.340> Bishop

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here Bishop to c4 as opposed to Bishop

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
here Bishop to c4 as opposed to Bishop
to<00:00:54.059> b5<00:00:54.510> which<00:00:54.809> would<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> Spanish<00:00:55.530> but

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
to b5 which would be the Spanish but

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
to b5 which would be the Spanish but
we're<00:00:56.430> looking<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> Italian<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.600> let's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
we're looking at the Italian so let's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.349 
we're looking at the Italian so let's
say<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.230> quickly<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> c4<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
say really quickly we go to c4 the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.510 
say really quickly we go to c4 the
opponent<00:01:01.109> goes<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.500> c5<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.309> best

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
opponent goes to c5 the best

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
opponent goes to c5 the best
continuation<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.510> c3<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> keep<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
continuation is c3 to try to keep the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.539 
continuation is c3 to try to keep the
initiative<00:01:06.080> other<00:01:07.080> moves<00:01:07.500> such<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.710> Knight<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
initiative other moves such as Knight to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.740 
initiative other moves such as Knight to
c3<00:01:09.380> castling<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.650> okay<00:01:11.250> d3<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.090> also<00:01:12.420> ok

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
c3 castling are also okay d3 is also ok

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.399 
c3 castling are also okay d3 is also ok
but<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> best<00:01:14.090> continuation<00:01:15.290> or<00:01:16.290> as

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
but this is the best continuation or as

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
but this is the best continuation or as
regarded<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.070> such<00:01:17.369> let's<00:01:18.090> say<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> have

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
regarded as such let's say you have

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.050 
regarded as such let's say you have
Knight<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> f6<00:01:19.040> attacking<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.220> pawn<00:01:20.460> now

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
Knight to f6 attacking this pawn now

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.600 
Knight to f6 attacking this pawn now
instead<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.600> d4<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.430> also

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
instead of going d4 which is also

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
instead of going d4 which is also
probably<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.360> good<00:01:24.540> maybe<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.990> best<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
probably a good maybe the best way to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
probably a good maybe the best way to
play<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.920> we're<00:01:26.400> gonna<00:01:26.490> look<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> modest

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
play it we're gonna look at this modest

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.069 
play it we're gonna look at this modest
continuation<00:01:28.560> d3<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:30.650> black<00:01:31.650> castles<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
continuation d3 now black castles and

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.359 
continuation d3 now black castles and
white<00:01:34.079> immediately<00:01:34.409> jumps<00:01:35.070> into<00:01:35.220> his

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
white immediately jumps into his

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.980 
white immediately jumps into his
territory<00:01:35.640> looking<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.540> trouble

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
territory looking for trouble

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.800 
territory looking for trouble
so<00:01:37.759> black<00:01:38.759> doesn't<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.600> white

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so black doesn't really know what white

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
so black doesn't really know what white
is<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.650> he<00:01:40.710> goes<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.070> kick<00:01:41.280> him<00:01:41.490> with

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
is up to but he goes to kick him with

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
is up to but he goes to kick him with
the<00:01:41.759> h6<00:01:42.270> pawn<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.409> allows<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.100> nice

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the h6 pawn and this allows for a nice

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.819 
the h6 pawn and this allows for a nice
little<00:01:44.579> sacrifice<00:01:45.329> play<00:01:45.979> with<00:01:46.979> h4<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.270> black

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
little sacrifice play with h4 so black

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.660 
little sacrifice play with h4 so black
snaps<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> knight<00:01:50.750> H<00:01:51.750> takes<00:01:52.229> G<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.189> we

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
snaps the knight H takes G and now we

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
snaps the knight H takes G and now we
have<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.970> beautiful<00:01:54.659> open<00:01:54.899> file<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.770> our

move to stop made in one

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.690 
move to stop made in one
which<00:02:07.909> is<00:02:08.119> bringing<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.750> rook<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.890> e8<00:02:10.069> giving

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
which is bringing the rook to e8 giving

which is bringing the rook to e8 giving
the<00:02:10.789> King<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.090> little<00:02:11.330> bit<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.569> space<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.980> escape

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the King a little bit of space to escape

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.580 
the King a little bit of space to escape
but<00:02:13.940> rather<00:02:14.270> than<00:02:14.510> going<00:02:14.780> clean<00:02:15.080> takes<00:02:15.440> a

sacrifice rook takes h7 the King has to
take<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.660> rook<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.440> Queen<00:02:27.830> just

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
cutting off the g8 square so that's a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.250 
cutting off the g8 square so that's a
miniature<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:35.030> played<00:02:35.270> by<00:02:35.480> Greco<00:02:35.989> maybe

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
miniature that was played by Greco maybe

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.990 
miniature that was played by Greco maybe
the<00:02:36.440> first<00:02:36.590> genius<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.340> chess<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:37.850> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
the first genius of chess but it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.420 
the first genius of chess but it
illustrates<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.750> lot<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.380> good<00:02:39.530> ideas<00:02:39.709> like<00:02:40.310> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
illustrates a lot of good ideas like the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.120 
illustrates a lot of good ideas like the
use<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.970> sacrifice<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.200> open<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.620> file

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
use of a sacrifice to open a file

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.780 
use of a sacrifice to open a file
it<00:02:43.940> also<00:02:44.090> shows<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.840> exchange<00:02:45.790> trading

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
it also shows in the exchange trading

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.100 
it also shows in the exchange trading
material<00:02:47.350> for<00:02:48.610> time<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.970> space<00:02:50.360> because<00:02:50.989> it's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
material for time and space because it's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.199 
material for time and space because it's
one<00:02:51.320> unit<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.739> time<00:02:51.769> when<00:02:52.370> black<00:02:52.610> retreats<00:02:52.940> his

one unit of time when black retreats his

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.020 
one unit of time when black retreats his
night<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.630> h7<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:55.160> more<00:02:55.640> than<00:02:55.760> anything

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
night to h7 and it's more than anything

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.449 
night to h7 and it's more than anything
space<00:02:56.780> for<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.260> rook<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.830> dominate<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
space for that rook to dominate the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.580 
space for that rook to dominate the
h-file<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.239> once<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.570> Queen<00:02:59.750> joins<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.380> rook

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
h-file so once the Queen joins the rook

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.340 
h-file so once the Queen joins the rook
on<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.830> h-file<00:03:01.280> black<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.970> hopeless<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.170> that

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
on the h-file black is hopeless so that

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.990 
on the h-file black is hopeless so that
was<00:03:03.500> just<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.739> quick<00:03:03.920> look<00:03:04.250> at<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.489> Italian

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
was just a quick look at the Italian

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.750 
was just a quick look at the Italian
game<00:03:05.239> or<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.080> JUCO<00:03:06.440> piano<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.010> recommend<00:03:07.640> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
game or the JUCO piano I recommend it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.190 
game or the JUCO piano I recommend it
for<00:03:07.940> young<00:03:08.120> players<00:03:08.330> it's<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.780> great<00:03:09.019> way<00:03:09.170> to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
for young players it's a great way to

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.670 
for young players it's a great way to
get<00:03:09.440> your<00:03:09.620> chess<00:03:09.860> game<00:03:10.069> started
