00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.120
 Hi, I am Amy from Synology. 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.740
 Today I will introduce you to Photo Station, a web-based application. 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.460
 The app has been designed to manage and view photos stored on your Synology NAS over the Internet. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.220
 With its sophisticated and user-friendly interface, Photo Station lets you upload, with just a few clicks. 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.900
 Browse, manage, and share your albums. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.120
 In this video, we'll show you how to create an album, upload photos from your Synology NAS, or your computer. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.220
 And browse and organize photos in Photo Station. 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.240
 First, go to the Suite Center and verify that the Photo Station Suite is installed. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.020
 When Photo Station is launched, a new tab will open for Photo Station outside of DSM. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.740
 Here you can upload and manage all your photos and albums. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.820
 To easily access your albums later, 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.440
 It is highly recommended that you enable the QuickConnect service. 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.230
 Whether you are at home or on the go, QuickConnect gives you a custom ID 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.230
 Access Synology NAS and Photo Station over the Internet 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.190
 There is no trouble with setting up complex network configurations such as port forwarding rules. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 Here are a few ways to upload photos to Photo Station. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280
 The first method is through the Photo Station interface. 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.720
 We don't have any photos or albums yet, so I'm going to click Add to create a new album for my photo. 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.560
 I want to upload, so go to the drop down menu and select "Create Folder". 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.040
 I want to create an album for the photos I took recently with my friend Sean on my trip to Europe. 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.720
 So name the album "Europe" and add a description. 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.260
 Now you can set the permissions for the album. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.360
 Public albums let anyone with this link view your album. 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.580
 Private albums are not viewable by anyone unless you grant user rights. 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.360
 You can also set a password to protect your album, which means you want to browse this album. 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.680
 Viewers must first enter the password you have previously configured. 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 I want to create a public album and click on "Permission Settings" to further fine-tune my permissions. 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.640
 As you can see, the default setting for Public Albums allows all users to browse this album. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.480
 I want to allow my friend "Sean" to upload and provide photos to this album. 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.019
 So I check the box next to the upload bar and click "OK" to save the settings. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.700
 Now I can upload photos to the "Europe" album. 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.600
 I have two ways to upload photos to this album. 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.500
 First, I want to upload some photos from the DiskStation. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.140
 Below are a few photos from May that have been organized and placed on a folder on your Synology NAS. 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 I chose to upload the photo and click "OK". 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.280
 Waiting for the photo to upload. 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.100
 I still have some photos on my computer that I have not uploaded to my Synology NAS. 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.880
 I want to add it to an album in Photo Station. 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.860
 This time, I will select "Your Computer" and select photos from my File Explorer. 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.110
 Another way to upload photos to Photo Station is to use Photo Station Uploader. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.880
 Go to Synology's Download Center and Utilities and find Photo Station Uploader 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040
 And download the installation files for your operating system. 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.010
 We recommend using Photo Station Uploader to upload photos. 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.490
 Because a thumbnail of the photo will be generated during the upload process. 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.620
 Upload photos via Photo Station Uploader 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960
 The computing power of the computer can be utilized to speed up the conversion. 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.940
 Start it after the installation is complete. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.849
 I will click on "Create Profile" and enter the new profile 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.589
 The target's Synology NAS server name/IP address. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.600
 The provided server information and user account information will be saved to this configuration file for future use. 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.800
 You can set up multiple profiles based on different rules or destinations. 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.860
 The next time you use Photo Station Uploader, you don't need to fill in the server information again. 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.180
 Just select an existing profile 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 And upload photos to the same destination using the settings they have previously set. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.340
 Choose whether you want to upload the file to Photo Station or to Personal Photo Station. 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.600
 But now, I will only upload to Photo Station. 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.260
 I will enter the user certificate information for the Synology NAS. 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.640
 Once the profile is created, I can use it to upload a new folder to Photo Station. 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.040
 I will click "Browse" to select the folder to upload. 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.420
 Here, I want to keep the default settings and click Next. 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.100
 Wait for the album to upload. 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.900
 After the upload is complete, I can see the folder "Taiwan" under "Photo Album" in Photo Station. 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.140
 Or, just right click on any photo you want to upload. 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.500
 And use the existing or new profile to select "Upload to Photo Station". 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.840
 As you can see, all the photos have now been successfully uploaded and displayed in Photo Station. 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.460
 I can browse and organize all uploaded photos in Photo Station. 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.000
 For example, I can right click on an album by editing its properties. 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.440
 Or set the album cover to fine-tune the settings of the album. 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.840
 In the album, I can view photos using different thumbnail sizes or view modes. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.340
 You can also right click on any photo to make changes to suit my needs. 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.180
 Such as rotating a photo, editing a label, or adding it to a shared album. 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.140
 As you can see, Photo Station incorporates rich and easy-to-use features. 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.520
 So uploading and organizing photos has become quite easy and fast. 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.140
 Photo Station offers many other ways to record and share great moments with others. 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.580
 Make sure you don't lose any precious moments. 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.000
