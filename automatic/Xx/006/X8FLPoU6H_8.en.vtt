like I said it's an SUV it's a four by

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.750 
like I said it's an SUV it's a four by
four<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.890> kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.189> looks<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.729> we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
four it kind of looks like what we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
four it kind of looks like what we
already<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.360> GTA<00:01:06.810> 5<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> moment

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
already have in GTA 5 at the moment

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
already have in GTA 5 at the moment
which<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> baller<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.460> guess<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> could

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
which is the baller I guess you could

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
which is the baller I guess you could
say<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.270> similar<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.260> Land<00:01:10.530> Rover<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.400> if

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
say it's similar to the Land Rover so if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
say it's similar to the Land Rover so if
you<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> coding<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.840> GTA<00:01:13.260> 5

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you actually go into the coding of GTA 5

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
you actually go into the coding of GTA 5
even<00:01:13.950> further<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.119> actually

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
even further what we can now actually

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
even further what we can now actually
find<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.080> some<00:01:16.409> images<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> guess<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> could

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
find is some images or I guess you could

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.670 
find is some images or I guess you could
save<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> body<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> customization<00:01:19.320> parts

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
save the body or the customization parts

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
save the body or the customization parts
of<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:20.400> three<00:01:20.729> different<00:01:21.180> DLC<00:01:21.750> cars<00:01:22.080> that

finally we've got the one for the
zentorno<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.480> looks<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
zentorno and this looks like the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.140 
zentorno and this looks like the
sportiest<00:02:19.680> car<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.460> lot<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.940> ask

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
sportiest car out of the lot if you ask

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.510 
sportiest car out of the lot if you ask
me<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.810> looks<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.680> car<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.100> gonna<00:02:23.280> be

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
me this looks like this car is gonna be

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.760 
me this looks like this car is gonna be
something<00:02:23.850> similar<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.570> Lamborghini<00:02:25.140> so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
something similar to the Lamborghini so

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.200 
something similar to the Lamborghini so
that's<00:02:26.010> all<00:02:26.220> three<00:02:26.490> cars<00:02:26.700> which<00:02:26.970> hopefully

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
that's all three cars which hopefully

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.060 
that's all three cars which hopefully
will<00:02:27.540> be<00:02:27.600> added<00:02:28.020> very<00:02:28.260> very<00:02:28.500> soon<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.890> only

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
will be added very very soon we only

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.370 
will be added very very soon we only
recently<00:02:29.430> got<00:02:29.910> some<00:02:29.940> brand-new<00:02:30.330> business<00:02:30.690> DLC

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
recently got some brand-new business DLC

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.110 
recently got some brand-new business DLC
so<00:02:31.590> I'm<00:02:31.830> guessing<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.460> will<00:02:32.550> come<00:02:32.730> around<00:02:32.850> in

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so I'm guessing this will come around in

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.990 
so I'm guessing this will come around in
about<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.330> month<00:02:33.690> maybe<00:02:33.960> march<00:02:34.860> april<00:02:35.340> i<00:02:35.910> think
