00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.709
 good afternoon cheeks addicted after 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.580
 a lot of searching for half a cent is 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:20.310
 perfect we have decided to try the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.660
 device of the play tv device for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.800
 connect to the play and be able to see the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.520
 television broadcasts of the tdt power 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.920
 Record 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.580
 see a channel you can record another same 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.740
 time and here we show you how you see 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.780
 the menu's we are dealing with 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.480
 command of the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 from the play3 of the shock 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.030
 It is quite comfortable to handle 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:00.680
 if we click here on live television and 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.600
 then channels to hd channels we can 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.900
 change none 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.550
 with the command 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.930
 because you stay with the pinion 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.940
 we can have them in the high guadalquivir 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.690
 and in Malaga if the presence of 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.690
 winds can not finish 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.100
 as you can see the epe is quite complete 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.260
 compared to other tuners we 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.800
 a bar appears indicating the time in 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.320
 what we are 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.200
 right now and all the programs that 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.110
 We can see different different 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.040
 chains if we wanted to record something 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.040
 schedule a recording 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.280
 we would simply look for the program 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.020
 we want to record 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.530
 medically the pharmaceutical consultant 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 you have streets on your feet the treatment 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.869
 torsion for example 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.780
 this same one we simply click here 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.850
 in the recording kingno 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.220
 click on record what we have 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.240
 seemed quite interesting is that we 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.380
 allows you to start recording on time and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.230
 be able to choose the minutes we want 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.940
 that starts before 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.150
 the same also at the time of finishing the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.970
 recording can be on time or we can 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.200
 schedule a few minutes after 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.270
 delay the repetition in case 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.770
 the relationships and always the same time or 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.170
 never 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.860
 if we click on record it warns us that the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.320
 recording remains confirmed 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.390
 and that in principle you can record while 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.500
 we are playing what we see movies but 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.070
 could affect the quality of 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.840
 recordings 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.320
 we are up here and the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.780
 programming with a few minutes before and a 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.240
 after 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.750
 problems and while we are going to continue 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.750
 seeing buildings that we're seeing that 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.910
 we went out 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.540
 we see that we have the guide here too 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.510
 where we can choose 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.710
 the recording that we want to do or see 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.300
 what are we going to 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.460
 what are you going to program in 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.010
 different schedules 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.100
 it's pretty fast and as you can see it appears 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.460
 the holy information of the pgr quite 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.460
 comfortable 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.970
 we go back search and record 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.440
 we can make a manual relationship search 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.440
 by for the keyword 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.110
 in settings to update 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.579
 while playing own programs 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.579
 sound subtitles 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.510
 the library that if we have any 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.870
 recording in this case we have not done 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.870
 any 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.680
 and here we have the programming that 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.600
 we just did here we could 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.020
 cancel the review what it is that 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.020
 we have 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:12.560
 in how you see can supply the average 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.690
 center with tdt for those who have 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.690
 that have ps3 of the play 3 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.759
 inside what we liked 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.560
 too much is that the playtv only has 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.789
 a television entry does not have 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.789
 output with what we would have to 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.050
 engineer it to get the signal 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.580
 to television 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.529
 if we also want to watch television with 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.449
 the tmt 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.839
 As you can see, the boat starts pretty 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.839
 Quick 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.139
 just to get used to the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.139
 I send 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.170
 what has been done 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.000
 technician thinks that I lie down and on Tuesday 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.520
 touch the bayern I am 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.710
 In addition, the training does not 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.870
 the past in Cantabria as it was in the 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.690
 good time what time will they meet 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.080
 in this next month of May it will be 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.259
 pedal against the elements here well 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.789
 and up here is the first this little 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.789
 He entered the use of cash for ps3
