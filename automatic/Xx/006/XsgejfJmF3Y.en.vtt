00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
today I'm shields did a great job put on
money<00:01:00.329> every<00:01:00.570> time<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> made<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> easy<00:01:01.440> but

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
protic because you have no idea what

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
protic because you have no idea what
they're<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.580> mean<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> know
