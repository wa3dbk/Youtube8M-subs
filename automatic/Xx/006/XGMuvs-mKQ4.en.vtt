00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
well lemme go here it shows like 15-30

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:35.500 
well lemme go here it shows like 15-30
and<00:00:18.170> over<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:21.480> numbers<00:00:21.900> come<00:00:22.350> on

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.490 

go<00:00:36.510> back<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.020> table<00:00:38.090> here<00:00:39.090> my<00:00:39.870> breasts

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
go back to the table here my breasts

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:52.220 
go back to the table here my breasts
reset<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.790> my<00:00:45.110> phone<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.550> ice<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.540> getting

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
reset on my phone and you ice is getting

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.660 
reset on my phone and you ice is getting
back<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.890> normal<00:00:53.070> level<00:00:54.769> yeah<00:00:55.769> that<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
back to normal level yeah that is the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
back to normal level yeah that is the
video<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.300> inspired<00:00:58.080> me<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.260> try<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> at

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
video that inspired me to try this at

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.979 
video that inspired me to try this at
home<00:00:59.040> this<00:01:00.030> experiment<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:01.829> stereo<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
home this experiment with my stereo that

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.540 
home this experiment with my stereo that
well<00:01:03.989> basically<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.680> Dara<00:01:05.009> picks<00:01:05.309> up

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
well basically this Dara picks up

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.070 
well basically this Dara picks up
radiation<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> works<00:01:06.960> but

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
radiation I don't know how it works but

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
radiation I don't know how it works but
it<00:01:07.229> got<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.520> device<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.789> something<00:01:09.149> inside<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it got a device or something inside of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
it got a device or something inside of
it<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.930> picks<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.560> radiation<00:01:11.039> so<00:01:11.789> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it that picks up the radiation so I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.389 
it that picks up the radiation so I
thought<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.390> let's<00:01:12.780> try<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.130> if

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
thought well let's try it out and see if

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:21.730 
thought well let's try it out and see if
maybe<00:01:16.550> aluminum<00:01:17.550> could<00:01:18.830> basically<00:01:20.149> stop<00:01:21.149> this

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
maybe aluminum could basically stop this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.020 
maybe aluminum could basically stop this
radiation<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:23.070> coming<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.520> from<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> phone

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
radiation from coming up from the phone

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.810 
radiation from coming up from the phone
so<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.720> got<00:01:25.440> an<00:01:25.560> experiment<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.369> i'm<00:01:26.550> going<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so I got an experiment here i'm going to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.430 
so I got an experiment here i'm going to
try<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.030> out<00:01:27.180> first<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.050> i'm<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.170> going

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
try it out first of all i'm just going

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.440 
try it out first of all i'm just going
to<00:01:28.470> show<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> how<00:01:28.800> it<00:01:28.979> works<00:01:29.039> normally<00:01:29.460> with

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to show you how it works normally with

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
to show you how it works normally with
the<00:01:30.570> phone<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.140> stereo<00:01:31.619> i'm<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.009> call

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the phone and stereo i'm going to call

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.919 
the phone and stereo i'm going to call
my<00:01:32.520> phone<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.970> i'm<00:01:33.179> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.539> put<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:33.750> close

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
my phone here i'm going to put it close

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.880 
my phone here i'm going to put it close
to<00:01:33.959> the<00:01:34.170> stereo<00:01:34.590> i'm<00:01:34.800> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> hear<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
to the stereo i'm going to hear it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:48.699 
to the stereo i'm going to hear it
listen<00:01:42.830> hear<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.660> yeah<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.099> the<00:01:47.130> phone

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
listen hear that yeah that is the phone

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.290 
listen hear that yeah that is the phone
you're<00:01:49.709> getting<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.099> call<00:01:50.340> receiving<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.090> call

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
you're getting a call receiving a call

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.740 
you're getting a call receiving a call
and<00:01:52.039> that<00:01:53.039> is<00:01:53.220> basically<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.849> radiation

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and that is basically the radiation

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
and that is basically the radiation
you're<00:01:55.110> hearing<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.849> I<00:01:56.880> got<00:01:57.179> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
you're hearing and so now I got this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.889 
you're hearing and so now I got this
aluminum<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.440> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.679> put<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.340> phone

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
aluminum I'm going to put on the phone

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.719 
aluminum I'm going to put on the phone
you're<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.349> difference<00:02:01.770> just

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you're going to see the difference just

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.330 
you're going to see the difference just
going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.940> put<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.270> camera<00:02:04.009> letter<00:02:05.009> put<00:02:05.250> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
going to put down camera letter put it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.270 
going to put down camera letter put it
like<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.759> fresh<00:02:06.690> piece<00:02:06.989> and<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.770> how<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
like that fresh piece and we go how to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.370 
like that fresh piece and we go how to
piece<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:11.330> steal<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.630> right<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
piece here to steal the right like that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.580 
piece here to steal the right like that
right<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:15.120> got<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.599> phone<00:02:15.780> sealed<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:18.590> i'm

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
right now I got the phone sealed and i'm

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.260 
right now I got the phone sealed and i'm
going<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.800> call<00:02:19.950> again

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.540 

and<00:02:24.750> put<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.080> close<00:02:25.320> as<00:02:25.890> before

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.860 

it's<00:02:33.210> calling<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.220> there's<00:02:35.220> nothing<00:02:35.870> yeah

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's calling but there's nothing yeah

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.670 
it's calling but there's nothing yeah
maybe<00:02:37.350> when<00:02:37.560> i<00:02:37.620> remove<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.430> see<00:02:42.680> see

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
maybe when i remove it like that see see

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.670 
maybe when i remove it like that see see
what<00:02:43.980> happens<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:49.260> difference<00:02:50.420> some<00:02:51.680> somehow

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
what happens the difference some somehow

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.580 
what happens the difference some somehow
this<00:02:53.040> aluminum<00:02:53.760> blocks<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.720> radiation<00:02:55.290> I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
this aluminum blocks the radiation I

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.970 
this aluminum blocks the radiation I
don't<00:02:55.800> know<00:02:55.860> what<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.250> does<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.410> yeah<00:02:58.410> that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
don't know what it does but yeah that

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.050 
don't know what it does but yeah that
was<00:02:59.340> basically<00:02:59.790> my<00:03:00.150> experiment<00:03:01.820> I'm<00:03:02.820> not<00:03:03.000> sure

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
was basically my experiment I'm not sure

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.390 
was basically my experiment I'm not sure
what<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> does<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:04.110> if<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.920> got<00:03:05.100> information

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
what it does but if you got information

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.860 
what it does but if you got information
comment<00:03:06.270> this<00:03:06.390> video<00:03:08.660> basically<00:03:09.660> what<00:03:09.840> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
comment this video basically what I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.280 
comment this video basically what I
wonders<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> solution<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.170> this

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
wonders is this like a solution to this

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.340 
wonders is this like a solution to this
problem<00:03:14.270> mobile<00:03:15.270> phone<00:03:15.540> radiation<00:03:15.870> problem

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
problem mobile phone radiation problem

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.580 
problem mobile phone radiation problem
or<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:18.020> mean<00:03:19.020> could<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.440> maybe<00:03:20.430> put<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.590> minyan

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
or I mean could you maybe put a minyan

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.870 
or I mean could you maybe put a minyan
piece<00:03:22.970> inside<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.360> or<00:03:25.640> maybe<00:03:26.640> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
piece inside of it or maybe the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.730 
piece inside of it or maybe the
manufactures<00:03:27.600> why<00:03:27.780> don't<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.260> think<00:03:28.320> about
