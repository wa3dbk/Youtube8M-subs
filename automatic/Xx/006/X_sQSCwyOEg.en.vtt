00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
related to equality LEDs also they've

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.359 
related to equality LEDs also they've
lasted<00:00:26.949> since<00:00:27.789> 2004<00:00:29.160> pretty<00:00:30.160> much

right nothing to do with these since
2004<00:00:40.600> one<00:00:41.600> man<00:00:41.810> broke<00:00:42.200> it's<00:00:42.590> been<00:00:42.830> fine<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:43.340> we

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
2004 one man broke it's been fine so we

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.300 
2004 one man broke it's been fine so we
decided<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:44.030> get<00:00:44.390> rid<00:00:44.450> of<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.780> neons<00:00:45.170> which<00:00:46.070> is

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
decided to get rid of the neons which is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.670 
decided to get rid of the neons which is
a<00:00:46.820> technology<00:00:47.420> that's<00:00:47.750> really<00:00:48.140> been<00:00:48.290> replaced

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
a technology that's really been replaced

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160 
a technology that's really been replaced
with<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.980> new<00:00:49.010> LEDs<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.690> seems<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:51.020> be<00:00:51.140> a

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
with the new LEDs and it seems to be a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.230 
with the new LEDs and it seems to be a
lot<00:00:51.320> better<00:00:51.610> they<00:00:52.610> were<00:00:52.730> showing<00:00:52.910> me<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
lot better they were showing me the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.940 
lot better they were showing me the
difference<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.720> them<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:54.200> replaced<00:00:54.860> the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
difference in them and we replaced the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.800 
difference in them and we replaced the
entire<00:00:55.130> setup<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:56.000> was<00:00:56.150> in<00:00:56.270> here<00:00:56.450> right<00:00:56.600> now

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
entire setup that was in here right now

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.060 
entire setup that was in here right now
with<00:00:57.680> with<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.640> LED<00:00:59.030> system<00:00:59.470> awesome<00:01:00.470> so

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
with with the LED system awesome so

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.160 
with with the LED system awesome so
you've<00:01:01.250> got<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.580> do<00:01:01.730> boogie<00:01:02.510> lights<00:01:02.690> cut<00:01:02.990> and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
you've got to do boogie lights cut and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.840 
you've got to do boogie lights cut and
click<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.410> ultimate<00:01:04.070> engine<00:01:04.250> kit<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.820> I

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
click the ultimate engine kit and I

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.450 
click the ultimate engine kit and I
think<00:01:05.059> we<00:01:05.180> did<00:01:05.330> your<00:01:05.510> saddlebags<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.560> I<00:01:06.980> did

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
think we did your saddlebags and I did

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.570 
think we did your saddlebags and I did
we<00:01:07.550> do<00:01:07.670> your<00:01:07.820> saddlebags<00:01:08.330> maybe<00:01:08.840> not<00:01:09.460> do<00:01:10.460> we

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
we do your saddlebags maybe not do we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.820 
we do your saddlebags maybe not do we
just<00:01:10.610> did<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.060> engine<00:01:11.210> great<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.530> now<00:01:12.560> you've

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
just did the engine great so now you've

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.410 
just did the engine great so now you've
got<00:01:12.979> all<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.280> new<00:01:13.400> technology<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.180> you're

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
got all the new technology and you're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.690 
got all the new technology and you're
looking<00:01:14.570> forward<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.229> another<00:01:15.670> nine<00:01:16.670> years
