Savannah made in North America it's

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.180 
Savannah made in North America it's
really<00:00:11.080> important<00:00:11.530> that<00:00:11.650> it's<00:00:11.830> made<00:00:12.010> of

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
really important that it's made of

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.820 
really important that it's made of
aluminum<00:00:12.940> because<00:00:13.090> we<00:00:13.990> want<00:00:14.200> it<00:00:14.320> to<00:00:14.440> be<00:00:14.590> to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
center of gravity is super low it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.010 
center of gravity is super low it's
lower<00:01:22.100> than<00:01:22.190> most<00:01:22.430> sports<00:01:22.580> class<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.300> that

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
lower than most sports class and that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.020 
lower than most sports class and that
means<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.830> when<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.130> when<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.580> brake<00:01:25.850> or

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
means that when you when you brake or

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.910 
means that when you when you brake or
accelerate<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.750> don't<00:01:26.930> have<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.649> dive

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
accelerate you don't have the the dive

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.740 
accelerate you don't have the the dive
or<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.970> know<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.360> feeling<00:01:29.600> of

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
or you know this is this feeling of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.840 
or you know this is this feeling of
diving<00:01:29.990> forward<00:01:30.380> or<00:01:30.649> falling<00:01:31.340> back<00:01:31.550> that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
diving forward or falling back that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.389 
diving forward or falling back that
you'd<00:01:31.970> normally<00:01:32.119> have<00:01:32.360> if<00:01:32.780> you've<00:01:33.170> got<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.619> big

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
you'd normally have if you've got a big

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.960 
you'd normally have if you've got a big
engine<00:01:35.320> above<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.500> axle<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.190> best<00:01:37.490> form<00:01:37.880> of

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
engine above the axle the best form of

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.279 
engine above the axle the best form of
safety<00:01:38.300> is<00:01:38.390> not<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.630> have<00:01:38.750> an<00:01:38.840> accident<00:01:39.080> in<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
safety is not to have an accident in the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.440 
safety is not to have an accident in the
first<00:01:39.470> place<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.550> have<00:01:40.759> incredible

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
first place and so to have incredible

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.270 
first place and so to have incredible
maneuverability<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.680> be<00:01:42.800> able<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.039> get<00:01:43.160> out

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
maneuverability and be able to get out

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.800 
maneuverability and be able to get out
of<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.430> way<00:01:43.550> of<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.729> accident<00:01:44.180> is<00:01:44.509> super

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
of the way of the accident is super

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.480 
of the way of the accident is super
important<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:45.350> because<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.070> have<00:01:46.220> that<00:01:46.310> low

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
important and because you have that low

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.859 
important and because you have that low
center<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.820> gravity<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.300> don't<00:01:47.509> have<00:01:47.690> this

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
center of gravity you don't have this

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.779 
center of gravity you don't have this
body<00:01:48.470> roll<00:01:48.710> issue<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.369> normally<00:01:49.460> have

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
body roll issue that you normally have

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.930 
body roll issue that you normally have
in<00:01:50.360> in<00:01:50.869> sedans<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:55.220> metric<00:01:55.520> it's<00:01:55.700> it's

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
in in sedans so on that metric it's it's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.660 
in in sedans so on that metric it's it's
really<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:57.020> situation<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.860> gasoline

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
really it's a situation that a gasoline

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.630 
really it's a situation that a gasoline
car<00:01:58.940> literally<00:01:59.270> can't<00:01:59.750> compete<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.640> and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
car literally can't compete on and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.910 
car literally can't compete on and
you'll<00:02:02.330> see<00:02:02.450> me<00:02:02.569> sort<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.780> kind<00:02:03.410> of<00:02:03.470> hopping<00:02:03.800> on

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
you'll see me sort of kind of hopping on

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.589 
you'll see me sort of kind of hopping on
this<00:02:04.039> difference<00:02:04.459> of<00:02:04.580> gasoline<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.179> electric

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
this difference of gasoline and electric

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.389 
this difference of gasoline and electric
what<00:02:06.349> we're<00:02:06.470> really<00:02:06.590> trying<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.979> show<00:02:07.039> here

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
what we're really trying to show here

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.080 
what we're really trying to show here
with<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.610> Model<00:02:07.849> S<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:09.099> an<00:02:10.099> electric<00:02:10.819> car

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
with the Model S is that an electric car

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.080 
with the Model S is that an electric car
is<00:02:11.330> not<00:02:11.770> it's<00:02:12.770> not<00:02:12.950> almost<00:02:13.220> as<00:02:13.640> good<00:02:13.819> as<00:02:14.060> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
is not it's not almost as good as a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.470 
is not it's not almost as good as a
gasoline<00:02:14.959> car<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.530> way<00:02:15.800> better<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.480> mean

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
gasoline car it's way better I mean

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.940 
gasoline car it's way better I mean
that's<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.110> thing<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.680> show<00:02:18.920> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
that's the thing that we have to show to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.559 
that's the thing that we have to show to
the<00:02:19.099> world<00:02:19.130> when<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.880> see<00:02:20.060> all<00:02:20.209> these<00:02:20.330> art
