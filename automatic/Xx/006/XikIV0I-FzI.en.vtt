fence<00:00:40.680> design<00:00:40.830> was<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.700> bad<00:00:42.120> design<00:00:42.830> everything

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
fence design was a bad design everything

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.250 
fence design was a bad design everything
is<00:00:44.070> tow<00:00:44.670> nailed<00:00:44.880> in<00:00:45.150> from<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.420> inside<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.960> now

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
is tow nailed in from the inside and now

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.360 
is tow nailed in from the inside and now
that<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> wood<00:00:46.650> is<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:46.890> shrinking<00:00:47.310> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that the wood is all shrinking and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
that the wood is all shrinking and
bowing<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> entire<00:00:48.180> fence<00:00:48.420> starting<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.810> pull

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
bowing the entire fence starting to pull

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.980 
bowing the entire fence starting to pull
apart<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.670> T<00:00:50.670> by<00:00:50.700> eight<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.150> actually<00:00:51.540> support

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
apart so T by eight is actually support

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.130 
apart so T by eight is actually support
to<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.850> Hope<00:00:54.000> tie<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> fence<00:00:54.570> together<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
to the Hope tie the fence together I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
to the Hope tie the fence together I
will<00:00:55.500> continue<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.400> tie<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.880> pins<00:00:57.090> together

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
will continue to tie the pins together

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.680 
will continue to tie the pins together
more<00:00:57.600> after<00:00:58.430> after<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> storm<00:00:59.850> we're<00:01:00.660> going

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
more after after the storm we're going

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.790 
more after after the storm we're going
to<00:01:00.810> try<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.200> much<00:01:01.320> done<00:01:01.470> as<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.620> can

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
to try to get as much done as we can

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
to try to get as much done as we can
today<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.310> think<00:01:02.850> we'll<00:01:03.060> at<00:01:03.180> least<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.540> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
today I think we'll at least get to the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.870 
today I think we'll at least get to the
second<00:01:04.140> two<00:01:04.619> by<00:01:04.799> eight<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.579> we'll<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.820> at

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
second two by eight here so we'll get at

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
second two by eight here so we'll get at
least<00:01:06.030> sixteen<00:01:06.800> nearly<00:01:07.800> sixteen<00:01:08.190> feet<00:01:08.400> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
least sixteen nearly sixteen feet in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.800 
least sixteen nearly sixteen feet in
because<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> first<00:01:09.390> hole<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.630> you're<00:01:09.720> going

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
because the first hole if you're going

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
because the first hole if you're going
to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:09.990> easy<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.400> four<00:01:12.000> ND

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
to be easy we're going to do four ND

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.730 
to be easy we're going to do four ND
three<00:01:12.390> feet<00:01:12.570> wide<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:13.440> we're<00:01:13.530> gonna<00:01:13.620> do

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
three feet wide then we're gonna do

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
three feet wide then we're gonna do
three<00:01:13.950> feet<00:01:14.210> we<00:01:15.210> might<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> move<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.870> two

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
three feet we might have to move the two

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.450 
three feet we might have to move the two
feet<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.350> top<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.740> 100%<00:01:17.130> sure<00:01:17.340> yet

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
feet at the top I'm not 100% sure yet

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.560 
feet at the top I'm not 100% sure yet
I'll<00:01:17.700> measure<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.120> I'm<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.360> start

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
I'll measure it but I'm going to start

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.230 
I'll measure it but I'm going to start
with<00:01:18.690> three<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> bottom<00:01:19.440> here<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.240> then

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
with three at the bottom here and then

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.530 
with three at the bottom here and then
go<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:21.960> long<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.260> can<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.370> I<00:01:23.670> don't

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
go as long as you can and then I don't

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.750 
go as long as you can and then I don't
have<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.780> stepped<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.440> we<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> hill

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
have to be stepped as we go up the hill

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.690 
have to be stepped as we go up the hill
so<00:01:27.510> it's<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.530> made<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.950> cedar<00:01:29.370> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so it's going to be made out of cedar so

this<00:02:03.810> post<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:05.250> other<00:02:05.369> direction<00:02:05.700> we're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
this post the other direction we're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.539 
this post the other direction we're
going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.720> this<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.399> said

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
going to have it this way so like I said

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.820 
going to have it this way so like I said
we<00:02:08.640> lose<00:02:08.789> lose<00:02:09.659> two<00:02:09.810> inches<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.200> space<00:02:10.439> but

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
we lose lose two inches of space but

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.570 
we lose lose two inches of space but
we'll<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.459> able<00:02:11.579> to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
we'll be able to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.170 
we'll be able to
for<00:02:13.090> everything<00:02:13.510> from<00:02:14.550> from<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.730> backyard

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
for everything from from the backyard

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.090 
for everything from from the backyard
side<00:02:16.420> instead<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.930> trying<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.380> build<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> as

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
side instead of trying to build it as

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.090 
side instead of trying to build it as
two<00:02:18.220> pieces<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.910> fit<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.240> all<00:02:19.270> together<00:02:19.420> later

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
two pieces and fit it all together later

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.840 
two pieces and fit it all together later
so<00:02:21.100> looks<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.280> we're<00:02:21.430> going<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.760> go

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
so looks like we're going to have to go

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.630 
so looks like we're going to have to go
up<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.060> foot<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> next<00:02:23.800> set<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> inclines

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.790 

okay<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.730> looks<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.470> we're<00:02:29.470> going<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.620> have

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
okay it looks like we're going to have

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.400 
okay it looks like we're going to have
