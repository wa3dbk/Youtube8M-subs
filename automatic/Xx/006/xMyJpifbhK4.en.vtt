00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.910
 there were all welcome back to my 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.050
 I bring you a video of the great 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.390
 tourism 5 I'm going to show you a video with 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.250
 the ten most expensive standard cars that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.930
 in the game and it went up a while 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.600
 video with the most expensive premium cars 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.100
 I'm going to put the 10 cars that are 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 more expensive standard I have already put here 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:51.720
 in favorite the first car is the car 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.720
 monkey 10 list is 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.850
 the jaguar xj r 9m you see cardel 88 it 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.430
 would be ranked number 10 with a 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.530
 price of 4 million 572 thousand 160 I say 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.729
 this price because when 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.680
 when I started buying cars I looked 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.150
 on the internet and I got off a list with 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.860
 all the cars what each car is worth 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.509
 then I rely on that list that does not 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.759
 come down at the time they have not gone up 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.500
 price have dropped for example the formula 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.159
 Granturismo is right now in the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.009
 dealer to buy at 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.399
 collectors to 5 million and it 's 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:37.479
 hiding what I understand cost me or 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:39.750
 4,819,000 100 would be the second car of 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.330
 the list at number 9 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.280
 of the most expensive cars I have if it is 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.080
 fairly good 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.160
 in this car is to compete against 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.420
 other cars that are just like him 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.940
 because if you choose this that is a career 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.820
 with normal street cars 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.530
 obviously there is no color and it is very 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.690
 difficult to carry especially if it is a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.590
 circuit with a lot of curve is very difficult 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:06.810
 it's good the number 3 corresponds to the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.220
 lancia stratos radical of 77 and worth 4 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.430
 million 945 thousand 100 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.420
 this car is very good car for 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.250
 circuits of land and snow is a 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.880
 basically rally car but it was a 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.300
 very good car to run in rallies 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.560
 and I do not know why it's so expensive when there 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.480
 other rally cars that are also 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.819
 good and are much cheaper than 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.430
 this but good 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.359
 the price puts the game I do not suppose 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.909
 since it is what is there is the third one by 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.739
 the tail as you saw about 10 and which 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.829
 number 29 which is the formulated tourism 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:50.200
 number 8 that in lancia stratos the number 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:54.519
 7 is the Audi R8 Racems of 2009 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.489
 this car is worth 5 million 53 thousand 939 a 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.430
 little more than 5 million and the next 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.769
 in the list is the same car but with 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.629
 the sticker with would wait for playstation 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.530
 that is, it would be the same car the audi r8 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:13.719
 lms race car but playstation this 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.939
 worth 5 million 54 thousand 359 just about 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:18.909
 500 among projects more expensive than 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:21.219
 other is they are very very similar and for 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.419
 by having one of the two singles says 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.489
 that a compass me only one of the 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.169
 two would buy me this one because it comes with 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.370
 your playstation sticker with the number 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.760
 five 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.660
 nothing is cooler 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:39.030
 the next on the list that would be 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:43.080
 After the Audi Sauber Mercedes C9 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.080
 rijkaard of 89 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.260
 if you realize that the average of 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.329
 cars that are here that are expensive 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.099
 standard cars there are many that are 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.720
 barquetas are cars that have motorcycles 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.780
 centers that serve to run the 24 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.780
 from alemany basically this one of them 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.890
 you have more than one thousand thousand horses 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.780
 power and it's worth five million 167 thousand 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.640
 699 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.470
 This car is easy to handle when a 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.530
 circuit with a lot of straight and with many 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.880
 speeds when you are with a circuit 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.160
 very twisted that has many curves very 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.290
 just as it is very very complicated to 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.550
 take the next one from the east of 20 and 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.850
 spiritual racecar of 2003 and in the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.530
 number 4 and is 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.320
 5 million 534 thousand 605 the price that 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.910
 has this car among more than 1,000 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.310
 horses and color is handsome grace 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.640
 we arrived with the podium with the three 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.070
 more expensive cars from standars and me 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.630
 I always say that the most expensive I mean 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.880
 standard because there is another video I 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.880
 previously uploaded with 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.520
 the premium cars and the number three of the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.490
 podium is the chaparral 2 the race car 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.810
 67 car that looks like a car 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.020
 super super spy agent 007 is 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:12.170
 quite handsome this car is very small 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.170
 it weighs very little 777 kilos 770 and 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.310
 8 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.760
 Well, this car is very good because that 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.680
 it has a huge power 400 and peak 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.300
 horses but despite it is not going very 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.730
 well on very twisty circuits like 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.770
 Monaco for example the next of the 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.690
 list number 2 podium medal 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.510
 silver for it to be the second car 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:37.770
 state of the game's most expensive 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.110
 the chaparral two jotas racecar of 70 with 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.700
 your piece of engine has back looks like a 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.780
 Spatial collar 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.740
 although I think I thought it was a refrigerator 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.919
 with wheels 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:55.919
 a refrigerator so square white 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:58.449
 that is worth 14 million 446 thousand 126 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.000
 this car is not the second car anymore 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:05.199
 expensive of the whole game in standard car 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.620
 and the number one the podium of the 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:11.949
 top of the whole is the ford gt40 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.280
 radical of 69 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.950
 this car is worth 19 million 829 thousand 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.540
 three hundred 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.969
 it is by far the clearest of all 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.989
 almost reached 20 million 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:31.919
 and it 's a car that is driving it because 

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:33.239
 it's going very well it 's very powerful and it's going to hit 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.539
 to the ground in basically but it's called 

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:39.679
 740 that is 40 inches off the ground and 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.899
 nothing here today's video with the 

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:45.240
 the top 10 of the most expensive cars that 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:50.960
 they are standard 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.960
 12 For we see in the next goodbye video
