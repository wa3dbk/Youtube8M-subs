00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
of branding for your channel and I think

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.080 
of branding for your channel and I think
on<00:01:03.939> the<00:01:04.390> lower<00:01:04.600> bottom<00:01:05.520> corner<00:01:06.520> here<00:01:06.909> you'll

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
on the lower bottom corner here you'll

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.050 
on the lower bottom corner here you'll
see<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.540> little<00:01:07.990> GS<00:01:08.439> logo<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.159> mine<00:01:09.340> that's<00:01:09.820> one

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
see a little GS logo of mine that's one

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.450 
see a little GS logo of mine that's one
thing<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.330> can<00:01:10.479> do<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.860> other<00:01:12.070> thing<00:01:12.220> is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
thing you can do and the other thing is

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.100 
thing you can do and the other thing is
you<00:01:12.490> can<00:01:12.700> do<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.270> think<00:01:13.330> is<00:01:13.780> even

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
you can do that that I think is even
