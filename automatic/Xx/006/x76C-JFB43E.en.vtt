thread your serger first we'll start
with<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.180> green<00:00:09.480> one<00:00:09.799> and<00:00:10.850> what<00:00:11.850> goes<00:00:12.030> through

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
with the green one and what goes through

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.169 
with the green one and what goes through
here<00:00:12.870> hold<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> switch<00:00:14.010> over<00:00:14.340> pull<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:14.970> down

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
here hold the switch over pull it down

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.030 
here hold the switch over pull it down
through<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> tension<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.110> as<00:00:16.500> we<00:00:16.650> go<00:00:16.770> there's

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
through the tension and as we go there's

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.429 
through the tension and as we go there's
numbers<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.880> colored<00:00:18.599> lines<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.170> follow

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
numbers and colored lines that we follow

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.819 
numbers and colored lines that we follow
they're<00:00:19.860> all<00:00:19.980> green<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.000> go<00:00:21.180> right<00:00:21.419> down

they're all green so go right down
there's<00:00:22.829> a<00:00:22.890> loop<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:24.800> green<00:00:25.800> dot<00:00:26.070> there<00:00:26.369> so

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
there's a loop here a green dot there so

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.790 
there's a loop here a green dot there so
we<00:00:26.790> take<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> through<00:00:27.329> you<00:00:28.320> bring<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.649> up

we take it through you bring it up
through<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.340> green<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.980> we're<00:00:31.980> gonna

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
through this green one and we're gonna

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.049 
through this green one and we're gonna
bring<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.610> right<00:00:34.160> here<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> upper<00:00:35.730> looper

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
bring it right here to the upper looper

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
bring it right here to the upper looper
dot<00:00:39.679> and<00:00:40.679> thread<00:00:40.949> it<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.280> through<00:00:41.519> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
dot and thread it right through that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.560 
dot and thread it right through that
little<00:00:41.910> hole<00:00:47.179> alright<00:00:48.179> and<00:00:48.300> we're<00:00:48.420> done<00:00:48.510> with

little hole alright and we're done with

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
little hole alright and we're done with
the<00:00:48.780> green<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.109> now<00:00:49.320> we'll<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the green one now we'll go up to the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.209 
the green one now we'll go up to the
blue<00:00:50.460> thread<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.559> always<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
blue thread and we always do it in the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.250 
blue thread and we always do it in the
same<00:00:53.429> order<00:00:53.640> again<00:00:54.390> we'll<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:54.719> through<00:00:55.019> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
same order again we'll go through the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.399 
same order again we'll go through the
plate<00:00:56.239> hold<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> switch<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.989> bring<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> down

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
plate hold the switch and bring it down

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.529 
plate hold the switch and bring it down
through<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:58.800> tension<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.879> we'll<00:01:00.089> follow<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
through the tension now we'll follow the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.060 
through the tension now we'll follow the
blue<00:01:00.749> lines<00:01:01.399> we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> blue<00:01:03.440> two<00:01:04.440> blue<00:01:04.470> dots

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
blue lines we have a blue two blue dots

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.969 
blue lines we have a blue two blue dots
here<00:01:07.400> up<00:01:08.400> through<00:01:08.759> here<00:01:09.530> now<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
here up through here now this is the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
here up through here now this is the
only<00:01:11.159> tricky<00:01:11.729> part<00:01:11.759> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.990> threading

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
only tricky part I think and threading

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.389 
only tricky part I think and threading
it<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.530> pull<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.640> switch<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.270> way<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:16.399> we

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
it we pull the switch all the way out we

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.990 
it we pull the switch all the way out we
need<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.579> catch<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
need to catch it in here so that this

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.370 
need to catch it in here so that this
switch<00:01:21.329> can<00:01:21.469> push<00:01:22.469> it<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.219> for<00:01:23.250> us

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
switch can push it right in there for us

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
switch can push it right in there for us
that's<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> only<00:01:26.219> tricky<00:01:26.549> part<00:01:26.659> I'm

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that's really the only tricky part I'm

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.050 
that's really the only tricky part I'm
gonna<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:28.079> the<00:01:28.320> end<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.799> thread<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.430> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
gonna take the end of my thread I just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.330 
gonna take the end of my thread I just
had<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> clip<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> end<00:01:30.750> off<00:01:31.130> because<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> was

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
had to clip the end off because it was

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.270 
had to clip the end off because it was
too<00:01:32.520> long<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.969> I'm<00:01:33.149> gonna<00:01:33.299> thread<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.780> through

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
too long and I'm gonna thread it through

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.260 
too long and I'm gonna thread it through
this<00:01:35.280> hole<00:01:35.640> right<00:01:36.000> here

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.300 

and<00:01:39.270> again<00:01:39.539> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> lower<00:01:40.229> looper<00:01:40.740> once

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and again this is the lower looper once

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
and again this is the lower looper once
we<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> through<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.149> just<00:01:42.360> bring<00:01:42.719> it<00:01:42.869> over

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
we get it through we just bring it over

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.039 
we get it through we just bring it over
with<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.469> thread<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.039> always<00:01:44.159> do

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
with our other thread like we always do

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.679 
with our other thread like we always do
so<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.969> what<00:01:47.969> I<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.359> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so now we go up what I like about the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.719 
so now we go up what I like about the
two<00:01:48.960> needle<00:01:49.320> threads<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.399> just

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
two needle threads is that they are just

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
two needle threads is that they are just
like<00:01:50.880> doing<00:01:51.180> our<00:01:51.299> sewing<00:01:51.659> machine<00:01:52.109> threading

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
like doing our sewing machine threading

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
like doing our sewing machine threading
it's<00:01:52.890> pretty<00:01:53.310> much<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> same<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.210> we've<00:01:54.570> got

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it's pretty much the same so we've got

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740 
it's pretty much the same so we've got
that<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.109> we<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.560> through<00:01:56.390> hold<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> switch

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that down we go through hold the switch

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.450 
that down we go through hold the switch
down<00:01:58.109> through<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> tension<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.159> time

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
down through the tension and this time

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
down through the tension and this time
our<00:01:59.670> lines<00:01:59.909> are<00:02:00.119> gonna<00:02:00.210> bring<00:02:01.140> us<00:02:01.289> over<00:02:01.409> here

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
our lines are gonna bring us over here

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.760 
our lines are gonna bring us over here
just<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> standard<00:02:02.520> sewing<00:02:02.909> machine<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just like a standard sewing machine and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.479 
just like a standard sewing machine and
down<00:02:05.009> through

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.119 

again<00:02:13.489> we<00:02:13.640> thread<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.480> through<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.810> needle

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
again we thread it through the needle

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.970 
again we thread it through the needle
most<00:02:16.209> searchers<00:02:17.209> do<00:02:17.450> come<00:02:17.780> with<00:02:18.080> tweezers<00:02:18.800> to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
most searchers do come with tweezers to

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.960 
most searchers do come with tweezers to
help<00:02:19.160> us<00:02:19.310> thread<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
help us thread it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.300
