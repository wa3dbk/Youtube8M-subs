00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
was no video game the hardware started

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
was no video game the hardware started
to<00:01:11.070> come<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.659> had<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.960> software

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to come out we we had to software

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.399 
to come out we we had to software
already<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.149> we<00:01:15.360> were<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.079> ahead<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
already and so we were kind of ahead of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
already and so we were kind of ahead of
everyone<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.719> the<00:01:19.590> new<00:01:20.030> hardware

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
everyone and then as as the new hardware

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.679 
everyone and then as as the new hardware
came<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.539> the<00:01:21.750> new<00:01:21.960> video<00:01:22.320> games<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.039> we<00:01:23.159> just

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
came out the new video games and we just

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.170 
came out the new video games and we just
adjusted<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> adapted<00:01:25.140> our<00:01:25.979> game<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.579> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
adjusted and adapted our game but the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.800 
adjusted and adapted our game but the
idea<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:28.280> always<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.549> make<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> same<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
