00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.559
 about glycoprivous slowly on 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.059
 about completely carb-free milking a little 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.920
 I can not say I am opposed to such 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.800
 cardinal methods and here 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.900
 low carbohydrate diet with carbon 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.570
 alternations are very interesting 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.430
 interesting powerful powerful tool then 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:36.059
 have I suggest this is an option 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.879
 This is a protein day when we make these 4 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.559
 up to 5 meals in the first 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.570
 eating food we have carbohydrates all the same 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.910
 present in a small volume from 20 to 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.230
 60 grams of carbohydrates no more than that is 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.320
 but not less than 20 and subsequent admissions 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 food is pure protein with protein 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 product and greens ie green salads 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.270
 maybe there is dressed with vegetable 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.820
 oiled on cold this these days 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.250
 there are no more than three in a row 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.009
 should alternate coals water days 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.750
 when we have the proportion of protein is minimal then 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.729
 eat less grams per kilogram of weight or 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.259
 absent altogether if it turns out 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.660
 pure carbohydrate days on difficult 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.560
 carbohydrates that is, it is some kind of pap 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.289
 same thing can 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.310
 You need to combine salads with products with 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.310
 high fiber 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.950
 with such a diet 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.820
 will be good enough to spend 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.549
 subcutaneous fat 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.880
 but this tool is powerful enough but 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.420
 psychologically heavy 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.340
 untrained person enough 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.590
 it will be hard going through these days 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.950
 so you can start alternating through 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.570
 day day protein day carbohydrate again 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.100
 it should all be combined with 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.369
 high enough motor level 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.270
 activity and high water consumption 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.640
 then it will be very, very 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.380
 effectively ie more detailed 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.789
 information can be obtained of course in 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.209
 individual order ie need 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.159
 understand 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:08.720
 semi weight age these are the criteria that 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.220
 need to know in order to give 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.410
 more specific recommendations and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.200
 recommendations for which they are now 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.470
 fairly generalized but already on their 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.150
 reason you can do some why 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.530
 try try I don't know what I want 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.269
 warn not bring yourself to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.250
 states of utter exhaustion 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.560
 that is, the body will simply start 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.670
 slow down the metabolism and and so neither 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.670
 what good will not come
