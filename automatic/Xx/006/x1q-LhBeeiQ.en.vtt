00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.700
 Ok I'm speaking on youtube keta. 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.530
 this problem it is much used but 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 especially for downloading videos on the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.000
 youtube and do video conversion is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 he really is enough for this 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.710

 it also has the option here to capture 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.299
 your computer screen 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.159

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.690
 Are you a professional to record? 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.819
 if the computer is not so professional 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.900
 If you really want a program 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.750
 complete 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.340
 I advise the fantasy studio is with 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.920
 How many studio albums are you going to have? 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.690
 several options is a specific program 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.610
 for this the screen recording 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.800
 then you will have a lot of legal function 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.690
 now if you just want to do 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.870
 an uncomplicated quiet lesson video 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.310
 is this program that you have to use 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.430
 some in practice then you will click 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.500
 here and restless and will appear in the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.790
 small screen here you what you need 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.970
 do the first thing you need 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.200
 do is draw area you want to wash 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.630
 It will be there that you will 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.040
 already for the function for you I 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.260
 I do not particularly like to show 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.480
 in the upper part here in this part of 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.849
 low is then I 'll really like 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.690
 to show only the part of the screen 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.640
 the schedule you click here you go 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.299
 Come down and you'll only be as far as you 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.420
 want my case and here was 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.310
 ready now you will have a 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.840
 Basic configuration 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.959
 Calm down, let's talk to this 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.170
 passage here I like to enable early 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.329
 delayed because both because it will have a 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.310
 treat 15 seconds or so to 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.440
 To start the video, I'll have it. 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.870
 a good time to prepare 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.519
 the video will become more professional not 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.870
 you do not want to stop marking 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.730
 dutta the video will start 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.670
 immediately then there it goes says I like it 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.420
 because they know that here I can enable 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.609
 also perform at the beginning because it is so 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.859
 the video start it automatically 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.810
 will minimize your skin so you do not 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.790
 I need half of the video I came here open 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.690
 it minimizes we will do it 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.889
 automatically 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.000
 so it 's a function that I also think 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:01.329
 cool good this option you have to 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.090
 believe that is the record cursor why 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.859
 this option if you do not military 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.319
 the mouse pointer will not appear in the 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.299
 recording is then mainly 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.010
 You're making a video lesson. It 's very 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.109
 interesting that you have a mouse that 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.440
 appearing then check the option 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:20.049
 cursor and last for 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.320
 finalize the selection setup 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.570
 from here and use hotkeys 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.210
 You have to do is falling short. 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.600
 rockets already looked like the 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.300
 Ok, then it's again I'll tell you 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.190
 You do not have to open this line to attack. 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.660
 using the to on video will be one of the 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.510
 shortcut keys then is very 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.050
 interesting this then f7 to start 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.810
 and pause and f8 prepare the team 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.900
 another fundamental thing of this program 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.250
 it does not render the videos at the end 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.570
 so if it's a horrible computer 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.740
 walking slow 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.420
 You're not going to have to wait for a 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.370
 day to render the video is 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.410
 from the moment you stop the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.410
 recording the video will be generated 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.720
 automatically is not fast you can 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.180
 click on it watch and send for everything 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.060
 Fast simple since then that 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.920
 program really is fabulous 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.930
 so everything set up a taboo knows that it is 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.310
 Very easy, very easy, I'll tell you. 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.230
 show in practice now I'm going to make a 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.840
 Quick recording for you to see how 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.060
 It's fast how easy it is you click here 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.200
 then the offer of 71 portal r7 you will 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.330
 see you just 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.240
 Good down here to see that she is 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.230
 looking like leiria 3 2 1 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.710
 the recording has already begun then I calm down 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.810
 You make your video lesson here. 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.910
 Good, this is quiet, you'll see it here. 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.350
 It's flashing on top, it means it's 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.240
 recording're then you will 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.980
 quietly did your video lesson 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.380
 It works out the way you want it 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.240
 video class is 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.670
 When you finish your video lesson. 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.270
 you will tighten end 80 shortcut to 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.990
 stop 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.550
 It's okay then you press f8 is the recording 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.830
 it's already going to stop 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.750
 the video is generated automatically then it is 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.680
 very fast simple as well 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.960
 here once the video has already generated video you 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.100
 will do is click and will open the folder 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.560
 The video was uploaded, it's very easy. 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.220
 put my folder in 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.720
 Is that what the video is about Japina 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.850
 jaqson to indemnify in no way was 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.680
 automatically you can already 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.020
 watch you can send by youtube and 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.760
 very fast then is this theater program 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.160
 baquet is sensational 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.500
 I really like avoiding it will help. 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.110
 so you need to have a one machine 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.840
 performance champion any machine 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.060
 can rotate it does so with much 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.340
 civil facility that to configure it 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.200
 It's easy and it's not going to be difficult. 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.669
 no's there you'll make your 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.070
 cages's there 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.650
 I received many doubts there from 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.260
 people asking how to record a screen 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.780
 There you are so low, you're from 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.010

 continue later it's no longer 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.820
 important for me that I know is 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.830
 computed performance and any doubt 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.750
 If you are under the program this 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.880
 It is not working out something leaves
