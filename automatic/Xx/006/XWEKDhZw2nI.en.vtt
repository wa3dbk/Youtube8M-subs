really need one of two combined

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200 
really need one of two combined
multiples<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.680> these<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.059> that

this piece can connect here but it can

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.610 
this piece can connect here but it can
also<00:00:48.390> connect<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.289> keep

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
also connect up here so you can keep

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.119 
also connect up here so you can keep
adding<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.780> add<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.559> B<00:00:55.739> dama<00:00:55.949> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
a limit to these like five or six but

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.969 
a limit to these like five or six but
they<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> old<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.350> dama<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
part here is a little tricky to attach

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.760 
part here is a little tricky to attach
on<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.290> it's<00:01:10.290> very<00:01:10.380> solid

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
on but these two it and it's very solid

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.640 
on but these two it and it's very solid
all<00:01:11.250> together<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> good<00:01:13.110> magazine

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
why they have the spinning gimmick but

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.740 
why they have the spinning gimmick but
that<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.920> lag<00:01:32.400> time<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.420> could<00:01:33.570> be

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that is a lag time that you could be

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.920 
that is a lag time that you could be
firing<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> magazine<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:36.210> loads<00:01:36.689> in

firing with this magazine it loads in
the<00:01:37.020> zigzag<00:01:37.530> formation<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.180> does<00:01:39.450> not

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the zigzag formation so that it does not

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
the zigzag formation so that it does not
clog<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.439> even<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> wide<00:01:41.100> magazines

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have to shake it to get it going again

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.600 
have to shake it to get it going again
this<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.009> doesn't<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.909> problem<00:01:48.390> at<00:01:48.810> all

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
this it doesn't have that problem at all

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.770 
this it doesn't have that problem at all
now<00:01:50.610> let's<00:01:51.570> attach<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:53.520> b-daman<00:01:54.180> here

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
now let's attach this to a b-daman here

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.609 
now let's attach this to a b-daman here
we<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.530> sonic<00:01:56.189> device<00:01:57.110> catch<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.439> there

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
we have sonic device catch that on there

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
we have sonic device catch that on there
it's<00:01:59.070> also<00:01:59.159> worth<00:01:59.369> noting<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:00.079> want<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> mention

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it's also worth noting I want to mention

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.139 
it's also worth noting I want to mention
this<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:02.329> ESP<00:02:03.329> Daman<00:02:03.799> they<00:02:04.799> sort<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.430> made

this that ESP Daman they sort of made

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.050 
this that ESP Daman they sort of made
the<00:02:06.899> head<00:02:07.200> parts<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.950> bit<00:02:08.580> better<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the head parts a bit better and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.089 
the head parts a bit better and
especially<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> rapid-fire<00:02:10.379> types<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.979> is

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
especially on the rapid-fire types it is

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.290 
especially on the rapid-fire types it is
super<00:02:11.550> easy<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.480> attach<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
super easy to attach and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.010 
super easy to attach and
attach<00:02:14.280> magazines<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.550> ESP<00:02:16.180> Daman<00:02:16.420> whereas

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
attach magazines on ESP Daman whereas

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.840 
attach magazines on ESP Daman whereas
with<00:02:17.290> cross<00:02:18.070> fight<00:02:18.340> b-daman

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
with cross fight b-daman

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.380 
with cross fight b-daman
which<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.990> can<00:02:20.200> still<00:02:20.470> attach<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.070> same

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
which you can still attach the same

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.080 
which you can still attach the same
magazines<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.660> them<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.320> very<00:02:23.980> hard<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
magazines on to them it's very hard to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.790 
magazines on to them it's very hard to
pull<00:02:25.420> off<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.050> put<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.580> magazines<00:02:28.060> here

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
pull off and put on the magazines here

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.780 
pull off and put on the magazines here
so<00:02:29.800> they<00:02:30.250> did<00:02:31.320> make<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.740> lot<00:02:33.040> easier<00:02:33.550> in

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
so they did make that a lot easier in

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.780 
so they did make that a lot easier in
the<00:02:33.910> future<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.690> again<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.980> attach<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.550> on

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
the future but again just attach this on

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.940 
the future but again just attach this on
it<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.210> hold<00:02:37.360> up<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:38.850> 11<00:02:39.850> or<00:02:40.060> 12<00:02:40.600> B<00:02:41.050> dama<00:02:41.320> just

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
it can hold up to 11 or 12 B dama just

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.120 
it can hold up to 11 or 12 B dama just
in<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.310> normal<00:02:42.700> one<00:02:43.300> again<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.620> hold<00:02:44.740> for

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
in the normal one again it can hold for

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.660 
in the normal one again it can hold for
more<00:02:45.370> for<00:02:45.610> every<00:02:45.940> layer<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.510> add<00:02:46.660> on<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.050> it

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
more for every layer you add on to it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.370 
more for every layer you add on to it
but<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:48.970> see<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.270> rolls<00:02:49.510> down<00:02:49.660> sort<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.260> in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
but you can see it rolls down sort of in

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.640 
but you can see it rolls down sort of in
a<00:02:50.410> zig-zag<00:02:50.770> pattern<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:53.320> there's<00:02:53.440> little

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
a zig-zag pattern and there's little

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.800 
a zig-zag pattern and there's little
ramps<00:02:53.980> inside<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.730> keep<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.270> down<00:02:55.480> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
ramps inside to keep it going down and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.630 
ramps inside to keep it going down and
you<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.830> fire<00:02:57.130> all<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.610> these<00:02:59.610> without<00:03:00.610> a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
you can fire all of these without a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.360 
you can fire all of these without a
clogging<00:03:01.210> at<00:03:01.960> all<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.830> that's<00:03:02.950> really<00:03:03.130> good

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
clogging at all so that's really good
