stuff the light at the door down there
doesn't<00:02:21.400> work<00:02:21.970> anymore<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.780> may<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.050> to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
doesn't work anymore so I may have to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.640 
doesn't work anymore so I may have to
rewire<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.130> figure<00:02:24.400> something<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:24.910> so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
rewire that and figure something out so

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.360 
rewire that and figure something out so
this<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.920> basically<00:02:27.670> what<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:27.970> looks<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.300> now
