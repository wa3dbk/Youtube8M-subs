we were in warframe and we're doing
another<00:00:12.150> Mirage<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.920> time<00:00:14.190> we

another Mirage in you and this time we
are<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.969> use<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.750> tetra<00:00:17.180> yes<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.420> tetra

I'm<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> throw<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> screen<00:00:20.189> my

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
I'm going to throw up on the screen my

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.599 
I'm going to throw up on the screen my
build<00:00:20.820> consists<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.660> 4<00:00:22.380> mods<00:00:22.650> only<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.250> never

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
build consists of 4 mods only I never

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.700 
build consists of 4 mods only I never
formed<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.570> really<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.500> need<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
formed with this I really do need to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920 
formed with this I really do need to
format<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.490> spend<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.240> more<00:00:27.449> time<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
format it and spend some more time on it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.210 
format it and spend some more time on it
as<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> matter<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.500> fact<00:00:28.590> we're<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> take

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
as a matter of fact we're going to take

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.750 
as a matter of fact we're going to take
this<00:00:29.369> against<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> corpus<00:00:31.279> what<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.579> oh

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
this against the corpus what is that oh

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.350 
this against the corpus what is that oh
okay<00:00:36.530> it's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.739> hologram<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:39.030> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> call

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
okay it's a hologram we're going to call

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.799 
okay it's a hologram we're going to call
it<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.510> hologram<00:00:40.219> yeah<00:00:41.480> interesting<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it a hologram yeah interesting that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.680 
it a hologram yeah interesting that
shouldn't<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:44.450> mean<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
shouldn't be there I mean we're going to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.479 
shouldn't be there I mean we're going to
run<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.020> tetra<00:00:46.410> against<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> corpus<00:00:47.280> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
run this tetra against the corpus this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
run this tetra against the corpus this
is<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> Neptune<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.800> we're<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is a Neptune that we're on in this

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
is a Neptune that we're on in this
weapon<00:00:52.320> technically<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
weapon technically because it is a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.020 
weapon technically because it is a
primarily<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.809> puncture<00:00:55.469> weapon<00:00:55.800> should<00:00:56.789> not

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
primarily a puncture weapon should not

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.540 
primarily a puncture weapon should not
work<00:00:57.329> well<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.050> against<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> corpus<00:00:59.070> who

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
work well at all against the corpus who

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.689 
work well at all against the corpus who
are<00:00:59.730> more<00:01:00.000> impact<00:01:00.449> weapon<00:01:01.219> impact<00:01:02.219> sensitive

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
are more impact weapon impact sensitive

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.310 
are more impact weapon impact sensitive
but<00:01:02.940> they're<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> run<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> anyway<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
but they're going to run it anyway and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.899 
but they're going to run it anyway and
based<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> four<00:01:07.860> damage<00:01:08.100> mods<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.700> we

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
based on the four damage mods that we

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.820 
based on the four damage mods that we
have<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.810> we're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> be

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
have in there I think we're going to be

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.039 
have in there I think we're going to be
just<00:01:11.010> fine<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.210> initially<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.869> right

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
just fine as you can initially see right

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.660 
just fine as you can initially see right
off<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> bat<00:01:13.439> we're<00:01:13.619> doing<00:01:13.830> pretty<00:01:14.040> well<00:01:16.670> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
off the bat we're doing pretty well of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
off the bat we're doing pretty well of
course<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.090> throw<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.479> forma<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.170> on

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
course if I throw some forma in here on

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.760 
course if I throw some forma in here on
this<00:01:20.070> weapon<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.640> could<00:01:21.170> potentially<00:01:22.170> really

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this weapon I could potentially really

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
this weapon I could potentially really
make<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.159> thing<00:01:23.400> beastly<00:01:23.939> i<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.810> think

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
make this thing beastly i would think

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.280 
make this thing beastly i would think
just<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.470> looking<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:27.330> having<00:01:28.049> four

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just in looking at it that having four

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.160 
just in looking at it that having four
extra<00:01:28.619> open<00:01:28.920> slots<00:01:29.270> allow<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> lot<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
extra open slots allow for a lot of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.499 
extra open slots allow for a lot of
different<00:01:31.500> options<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.909> build<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
different options on the build of the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.289 
different options on the build of the
weapon<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:35.130> course<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.880> always<00:01:36.030> be

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
weapon of course you know it always be

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.340 
weapon of course you know it always be
primarily<00:01:36.750> focused<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:39.110> puncture<00:01:40.110> because

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
primarily focused on puncture because

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.539 
primarily focused on puncture because
that's<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.100> built<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that's just the way it was built the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
that's just the way it was built the
damage<00:01:41.880> two<00:01:42.030> point<00:01:42.270> oh<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.829> offset

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
damage two point oh but we can offset

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.090 
damage two point oh but we can offset
that<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.549> well<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> course<00:01:46.009> using<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that as well and of course using the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
that as well and of course using the
metal<00:01:47.340> auger<00:01:47.670> having<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> punch<00:01:48.420> through<00:01:48.750> on

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
metal auger having the punch through on

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.610 
metal auger having the punch through on
there<00:01:49.430> is

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.370 

going<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.550> be<00:01:53.850> very<00:01:54.150> helpful<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.900> course<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
going to be very helpful of course in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.470 
going to be very helpful of course in
this<00:01:55.500> situation<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.190> it's<00:01:57.120> not<00:01:57.330> an

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
this situation because it's not an

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.460 
this situation because it's not an
impact<00:01:57.900> sensitive<00:01:58.830> weapon<00:01:59.130> I<00:02:00.140> think<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.260> far

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
impact sensitive weapon I think so far

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.780 
impact sensitive weapon I think so far
we're<00:02:01.590> doing<00:02:01.740> pretty<00:02:01.890> good<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:04.190> would<00:02:05.190> say

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
we're doing pretty good and I would say

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
we're doing pretty good and I would say
that<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.390> hall<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.660> mirrors<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.290> course<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that the hall of mirrors of course is

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.230 
that the hall of mirrors of course is
helping<00:02:08.130> me<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:13.730> without<00:02:14.730> having

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
helping me out in this without having

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.600 
helping me out in this without having
hall<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.570> mirrors<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.260> would<00:02:17.220> definitely<00:02:17.340> say

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
hall of mirrors I would definitely say

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.850 
hall of mirrors I would definitely say
to<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.660> against<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.110> corpus<00:02:19.470> you're<00:02:19.650> probably

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860

nice i mean the tetra i always liked it
when<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.230> first<00:03:16.440> came<00:03:16.680> out<00:03:16.890> i<00:03:19.370> think<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.489> came

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
when it first came out i think it came

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.449 
when it first came out i think it came
out<00:03:20.910> around<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.600> time<00:03:21.840> axiom<00:03:22.470> came<00:03:22.860> out<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:23.280> i

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
out around the time axiom came out if i

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.160 
out around the time axiom came out if i
remember<00:03:23.730> with<00:03:23.850> axiom<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.390> new<00:03:24.510> resource<00:03:24.930> put

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
remember with axiom the new resource put

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.199 
remember with axiom the new resource put
into<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.470> game<00:03:25.620> which<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.640> all<00:03:26.790> started

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
into the game which we all started

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.000 
into the game which we all started
flipping<00:03:27.540> out<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.900> because<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.380> needed<00:03:28.560> oxy

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
flipping out on because we needed oxy

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.300 
flipping out on because we needed oxy
them<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.430> everything<00:03:29.820> at<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.030> time<00:03:31.040> but<00:03:32.040> i

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
them for everything at the time but i

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.250 
them for everything at the time but i
haven't<00:03:33.060> spent<00:03:33.270> much<00:03:33.360> time<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.930> but<00:03:34.140> I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
haven't spent much time with it but I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.080 
haven't spent much time with it but I
it's<00:03:34.650> doing<00:03:34.890> pretty<00:03:34.980> decently<00:03:35.580> against<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
it's doing pretty decently against the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's doing pretty decently against the
corpus<00:03:36.769> it's<00:03:37.769> kind<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.250> little<00:03:38.550> mini

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
corpus it's kind of like a little mini

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:48.660 
corpus it's kind of like a little mini
supra<00:03:39.269> if<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.750> will

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.030 

and<00:03:48.940> definitely<00:03:49.540> with<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.870> metal<00:03:50.170> auger<00:03:50.560> that

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
and definitely with the metal auger that

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.309 
and definitely with the metal auger that
extra<00:03:51.670> punch<00:03:51.910> through<00:03:52.209> really<00:03:52.959> helps<00:03:53.260> me

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
extra punch through really helps me

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.370 
extra punch through really helps me
getting<00:03:53.680> through<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.190> corpus<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.989> this<00:03:56.319> one<00:03:56.560> I

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
is go back on a couple of those setups

we'll<00:05:37.150> do<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.479> that<00:05:37.630> way

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.150 

will<00:05:40.570> feature<00:05:40.780> it<00:05:41.050> in<00:05:41.170> some<00:05:41.700> some<00:05:42.700> episodes<00:05:43.180> I

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
will feature it in some some episodes I

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.900 
will feature it in some some episodes I
guess<00:05:45.160> that<00:05:45.340> would<00:05:45.460> be<00:05:45.490> similar<00:05:45.790> to

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
guess that would be similar to

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.610 
guess that would be similar to
potato-powered<00:05:46.840> you<00:05:47.530> know<00:05:50.100> ngf<00:05:51.100> our<00:05:51.340> series

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
potato-powered you know ngf our series

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.960 
potato-powered you know ngf our series
but<00:05:53.620> in<00:05:53.740> this<00:05:53.860> case<00:05:54.070> of<00:05:54.310> course<00:05:54.520> I<00:05:54.700> would<00:05:54.880> be

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
but in this case of course I would be

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.150 
but in this case of course I would be
able<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.240> mod<00:05:55.450> it<00:05:55.600> however<00:05:55.750> I<00:05:55.960> want<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.440> it

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
able to mod it however I want to it

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.430 
able to mod it however I want to it
would<00:05:57.280> just<00:05:57.310> be<00:05:57.520> based<00:05:57.820> off<00:05:58.030> of<00:05:58.060> your<00:05:58.390> what<00:05:59.320> you

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
would just be based off of your what you

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.170 
would just be based off of your what you
think<00:05:59.680> is<00:05:59.800> your<00:05:59.980> ultimate<00:06:00.130> bill<00:06:00.550> so<00:06:03.150> let<00:06:04.150> me

you know three other Bratton's so of
course<00:06:46.180> I<00:06:46.360> would<00:06:46.510> just<00:06:46.660> run<00:06:46.840> one<00:06:47.080> of<00:06:47.200> those

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
course I would just run one of those

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.920 
course I would just run one of those
Bratton's<00:06:47.770> if<00:06:47.890> you<00:06:47.980> chose<00:06:48.190> brat<00:06:48.690> that<00:06:49.690> type<00:06:49.900> of

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
Bratton's if you chose brat that type of

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.730 
Bratton's if you chose brat that type of
thing

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
thing

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.760 
thing
you<00:06:52.430> know<00:06:52.550> just<00:06:52.880> a<00:06:53.000> thought<00:06:53.030> but<00:06:53.530> I<00:06:54.530> think

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
you know just a thought but I think

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.290 
you know just a thought but I think
we're<00:06:54.919> powering<00:06:55.250> through<00:06:55.610> this<00:06:55.759> pretty<00:06:56.000> well

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
we're powering through this pretty well

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.969 
we're powering through this pretty well
I<00:06:56.539> like<00:06:57.020> that<00:06:57.169> we're<00:06:57.319> almost<00:06:57.440> done<00:06:57.740> with<00:06:57.889> the

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
I like that we're almost done with the

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.249 
I like that we're almost done with the
enemies<00:06:58.539> almost<00:06:59.539> done<00:06:59.750> killing<00:06:59.990> all<00:07:00.169> the

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
enemies almost done killing all the

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.379 
enemies almost done killing all the
corpus<00:07:01.870> you<00:07:02.870> know<00:07:02.960> yes<00:07:03.440> in<00:07:03.889> this<00:07:04.069> case<00:07:04.310> I<00:07:04.610> know

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:05.389 
corpus you know yes in this case I know

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:07.540 
corpus you know yes in this case I know
that<00:07:05.810> the<00:07:06.139> hall<00:07:06.440> of<00:07:06.470> mirrors<00:07:06.740> had<00:07:07.160> a<00:07:07.190> lot<00:07:07.520> of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
that the hall of mirrors had a lot of

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.909 
that the hall of mirrors had a lot of
help<00:07:07.910> in<00:07:08.690> it<00:07:08.870> and<00:07:09.050> it<00:07:09.259> does<00:07:09.440> feel<00:07:09.680> like<00:07:09.889> a

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
help in it and it does feel like a

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.219 
help in it and it does feel like a
slower<00:07:10.280> version<00:07:10.610> of<00:07:10.940> the<00:07:11.030> supra<00:07:11.419> so<00:07:12.080> you're

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
slower version of the supra so you're

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:18.189 
slower version of the supra so you're
not<00:07:12.319> burning<00:07:12.590> through<00:07:12.949> ammo<00:07:16.930> punch<00:07:17.930> through

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 
not burning through ammo punch through

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.640 
not burning through ammo punch through
metal<00:07:18.500> auger<00:07:18.830> is<00:07:19.009> awesome<00:07:20.380> could<00:07:21.380> probably

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
metal auger is awesome could probably

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.680 
metal auger is awesome could probably
put<00:07:21.979> metal<00:07:22.280> auger<00:07:22.460> and<00:07:22.729> shred<00:07:23.210> in<00:07:23.360> here<00:07:23.569> and

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.690 
put metal auger and shred in here and

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.420 
put metal auger and shred in here and
have<00:07:23.780> even<00:07:23.960> more<00:07:24.259> punch<00:07:24.560> through<00:07:24.830> capability

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
have even more punch through capability

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.420 
have even more punch through capability
and<00:07:25.639> some<00:07:26.389> fire<00:07:26.599> rate<00:07:27.099> but<00:07:28.099> like<00:07:28.190> I<00:07:28.250> said<00:07:28.370> I

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430 
and some fire rate but like I said I

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.059 
and some fire rate but like I said I
probably<00:07:28.639> spend<00:07:28.909> some<00:07:29.030> time<00:07:29.240> on<00:07:29.270> it<00:07:30.009> so<00:07:31.009> you

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:31.069 
probably spend some time on it so you

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:32.700 
probably spend some time on it so you
may<00:07:31.250> see<00:07:31.310> me<00:07:31.460> running<00:07:31.849> it<00:07:31.970> a<00:07:32.060> little<00:07:32.240> bit<00:07:32.449> more

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
may see me running it a little bit more

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.469 
may see me running it a little bit more
if<00:07:33.710> I<00:07:33.830> decide<00:07:34.130> to<00:07:34.159> put<00:07:34.370> them<00:07:34.490> forma<00:07:35.060> into<00:07:35.360> it

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 
if I decide to put them forma into it

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.689 
if I decide to put them forma into it
and<00:07:35.599> I<00:07:35.870> never<00:07:36.530> didn't<00:07:36.860> actually<00:07:37.009> build<00:07:37.340> on<00:07:37.550> it

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:37.699 
and I never didn't actually build on it

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:40.059 
and I never didn't actually build on it
so<00:07:37.909> if<00:07:38.419> I<00:07:38.539> do<00:07:38.599> that<00:07:38.930> obviously<00:07:39.199> I'll<00:07:39.590> take<00:07:39.860> time

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:40.069 
so if I do that obviously I'll take time

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:44.230 
so if I do that obviously I'll take time
put<00:07:40.340> it<00:07:40.460> all<00:07:40.580> in<00:07:40.759> and<00:07:42.639> we'll<00:07:43.639> do<00:07:43.729> a<00:07:43.759> build<00:07:44.000> on<00:07:44.150> it

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 
put it all in and we'll do a build on it

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.879 
put it all in and we'll do a build on it
once<00:07:44.389> i'm<00:07:44.509> done<00:07:44.539> but<00:07:44.810> that's<00:07:44.930> it<00:07:45.110> for<00:07:45.259> now<00:07:45.349> hit

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:45.889 
once i'm done but that's it for now hit

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:47.379 
once i'm done but that's it for now hit
that<00:07:46.069> like<00:07:46.220> button<00:07:46.250> for<00:07:46.490> me<00:07:46.759> if<00:07:46.819> you<00:07:46.909> did<00:07:47.150> like

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:47.389 
that like button for me if you did like

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:49.659 
that like button for me if you did like
this<00:07:47.569> comments<00:07:48.080> below<00:07:48.229> and<00:07:48.650> we'll<00:07:49.460> see<00:07:49.610> you
