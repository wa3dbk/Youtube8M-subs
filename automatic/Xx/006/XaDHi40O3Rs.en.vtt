00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.110
 learning towards the silly teach 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.110
 learn here in punta al toro 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.349
 the first thing to do first 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.380
 buy I have chosen the jump ones 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.270
 roles tricked with oil that I already know 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.220

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:37.240
 first we take the ring after the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:40.840
 we put between this circle 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.960
 then if we are right-handed we put it that way 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.110
 like me and after 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.780
 If we are pure so we put it 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.960
 we are parties we do it like this first 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.340
 we have to force it very well so that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.770
 pull the pronounce well and with 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.620
 ease up to the beginning up here 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.980
 for example it is done with force and after 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 you can go the shine carefully, but not 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.290
 it will pass expose here that because 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 it will be bad 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.680
 seixas and then with the fingers of the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.520
 victory you take and put it between the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.850
 thread 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.149
 you take two fingers and put it 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.840
 around the circle and then the finger 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:32.170
 in the world 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 you put it that way backwards because if you 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.789
 you have like this will come out more like this and you do like 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.869
 it was formulated tico 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.869
 it already 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.100

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.690

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:59.630

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.250
 beginning for stews and then 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.970
 higuerillo
