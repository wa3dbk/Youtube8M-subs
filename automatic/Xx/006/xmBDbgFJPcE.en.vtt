00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.169
 Many people and my students ask me in workshops and in emails 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.289
 what they should use white balance. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.899
 The answer is quite simple. First, people deal with white balance and secondly 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:28.140
 I love colors. And because I love them, I always try to warm the colors in my photos. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.679
 I even did it while I was taking pictures for a few years. I often used it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.440
 filter 81B, which warmed colors in photos. Do you at the time of digital photography 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.879
 you don't have to worry, because white balance is enough. 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.350
 This is in other words setting the light temperature 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.940
 which you can use. See the light temperature as warm or cold colors. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.949
 Personally, I use the Cloudy setting in 98 percent of the cases because 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.320
 that colors get into warmer shades. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.970
 Look at this photo of downtown Seattle I took at sunset. 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.720
 Notice how rich colors are in it. 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.580
 Compare the photo with the AUTO setting, do you see the difference? 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.090
 Of course, this is not just about the city, but look at this series of pictures. 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.920
 White Balance on Cloudy and White Balance on Auto. 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 Overcast. / Car. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.690
 Overcast. 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.380
 Car. 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.260
 So from my point of view, you have the only option: in most cases, select Cloudy. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.480
 You can use it at noon, morning, evening. 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.030
 The only case in which I wouldn't use the Cloudy setting as you see it 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.009
 is a photo shoot of people 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.500
 when the sun is low over the horizon. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.170
 Warm light at sunset or sunrise already warms the skin of a person sufficiently 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.720
 thus 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.280
 the color of the skin turns cloudy to lobster color. 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.070
 And you want to avoid it. 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.020
 In this situation, I don't have a problem setting the white balance to Auto. 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.220
 But one more time: I shoot most of the time on Cloudy. 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.120
 It is of course up to you, of course, but I hope this video is finally 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.710
 saves the white balance theme to sleep. It's not complicated. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.380
 Next time again, this is Bryan Peterson and you don't stop taking pictures.
