00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.610 
shredder and just took big handfuls of
aluminum<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.780> threw<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
aluminum and just threw it in the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.259 
aluminum and just threw it in the
shredder<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.130> then<00:02:37.519> they<00:02:37.639> spread<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.180> all

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
shredder and then they spread it all

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.910 
shredder and then they spread it all
over<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.720> field<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.260> then<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.709> good<00:02:39.859> measure

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
over the field and then for good measure

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.610 
over the field and then for good measure
they<00:02:40.280> plowed<00:02:40.639> it<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.389> spread<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.019> out<00:02:42.260> so

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
they plowed it in and spread it out so

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.129 
they plowed it in and spread it out so
it<00:02:42.769> would<00:02:42.889> be<00:02:43.069> everywhere<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.780> was<00:02:44.959> tough

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
it would be everywhere that was tough

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.849 
it would be everywhere that was tough
honey<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:46.459> know<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.660> site<00:02:47.930> doesn't<00:02:48.350> date<00:02:48.560> back

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
honey I know the site doesn't date back

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.559 
honey I know the site doesn't date back
to<00:02:49.010> Civil<00:02:49.340> War<00:02:49.519> period<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.209> knew<00:02:50.359> they<00:02:50.480> were

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
to Civil War period if I knew they were

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.270 
to Civil War period if I knew they were
Civil<00:02:50.900> War<00:02:51.049> relics<00:02:51.230> here<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.620> probably<00:02:52.010> would

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
Civil War relics here I probably would

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.300 
Civil War relics here I probably would
hunker<00:02:52.549> down<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.440> put<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> little<00:02:55.040> more

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
hunker down and and put a little more

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.039 
hunker down and and put a little more
effort<00:02:55.430> into<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.600> know<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:57.019> probably

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
effort into it but I know it probably

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.490 
effort into it but I know it probably
doesn't<00:02:57.380> date<00:02:57.769> more<00:02:58.069> earlier<00:02:58.880> than<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.420> the
