for<00:01:53.759> example<00:01:53.939> prep<00:01:54.479> page<00:01:55.280> we<00:01:56.280> spoke<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
for example prep page we spoke with a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.310 
for example prep page we spoke with a
lot<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> teachers<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.540> develop<00:01:57.899> dash<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
lot of teachers when we develop dash and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
lot to think about

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.459 
lot to think about
a<00:02:00.579> lot<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:00.939> material<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.450> get<00:02:01.659> through<00:02:01.719> so<00:02:02.380> we

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
a lot of material to get through so we

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.599 
a lot of material to get through so we
wanted<00:02:02.679> to<00:02:02.740> make<00:02:02.890> sure<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.399> teacher

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609

only had to see the material that she
wanted<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.740> see<00:02:05.920> we<00:02:06.490> created<00:02:06.850> this<00:02:06.939> folder

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
wanted to see we created this folder

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.759 
wanted to see we created this folder
structure<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.899> teacher<00:02:08.080> can<00:02:08.319> reveal<00:02:08.560> our

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
structure so the teacher can reveal our

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.100

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
hide them if she doesn't need them so

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.610 
hide them if she doesn't need them so
there's<00:02:16.510> two<00:02:16.629> ways<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> move<00:02:17.080> through<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.470> can

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
there's two ways to move through you can

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.110 
there's two ways to move through you can
add<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.739> tap<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.069> button<00:02:18.280> at<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.549> top<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.000> can

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
add a tap a button at the top of you can

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.570 
add a tap a button at the top of you can
simply<00:02:19.269> swipe<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.870> next<00:02:20.140> screen<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:21.220> this

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
simply swipe to the next screen so this

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520 
simply swipe to the next screen so this
is<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> first<00:02:22.030> teach<00:02:22.239> page<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.959> bell<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.349> rung

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.259 
in place something else we did was to
augment<00:03:05.319> our<00:03:05.410> support<00:03:05.859> for<00:03:05.920> vocabulary<00:03:06.370> now

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
augment our support for vocabulary now

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.210 
augment our support for vocabulary now
vocabulary<00:03:07.930> support<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.470> very<00:03:08.590> important<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
vocabulary support is very important and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.500 
vocabulary support is very important and
we<00:03:09.310> can<00:03:09.430> see<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:09.579> teacher<00:03:09.819> using<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.299> either

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
we can see a teacher using this either

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.059 
we can see a teacher using this either
in<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.780> fonda<00:03:11.079> class<00:03:11.290> or<00:03:11.590> working<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.040> a

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
in the fonda class or working one a

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.340 
in the fonda class or working one a
month<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.519> student<00:03:12.880> needs<00:03:13.060> extra<00:03:13.299> help<00:03:13.510> so

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
month the student needs extra help so

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.930 
month the student needs extra help so
say<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.859> student<00:03:15.100> needs<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.489> understand<00:03:15.850> the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
say the student needs to understand the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.759 
say the student needs to understand the
concept<00:03:16.329> of<00:03:16.389> arable<00:03:16.750> land<00:03:16.959> we<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.560> blow<00:03:17.739> up

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
concept of arable land we can blow up

we<00:04:22.460> had<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.760> answers<00:04:23.180> that<00:04:23.450> go<00:04:24.140> along<00:04:24.260> with

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
student edition we copied the answers

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.780 
student edition we copied the answers
over<00:04:27.500> here<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.040> teacher<00:04:28.190> doesn't<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:28.670> to

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
my Pearson training this is where we

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.410 
my Pearson training this is where we
have<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.980> videos<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.610> teacher<00:04:34.790> could<00:04:35.030> use<00:04:35.240> to

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
have the videos the teacher could use to

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.120 
have the videos the teacher could use to
learn<00:04:35.570> how<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.780> use<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.140> my<00:04:36.260> role<00:04:36.470> program<00:04:36.890> as

differentiate and it pulls all the
resources<00:06:14.090> teacher<00:06:14.540> needs<00:06:14.810> together<00:06:15.140> at<00:06:15.440> the

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
resources teacher needs together at the

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.930 
resources teacher needs together at the
place<00:06:15.770> she<00:06:15.800> needs<00:06:16.100> them<00:06:16.250> when<00:06:16.400> she<00:06:16.550> gives<00:06:16.700> them
