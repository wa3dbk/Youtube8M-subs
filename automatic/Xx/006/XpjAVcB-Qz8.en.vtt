00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello to repair the monitor SRP 193 w with 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.540
 the defect disappears image immediately 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 after power on 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:22.410
 defect demonstration root cause 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.920
 This defect is a block failure. 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.859
 power inverter or backlight for 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.890
 finding out the cause of the defect is necessary 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.590
 disassemble the monitor we start with 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.450
 dismantling the legs for this you need to remove two 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 plastic lining and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:51.239
 unscrew the fastening screws further 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.059
 unscrew the screw of the cover of the case cover 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.280
 the monitor snaps into place for 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.090
 opening we decided to first remove the side 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.539
 lining 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.750
 and then unclip the latch cover 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.750
 filmed 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.159
 disable socket lamps Svetka 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.399
 peel off the foil so as not to interfere 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:46.810
 freeing the board with the buttons do not forget 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:49.660
 disable the loop matrix now you have 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.570
 access to monitor electronics we need 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.460
 make sure the power supply is working 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.870
 To do this, unscrew the mounting screws 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.729
 power supply boards 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:05.800
 it is the inverter board we inspect the board 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.530
 for obvious defects in the form 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.750
 swollen capacitors and immediately 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.390
 stumble on swollen capacitor by 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.090
 power circuit of the inverter most likely she 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.630
 is the cause of the defect need to be replaced 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.610
 this capacitor is rated capacitor 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.220
 680 microfarad at twenty five volts 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.530
 denomination not common usually 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.209
 we change such capacitors on face value 1 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.820
 thousands of microfarads 25 or 35 volts worth 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.730
 note that the problem is not always solved 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.130
 only capacitor replacements 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.140
 that besides the capacitor fails 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.150
 also inverter transformer 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.060
 or conder backlight lamps 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.040
 replaced now twist the board into place and 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.040
 check missing their defect 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.790
 including monitor and watch 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.629
 Now the image does not disappear 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.629
 defect fixed collecting monitor 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.989
 monitor assembled monitor testing 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.599
 we carry out continuous work of the monitor in 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.239
 for at least three hours if for that 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.459
 time defect does not manifest then repair 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.760
 we consider completed on the same we 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.439
 we say goodbye to you dear friend to the new 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.439
 meetings in the following repairs
