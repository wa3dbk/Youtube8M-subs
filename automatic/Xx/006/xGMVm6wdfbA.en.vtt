if it's supposed to taste like a full
complex<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.400> yet<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> first<00:01:30.090> time<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> made

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
complex one yet is the first time I made

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749

one but it doesn't taste sweet the sugar
has<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.180> been<00:01:33.299> turned<00:01:33.420> into<00:01:33.570> alcohol<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.439> from

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
has all been turned into alcohol so from

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.039 
has all been turned into alcohol so from
that<00:01:34.680> standpoint<00:01:34.950> we're<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> go

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
that standpoint we're good to go

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.030 
that standpoint we're good to go
otherwise<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.290> doesn't<00:01:37.439> taste<00:01:37.710> over<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
otherwise it doesn't taste over the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
otherwise it doesn't taste over the
complex<00:01:38.400> definitely<00:01:39.240> has<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.600> fruity

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
complex definitely has some fruity

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
complex definitely has some fruity
characters<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.430> too

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
characters in there but it's not too

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520 
characters in there but it's not too
impressive<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:42.420> hoping<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> next

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
impressive so I'm hoping over the next

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
impressive so I'm hoping over the next
month<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.460> let<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> rest<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
month or so as we let it rest and as it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.120 
month or so as we let it rest and as it
all<00:01:45.840> comes<00:01:46.079> together<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.590> it'll<00:01:46.829> build<00:01:46.979> up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
all comes together and it'll build up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.469 
all comes together and it'll build up
and<00:01:47.310> I'll<00:01:47.399> taste<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.759> lot<00:01:47.909> more<00:01:48.119> impressive

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and I'll taste a lot more impressive

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.600 
and I'll taste a lot more impressive
because<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:48.960> now<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.890> tastes<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
because right now it just tastes kind of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149 
because right now it just tastes kind of
like<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.270> an<00:01:51.420> adequate<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.380> very<00:01:52.649> good<00:01:52.860> sort

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
like it's an adequate not very good sort

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.219 
like it's an adequate not very good sort
of<00:01:53.189> watered-down<00:01:53.490> wine<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.210> we'll<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
of watered-down wine but we'll see the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.630 
of watered-down wine but we'll see the
next<00:01:55.409> thing<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.619> want<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.130> retest

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
next thing I want to do that is retest

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
next thing I want to do that is retest
the<00:01:56.759> specific<00:01:57.240> gravity<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.780> specific

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the specific gravity the specific

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.649 
the specific gravity the specific
gravity<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.710> should<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:58.979> around<00:01:59.600> 0.995

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
gravity of this should be around 0.995

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.690 
gravity of this should be around 0.995
this<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.560> second<00:02:01.950> line<00:02:02.100> down<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this is about that second line down so

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
this is about that second line down so
it<00:02:02.759> looks<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.560> 0.99<00:02:04.560> 4<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.640> if

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it looks like it's at about 0.99 4 so if

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.620 
it looks like it's at about 0.99 4 so if
you<00:02:05.759> remember<00:02:05.880> from<00:02:06.000> last<00:02:06.240> time<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
you remember from last time the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.969 
you remember from last time the
temperature<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> liquid<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.590> important

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
temperature of the liquid is important

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.109 
temperature of the liquid is important
in<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.099> measurements<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> specific<00:02:08.940> gravity

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
in the measurements the specific gravity

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.750 
in the measurements the specific gravity
so<00:02:09.599> look<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> side<00:02:10.110> I'm<00:02:10.259> from

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
so look at the side I'm from

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.220 
so look at the side I'm from
the<00:02:11.760> line<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.239> actually<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.750> 70<00:02:13.140> degrees

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the line is actually about 70 degrees

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.770 
the line is actually about 70 degrees
right<00:02:13.440> now<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.220> 70<00:02:14.760> degrees<00:02:14.940> means<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.330> add<00:02:15.480> one

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
right now so 70 degrees means we add one

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.410 
right now so 70 degrees means we add one
number<00:02:16.459> 0.995<00:02:17.459> we're<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:17.940> there<00:02:18.150> where

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
number 0.995 we're right there where

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.390 
number 0.995 we're right there where
we're<00:02:18.599> supposed<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.930> be<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.319> dry<00:02:19.470> red<00:02:19.680> wine<00:02:19.709> so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
we're supposed to be for dry red wine so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.979 
we're supposed to be for dry red wine so
what<00:02:20.519> does<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.640> actually<00:02:20.879> mean<00:02:21.060> well<00:02:21.599> to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
what does that actually mean well to

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.300 
what does that actually mean well to
figure<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> alcohol<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.980> take<00:02:23.190> your

figure out the alcohol you take your

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.490 
figure out the alcohol you take your

gravity point nine nine five subtract

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.600 
gravity point nine nine five subtract
that<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:30.900> point<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.530> zero<00:02:31.890> two<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
that you get point one zero two you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.520 
that you get point one zero two you
multiply<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:33.090> number<00:02:33.150> by<00:02:33.360> 130<00:02:34.049> which<00:02:34.319> gives

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
multiply that number by 130 which gives

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.140 
multiply that number by 130 which gives
you<00:02:34.590> thirteen<00:02:34.950> point<00:02:35.190> two<00:02:35.340> six<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.849> there's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you thirteen point two six and there's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
you thirteen point two six and there's
our<00:02:36.269> approximate<00:02:36.720> alcohol<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.470> our<00:02:37.620> line<00:02:37.799> is

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
our approximate alcohol so our line is

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.979 
our approximate alcohol so our line is
approximately<00:02:38.430> 13%<00:02:38.849> alcohol<00:02:39.150> which<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.780> right

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
approximately 13% alcohol which is right

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.960 
approximately 13% alcohol which is right

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
siphoning here's what we got left it's a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.080 
siphoning here's what we got left it's a
whole<00:03:10.319> bunch<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.769> messy<00:03:11.310> folk<00:03:11.579> down<00:03:11.849> there

whole bunch of messy folk down there

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.319 
whole bunch of messy folk down there
then<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.540> some<00:03:12.660> dark<00:03:13.760> swirly<00:03:14.760> yeast<00:03:15.090> some

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
then it's some dark swirly yeast some

have any other spoilers going on with
the<00:03:29.760> wine<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.690> mix<00:03:30.900> about<00:03:31.109> a<00:03:31.139> half

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290

next<00:03:35.910> are<00:03:36.030> going<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.269> adding<00:03:36.569> tannins<00:03:36.989> now

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
next are going to be adding tannins now

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.990 
next are going to be adding tannins now
tannins<00:03:37.889> naturally<00:03:38.430> occur<00:03:38.639> when<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.880> make

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000

stem<00:03:41.160> seeds<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.209> some<00:03:42.450> from<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.690> oak

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
stem seeds and we have some from the oak

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.539 
stem seeds and we have some from the oak
chips<00:03:42.989> out<00:03:43.200> using<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:44.040> because<00:03:44.250> we're<00:03:44.400> using

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
chips out using but because we're using

chips out using but because we're using
concentrated<00:03:44.940> grape<00:03:45.269> juice<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.630> probably

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
concentrated grape juice it probably

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.270 
concentrated grape juice it probably
doesn't<00:03:46.049> have<00:03:46.169> as<00:03:46.260> much<00:03:46.410> tannins<00:03:46.799> normally

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
doesn't have as much tannins normally

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.650 
doesn't have as much tannins normally
would<00:03:47.430> if<00:03:47.549> we<00:03:47.579> were<00:03:47.730> using<00:03:47.849> crushed<00:03:48.209> grapes<00:03:48.450> so

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
would if we were using crushed grapes so

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.819 
would if we were using crushed grapes so
we're<00:03:48.780> adding<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.049> little<00:03:49.139> bit<00:03:49.260> more<00:03:49.380> tanum

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
we're adding a little bit more tanum

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.530 
we're adding a little bit more tanum

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
sparkle oi powder now what this does is

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.550 
sparkle oi powder now what this does is
it<00:03:56.819> helps<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.150> take<00:03:57.299> all<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.630> fine<00:03:58.019> sediment

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
it helps to take all that fine sediment

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.990 
it helps to take all that fine sediment
in<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.069> binds<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.459> all<00:03:59.549> together<00:03:59.669> and

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
in there and binds it all together and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.640 
in there and binds it all together and
drops<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.389> to<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.540> bottom<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.870> really<00:04:01.049> clarify

drops it to the bottom to really clarify
the<00:04:01.709> line<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.579> can<00:04:02.760> rack<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.209> again<00:04:03.480> take

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
the line so we can rack it again take

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.089 
the line so we can rack it again take
the<00:04:03.959> wine<00:04:04.109> off<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.590> leave<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.769> sediment<00:04:05.040> in

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
the wine off and leave the sediment in

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.099 
the wine off and leave the sediment in
the<00:04:05.130> bottom<00:04:05.190> right<00:04:05.669> before<00:04:05.910> we<00:04:06.030> bottle<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.450> and

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
the bottom right before we bottle it and

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.629 
the bottom right before we bottle it and
get<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.319> ready<00:04:07.470> make<00:04:07.889> it<00:04:07.980> nice<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.160> clear<00:04:08.609> and

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
wine so I'm gonna go ahead and just use

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.180 
wine so I'm gonna go ahead and just use
a<00:04:32.610> distilled<00:04:33.030> water<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.450> see<00:04:34.110> give<00:04:34.889> it<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:35.010> fair

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
a distilled water and see give it a fair

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.860 
a distilled water and see give it a fair
test<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.760> kit<00:04:35.940> if<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.419> ends<00:04:36.600> up<00:04:36.690> tasting

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
test to the kit if it ends up tasting

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.540 
test to the kit if it ends up tasting
water<00:04:37.169> down<00:04:37.440> then<00:04:37.800> obviously<00:04:38.430> that's

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
water down then obviously that's

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.540 
water down then obviously that's
something<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.910> know<00:04:39.150> about<00:04:39.270> going<00:04:39.540> forward

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
something to know about going forward

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.800 
something to know about going forward
let's<00:04:41.550> take<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.820> fermentation<00:04:42.150> lock<00:04:42.540> back

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.450 
let's take the fermentation lock back
inside<00:04:43.230> there<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.980> we're<00:04:44.160> gonna<00:04:44.250> let<00:04:44.400> that

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
inside there and we're gonna let that

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.400 
inside there and we're gonna let that
wine<00:04:44.730> sit<00:04:45.030> for<00:04:45.210> about<00:04:45.300> 21<00:04:45.690> days<00:04:45.840> let<00:04:46.320> it
