00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.810
 because we had a very round match 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.540
 back with a lot of dynamics and above all 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.820
 with great power of forcefulness of this 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.280
 fbb melgar team that quickly 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.869
 find a goal chance 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.910
 through this center of slope that 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.160
 out like a shot the far post the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.599
 beautiful deviates you have the feet of di 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.640
 cosmo he said he could not I do 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.439
 difficult tasks easy not going 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.580
 to do these are the clearest whites 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.570
 opportunities that he had throughout the 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.310
 match 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.499
 the clearest I find vallejo through 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.260
 of the feet of cedrÃ³n that does not achieve 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:36.680
 define there exactly what would arrive 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.079
 this goal this great goal in 1st of julian 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.670
 I gave cosmo no after a support not so 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.420
 precise putting that leaves the ball 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.609
 high and how it takes advantage and at first 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.520
 when it went down, it hits the ball dry 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:52.460
 with a lot of power and leaves no option 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.559
 beautiful that when the ball comes in 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.949
 is just pulling you do not do what you 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.570
 grants the definition in first then 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.120
 the second goal would already arrive and it is through 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.620
 of this second goal that already marks a 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.470
 total difference in the team game 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.260
 of melgar error in output 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.270
 Vallejo who finds the ball in 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.830
 feet of slope this is a big cut 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.930
 because that does not diminish the error does not 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.690
 Subtract merit makes a very good cut 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.450
 even on top as it lifts the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.850
 ball all and all exact government not 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.830
 believe and that takes away possibilities to the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.620
 beautiful sun leaving bodies 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.120
 time to bed before the departure of the 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.970
 archer would then arrive and at the end of the 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.220
 first time this great goal by Julian Di 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.540
 cosmo that even better than the first to 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.370
 I like this more than the one 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.410
 first is very good clipping the hitch 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.990
 is the means to generate the profile 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.710
 right in the definition and with an auction 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.200
 strong and forceful was going 3 to 0 at 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.320
 rest the melgar team and in the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.090
 second comes to the expulsion of subtle and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.369
 everything is already much more complicated 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.110
 for the trujillano team 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.380
 yes yes you are missing a match so 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.720
 clearly do not start losing the one 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.640
 it comes not if it's still taking in 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.320
 mind that is the one who comes is 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.990
 against the championship pointer 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.860
 would come this magnificent move of meza 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.750
 block 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.220
 the perfect hitch at the end and then already 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.950
 in the definition 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.780
 it ends up failing not being precise what 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.000
 that would have been the truth one of the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.120
 best goals not from the game but from the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.190
 championship seems to me and finally when 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.870
 we said that but you could get into 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.360
 podium of the figures of the party that 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.950
 the ball was missing a goal I have a 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.940
 football friend who told me he is 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.920
 just and there for justice sought piero 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.500
 it fell right on his head and this one with a 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.130
 good movement ends up decreeing the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.130
 4-0 final
