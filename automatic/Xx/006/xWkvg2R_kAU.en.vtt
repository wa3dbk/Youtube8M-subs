00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
bye guys just doing a little video one

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.240 
bye guys just doing a little video one
of<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.449> members<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.440> forum<00:00:04.799> by<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.040> name

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
of the members on the forum by the name

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.310 
of the members on the forum by the name
of<00:00:05.279> Cultus<00:00:05.899> that<00:00:06.899> has<00:00:07.080> one<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.859> these<00:00:08.010> little

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
of Cultus that has one of these little

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.280 
of Cultus that has one of these little
phone<00:00:10.320> generators<00:00:10.830> similar<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.290> and

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
phone generators similar to this one and

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.700 
phone generators similar to this one and
he<00:00:13.440> just<00:00:13.469> wanted<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.040> know<00:00:14.190> how<00:00:14.809> working<00:00:15.809> how

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
he just wanted to know how working how

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.090 
he just wanted to know how working how
it<00:00:16.770> does<00:00:17.010> work<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.070> he<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.460> get<00:00:20.609> his<00:00:20.760> going

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
it does work so as he can get his going

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.769 
it does work so as he can get his going
so<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.400> front<00:00:24.119> here

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
so on the front here

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.740 
so on the front here
you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.289> see<00:00:25.640> there's<00:00:26.640> two<00:00:26.730> sets<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.420> points

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
you can see there's two sets of points

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.549 
you can see there's two sets of points
that<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.990> talking<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:31.579> Cultus<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> on

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that I was talking about Cultus and on

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.139 
that I was talking about Cultus and on
the<00:00:34.710> back<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.100> crank<00:00:35.430> handle<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.940> can

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the back with the crank handle you can

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.940 
the back with the crank handle you can
see<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.380> an<00:00:37.530> angled<00:00:37.920> cut<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:39.770> in<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
see we have an angled cut out in the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.479 
see we have an angled cut out in the
crank<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.969> turn<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.719> crank<00:00:43.489> slides

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
crank so when you turn the crank slides

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.840 
crank so when you turn the crank slides
down<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.000> cut<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> other

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
down that cut out and this on the other

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.080 
down that cut out and this on the other
end<00:00:48.590> opens<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.770> set<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.160> points<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.579> closes

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
end opens one set of points and closes

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.130 
end opens one set of points and closes
the<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.690> points<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the other so one this set of points is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.970 
the other so one this set of points is
actually<00:00:58.469> hooked<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.170> side<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> coil

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
actually hooked to one side of the coil

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
actually hooked to one side of the coil
and<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.699> set<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> points<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.539> grounded<00:01:04.019> out

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and this set of points is grounded out

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.490 
and this set of points is grounded out
to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> shaft<00:01:04.799> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> moment<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:06.990> coils

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to the shaft at the moment so our coils

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.600 
to the shaft at the moment so our coils
reading<00:01:07.979> zero<00:01:08.520> ohms<00:01:08.820> across<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:10.340> I'm<00:01:11.340> set<00:01:11.580> on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
reading zero ohms across it I'm set on

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.550 
reading zero ohms across it I'm set on
the<00:01:11.850> 2k<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:13.229> setting<00:01:14.720> we're<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.869> turning

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the 2k I'm setting we're not turning

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.109 
the 2k I'm setting we're not turning
this<00:01:16.740> handle<00:01:16.950> slightly<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.850> imitating

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
this handle slightly like imitating

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.980 
this handle slightly like imitating
cranking<00:01:21.890> you'll<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.299> top<00:01:24.299> set<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> points

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
cranking you'll see top set of points

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.469 
cranking you'll see top set of points
opens<00:01:25.439> between<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.950> shaft<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.119> bottom

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
opens between the shaft and the bottom

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.899 
opens between the shaft and the bottom
set<00:01:27.689> closes<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.420> opens<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.909> point

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
set closes this actually opens the point

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.249 
set closes this actually opens the point
opens<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.900> point<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.939> stops<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> coil<00:01:36.840> short

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
opens the point and stops the coil short

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.039 
opens the point and stops the coil short
and<00:01:37.470> then<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.829> chicken<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.750> there<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:39.810> three

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and then a chicken see there are three

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.580 
and then a chicken see there are three
hundred<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.470> nine<00:01:40.619> ohms<00:01:40.890> across<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.549> coil<00:01:42.590> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
hundred and nine ohms across the coil so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.870 
hundred and nine ohms across the coil so
that's<00:01:44.450> coil<00:01:45.450> shorted<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:47.070> coil<00:01:47.399> open

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that's coil shorted and that's coil open

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.139 
that's coil shorted and that's coil open
and<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.649> simply<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.070> by<00:01:50.430> doing<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.759> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and that's simply just by doing that so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.969 
and that's simply just by doing that so
when<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> actually<00:01:51.960> crank<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.600> you're<00:01:54.979> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
when you actually crank it you're the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.429 
when you actually crank it you're the
movement<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:57.030> your<00:01:57.360> hand<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.229> not

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
movement of your hand because it's not

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.760 
movement of your hand because it's not
perfect<00:01:59.299> opens<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> closes<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.140> points<00:02:01.590> like

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
perfect opens and closes the points like

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
perfect opens and closes the points like
that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
that

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.440 
that
so<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.330> course<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.730> put<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.060> lock<00:02:07.240> me<00:02:07.420> up

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
so of course if we put a lock me up

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.470 
so of course if we put a lock me up
little<00:02:07.990> buzzer<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.670> here<00:02:12.300> that's<00:02:13.300> what

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
little buzzer in here that's what

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.940 
little buzzer in here that's what
happens<00:02:13.840> when<00:02:14.110> you're<00:02:14.290> cranking<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.800> handle

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
happens when you're cranking the handle

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.190 
happens when you're cranking the handle
the<00:02:15.280> points<00:02:15.640> open<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.090> close<00:02:16.390> causing<00:02:17.110> a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
the points open and close causing a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.930 
the points open and close causing a
short<00:02:17.500> across<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.010> coil<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:18.730> an

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
short across the coil and then an

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.960 
short across the coil and then an
opening<00:02:19.450> across<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.990> coil<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> point

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
opening across the coil when the point

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.070 
opening across the coil when the point
is<00:02:22.060> open<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.510> get<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.720> big<00:02:24.180> voltage<00:02:25.180> surge<00:02:25.450> just

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
is open you get a big voltage surge just

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.040 
is open you get a big voltage surge just
like<00:02:26.290> good<00:02:27.070> old<00:02:27.190> SSG<00:02:27.850> circuit<00:02:28.330> once<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
like good old SSG circuit once the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.790 
like good old SSG circuit once the
transistor<00:02:29.680> opens<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.870> get<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.200> big<00:02:32.350> voltage

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
transistor opens we get that big voltage

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.710 
transistor opens we get that big voltage
surge<00:02:33.070> from<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.520> coil<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:34.330> we<00:02:34.510> use<00:02:34.690> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
surge from the coil which we use to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.130 
surge from the coil which we use to
charge<00:02:35.080> our<00:02:35.290> batteries<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:37.060> works<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.840> a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
charge our batteries and this works in a

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.030 
charge our batteries and this works in a
very<00:02:38.380> similar<00:02:38.740> way<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.880> mechanical<00:02:40.480> setup

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.760 

so<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.340> see<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.670> gap<00:02:45.850> there<00:02:46.060> really<00:02:46.210> good

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
so you can see the gap there really good

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.260 
so you can see the gap there really good
so<00:02:47.770> that's<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.040> coil<00:02:48.430> open<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.030> that's<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
so that's the coil open and that's the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.700 
so that's the coil open and that's the
coil<00:02:49.540> shorted<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.900> what's<00:02:53.080> doing<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.440> noise

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
coil shorted so what's doing that noise

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.190 
coil shorted so what's doing that noise
off<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.700> voltage<00:02:58.090> spikes<00:02:58.510> coming<00:02:58.959> off<00:02:59.170> of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
off and the voltage spikes coming off of

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.550 
off and the voltage spikes coming off of
that<00:02:59.380> when<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.740> coil<00:03:00.010> opens<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:02.320> what

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that when the coil opens and what

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.230 
that when the coil opens and what
happens<00:03:02.920> even<00:03:03.100> though<00:03:03.280> these<00:03:03.580> magnets<00:03:04.090> are

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
happens even though these magnets are

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.510 
happens even though these magnets are
very<00:03:04.270> weak<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.050> they<00:03:05.620> are<00:03:05.770> very<00:03:06.010> weak<00:03:06.220> they're

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
very weak and they are very weak they're

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.080 
very weak and they are very weak they're
battling<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.030> lift<00:03:07.209> up<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.510> three-inch<00:03:07.870> nail

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
battling to lift up a three-inch nail

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.420 
battling to lift up a three-inch nail
when<00:03:10.090> your<00:03:10.420> coil<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:10.959> shorted<00:03:11.470> inside<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> weak

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
when your coil is shorted inside a weak

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.120 
when your coil is shorted inside a weak
magnetic<00:03:12.850> field<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.900> starts<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.560> build<00:03:14.739> up<00:03:14.950> a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
magnetic field it starts to build up a

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.120 
magnetic field it starts to build up a
very<00:03:15.280> strong<00:03:15.640> magnetic<00:03:16.060> field<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.920> when<00:03:17.920> that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
very strong magnetic field and when that

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.040 
very strong magnetic field and when that
coil<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.640> open<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.330> magnetic<00:03:19.780> field

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
coil is open the magnetic field

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.759 
coil is open the magnetic field
collapses<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:22.150> get<00:03:22.420> out<00:03:22.570> quite<00:03:23.320> voltage

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
collapses and we get out quite voltage

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.759 
collapses and we get out quite voltage
surge<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.450> here<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.720> have<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.400> 240<00:03:27.400> volt<00:03:27.430> neon

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
surge so here I have a 240 volt neon

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.900 
surge so here I have a 240 volt neon
just<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:29.920> we<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.190> get<00:03:30.310> some<00:03:30.550> sort<00:03:30.820> of

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
just so we can get some sort of

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.479 
just so we can get some sort of
demonstration<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:32.230> put<00:03:32.709> one<00:03:32.950> end<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:33.280> earth

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
demonstration I put one end on earth

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.960 
demonstration I put one end on earth
which<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.060> one<00:03:34.269> side<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.690> coil<00:03:35.970> and

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
which is one side of the coil and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.890 
which is one side of the coil and
although<00:03:37.600> pin<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.050> up<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.350> little<00:03:38.470> bit<00:03:39.900> I'll

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
although pin this up a little bit I'll

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.180 
although pin this up a little bit I'll
put<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.290> other<00:03:41.440> end<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:44.260> peg<00:03:44.830> that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
put the other end on the peg that

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.940 
put the other end on the peg that
delivers<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.030> power

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.210 

and<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.580> can<00:03:51.790> see<00:03:52.050> just<00:03:53.050> by<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.349> single<00:03:53.890> crank

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
and you can see just by a single crank

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.510 
and you can see just by a single crank
doesn't<00:03:54.730> matter<00:03:54.849> love<00:03:56.069> can't<00:03:57.069> really<00:03:57.370> hold

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
doesn't matter love can't really hold

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.960 
doesn't matter love can't really hold
this<00:03:57.760> still<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.630> hold<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.989> camera'<00:04:02.790> see<00:04:03.790> if<00:04:03.849> I

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
this still and hold the camera' see if I

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.500 
this still and hold the camera' see if I
can<00:04:04.150> sit<00:04:04.390> down<00:04:04.420> here<00:04:05.700> put<00:04:06.700> something<00:04:07.180> under

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
can sit down here put something under

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:27.690 
can sit down here put something under
there<00:04:25.080> get<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.260> voltage<00:04:26.740> over<00:04:27.070> that<00:04:27.280> current

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
there get that voltage over that current

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:58.280 
there get that voltage over that current
surge<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:37.750> can't<00:04:38.110> see<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:43.510> point

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.590 

so<00:04:59.290> that's<00:04:59.470> how<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.680> works

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.620 

simply<00:05:04.650> by<00:05:05.650> coil<00:05:06.040> shorting<00:05:07.260> and<00:05:09.450> this<00:05:10.450> was

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
simply by coil shorting and this was

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.370 
simply by coil shorting and this was
done<00:05:12.060> well<00:05:13.060> there<00:05:13.240> was<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.389> lot<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:13.900> hype<00:05:14.169> about

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
done well there was a lot of hype about

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.670 
done well there was a lot of hype about
it<00:05:14.910> last<00:05:15.910> couple<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.330> years<00:05:16.570> on<00:05:16.630> YouTube<00:05:17.230> about

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
it last couple of years on YouTube about

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.420 
it last couple of years on YouTube about
coil<00:05:18.130> shorting<00:05:19.290> these<00:05:20.290> guys<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:21.010> made<00:05:21.220> this

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
coil shorting these guys that made this

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.400 
coil shorting these guys that made this
actually<00:05:22.419> been<00:05:22.570> doing<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.020> for<00:05:23.169> over<00:05:23.320> a

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
actually been doing it for over a

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.770 
actually been doing it for over a
hundred<00:05:23.620> years<00:05:23.910> just<00:05:24.910> through<00:05:25.210> mechanical

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
hundred years just through mechanical

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.730 
hundred years just through mechanical
points<00:05:27.780> so<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.810> hope<00:05:29.020> that's<00:05:29.200> helped<00:05:29.530> ya<00:05:29.680> a

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
points so I hope that's helped ya a

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:37.290 
points so I hope that's helped ya a
little<00:05:29.919> bit<00:05:30.130> coldest<00:05:34.950> they<00:05:35.950> are<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.550> lot<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.150> say

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
little bit coldest they are a lot to say

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.000 
little bit coldest they are a lot to say
not<00:05:37.540> so<00:05:37.570> good<00:05:37.960> here<00:05:38.169> but<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.990> has<00:05:41.260> of<00:05:41.800> course

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
not so good here but this has of course

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.250 
not so good here but this has of course
that<00:05:42.310> bottom<00:05:42.700> set<00:05:42.910> of<00:05:43.000> points<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.540> this<00:05:43.990> top

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
that bottom set of points and this top

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.800 
that bottom set of points and this top
set<00:05:44.500> of<00:05:44.620> points<00:05:44.979> when<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.310> crank<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.669> handle

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
set of points when you crank the handle

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.240 
set of points when you crank the handle
one<00:05:46.810> closes<00:05:47.320> one<00:05:47.500> opens<00:05:48.960> yeah<00:05:49.960> this<00:05:50.620> one<00:05:50.860> opens

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
one closes one opens yeah this one opens

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.879 
one closes one opens yeah this one opens
and<00:05:51.400> that<00:05:51.490> one<00:05:51.639> closes<00:05:52.210> which<00:05:53.020> delivers<00:05:53.560> our

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
and that one closes which delivers our

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.090 
and that one closes which delivers our
coil<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.250> spike<00:05:55.410> on<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.470> open<00:05:56.919> circuit<00:05:58.050> and

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
coil a spike on the open circuit and

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.010 
coil a spike on the open circuit and
that's<00:06:00.100> basically<00:06:00.460> how<00:06:00.669> it<00:06:00.700> works<00:06:00.790> so<00:06:01.600> your

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
that's basically how it works so your

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.580 
that's basically how it works so your
magnet<00:06:02.380> strength<00:06:03.690> doesn't<00:06:04.690> have<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> lot<00:06:05.290> to<00:06:05.410> do

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
magnet strength doesn't have a lot to do

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.830 
magnet strength doesn't have a lot to do
with<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:06.550> because<00:06:06.940> it<00:06:07.090> builds<00:06:07.330> up<00:06:07.510> its<00:06:07.690> own

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
with it because it builds up its own

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.520 
with it because it builds up its own
magnetic<00:06:08.080> field<00:06:09.210> inside<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.270> machine<00:06:10.780> once

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
magnetic field inside the machine once

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.159 
magnetic field inside the machine once
the<00:06:11.860> points<00:06:12.460> are<00:06:12.970> closed<00:06:13.330> and<00:06:13.630> the<00:06:13.690> coil<00:06:13.990> is

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
the points are closed and the coil is

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.140 
the points are closed and the coil is
shorted<00:06:14.590> just<00:06:15.430> like<00:06:15.610> any<00:06:15.820> generator<00:06:17.850> and<00:06:18.850> when

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
shorted just like any generator and when

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.870 
shorted just like any generator and when
those<00:06:19.360> points<00:06:19.990> become<00:06:20.320> open<00:06:20.680> we<00:06:21.430> get<00:06:21.580> our<00:06:21.700> high

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
those points become open we get our high

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.930 
those points become open we get our high
voltage<00:06:22.300> surge<00:06:22.950> from<00:06:23.950> the<00:06:24.160> coil<00:06:24.460> when<00:06:24.760> the

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
voltage surge from the coil when the

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.219 
voltage surge from the coil when the
magnetic<00:06:25.390> field<00:06:25.600> collapses<00:06:26.140> around<00:06:26.260> it<00:06:26.530> okay

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
magnetic field collapses around it okay

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.500 
magnetic field collapses around it okay
so<00:06:29.229> what<00:06:29.770> I<00:06:30.130> purchase<00:06:30.850> on<00:06:30.970> the<00:06:31.060> floor<00:06:31.210> make<00:06:31.450> you

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
so what I purchase on the floor make you

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.490 
so what I purchase on the floor make you
have<00:06:31.600> a<00:06:31.630> look<00:06:31.840> at<00:06:31.900> it<00:06:31.990> and<00:06:32.110> see<00:06:32.229> if<00:06:32.260> it<00:06:32.380> helps

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
have a look at it and see if it helps

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.130 
have a look at it and see if it helps
you<00:06:32.710> out<00:06:32.740> in<00:06:32.919> any<00:06:33.010> way<00:06:33.160> but<00:06:33.789> yeah<00:06:34.330> 300<00:06:34.930> plus

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
you out in any way but yeah 300 plus

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.440 
you out in any way but yeah 300 plus
ohms<00:06:35.470> on<00:06:35.979> the<00:06:36.250> coil<00:06:36.490> so<00:06:36.820> you<00:06:36.880> do<00:06:37.240> have<00:06:37.270> some

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
ohms on the coil so you do have some

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.870 
ohms on the coil so you do have some
warning<00:06:37.990> to<00:06:38.110> do<00:06:38.340> if<00:06:39.340> you<00:06:39.580> are<00:06:39.760> going<00:06:39.970> to<00:06:40.180> rewind

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
warning to do if you are going to rewind

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.840 
warning to do if you are going to rewind
alright<00:06:42.880> Cheers<00:06:43.210> under<00:06:43.479> 10<00:06:43.630> min
