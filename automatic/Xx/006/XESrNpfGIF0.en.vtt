zerglings<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.159> the

zerglings right here as you can see the
turn<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> immediately<00:01:30.840> shoot<00:01:31.380> right

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
turn you can immediately shoot right

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.870 
turn you can immediately shoot right
there<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.829> boost<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.430> forth<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
there just boost back and forth and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.359 
there just boost back and forth and
shoot<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> lane<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.740> looking<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.220> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
shoot the lane if I'm looking this way I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.890 
shoot the lane if I'm looking this way I
have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> rotate<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.150> way<00:01:36.270> around<00:01:36.360> taking

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
have to rotate all the way around taking

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
have to rotate all the way around taking
another<00:01:37.229> split<00:01:37.530> second<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.280> sometimes<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
another split second and sometimes you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.609 
another split second and sometimes you
don't<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> split<00:01:39.509> second<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.439> that's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
don't have that split second and that's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.800 
don't have that split second and that's
very<00:01:40.829> important

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
very important

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.840 
very important
so<00:01:41.960> they<00:01:42.619> go<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.010> little<00:01:43.220> bit<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.640> little

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
so they go a little bit there a little

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.830 
so they go a little bit there a little
bit<00:01:44.030> here<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:44.299> I'm<00:01:44.420> always<00:01:44.540> using

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
bit here but I'm always using

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.050 
bit here but I'm always using
right-click<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.470> pick<00:01:45.650> up<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.430> then<00:01:46.640> I'm<00:01:46.850> Dee

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
right-click to pick up and then I'm Dee

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.399

clicking on the top of the medivac while
I'm<00:01:48.530> moving<00:01:48.799> this<00:01:48.920> was<00:01:49.100> an<00:01:49.190> old<00:01:49.549> quick<00:01:49.820> tip<00:01:50.030> but

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
I'm moving this was an old quick tip but

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.210 
I'm moving this was an old quick tip but
as<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.259> can<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:51.440> just<00:01:51.770> trying<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.009> make<00:01:52.130> sure

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
as you can see just trying to make sure

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.560 
as you can see just trying to make sure
the<00:01:52.310> medivac<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.759> always<00:01:52.940> facing<00:01:53.299> towards<00:01:53.540> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
the medivac is always facing towards the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.920 
the medivac is always facing towards the
zerglings<00:01:54.020> but<00:01:54.110> I'm<00:01:54.200> maximum<00:01:54.590> damage<00:01:54.770> though

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
zerglings but I'm maximum damage though

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.999 
zerglings but I'm maximum damage though
otherwise<00:01:56.930> you're<00:01:57.200> gonna<00:01:57.259> take<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.680> extra
