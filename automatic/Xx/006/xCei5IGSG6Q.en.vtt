00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.630
 hello friends welcome to a new appointment 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.830
 with chess 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.830
 we have a position 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.139
 in which we see 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.789
 both white and black have 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.039
 a good attack is worth and they have their 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.029
 advantage 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:30.050
 ok we see the white ones that have a 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:34.470
 semi open column dominated by two 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.740
 towers we also have 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.500
 a battery of bishop and lady pointing 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.920
 directly by the large diagonal towards 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.140
 the black castling that can create many 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.630
 threats 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.980
 and on the part of black we see a lady 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.250
 centralized that you can also create 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.530
 tactical issues an open column 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.340
 dominated by the black tower 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.460
 OK 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.450
 and in the case that it is their turn to move 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.070
 the black ones for the video try 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.380
 guess the correct movement is worth 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.570
 well the correct movement of the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.720
 Black would be a subject of attraction and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.730
 attraction of the king towards a square 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.520
 key 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.230
 in which you would be stuck in a network 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.200
 of mate 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.990
 the play is a sacrifice of the tower 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.990
 in the column h tower 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.510
 h 1 check 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:48.560
 and we see that after king by h1 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.740
 Black gets a checkmate with 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.549
 lady of c-1 check 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.920
 the column is in box h 2 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.229
 evidently controlled by the pawn the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.229
 King has fallen into the net of mate worth 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.230
 It's worth directly you could not give the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.230
 checkmate because, but with a theme 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.220
 the theme of attraction is achieved 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.000
 divert the king to bring this 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.650
 box with the sacrifice of tower and 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.500
 Its just a simple matte check 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.490
 by the rules 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.040
 it is clear well in the case that they 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.510
 touch move to white well 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.510
 they have tactical motives 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.870
 and win the game 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.629
 for the video try to guess by 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.430
 yourselves how this is earned 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:57.109
 position by white 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.500
 and in the move of the white would be tower 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.910
 because 6 check 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.040
 now evidently 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.550
 Black can not come to this box 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.310
 why 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.620
 as we have seen before the great diagonal 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.130
 has it dominated 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.670
 the range battery is finally worth 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.770
 obviously they can not be covered either 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.870
 because with the simple 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:29.220
 tower x 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.330
 it's 7 would be javier matÃ© are bound to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.410
 eat of bishop sacrifice of tower eat 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.930
 with the bishop 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.080
 and now 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.290
 Well lady is 6 check 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.000
 It's worth the same as before they can not come 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.060
 here to this box because it's 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.350
 controlled by the diagonal alfil 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.620
 with which they have left or to cover themselves with the 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.840
 alfil backing or covered with 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.690
 tower let's see if they plugged with the 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:09.250
 bishop what happens if this 'blackout' is 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.440
 simply say lady g4 check 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.470
 and Black does not have any choice 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.709
 that tower g7 and lady because 7 checkmate 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.340
 and the bishop and queen battery has 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.060
 concluded the play is worth 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.060
 we go back 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.199
 well if they are covered with this tower it 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.900
 can now cover with this tower or with 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:43.130
 this other let's see first if it 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:47.830
 they cover up with this tower 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.230
 lady for g6 check 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.460
 the same can not go there because it is 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:59.520
 controlled by the bishop and yes 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:02.090
 only play tower g7 for lady for g 7 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.090
 checkmate 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:15.589
 that is, as a rook and bishop , 

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:18.019
 can cover and even the only 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:21.199
 played the only line that would be left 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:23.289
 it would be covered with this tower but 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:27.139
 after d 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.030
 8 check lady 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.810
 the king can not move here because the 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.800
 has diagonally controlled 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.659
 very important controlled by the end with 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.860
 which has to go back to 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.860
 cover yourself with the tower 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.479
 the battery lady bishop in the great 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:54.900
 diagonal is very powerful and now lady by 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:57.240
 g6 check and again we go back to the 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.630
 position of before with 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:05.639
 the tower covering the king to finish 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.740
 the lady gave for 7 javier tablecloth 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.370
