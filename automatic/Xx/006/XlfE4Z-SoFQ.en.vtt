00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.790 
Max because she's lost her mother she's
lost<00:02:24.080> her<00:02:24.260> brother<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:25.840> Max<00:02:26.840> has<00:02:27.050> also<00:02:27.230> lost

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
lost her brother and Max has also lost

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.490 
lost her brother and Max has also lost
his<00:02:28.010> mother<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:31.120> think<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.239> Liesel<00:02:32.690> she<00:02:32.959> she

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
his mother and I think in Liesel she she

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.710 
his mother and I think in Liesel she she
she<00:02:34.340> feels<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:34.879> displaced<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:37.519> think<00:02:38.450> she

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
she feels so displaced and I think she

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.780 
she feels so displaced and I think she
finds<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.230> real<00:02:39.379> kindred<00:02:39.799> spirit<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.310> Max<00:02:40.519> and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
finds a real kindred spirit and Max and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.309 
finds a real kindred spirit and Max and
finds<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.120> bit<00:02:41.269> of<00:02:41.330> an<00:02:41.420> older<00:02:41.660> brother<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.110> Max

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
finds a bit of an older brother and Max

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.420 
finds a bit of an older brother and Max
and<00:02:42.910> um<00:02:43.910> he's<00:02:44.840> someone<00:02:45.470> new<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.860> he's<00:02:46.069> someone

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
and um he's someone new and he's someone

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.449 
and um he's someone new and he's someone
who<00:02:46.549> doesn't<00:02:46.760> belong<00:02:47.150> either<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:49.010> think

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
who doesn't belong either and I think

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.210 
who doesn't belong either and I think
she<00:02:49.730> has<00:02:49.879> a<00:02:49.910> real<00:02:50.150> sense<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.829> not<00:02:51.829> belonging

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
she has a real sense of not belonging

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.050 
she has a real sense of not belonging
and<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.069> think<00:02:55.160> they<00:02:55.430> really<00:02:55.459> see<00:02:55.910> that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and and so I think they really see that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.120 
and and so I think they really see that
in<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.209> another

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.840
