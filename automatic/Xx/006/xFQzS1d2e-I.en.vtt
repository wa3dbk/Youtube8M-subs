00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.870
 in the sequence that ended up getting ne 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.340
 to complete the trip there is fine, but he 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.960
 used the nitros then 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.050

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.050
 candidate who is not 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.360
 identified he sent a gta 5oc and that 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.820
 happens when the guy does not identify himself 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.260
 I am obliged to put here only one 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.690

 dude he is using the racket 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.450

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.190
 bike is invisible and he is using 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.330
 a skin of a muscular face in the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.250
 his character 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.290
