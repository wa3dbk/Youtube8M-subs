00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
below so the first major change coming

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.680 
below so the first major change coming
soon<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.530> spawn<00:00:37.829> system<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
soon is the spawn system as right now it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.520 
soon is the spawn system as right now it
is<00:00:39.870> probably<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> most<00:00:40.760> rage<00:00:41.760> inducing

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
is probably the most rage inducing

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.350 
is probably the most rage inducing
factor<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.010> game<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.460> anthony<00:00:44.940> award<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
factor in the game and anthony award is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
factor in the game and anthony award is
very<00:00:45.539> aware<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.710> situation<00:00:46.920> actually

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
very aware of the situation actually

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.330 
very aware of the situation actually
gathered<00:00:48.090> information<00:00:48.649> from<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.890> past<00:00:50.100> five

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
gathered information from the past five

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
gathered information from the past five
weeks<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.789> did<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.629> play<00:00:51.899> test<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
weeks and did a first play test of the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920 
weeks and did a first play test of the
new<00:00:52.710> system<00:00:53.010> recently<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.629> really

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
new system recently so this is really

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
new system recently so this is really
good<00:00:55.230> news<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.070> probably<00:00:56.399> mean

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
good news because it will probably mean

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.639 
good news because it will probably mean
that<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.910> won't<00:00:57.090> spawn<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> front<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.530> an

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that we won't spawn right in front of an

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
that we won't spawn right in front of an
enemy<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.190> die<00:00:59.579> within<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> first<00:01:00.030> 30<00:01:00.420> seconds

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
enemy or die within the first 30 seconds

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.799 
enemy or die within the first 30 seconds
of<00:01:00.750> spawning<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:02.250> opinion<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.030> probably

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
of spawning in my opinion it's probably

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.020 
of spawning in my opinion it's probably
one<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> biggest<00:01:04.710> issues<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.850> game

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
one of the biggest issues in the game

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
one of the biggest issues in the game

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and if you agree and want the spawn

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219
