my hard-wired need for facts I decided

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
my hard-wired need for facts I decided
to<00:01:26.190> try<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.060> remedies<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

to try some of these remedies that
people<00:01:28.020> insist<00:01:28.470> work<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.320> Vaseline<00:01:31.320> these

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
people insist work one is Vaseline these

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.130 
people insist work one is Vaseline these
are<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.130> supposed<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.850> work<00:01:32.940> as<00:01:33.390> mold

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
are all supposed to work as mold

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.840 
are all supposed to work as mold
releases<00:01:35.630> for<00:01:37.130> mold<00:01:38.130> putty<00:01:38.370> like<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
releases for mold putty like this

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.660 
releases for mold putty like this
amazing<00:01:39.150> mold<00:01:39.510> putty<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:39.870> for<00:01:40.470> candy<00:01:40.950> molds<00:01:41.460> or

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
amazing mold putty or for candy molds or

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.350 
amazing mold putty or for candy molds or
things<00:01:42.510> that<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.440> work<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.950> up

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
things that really don't work well up

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.390 
things that really don't work well up
traditionally<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.990> resin<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.370> to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
traditionally with resin so I'm going to

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.190 
traditionally with resin so I'm going to
try<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.200> Vaseline<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:50.780> armor-all<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
try it Vaseline is one armor-all is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.440 
try it Vaseline is one armor-all is
another<00:01:54.290> wd-40<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.500> another<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:57.030> believe<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
another wd-40 is another and believe it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.050 
another wd-40 is another and believe it
or<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.920> cooking<00:01:58.920> spray<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.760> butter

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
or not cooking spray this is butter

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.450 
or not cooking spray this is butter
flavored<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.750> hope<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> will<00:02:01.410> not<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:02.130> any

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
flavored I hope that will not have any

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.870 
flavored I hope that will not have any
impact<00:02:02.930> on<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.200> experiment<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.700> what

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
impact on the experiment but that's what

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.080 
impact on the experiment but that's what
I<00:02:05.910> had<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.500> use<00:02:07.710> butter<00:02:08.220> butter

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
I had so I'm going to use butter butter

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to treat these molds each one is going

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.510 
to treat these molds each one is going
to<00:02:18.600> get<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> different<00:02:19.230> treatment<00:02:19.530> I've<00:02:19.890> got

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.820 
to get a different treatment I've got
some<00:02:20.760> resin<00:02:21.120> mixed<00:02:21.450> up

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
some resin mixed up

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.900 
some resin mixed up
and<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.030> pour<00:02:23.680> four<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:25.190> these

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
and I'm going to pour four of these

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.200 
and I'm going to pour four of these
using<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:27.470> stuff<00:02:27.860> as<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.190> mold<00:02:28.550> release<00:02:28.880> and

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
using this stuff as a mold release and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.740 
using this stuff as a mold release and
see<00:02:29.510> if<00:02:29.840> any<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.770> them<00:02:30.950> work<00:02:31.450> with<00:02:32.450> amazing

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
see if any of them work with amazing

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.580 
see if any of them work with amazing
mold<00:02:33.170> putty<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.680> am<00:02:34.400> NOT<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.940> tried<00:02:35.780> armor-all

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
mold putty I am NOT I tried armor-all

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.210 
mold putty I am NOT I tried armor-all
long<00:02:37.310> time<00:02:37.670> ago<00:02:38.080> didn't<00:02:39.080> work<00:02:39.260> at<00:02:39.560> all

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
long time ago didn't work at all

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.040 
long time ago didn't work at all
so<00:02:40.430> I'll<00:02:41.330> try<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.720> again<00:02:42.490> just<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:43.670> satisfy

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
so I'll try it again just to satisfy

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.020 
so I'll try it again just to satisfy
this<00:02:45.050> debate<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.740> my<00:02:46.250> sense<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.760> curiosity

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
this debate and my sense of curiosity

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
this debate and my sense of curiosity
and<00:02:47.570> need<00:02:48.020> for<00:02:48.500> facts<00:02:49.600> that's<00:02:50.600> it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
and need for facts that's it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.650 
and need for facts that's it
so<00:02:51.650> I'm<00:02:52.160> going<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.460> just<00:02:52.640> spray<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.270> little<00:02:53.360> in

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
so I'm going to just spray a little in

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.390 
so I'm going to just spray a little in
there<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.080> swirl<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:54.740> around<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.580> see<00:02:56.480> how<00:02:57.400> by

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
there and swirl it around and see how by
