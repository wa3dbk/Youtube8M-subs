hello<00:00:01.110> I'm<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.070> show<00:00:02.250> you<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.490> to

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hello I'm going to show you how to

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.550 
hello I'm going to show you how to
remove<00:00:02.760> air<00:00:03.149> from<00:00:03.270> our<00:00:03.600> water<00:00:04.080> loop<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.500> a

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
remove air from our water loop in a

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.400 
remove air from our water loop in a
computer<00:00:05.330> if<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.480> notice<00:00:06.720> sure<00:00:06.839> what<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> level

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
computer if you notice sure what a level

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.669 
computer if you notice sure what a level
has<00:00:07.529> went<00:00:07.710> up<00:00:08.360> that<00:00:09.360> means<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:10.110> potentially

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
has went up that means that potentially

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.030 
has went up that means that potentially
the<00:00:11.099> air<00:00:11.250> has<00:00:11.490> moved<00:00:11.639> around<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.000> system<00:00:13.040> so

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the air has moved around the system so

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.320 
the air has moved around the system so
first<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.429> all<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.700> need<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.849> equalize<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
first of all you need to equalize the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.960 
first of all you need to equalize the
pressure<00:00:15.859> so<00:00:16.859> remove<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> cap<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.820> your

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
pressure so remove the cap on your

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.510 
pressure so remove the cap on your
reservoir<00:00:18.980> obviously<00:00:19.980> take<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.220> power<00:00:20.400> off

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
reservoir obviously take the power off

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
reservoir obviously take the power off
your<00:00:20.550> computer<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:22.080> case<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:22.500> water

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
your computer just in case some water

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.660 
your computer just in case some water
comes<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.750> its<00:00:24.750> allies<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.199> I've<00:00:25.289> done<00:00:25.410> here

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
comes out its allies what I've done here

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
comes out its allies what I've done here
as<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> label<00:00:28.109> has<00:00:28.230> been

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
as you can see what the label has been

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.780 
as you can see what the label has been
back<00:00:28.590> down<00:00:28.800> again<00:00:31.309> but<00:00:32.309> there's<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.669> learning

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
back down again but there's a learning

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.400 
back down again but there's a learning
system<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:34.130> know<00:00:35.130> s<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.180> clicked<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
system I know s if it was clicked in the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
system I know s if it was clicked in the
top<00:00:37.590> radiator<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> bike<00:00:39.329> paint

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
top radiator you can see the bike paint

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.540 
top radiator you can see the bike paint
there<00:00:40.399> was<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> collection<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.940> ear<00:00:46.219> now<00:00:47.219> due<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
there was a collection of ear now due to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.410 
there was a collection of ear now due to
the<00:00:47.760> flow<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> water<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:50.579> last<00:00:50.969> thing<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the flow of water the last thing in the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.250 
the flow of water the last thing in the
loop<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.140> by<00:00:52.550> 120<00:00:53.550> ammonia<00:00:53.910> Rydia<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
loop is up by 120 ammonia Rydia so I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.630 
loop is up by 120 ammonia Rydia so I
have<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> put<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> computer<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.370> front

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
have to put a computer on this front

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
have to put a computer on this front
here<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.960> force<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> air<00:00:58.469> through<00:00:58.710> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
here just to force the air through that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.010 
here just to force the air through that
radiator<00:01:04.820> as<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.570> coming

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
radiator as you can see it now coming

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.800 
radiator as you can see it now coming
back<00:01:07.170> over<00:01:07.850> let's<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:08.970> fire<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.540> pump

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
back over let's this fire like a pump

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.399 
back over let's this fire like a pump
and<00:01:10.320> reservoir<00:01:11.100> combined<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.260> do

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and reservoir combined and so you can do

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.240 
and reservoir combined and so you can do
that<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> pump<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> razor<00:01:16.950> fire

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that if you have a pump and razor fire

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
that if you have a pump and razor fire
which<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.490> actually<00:01:17.939> part<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> computer

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
which is actually part of the computer

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
which is actually part of the computer
as<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.549> eyeball<00:01:20.549> taqdeer

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
as an eyeball taqdeer

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.480 
as an eyeball taqdeer
or<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> five<00:01:22.290> french<00:01:22.740> beads<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
or one of the five french beads at the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.080 
or one of the five french beads at the
front<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> computer<00:01:24.740> then<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.759> do

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
front of the computer then you can do

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.569 
front of the computer then you can do
this<00:01:27.259> you'll<00:01:28.259> know<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.710> gonna<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:28.979> 100%

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
this you'll know that I'm gonna get 100%

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.960 
this you'll know that I'm gonna get 100%
in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> inner<00:01:30.210> inner<00:01:30.450> system<00:01:30.770> by<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.970> moving

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
in the inner inner system by just moving

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.690 
in the inner inner system by just moving
your<00:01:33.150> computer<00:01:33.540> vocal<00:01:33.960> slightly<00:01:34.700> you've

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
your computer vocal slightly you've

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.190 
your computer vocal slightly you've
really<00:01:35.939> got<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.540> which<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.869> Luke's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really got to do this which is Luke's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.010 
really got to do this which is Luke's
extreme<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.490> gets<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
extreme but it gets all you know and it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
extreme but it gets all you know and it
just<00:01:40.049> kills<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:40.590> efficiently<00:01:41.090> as<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> can

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just kills more efficiently as you can

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.819 
just kills more efficiently as you can
see<00:01:42.540> yellow<00:01:42.780> tops<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.770> I'm

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
see yellow tops I don't know so I'm

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.940 
see yellow tops I don't know so I'm
getting<00:01:44.130> even<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.549> ear<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
getting even more ear so it's not the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
getting even more ear so it's not the
best<00:01:47.100> process<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.820> doing<00:01:48.149> ideally<00:01:48.720> am<00:01:48.810> two

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
best process to be doing ideally am two

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.880 
best process to be doing ideally am two
people<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.729> doing<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.119> but<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.740> see

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
people can be doing this but you can see

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.219 
people can be doing this but you can see
how<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.130> air<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.399> chemo<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.780> starting

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.349 

that's<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.409> last<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.859> he'll<00:02:02.039> know

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.550 

obviously<00:02:06.359> there<00:02:06.509> were<00:02:06.569> no<00:02:06.689> poet<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.140> computer

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
obviously there were no poet in computer

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.969 
obviously there were no poet in computer
apart<00:02:08.369> from<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.660> pump<00:02:09.869> running<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.410> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
apart from of the pump running here so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.860 
apart from of the pump running here so
you'll<00:02:11.430> use<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> separate<00:02:12.090> power<00:02:12.239> supply<00:02:12.299> just

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you'll use a separate power supply just

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.570 
you'll use a separate power supply just
to<00:02:13.349> keep<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> pump<00:02:13.860> running<00:02:14.069> which<00:02:14.280> helps

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
to keep the pump running which helps

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.470
