connected<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.750> let's<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.260> happens<00:00:56.270> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.330 

we<00:01:05.549> still<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.030> some<00:01:06.330> skips<00:01:06.799> but<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.130> not

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
we still get some skips but it is not

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.300 
we still get some skips but it is not
nearly<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.330> bad<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.259> before<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.070> see

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
nearly as bad as before you can see

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.920 
nearly as bad as before you can see
where<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.119> palm<00:01:12.509> protection<00:01:13.729> took

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
where the palm protection took

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.270 
where the palm protection took
impression<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.320> poem<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.130> that's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
impression from my poem there and that's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.570 
impression from my poem there and that's
where<00:01:17.399> that<00:01:17.670> skip<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.990> ink<00:01:19.619> flows<00:01:20.159> much

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
where that skip was but ink flows much

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
where that skip was but ink flows much
more<00:01:20.880> smoothly<00:01:21.890> here<00:01:23.659> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.200> say<00:01:25.470> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
more smoothly here and I would say that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.609 
more smoothly here and I would say that
this<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.220> probably<00:01:26.940> what<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> makers<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.289> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this is probably what the makers of this

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.850 
this is probably what the makers of this
particular<00:01:28.950> device<00:01:29.490> were<00:01:29.789> looking<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.649> if

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
