00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this indicates that we actually can go

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.390 
this indicates that we actually can go
quite<00:01:39.570> far<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.170> haven't<00:01:40.380> used<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.979> single

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
quite far I haven't used a single

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.050 
quite far I haven't used a single
guardian<00:01:41.850> shield<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.329> now<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> died<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> shield

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
guardian shield but now I died so shield

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.570 
guardian shield but now I died so shield
no<00:01:47.149> bad<00:01:48.149> res

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.760 

and<00:01:52.580> normally<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.900> idea<00:01:54.260> was<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:56.740> when<00:01:57.740> I

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
and normally the idea was that when I

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.520 
and normally the idea was that when I
die<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.909> who<00:01:59.479> was<00:01:59.630> supposed<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.110> use<00:02:00.320> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
die then who was supposed to use the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.469 
die then who was supposed to use the
shield<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.780> was<00:02:03.080> supposed<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.710> wait<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:05.360> be

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
shield and I was supposed to wait to be

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.080 
shield and I was supposed to wait to be
resurrected<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:06.409> three<00:02:06.680> turns<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.910> way

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
resurrected for three turns and that way

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.760 
resurrected for three turns and that way
you<00:02:08.149> can<00:02:08.450> actually<00:02:09.070> get<00:02:10.420> more<00:02:11.420> out<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:12.050> also

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
you can actually get more out of it also

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.050 
you can actually get more out of it also
with<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.010> guardian<00:02:13.430> shield<00:02:13.610> if<00:02:13.850> you're<00:02:14.030> a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060

knight don't cast your skills very fast
weight<00:02:18.739> as<00:02:19.459> much<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.060> can<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.569> then<00:02:20.630> press

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
weight as much as you can and then press

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.979 
weight as much as you can and then press
some<00:02:21.830> late<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.550> take<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.000> longer<00:02:23.450> plastic

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
some late and take the longer plastic

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.540 
some late and take the longer plastic
ones<00:02:24.170> because<00:02:24.500> then<00:02:24.650> actually<00:02:25.040> your<00:02:25.190> shield

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
ones because then actually your shield

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.940 
ones because then actually your shield
works<00:02:25.850> much<00:02:26.180> more<00:02:26.420> than<00:02:26.630> three<00:02:26.870> turns<00:02:27.170> so

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
works much more than three turns so

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.530 
works much more than three turns so
that's<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.280> trick<00:02:28.640> for<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:32.180> that's<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that's a trick for you so that's a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.990 
that's a trick for you so that's a

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.690 
rest i would not sure if i should be
using<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.560> because<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:25.040> actually<00:04:25.130> had<00:04:25.550> the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
using it because we actually had the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.550 
using it because we actually had the
thief<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.630> think<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.020> might<00:04:27.230> have<00:04:27.350> given

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
thief and I think you might have given

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.340 
thief and I think you might have given
more<00:04:27.980> resurrections<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.910> others<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.480> it's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
more resurrections to others so it's

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.820 
more resurrections to others so it's
always<00:04:30.500> good<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:30.980> keep<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:32.240> last<00:04:32.480> one<00:04:33.169> true

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
always good to keep the last one true

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.570 
always good to keep the last one true
myself<00:04:34.669> I<00:04:35.140> don't<00:04:36.140> have<00:04:36.290> too<00:04:36.680> much<00:04:36.830> rage<00:04:37.280> to

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
myself I don't have too much rage to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.690 
myself I don't have too much rage to
cast<00:04:37.850> my<00:04:38.090> alternates<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.590> have<00:04:39.800> one<00:04:40.160> Vulcan
