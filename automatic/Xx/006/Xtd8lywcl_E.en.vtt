00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
even better word than well I would use

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:09.230 
even better word than well I would use
if<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.070> could<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.550> one

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300

yeah<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.060> new<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.440> actually

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
yeah that's new you know and we actually

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.430 
yeah that's new you know and we actually
use<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> front-end

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
use that a lot that's just a front-end

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.440 
use that a lot that's just a front-end
reverb<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.520> we've<00:01:20.820> been<00:01:20.970> using<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
reverb right we've been using that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.660 
reverb right we've been using that
before<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.050> input<00:01:22.350> sounded<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.950> nice<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
before the input sounded really nice and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.749 
before the input sounded really nice and
you<00:01:23.940> know<00:01:24.509> typically<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> use<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.560> Bogner<00:01:26.070> for

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you know typically we use the Bogner for

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.680 
you know typically we use the Bogner for
dirty<00:01:28.070> paired<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.430> diamond<00:01:29.940> these<00:01:30.390> two

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
dirty paired with the diamond these two

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.950 
dirty paired with the diamond these two
we'd<00:01:30.899> record<00:01:32.390> everything<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.540> that's<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we'd record everything with that's the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.649 
we'd record everything with that's the
rhythm<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.440> there<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> diamond<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.659> not

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
rhythm right there the diamond and not

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
rhythm right there the diamond and not
this<00:01:36.899> one<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.250> house<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.729> doesn't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
this one the one at my house it doesn't

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.020 
this one the one at my house it doesn't
travel<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.750> leave<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.440> on<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.789> truck<00:01:41.789> or

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
travel or leave or go on a truck or

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.749 
travel or leave or go on a truck or
anything<00:01:42.270> stays<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.080> home<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:44.039> so<00:01:44.369> that's<00:01:44.550> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
anything stays at home but so that's the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
anything stays at home but so that's the
the<00:01:45.000> root<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.660> of<00:01:45.929> all<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.410> dirty<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the root of the of all the dirty that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.450 
the root of the of all the dirty that
you<00:01:47.100> hear

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.120 

what<00:01:56.090> solo<00:01:56.480> do<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.720> think<00:01:56.930> up<00:01:57.050> first<00:01:57.440> on<00:01:57.830> this

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
what solo do you think up first on this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.190 
what solo do you think up first on this
album<00:01:58.340> there's<00:01:59.060> only<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.360> couple<00:01:59.390> there's<00:01:59.990> one

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
album there's only a couple there's one

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.270 
album there's only a couple there's one
first<00:02:00.530> dimensioned

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
first dimensioned

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.880 
first dimensioned
I<00:02:01.310> mean<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.610> must<00:02:01.940> have<00:02:02.260> tried<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.320> thousand

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
I mean I must have tried a thousand

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.350 
I mean I must have tried a thousand
different<00:02:04.250> routes<00:02:04.430> on<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.910> one<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.270> that's

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
different routes on that one and that's

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.520 
different routes on that one and that's
just<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.810> one<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.200> we<00:02:06.380> used<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.410> know

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
just the one that we used but you know

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.860 
just the one that we used but you know
it's<00:02:09.800> hard<00:02:09.890> because<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:11.060> ones<00:02:11.240> I<00:02:11.540> kind<00:02:11.840> of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
it's hard because I the ones I kind of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.750 
it's hard because I the ones I kind of
put<00:02:12.110> off<00:02:12.260> recording<00:02:12.920> them<00:02:13.040> until<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> end<00:02:13.550> and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
put off recording them until the end and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.450 
put off recording them until the end and
then<00:02:13.850> we<00:02:14.000> got<00:02:14.150> slammed<00:02:14.720> with<00:02:14.930> time<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.710> we

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
then we got slammed with time so we

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.680 
then we got slammed with time so we
probably<00:02:16.610> could<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.030> had<00:02:17.150> some<00:02:17.330> more<00:02:17.480> time

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
probably could have had some more time

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.270 
probably could have had some more time
but<00:02:17.870> they<00:02:17.990> got<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.290> done<00:02:18.440> at<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.710> last<00:02:18.860> day<00:02:19.220> so

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
but they got it done at the last day so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.600 
but they got it done at the last day so
we<00:02:19.670> could<00:02:19.820> get<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.030> out<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.930> 3/11<00:02:21.610> basically

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
we could get it out on 3/11 basically

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.490 
we could get it out on 3/11 basically
that<00:02:23.300> was<00:02:23.450> one<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> cool<00:02:23.990> things<00:02:24.320> about

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that was one of the cool things about

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.470 
that was one of the cool things about
the<00:02:24.860> recording<00:02:25.250> processes<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.940> had<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.450> had

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the recording processes we had a we had

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.840 
the recording processes we had a we had
a<00:02:26.600> definite<00:02:27.110> deadline<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.770> we<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.160> knew<00:02:28.460> and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
a definite deadline that we all knew and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.390 
a definite deadline that we all knew and
and<00:02:29.510> even<00:02:29.930> with<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> bunch<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.590> time<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.310> we

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
and even with a bunch of time that we

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.940 
and even with a bunch of time that we
kind<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.730> set<00:02:32.210> out<00:02:32.240> with<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:33.290> plenty<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.740> time

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
kind of set out with it's plenty of time

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.730 
kind of set out with it's plenty of time
we'll<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.340> plenty<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.850> time<00:02:35.080> real<00:02:36.080> fast<00:02:36.380> yeah

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740

and<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.720> pressure<00:02:38.930> worked<00:02:39.230> for<00:02:39.470> us<00:02:39.590> a

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
and I think the pressure worked for us a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.620 
and I think the pressure worked for us a
little<00:02:39.860> bit<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.520> know<00:02:40.640> well<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.240> think<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.480> went
