00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.980
 Hello everyone, Swami channel without wires and 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.960
 the topic of today's video lesson is like 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.100
 connect two computers to the internet 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.850
 through the switch the first thing we need 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.430
 here 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.260
 learn for yourself this scheme will 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.880
 be connected and so the scheme 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.050
 will look like this 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.429
 the way that is, we have a computer 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.140
 host computer that is already connected 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.150
 to internet 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.880
 we want to connect this computer 2 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.740
 or several computers 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.300
 through the switch so the first computer 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.520
 connected to the internet in this computer 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.160
 need to install additional network 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.620
 map to this holy picture we connect 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.350
 switch and connect all to the candle 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.990
 the remaining additional computers are one 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.430
 or more so that 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.560
 computer to provide Internet access 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.220
 but also a matter of course, to combine them 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.220
 to local network 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.770
 the first computer should be enough 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.590
 powerful to work as a server 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.180
 and it must also be constantly 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.950
 included to provide 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.020
 internet and other computers i.e. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.490
 when you turn off the main computer in 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.840
 other computers internet 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.630
 automatic park disappear acted 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.730
 all this is taken into account and made hooked up 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.000
 you can proceed to customize settings 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.340
 carried out as follows we go 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.200
 in the control panel of the control panel we 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.790
 find the Internet section further 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.860
 Network and Sharing Center 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.840
 here we select the change section 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.140
 adapter parameters and find 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.300
 find out here 2 2 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.060
 ethernet interface connections 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.000
 you should be il-2 and these two 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 connect for me should be in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.920
 computer which we designated as in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.850
 computer host computer server in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.670
 other computers 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 ethernet connections 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.320
 one is enough so the first 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.630
 resident connection this about connection 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 through which enters the computer 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.970
 internet and it should already be configured 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.620
 according to the mood from the provider which 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.320
 held you cable your room if with 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.970
 this order we are on this connection 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.880
 click the right mouse button select 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.530
 here the property point is here such 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.820
 a section called access in this 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.500
 section we put a tick to allow 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.790
 other network users use 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.040
 internet connection given 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.130
 Subway computer box is checked, must 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.900
 be faithful okay and save changes 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.660
 after that then 2 network card 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.540
 should automatically get ip-address 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.700
 192 168 01 well, in principle, three 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.300
 network card we can no longer touch 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.590
 we go to the settings already 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.240
 additional computers those who 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.890
 for which we need to configure 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.670
 Internet setting is carried out 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.290
 as follows we all go 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.820
 all these internet network management centers 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.910
 and choose here with shared access 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.190
 change the parameters of the adapter we find 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.170
 our and network interface connections 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.380
 follow me by right button 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.020
 mice choose the internet protocol here 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.520
 version 4 click properties and swap 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.300
 marker in position to use 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.350
 following rows 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:30.730
 next we specify the address in this way 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:32.770
 IP address 190 to 160 802 for example or 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.810
 three i.e. last digit on special 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.200
 does not matter but just indicate and 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.790
 and most importantly, she was not 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.260
 one and not more than two hundred and fifty 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.300
 subnet mask leave this 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.470
 and here we specify the main gateway 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.610
 192 168 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.410
 0 and here we must put 1 in the line 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:05.210
 use the following server data we 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:05.210
 we indicate 192 168 01 and 192 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.470
 168 02 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.709
 here 02 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.390
 we press ok we save changes and 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.840
 similarly we customize everything 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.900
 computers that you will play a role 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.940
 the only extras we do 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.220
 everything is the same except ip ip address 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.040
 address we change this last tsiferku 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.080
 prize if one computer is configured with 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.670
 number 2 then the next computer 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.790
 should set up in the morning for example three 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.700
 four and so on after we 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.289
 entered all necessary data saved 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.289
 changes and came out of all these 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.159
 settings local network 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.809
 as well as the internet in these computers 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.699
 automatically configured enters 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:58.819
 strength and principle can be used when 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:03.020
 it is necessary to take into account this very 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.849
 important point which is associated with 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.949
 features of some 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.379
 providers some providers in on 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.939
 their settings block the possibility 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.569
 switch use 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:17.210
 that is, in order for the user not to 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.499
 could hand out the internet through a candle for 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.360
 other users 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:25.039
 some providers sometimes use 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.319
 such a lock so if you 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.930
 such a lock will even exist 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.639
 if you make settings like this 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.279
 told you cannot provide 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.080
 Internet for other computers through 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:39.619
 bitches in this case only 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.619
 an option that you can use 

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:47.360
 is to connect the switch to the router 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:48.810
 and in this case, the router will be able to 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.120
 hand out 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.220
 interns if no router is 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.830
 set up internet connection for others 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.900
 computers and through sich simply not 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.669
 but I repeat it only if 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.290
 provider 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.740
 carries out blocking use 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.380
 candle 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.360
 Well, the principle was the channel itself 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.010
 without wires everyone yet and remember that 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.520
 Fish problems can be solved the main thing is not 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.520
 know how
