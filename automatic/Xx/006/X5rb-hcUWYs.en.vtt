hey guys checking this new kind of
deadfall<00:00:06.359> I've<00:00:06.660> never<00:00:06.960> tried<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.319> before

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
deadfall I've never tried it before

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.410 
deadfall I've never tried it before
until<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:09.440> there's<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.590> little<00:00:10.910> hump<00:00:11.910> under<00:00:12.360> it

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
until now there's a little hump under it

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.990 
until now there's a little hump under it
so<00:00:12.960> by<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.469> looks<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.099> looks<00:00:14.460> like<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.820> got

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
so by the looks of it looks like I got

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.710 
so by the looks of it looks like I got
something<00:00:16.520> let's<00:00:17.520> see

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.160 

sure<00:00:21.720> enough<00:00:21.840> red<00:00:22.830> swirl

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
sure enough red swirl

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.820 
sure enough red swirl
he's<00:00:25.170> pretty<00:00:25.439> mangled<00:00:26.210> well<00:00:27.380> I'll<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.619> him

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
he's pretty mangled well I'll get him

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.880 
he's pretty mangled well I'll get him
out<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> way<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.349> show<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.410> guys<00:00:32.390> how<00:00:33.390> to

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
out of the way and show you guys how to

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:54.049 
out of the way and show you guys how to
set<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.040> his<00:00:35.219> trap<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> high<00:00:38.600> here<00:00:53.059> I'm

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
set up his trap so high here I'm

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.959 
set up his trap so high here I'm
thinking<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.230> pretty<00:00:55.469> good<00:00:55.710> view

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.890 

so<00:01:02.969> here's<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.390> weight<00:01:04.129> board<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so here's my weight board and then this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.740 
so here's my weight board and then this
baseboard<00:01:07.909> make<00:01:08.909> sure<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.420> crushed

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
baseboard make sure they get crushed

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
baseboard make sure they get crushed
I've<00:01:10.020> got<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.470> stick<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.400> that's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I've got this stick right here that's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
I've got this stick right here that's
gonna<00:01:12.600> help<00:01:13.610> setting<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> trap<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> uh<00:01:18.830> it's<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
gonna help setting the trap so uh it's a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.660 
gonna help setting the trap so uh it's a
very<00:01:20.820> simple<00:01:21.270> deadfall<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:23.100> need<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> stick

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
very simple deadfall you need a stick

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
very simple deadfall you need a stick
that's<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.119> least<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.630> long<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> width<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that's at least as long as the width of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
that's at least as long as the width of
your<00:01:26.100> weight<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.960> one's<00:01:28.259> longer

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
your weight like this this one's longer

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.330 
your weight like this this one's longer
but<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.390> work<00:01:30.799> you're<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:31.890> set<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> on

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
but it will work you're gonna set it on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.109 
but it will work you're gonna set it on
that<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.869> want<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> cut<00:01:34.290> yourself<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:35.159> why

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that and you want to cut yourself a why

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
that and you want to cut yourself a why
stick<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:37.140> preparation<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> making<00:01:38.610> this

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
stick in preparation to making this

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.969 
stick in preparation to making this
before<00:01:40.790> now<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:44.030> stand<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> upright

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
before now you're gonna stand it upright

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.350 
before now you're gonna stand it upright
like<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.990> bounce<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:53.360> if

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
like that bounce it and there you go if

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:09.139 
like that bounce it and there you go if
I<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.170> stay

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:25.259 

it's<00:02:10.149> really<00:02:10.509> sensitive<00:02:23.489> well<00:02:24.489> geez<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:25.060> might

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
it's really sensitive well geez I might

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:40.789 
it's really sensitive well geez I might
have<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.599> reposition<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.349> whole<00:02:26.560> thing

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:49.110 

there<00:02:41.799> we<00:02:41.980> go<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:48.280> bouncing<00:02:48.970> on

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
there we go so there it's bouncing on

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.229 
there we go so there it's bouncing on
that<00:02:49.330> stick<00:02:49.690> there<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.760> stick<00:02:52.090> is

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that stick there and that stick is

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.610 
that stick there and that stick is
driven<00:02:52.510> into<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> ground

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
driven into the ground

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.490 
driven into the ground
now<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.540> balancing<00:02:56.580> like<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:58.500> that's

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
now that's balancing like that that's

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.259 
now that's balancing like that that's
the<00:02:59.650> trigger<00:02:59.860> stick<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.400> had<00:03:00.579> peanut<00:03:00.940> butter<00:03:01.090> on

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
the trigger stick I had peanut butter on

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.870 
the trigger stick I had peanut butter on
there<00:03:01.480> throw<00:03:02.019> solid<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.739> fall<00:03:03.040> off<00:03:03.280> when<00:03:03.610> I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
there throw solid and fall off when I

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.119 
there throw solid and fall off when I
caught<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.540> squirrel<00:03:07.019> butt

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
caught the squirrel butt

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.729 
caught the squirrel butt
it's<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.790> very<00:03:10.090> simple<00:03:10.510> trap<00:03:11.969> and<00:03:12.969> as<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:14.439> just

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
it's a very simple trap and as I just

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.949 
it's a very simple trap and as I just
showed<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.299> good<00:03:16.450> way<00:03:16.599> of<00:03:16.629> catching

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
showed you it's a good way of catching

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.679 
showed you it's a good way of catching
meat<00:03:17.439> so<00:03:18.540> there<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.749> go

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
meat so there you go

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.479 
meat so there you go
