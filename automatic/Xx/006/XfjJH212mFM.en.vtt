00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.879
 today we are going to talk about kites and 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.009
 asteroids those objects that by 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.470
 hundreds of thousands there are those who say that 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.320
 by millions they accompany the planets in 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.000
 the solar system 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.029
 not only accompanies them but also 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.410
 sometimes have very remarkable effects on 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.220
 these planets especially when 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 collide with them but let's see let's 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.100
 explain where we locate them 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.460
 and what possibilities do we have of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.719
 interact with them on occasion 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.519
 we have to go back to the origin of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.280
 solar system about five thousand 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.859
 millions of years then with the sun 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.619
 newly formed the material left over from the 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.440
 sun was accumulating and we can say 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.390
 that accumulation along 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.180
 millions of years it was becoming 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 rocks and stones of all sizes 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.059
 some started to merge 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 each other and gave rise to the planets 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.570
 others failed to build planets 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.909
 and they stayed in an intermediate 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.860
 and those rocks or a good number of those 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.780
 rocks are found between the orbits 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.210
 Mars and Jupiter and is what 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.920
 we know about the asteroid belt 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.619
 the asteroid belt are thousands of 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.510
 rocks of all sizes from a thousand 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.970
 kilometers that is almost almost a planet 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.060
 a little smaller than the moon until 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.330
 even with rocks weighing several kilos 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.990
 nothing more and they are shaping a ring 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.970
 in a belt where you should have 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.479
 another planet that does not exist because there is a 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.300
 gap between mars and jupiter that is 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.720
 occupied precisely by this belt 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.390
 but nevertheless 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.400
 from here we know that many of 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.440
 the meteorites that reach the planets 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.060
 internal like the earth or like mars 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.610
 but there is more 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.470
 not only meteorites but comets 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.720
 they also come to us and they come to us from 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.770
 much more external areas of the system 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.679
 solar there are two zones identified one is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.840
 the kuiper belt that is similar to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.480
 asteroid belt but beyond 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.870
 Neptune's orbit are objects 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.590
 transneptunian and it's a big cloud of 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 objects also that where do they come from 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.280
 some of the comets especially the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.800
 that have short period is to say the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.350
 that have short orbits around the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.180
 sun and then a hundred times farther 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.670
 very much beyond Pluto and Neptune 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.220
 there is a huge cloud that is believed to 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.110
 has billions of objects of all 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.510
 sizes and that are also part of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.000
 our solar system in the external zone 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.220
 which is the cloud of gold and the cloud of 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.540
 oort arrive many of the comets that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.620
 we know among them the halley comet 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.000
 precisely from the golden cloud we 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.130
 will come to where the comet comes from and 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.360
 they are so called by scientists 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.170
 that they have discovered by a group of 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.820
 scientists and that towards the spring of 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.470
 2013 is going to become one of the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.230
 brightest objects of our sky 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.030
 It has the appearance of being like that 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.400
 we are sure of everything because now 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.410
 very recently he was seen passing 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.300
 and is approaching the sun 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.830
 when comets approach the sun is 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.110
 possible that they lose part of their mass or 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.570
 even if they are destroyed but if not 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.910
 this is how he survives in the spring of 2013 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.710
 will be brighter than the full moon with 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.990
 which we can see even at full 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.060
 daylight and there will be a show 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.430
 other encounters that are not so nice 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.040
 with good objects of the belt 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.980
 asteroids or the belt of kuiper 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.590
 or from the oort cloud that we just saw 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.810
 we all know that 65 million 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.080
 years a large meteorite 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.210
 about 10 kilometers struck against the 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.090
 Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.270
 Mexico and the catastrophe that caused 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.350
 He ended the lives of 70% of all 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.870
 living species 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.670
 that there was then on the planet between 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.400
 them the dinosaurs and there's been more 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.360
 cases we are also seeing the moon 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.770
 such as Mars that are literally 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.300
 set of asteroid impacts and 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.660
 our planet would be exactly what 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.209
 same only that having an atmosphere 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.160
 with winds and with erosion that go 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 cleaning the surface, not the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.580
 we can see we can not see all that 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.550
 there are some yes and very 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.360
 spectacular 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.340
 in the number of objects near the 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.620
 ground or potentially dangerous to 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.120
 the earth has been increasing not because 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.750
 there are more objects but because we are 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.030
 able to see them better 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.790
 since the 90s when they knew each other 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.830
 just a few thousand objects 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.250
 close to the earth until the year 2012 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.350
 that its number exceeds 700 thousand since it has 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.720
 past has passed a good braid and a 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.880
 good turning point when the 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.980
 astronomers began to devote themselves to 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.090
 study these things carefully was in 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.860
 the year 96 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.200
 I think it was when a comet 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.880
 shoemaker-levy hit the 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.360
 surface of jupiter 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.130
 schumacher and they saw him a marriage of 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.320
 amateur astronomers who discovered 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.840
 to this comet and they realized that 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.310
 went straight to Jupiter with which 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.530
 the observatories around the world in 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.930
 that moment they focused their instruments 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.290
 there and it was the first time 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.930
 televised and what could be seen filmed 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.090
 the impact of a comet against a body 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.630
 planetary clear the effects of that 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.670
 they were tremendous when he was captured 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.100
 by the gravity of jupiter the comet 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.410
 broke into a dozen fragments that to 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.729
 over three days one was falling 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.439
 behind another on jupiter 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.189
 some of those fragments had 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:47.139
 kilometers in diameter and others 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.759
 only a few hundred meters but 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.639
 each of them when it impacted 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.559
 a scar left a mark on 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.710
 jupiter that was bigger than the 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:58.870
 planet earth evidently that was a 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.370
 wake up call because tomorrow another 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.469
 comet could do the same with the 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.330
 land if a comet started michael levy 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:06.699
 it will obviously collide with the earth 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.379
 it would be catastrophic for very many 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.219
 millions of people with which 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:14.559
 began to design programs of 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.289
 observation and prevention until arriving 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:19.599
 to which we have today today we are the 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.339
 scientists have a whole network that 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.889
 called rings of objects near the 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.020
 land that is capable of monitoring 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.270
 all these objects and to notify us with 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.069
 a time when cometh the 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.229
 problem however I always say what 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.089
 same are not the big ones because the 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.490
 great those who have kilometers the 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:38.889
 we can see years in advance and in 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.659
 years knowing that an asteroid is coming 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.660
 within 15 more years to hit the 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:45.550
 land in 15 years we are capable 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.380
 things in fact there are many plans for 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.570
 deflect or even destroy an asteroid 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.700
 of these characteristics the problem is 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.950
 the small ones and by small ones I mean 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.840
 those that are between 50 meters 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.570
 diameter and the 100 or 150 meters of 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.170
 diameter those we are barely able to 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:04.720
 see them with hours every year we 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.720
 they pass by skimming small asteroids 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.130
 asteroids of these these dimensions 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.990
 that nobody had seen before and that we 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.250
 we realize precisely just when 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.610
 we have them on top and with two or three 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:18.070
 hours for the time of your passage or in your 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.260
 case for the moment of impact these 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.450
 asteroids can not cause 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.430
 episodes of mass extinction but if 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.009
 they fall in a city like madrid 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.820
 example are capable of razing 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.340
 that is to say 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.780
 we have that scientists have to 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.940
 arbitrate measures to be able 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.890
 also to see these little ones that also 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.300
 they are much more numerous and more frequent 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.470
 that the great 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.470
 and not
