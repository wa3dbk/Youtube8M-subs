what you want to do is hold it over the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
what you want to do is hold it over the
pan<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.620> twist<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.219> direction<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
pan you twist it one direction at the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.200 
pan you twist it one direction at the
top

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
top

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.580 
top
twisted<00:00:45.660> another<00:00:45.840> direction<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.289> bottom

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
twisted another direction at the bottom

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.799 
twisted another direction at the bottom
and<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.460> let<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> fall<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.600> falls

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and if they let it fall and it falls

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020 
and if they let it fall and it falls
down<00:00:48.899> into<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.230> fan<00:00:49.530> shape<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> helps<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> stop

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
down into a fan shape and helps to stop

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
down into a fan shape and helps to stop
it<00:00:51.180> sticking<00:00:51.510> together<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.559> we'll<00:00:52.800> leave<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it sticking together so we'll leave that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
it sticking together so we'll leave that
melt<00:00:53.370> down<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> water<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:54.840> going
