00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:11.160
 she does not seem home she appears in 11 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.400
 touch 1 in one thing with identity 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.660
 herself does not have a formalism of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.600
 a house 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 now when you 're in you feel 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.279
 It's fine because it's a space is a lot. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.279
 well in the dinho by the natural light 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.410
 what we did containing his great 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.510
 work is a take is a new side is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 that it did not exist to create one of the levels 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.220
 deployment did not exist is to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.200
 the program in participating in the villains have 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.440
 flag that disappears e.g. 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.280
 under the ground that is the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.170
 Where are the children, is not every month 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.480
 past the garden cover you do not 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.750
 can identify where the 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.729
 her house she has both views right 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 the front lake of the land and the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.740
 of the land that is the great and quattor 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.220
 we split it into a kind of blocks 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.350
 in the entrance of the land has a block of 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.759
 service everywhere service is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.450
 separated is the terrain relief to 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.970
 people made a grassy store and the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.360
 that a house like that according to her from outside 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.320
 she surpasses hidden in the other vegetation 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.250
 class is ala pa of it is that happens 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.140
 at the end of the pool is one thing that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.190
 if there is a little connection from the house 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 main 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.759
 These are the last tennis lesson that is 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.310
 one more piece is the word stone one leg 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.450
 also laminated wood then a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:11.100
 The house that you run through it is a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.690
 way it is almost playful with a 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.569
 Japanese architecture that has 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.019
 next posts in the middle of the gardens 11 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.019
 games 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.440
 there was a demand to make a 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.910
 different structure using wood without 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.310
 use reverse abutment 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.590
 so we did not want to do it then 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.940
 we made an association of porticos 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.310
 placed 40 centimeters and the oxum 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.040
 and we tried to interpret this 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.480
 in a way that was not only the structure 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.610
 here the pillars become prise is and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.440
 lives would turn a fire and scarcity 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.260
 apparent both from inside and outside 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.660
 in that the cover is made of plate 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.060
 compensated with a blanket that is called the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.750
 possible glass so all this to do 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.750
 the structure is the lightest thing possible 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.439
 she has glass and that 's it does not appear 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.530
 the structural porticos are they are they 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:20.829
 on the one hand is internal to the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.129
 student bruno rain neither sun and outside 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:28.900
 of yours in this video to fix ear 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:32.230
 and here to tie everything to the drive to us 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.049
 uses a language of the engineers 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.790
 of the wood of sacrifice that is the 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.280
 wood that actually gets exposed to the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.239
 time in the sun and rain and which is a 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.680
 way that has a lifetime 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.579
 reduced in the case 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.400
 ten years and the structure does not leave 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.349
 the IfÃ¡ to last a lifetime for 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.870
 floor we used is for the areas 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.180
 social large closed large plates 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.310
 that was a very clear thing when it says 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.310
 who does not see paging 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:10.910
 has that phrase is the architect's 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.950
 did the mane reform 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.830
 He said that if you give me too much 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.500
 money makes you a beautiful house in 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.230
 double bondage will disappear 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.260
 so it's more or less what we people 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.290
 tried to revitalize that 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.600
 have hidden what you need to do 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.600
 he plays on our side
