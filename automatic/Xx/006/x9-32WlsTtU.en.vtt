00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.200 

we<00:02:25.430> go<00:02:25.610> people<00:02:27.430> some<00:02:28.430> glass<00:02:28.700> digitized<00:02:29.180> with

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
we go people some glass digitized with

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.350 
we go people some glass digitized with
pay<00:02:29.660> removal<00:02:30.110> now<00:02:30.410> we<00:02:30.740> do<00:02:31.030> we<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.210> get

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
pay removal now we do we have to get

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.510 
pay removal now we do we have to get
this<00:02:32.480> glue<00:02:32.750> off<00:02:32.780> these<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.710> where<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:33.980> found<00:02:34.280> is

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
this glue off these is where I found is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.920 
this glue off these is where I found is
just<00:02:35.350> little<00:02:36.350> bit<00:02:36.470> off<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:37.130> your<00:02:37.310> finger<00:02:37.930> and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
just little bit off of your finger and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.080 
just little bit off of your finger and
it<00:02:39.080> should<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:39.410> roll<00:02:39.680> off<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.610> peel<00:02:40.910> off

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
it should just roll off and peel off

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.210 
it should just roll off and peel off
like<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:47.690> will<00:02:47.930> take<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> while<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.010> what

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
like so this will take a while so what

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.350
