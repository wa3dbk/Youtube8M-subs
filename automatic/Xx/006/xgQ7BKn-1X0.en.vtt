00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
enemies but I've done a pretty good job

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.540 
enemies but I've done a pretty good job
of<00:02:20.780> locking<00:02:21.080> them<00:02:21.200> down<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:23.110> there<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.200> is

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
of locking them down here there it is

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.430 
of locking them down here there it is
not<00:02:25.550> sure<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.480> lot<00:02:29.720> easier<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.290> gun

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
not sure this is a lot easier the gun

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.810 
not sure this is a lot easier the gun
the<00:02:30.800> light<00:02:30.950> gun<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.520> don't<00:02:31.670> have<00:02:31.700> to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
the light gun because you don't have to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.130 
the light gun because you don't have to
cycle<00:02:32.120> back<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.600> forth<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.020> much<00:02:34.090> right<00:02:35.140> it's

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
cycle back and forth so much right it's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.630 
cycle back and forth so much right it's
usually<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.650> case<00:02:36.950> when<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.400> an

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
usually the case when you have an

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.310 
usually the case when you have an
alternate<00:02:38.000> control<00:02:38.360> scheme<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:38.960> something

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
alternate control scheme for something

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.240 
alternate control scheme for something
meant<00:02:39.500> for<00:02:39.680> like<00:02:39.800> guns<00:02:42.610> hey<00:02:43.610> never<00:02:44.120> moves

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
meant for like guns hey never moves

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.680 
meant for like guns hey never moves
Japan's<00:02:46.250> stage<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.090> pretty<00:02:47.420> much<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
Japan's stage of that is pretty much the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.990 
Japan's stage of that is pretty much the
same<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.410> didn't<00:02:48.770> bother<00:02:48.830> doing<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.760> don't

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
same so I didn't bother doing it I don't

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.070 
same so I didn't bother doing it I don't
think<00:02:50.030> there's<00:02:50.300> any<00:02:50.480> changes<00:02:50.810> at<00:02:50.870> all

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
think there's any changes at all

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.870 
think there's any changes at all
actually<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:55.040> stage<00:02:55.340> looks<00:02:55.580> pretty

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
actually that stage looks pretty

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.449 
actually that stage looks pretty
reasonable<00:02:56.420> yeah<00:02:57.110> yeah<00:02:57.739> well<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.070> one's<00:02:58.280> not

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
this one's much worse than stage 10

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.360 
this one's much worse than stage 10
that's<00:03:02.300> uh<00:03:02.420> not<00:03:03.080> only<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.860> crap<00:03:04.190> again

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
it at some point here you just have to

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.600 
it at some point here you just have to

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
then now you got to kill these and I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.160 
then now you got to kill these and I
definitely<00:03:37.580> I<00:03:37.970> definitely<00:03:38.060> prefer<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.900> stick

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
definitely I definitely prefer the stick

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.780 
definitely I definitely prefer the stick
if<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.680> don't<00:03:39.860> have<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.040> stick<00:03:40.310> here<00:03:40.489> eating

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
if you don't have the stick here eating

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.509 
if you don't have the stick here eating
cake<00:03:41.150> them<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.570> guess<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:43.310> dangerous

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
cake them I guess that it's dangerous

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.180 
cake them I guess that it's dangerous
enough<00:03:43.850> as<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.209> is<00:03:44.300> these<00:03:45.230> Gators<00:03:45.620> just<00:03:45.860> do<00:03:46.040> not

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
enough as it is these Gators just do not

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.970 
enough as it is these Gators just do not
play<00:03:46.489> along<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:47.239> don't<00:03:48.200> think<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.530> would<00:03:48.680> fight

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.100 
play along I don't think I would fight
Gators<00:03:49.640> in<00:03:49.820> water<00:03:50.030> yeah<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.690> don't<00:03:50.900> know<00:03:50.959> what
