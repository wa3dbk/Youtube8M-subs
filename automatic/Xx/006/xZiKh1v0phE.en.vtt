so<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.190> one<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.370> used<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.360> was

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
so that's the one I used and I was

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.960 
so that's the one I used and I was
really<00:02:21.020> nervous<00:02:21.380> about<00:02:21.680> using<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.459> foam<00:02:22.700> die

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
really nervous about using the foam die

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.640 
really nervous about using the foam die
because<00:02:23.209> I've<00:02:23.510> never<00:02:23.780> even<00:02:24.170> heard<00:02:24.530> of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
because I've never even heard of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.590 
because I've never even heard of
anything<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.820> didn't<00:02:26.120> even<00:02:26.209> realize

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
anything like that I didn't even realize

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.690 
anything like that I didn't even realize
I<00:02:26.780> was<00:02:26.810> getting<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.230> phone<00:02:27.410> guy<00:02:27.620> because<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.400> just

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
I was getting a phone guy because I just

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.490 
I was getting a phone guy because I just
didn't<00:02:29.120> think<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.390> look<00:02:29.420> at<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> packaging<00:02:30.230> I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
didn't think to look at the packaging I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.640

know<00:02:30.709> I'm<00:02:31.070> Jay<00:02:31.310> smart<00:02:31.580> but<00:02:32.180> um<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.959> just<00:02:33.320> assumed

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
um but anyways that's what I used for a

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.879 
um but anyways that's what I used for a
while<00:06:07.940> just<00:06:08.300> because<00:06:08.780> I<00:06:08.900> love<00:06:09.229> the<00:06:09.530> smell<00:06:09.830> so

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
while just because I love the smell so

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.439 
while just because I love the smell so
much<00:06:10.160> but<00:06:10.610> that's<00:06:10.669> right<00:06:10.910> I<00:06:10.940> started<00:06:11.240> using

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
much but that's right I started using

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.059 
much but that's right I started using
that<00:06:11.599> for<00:06:11.900> a<00:06:11.930> while<00:06:12.110> I<00:06:12.169> realized<00:06:12.770> it<00:06:12.919> was

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
that for a while I realized it was

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:14.920 
that for a while I realized it was
really<00:06:13.400> drying<00:06:13.759> on<00:06:14.030> my<00:06:14.060> hair<00:06:14.509> and<00:06:14.539> I<00:06:14.780> thought

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
really drying on my hair and I thought

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.689 
really drying on my hair and I thought
that<00:06:15.110> was<00:06:15.229> kind<00:06:15.440> of<00:06:15.500> weird<00:06:15.740> because<00:06:16.039> it's<00:06:16.400> for

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
that was kind of weird because it's for

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.490 
that was kind of weird because it's for
drying<00:06:17.000> dry<00:06:17.569> and<00:06:17.720> damaged<00:06:18.020> hair<00:06:18.050> so<00:06:18.380> it's

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
drying dry and damaged hair so it's

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.279 
drying dry and damaged hair so it's
really<00:06:18.740> just<00:06:18.889> supposed<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.759> like<00:06:20.240> make<00:06:21.139> your

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
really just supposed to like make your

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.339 
really just supposed to like make your
hair<00:06:21.610> let's<00:06:22.610> try<00:06:22.970> and<00:06:23.180> image<00:06:23.569> but<00:06:23.810> instead<00:06:24.169> it

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
hair let's try and image but instead it

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.279
