 information and at the end of the video 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 first let's prepare the avocados and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 to open them what we are going to do is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 let's grab a knife and we 're going to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.360
 cut around the seed or the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.930
 pepa 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.930
 yes 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.360
 now we turn to open it 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.320
 and we are going to take out the seed with the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.149
 knife help I like to use the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.469
 bottom part of the knife to do it 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.220
 more sure we give it a tap we turn 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.680
 and we take out the seed hello pepa 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.600
 to open the avocado more carefully and 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.370
 make it safer what we can do 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.770
 is to place the avocado on a 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.420
 flat surface and we are turning it to 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.860
 as the knife is cutting 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 around the seed 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.310
 then we rotate to open it we place the 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.560
 half of the avocado on the surface 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.060
 again and very carefully we give him 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.540
 the tap to the seed with the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.520
 knife and we take it off 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.980
 Now we're going to remove the pulp to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.170
 avocado with the help of a spoon and 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.940
 with the spoon we are going to scrape all the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.940
 pulp that sticks to the shell 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.820
 then we are going to crush the avocado with 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.310
 the help of a fork and the more 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 We crush softer more thick more 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.290
 creamy we will leave the guacamole 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.860
 already when it is crushed we are going to 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.460
 add chopped jalapeÃ±o also 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.010
 we add chopped coriander 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.770
 red onion or purple 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.360
 Garlic and season with cumin 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.360
 and salt and pepper to taste 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.990
 and finally we add the juice of a 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.180
 lemon green or yellow medium and this is 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.510
 to give it more flavor and also so that 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.280
 Do not rust and do not turn brown or black 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.769
 then we stir these ingredients 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.810
 until they are well incorporated and in 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.099
 this point can already be used but if 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.659
 they want to keep it in the fridge what 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.909
 can be placed in a container 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.700
 hermetic nevertheless what to me 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.579
 like to do is cover it with a piece of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.360
 plastic kitchen this is so that no 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.350
 he was between the air 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.350
 Y 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.079
 and then I cover everything with another piece of 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.730
 plastic kitchen and this way 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.319
 we can guarantee that it is not going to 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.989
 oxidize and that it will not change color 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.489
 and that's how easy and easy it is 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.489
 a delicious guacamole 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.420
