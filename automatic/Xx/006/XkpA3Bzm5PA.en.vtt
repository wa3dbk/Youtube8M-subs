because<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.610> sound<00:00:35.880> bite<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.149> played

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
because in that sound bite we played

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.580 
because in that sound bite we played
before<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.719> went<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> commercial<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
before we went to the commercial you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.819 
before we went to the commercial you
said<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> framers<00:00:38.430> would<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.879> horrified

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
said the framers would be horrified

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
said the framers would be horrified
because<00:00:40.829> everything<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.820> did<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
because everything they did was to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.810 
because everything they did was to
create<00:00:42.780> balance<00:00:43.590> between<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> branches<00:00:44.489> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
create balance between the branches of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.119 
create balance between the branches of
government<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.300> we've<00:00:45.690> lost<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.350> expand<00:00:47.010> on

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
government and we've lost it expand on

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.150 
government and we've lost it expand on
that<00:00:47.629> well<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.690> afraid<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.230> quite<00:00:49.379> serious

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that well I'm afraid it's quite serious

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
that well I'm afraid it's quite serious
because<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> framers<00:00:51.360> created<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.840> system

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
because the framers created a system

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.369 
because the framers created a system
that<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:52.980> designed<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.699> avoid<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.840> principle

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that was designed to avoid one principle

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
that was designed to avoid one principle
thing<00:00:55.590> that's<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> concentration<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> power

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
thing that's the concentration of power

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.709 
thing that's the concentration of power
in<00:00:57.480> any<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.320> branch<00:00:58.800> because<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.910> balancing

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
in any one branch because that balancing

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
in any one branch because that balancing
between<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.320> branches<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.370> fixed

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
between these branches in this fixed

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
between these branches in this fixed
orbit<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.170> only<00:01:04.350> gives<00:01:04.559> stability

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
orbit is what not only gives stability

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.250 
orbit is what not only gives stability
to<00:01:05.280> our<00:01:05.430> system<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> protects<00:01:06.780> us<00:01:06.930> against

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
to our system but it protects us against

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
to our system but it protects us against
authoritarian<00:01:08.100> power<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.729> protects<00:01:09.090> civil

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
authoritarian power it protects civil

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
authoritarian power it protects civil
liberties<00:01:09.900> from<00:01:10.619> abuse<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:11.880> we've<00:01:12.030> been

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
liberties from abuse and what we've been

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
liberties from abuse and what we've been
seeing<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> shift<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.740> gravity<00:01:14.400> within

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
seeing is the shift of gravity within

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.020 
seeing is the shift of gravity within
that<00:01:14.850> system<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:16.140> very<00:01:16.439> dangerous<00:01:16.770> way<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that system in a very dangerous way that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.719 
that system in a very dangerous way that
makes<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> unstable<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.549> that's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
makes it unstable and I think that's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
makes it unstable and I think that's
what<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> president<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> doing<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
what the president is doing I think that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520 
what the president is doing I think that
we've<00:01:23.369> become<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> nation<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.390> enablers<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
we've become a nation of enablers we are

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.460 
we've become a nation of enablers we are
turning<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.310> blind<00:01:26.939> eye<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> fundamental

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
turning a blind eye to a fundamental

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.920 
turning a blind eye to a fundamental
change<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> our<00:01:29.159> system<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.390> many<00:01:30.540> people

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
change in our system I think many people

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
change in our system I think many people
will<00:01:31.020> come<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.409> loathe<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.700> remain

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
will come to loathe that they remain

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.450 
will come to loathe that they remain
silent<00:01:33.659> during<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.020> period<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
silent during this period because I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.130 
silent during this period because I
think<00:01:35.520> yeah<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.270> heard<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.900> objections

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
think yeah we heard a lot of objections

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
think yeah we heard a lot of objections
when<00:01:37.650> President<00:01:38.100> Bush<00:01:38.130> expanded<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> powers

you<00:01:45.899> say<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.680> at<00:01:46.890> their<00:01:46.920> own<00:01:47.100> peril

you say they do so at their own peril
I'm<00:01:48.720> afraid<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.259> beginning<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.649> border

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
I'm afraid this is beginning to border

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.760 
I'm afraid this is beginning to border
on<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.280> call<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.759> personality<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.899> people<00:01:52.649> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
on a call to personality for people on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.590 
on a call to personality for people on
the<00:01:52.799> Left<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.700> agree<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.240> many<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the Left I have to agree with many of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.740 
the Left I have to agree with many of
President<00:01:55.170> Obama's<00:01:55.590> policies<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.360> our

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
President Obama's policies but in our

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.230 
President Obama's policies but in our
system<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.799> often<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.460> important<00:02:00.000> how<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
system it is often as important how you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.530 
system it is often as important how you
do<00:02:00.780> something<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.420> think

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
do something is what you do and I think

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.480 
do something is what you do and I think
that<00:02:03.810> many<00:02:04.259> people<00:02:04.350> will<00:02:04.829> look<00:02:05.040> back<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that many people will look back at this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.710 
that many people will look back at this
period<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.680> history<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.670> nothing<00:02:09.569> but

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
period in history and see nothing but

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.559 
period in history and see nothing but
confusion<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.709> why<00:02:11.129> people<00:02:11.180> remain<00:02:12.180> so

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
system that borders on authoritarianism

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.240 
system that borders on authoritarianism
because<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.200> don't<00:02:43.650> believe<00:02:43.889> that<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.219> are
