00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.249
 yes hello together 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.419
 Reken Kirchenthemen to expensive made lists we show with the program Mio Gamer 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.720
 SÃ¶ren Voss can be surrounded so well 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.419
 basically the program is meant for that 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.529
 This is complete with two backups of CDs 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.569
 start 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.670
 and once up with compulsory december from the beginning to be able to play 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 as us us start the newcomer 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.300
 yes the program is not quite simply done randomly 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.970
 and here it is Lothar Schelenz pays next to pick 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.260
 from where something should be loaded both foot iris is the card or TIF 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.390
 veteran 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.380
 actually very tender and moves to make sure and therefore em-start 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.440
 Naturally 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.640
 the DVD 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.650
 we serve then is central 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.580
 then outside small moment 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.580
 that just loaded this DVD 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 and of course, as in my case 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.200
 So that's not all on the whole 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 mentioned to me at the beginning 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.810
 Therefore announces then also original games play 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.620
 You have to know that over time 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.950
 Percent again will give new Albi image 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.040
 but this would make me 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.250
 then that would often be deleted for athleticism 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.360
 and there are for the marginal games 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 that makes him a forced descent 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.440
 just to prevent that gives seven seats newcomer 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.080
 and you should also use Dean in the future if all of you are tomorrow 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.730
 Wants to play games 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.780
 that's exactly what we have from our side 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.380
 we hope to have and use 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.310
 and if in doubt 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.240
 Just write us one take 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.860
 otherwise you wish to have fun, Rani said
