00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
right actually at the the second solo

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
right actually at the the second solo
okay<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> guess<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> would<00:00:24.449> call<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:27.470> that's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
okay I guess you would call it that's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.749 
okay I guess you would call it that's
all<00:00:28.680> though<00:00:30.199> so<00:00:31.199> your<00:00:31.380> rhythm<00:00:31.619> guitar<00:00:31.949> behind

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
all though so your rhythm guitar behind

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:46.720 
all though so your rhythm guitar behind
that<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.320> basically<00:00:36.050> four<00:00:37.050> chords

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:01:00.040 

+<00:00:47.630> F<00:00:47.809> sharp<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.380> E<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.120> C<00:00:50.870> sharp

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.540 

so<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> want<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.650> numbers<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.130> that<00:01:02.310> it's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so if you want the numbers for that it's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:14.740 
so if you want the numbers for that it's
the<00:01:03.080> 912<00:01:04.670> 74<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.300> string

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.990 

that<00:01:15.410> goes<00:01:15.590> until<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.920> guitar<00:01:16.250> solo<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:16.670> over

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
that goes until the guitar solo is over

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.880 
that goes until the guitar solo is over
when<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.720> bass<00:01:17.930> solo<00:01:18.320> starts<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:25.250> guy<00:01:25.570> you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
when the bass solo starts that guy you

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.350 
when the bass solo starts that guy you
want<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:27.979> move<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.580> same<00:01:28.940> chord<00:01:29.330> progression

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
want to move that same chord progression

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.790 
want to move that same chord progression
down<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.780> e<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:33.410> then<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:33.950> becomes<00:01:34.250> e<00:01:34.420> g<00:01:35.420> d<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.320> b

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
down to e so then it becomes e g d and b

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.140 
down to e so then it becomes e g d and b
so<00:01:37.550> seven<00:01:38.060> ten<00:01:38.570> five<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.440> two<00:01:39.800> exactly<00:01:40.580> two

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
so seven ten five and two exactly two

00:01:41.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
so seven ten five and two exactly two
frets<00:01:41.740> down<00:01:42.740> from<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.160> original

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.320 

and<00:02:00.290> then<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.220> come<00:02:01.400> back<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.759> your<00:02:01.939> original

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
and then you come back to your original

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.460 
and then you come back to your original
tempo<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.229> your<00:02:03.439> original<00:02:04.070> e<00:02:04.790> AC<00:02:05.509> chord<00:02:06.290> from

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
tempo and your original e AC chord from

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.690 
tempo and your original e AC chord from
the<00:02:06.619> first<00:02:06.830> part<00:02:08.080> then<00:02:09.099> after<00:02:10.099> that<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.489> kick

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
the first part then after that you kick

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.650 
the first part then after that you kick
into<00:02:10.910> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.780 

basically<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.770> same<00:02:18.890> rhythm<00:02:19.310> from<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
basically do the same rhythm from the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.080 
basically do the same rhythm from the
first<00:02:20.000> part<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.460> behind<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.880> first

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
first part that was behind the first

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.410 
first part that was behind the first
solo<00:02:23.330> because<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.200> riff<00:02:24.440> now<00:02:24.650> backs<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
solo because that riff now backs the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:35.270 
solo because that riff now backs the
final<00:02:26.420> solo<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.960> think<00:02:27.710> it's<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.860> third<00:02:28.100> cell

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.280 

then<00:02:35.819> when<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.209> end<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.569> riff<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.050> solo

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
then when you end that riff and the solo

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.550 
then when you end that riff and the solo
is<00:02:37.410> done<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:39.180> kick<00:02:39.390> into<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:43.140> EAC

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
is done you kick into the the the EAC

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:02.710 
is done you kick into the the the EAC
riff<00:02:44.250> EAC<00:02:45.209> efe<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.890> cea

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.210 

and<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.780> basically<00:03:03.900> repeat<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.590> riff<00:03:04.830> until

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and you basically repeat that riff until

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.020 
and you basically repeat that riff until
the<00:03:05.310> end<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.580> song

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
the end of the song

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.090 
the end of the song
you
