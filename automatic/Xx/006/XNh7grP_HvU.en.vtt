 0 5k flat screen TVs 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.630
 This model is a TV with full do and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.079
 lighting 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.869
 the TV offers on the side connections for HDMI USB and also for 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.690
 digital satellite television including HD for this Philips also has a ci +

 ProSieben HD Sat 1 HD and so on can look 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.350
 the usb-port can be used for various video formats and also photos 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.990
 and play audio files 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.190
 for how that gets at the best MK calls one on the back there is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920
 a component work concluded 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.780
 as well as the connection for headphones directly below are the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.150
 Bottom connections underneath Skat Digital Audio out 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.600
 as well as two hdmi connections Hecklingen input for the PC to last year's conclusion 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.080
 and of course the antenna connection must be active for the VW and the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.160
 Politics is competent Defense can also betray the contents of them 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.260
 receive 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.650
 On a general basis, since percent are even easier 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.789
 Control buttons 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.600
 what the mediation is again not at hand 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.160
 that that's the app is pretty easy 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 the user is gradually guided through the menu starting with the 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.910
 Selection of the language 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.950
 followed by the selection of the respective country 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.060
 and so the assembly 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 as well as the location 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.540
 next you can install the transmitter 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.160
 here also equal 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.260
 people love broadcasters 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.590
 but at first I decided here only for the Thier factory 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.500
 latest in the fall 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 and with her up 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.990
 here I want now is the policy from antenna and starting eleven could the whole 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.970
 Search only takes hits two minutes and he brought 34 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.190
 transmitter 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.510
 because the VBL is so deep it was almost half an hour but also around the 900 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.510
 Billion been found 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:20.489
 Next, with the help of picture and sound examples, you can see the gates and 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.120
 the picture to your own taste 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.120
 to adjust 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.670
 over the book symbol one can view the station list the Epi GR or the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.899
 Call teletext 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.899
 Here I once used the station list 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.230
 this is quite clear and by means of the outer part buttons 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.829
 you switch between 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.829
 Selection screen of the respective transmitter Dulig 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.029
 Now we have to do that over the below average whole 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:49.939
 Amount of transmitters 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.809
 to select 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:56.329
 the electronic program guide Kurth gg 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.229
 shows the current and the upcoming broadcast of the station is on but otherwise 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:01.730
 very spartan 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.220
 Unfortunately, the current program is suspended during the marriage given train 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.230
 goes for playing material like Reus

 Image paint US educational levels in June 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.119
 here go next to USB sticks on hard drives which but a separate 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.119
 Power supply must come 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.539
 Not every finger is connected when a new device is connected 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.249
 Muliar selected the i-pod 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.709
 Summer has to add the device before 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.709
 per connection, however, is only settled in 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.479
 Dittmann corresponding devices 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:39.259
 and then in Ãœberlingen as happy 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.119
 this one is still available and that's why it can be 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.440
 one device per connection 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.709
 set up 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 The TV does offer excellent picture quality 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.699
 even over dvb-t lives 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:56.549
 but the menu and the software are renewed so you have the at any time 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.870
 perform the operations 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.780
 just to adjust the Citaro then ruled but for a separate button 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.799
 that is very tedious 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.319
 for adjusting the brightness and contrast 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.379
 you have to go through exactly the same employer 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.389
 because you really should not have saved on the rental 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.109
 the search can be interpreted a little more generously 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.639
 despite the good picture quality and the very energy-saving LEDs technology 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.960
 does not ensure that the Palatine in operation on average only about 60 watts 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.740
 used there is the typical viewing angle dependence which of 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.919
 a lcd tv can expect 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.340
 Here we are then clear in the councils and especially plasma TVs 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.259
 Advantage because they are not quite as look dependent 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.020
 then in an angle of about 45 degrees you can definitely on with 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.529
 Make friends a video evening together 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:45.449
 but 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.520
 you see here 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.629
 lateral uses very dark 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.599
 and the contrasts are also lateral 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:52.960
 Consideration 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.939
 significantly after 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.059
 the best picture you have as always directly frontal 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:02.939
 lives before the test 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.510
 that summarizes my conclusion you can the device but because of the good 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.810
 Image quality and the pop-antons recommend 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.530
 but only because of a cumbersome operation and some of the problem 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.410
 Vettel driving covers are likely to be recoverable life can
