00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
on the the motor hopefully that'll get

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.050 
on the the motor hopefully that'll get
your<00:03:11.800> release<00:03:12.239> from<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.360> weeds<00:03:13.600> now<00:03:15.060> when

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060

get at least a 60 amp hour deep cycle

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.370 
get at least a 60 amp hour deep cycle
battery<00:03:23.530> I've<00:03:24.340> got<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.700> connected<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.380> 125

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
battery I've got it connected to a 125

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.120 
battery I've got it connected to a 125
amp<00:03:26.769> hour<00:03:27.010> battery<00:03:27.450> get<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> lot<00:03:28.810> more<00:03:29.110> time<00:03:29.920> out

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
amp hour battery get a lot more time out

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.720 
amp hour battery get a lot more time out
on<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> water<00:03:30.670> with<00:03:31.030> something<00:03:31.330> that<00:03:31.600> big<00:03:32.730> so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
on the water with something that big so

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.670 
on the water with something that big so
now<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:33.940> I've<00:03:34.090> got<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.300> connected<00:03:34.540> I'll<00:03:35.410> show

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
now that I've got it connected I'll show

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.890 
now that I've got it connected I'll show
you<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.950> different<00:03:36.310> speeds<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.090> because

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
you the different speeds and because

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.890 
you the different speeds and because
it's<00:03:38.080> out<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.380> water<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:39.010> can't<00:03:39.400> show<00:03:39.640> you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
it's out of water I can't show you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.620 
it's out of water I can't show you
typically<00:03:40.900> speeds<00:03:41.260> three<00:03:41.709> four<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.190> five

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
typically speeds three four and five

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.570 
typically speeds three four and five
because<00:03:43.630> it's<00:03:44.170> got<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.410> safety<00:03:44.650> feature<00:03:45.160> and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
because it's got a safety feature and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.210 
because it's got a safety feature and
it'll<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.150> shut<00:03:46.420> off<00:03:46.450> at<00:03:46.930> those<00:03:47.110> speeds<00:03:47.440> when

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
it'll just shut off at those speeds when

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.080 
it'll just shut off at those speeds when
it's<00:03:48.340> out<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.489> water

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
it's out of water

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.750 
it's out of water
but<00:03:49.630> let<00:03:50.440> me<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:50.709> get<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.010> running<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.580> you

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
but let me just get it running for you

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.080 
but let me just get it running for you
you<00:03:52.150> can<00:03:52.360> hear<00:03:52.780> how<00:03:53.440> quiet<00:03:53.800> this<00:03:54.310> motor<00:03:54.640> really

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
you can hear how quiet this motor really

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.850 
you can hear how quiet this motor really
is<00:03:55.269> there's<00:03:55.750> speed<00:03:56.110> one<00:03:56.820> speed<00:03:57.820> two

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
is there's speed one speed two

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.240 
is there's speed one speed two
speed3<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.910> shuts<00:04:02.420> off<00:04:02.710> it<00:04:03.710> doesn't<00:04:04.040> want<00:04:04.160> to

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
speed3 and shuts off it doesn't want to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.420 
speed3 and shuts off it doesn't want to
go<00:04:04.370> too<00:04:04.430> fast<00:04:04.850> when<00:04:05.360> it's<00:04:05.510> out<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.690> water<00:04:05.960> the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
go too fast when it's out of water the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.790 
go too fast when it's out of water the
reverse<00:04:07.430> speeds<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.540> does<00:04:08.780> let<00:04:09.050> me<00:04:09.200> get<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.710> all

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
reverse speeds it does let me get to all

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.710 
reverse speeds it does let me get to all
the<00:04:09.980> all<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.340> way<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.490> three<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.300> let's<00:04:11.330> try<00:04:11.690> it

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
the all the way to three so let's try it

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:21.280 
the all the way to three so let's try it
out<00:04:12.100> speed<00:04:13.100> 1<00:04:15.130> speed<00:04:16.130> 2<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:18.430> speed<00:04:19.430> 3<00:04:20.290> again

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
out speed 1 speed 2 and speed 3 again

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.700 
out speed 1 speed 2 and speed 3 again
shuts<00:04:22.070> off<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.390> can<00:04:23.540> see<00:04:23.780> how<00:04:23.990> quiet<00:04:24.320> this

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
shuts off so you can see how quiet this

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.430 
shuts off so you can see how quiet this
machine<00:04:25.460> really<00:04:25.670> is<00:04:25.960> it's<00:04:26.960> real<00:04:27.380> smooth<00:04:29.440> and

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440
