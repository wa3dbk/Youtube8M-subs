the best form of lubrication known to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.660 
the best form of lubrication known to
man<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.910> call<00:00:43.219> hydrodynamic<00:00:44.219> hydro

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
man is what we call hydrodynamic hydro

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.479 
man is what we call hydrodynamic hydro
mean<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.690> wet<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> dynamic<00:00:46.920> means<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
mean it's wet and dynamic means that it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
mean it's wet and dynamic means that it
moves<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.450> we're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> pour<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> little<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
moves so we're going to pour a little of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.840 
moves so we're going to pour a little of
this<00:00:49.530> oil<00:00:50.719> into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> oil<00:00:52.020> bath<00:00:52.850> sufficient

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
this oil into the oil bath sufficient

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.549 
this oil into the oil bath sufficient
enough<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> where<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.320> have

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
enough to where you can see that we have

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.270 
enough to where you can see that we have
flow<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.250> over<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> bearing<00:00:58.160> what<00:00:59.160> we're

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
flow going over the bearing what we're

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
flow going over the bearing what we're
now<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> fresh

burying it in placed into the torque

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
burying it in placed into the torque
wrench<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.070> we're<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.460> ahead<00:01:05.580> and

we at for foot-pounds Ralph 22 23 we're

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.179 
we at for foot-pounds Ralph 22 23 we're
about<00:01:32.820> 22<00:01:33.390> 23<00:01:33.930> pounds<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.500> pressure<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.040> where

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
about 22 23 pounds of pressure to where

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
about 22 23 pounds of pressure to where
we<00:01:35.310> stop<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.450> time

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
we stop it I'm gonna do it one more time

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.000 
we stop it I'm gonna do it one more time
they're<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.370> seize<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> while<00:01:40.860> we're

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
they're gonna seize it and while we're

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.650 
they're gonna seize it and while we're
simply<00:01:41.400> doing<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.940> squeezing<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
simply doing is squeezing out the

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.890 
simply doing is squeezing out the
lubrication<00:01:43.230> 25<00:01:44.060> again<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.630> that's

lubrication 25 again all that's
happening<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.979> we're<00:01:47.640> forcing<00:01:48.090> the

happening here is that we're forcing the
oil<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.830> oil<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> acting<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.760> barrier

but the purpose of this demonstration is
to<00:03:49.490> show<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.830> lubricating<00:03:51.830> capabilities

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
to show you the lubricating capabilities

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.670 
to show you the lubricating capabilities
and<00:03:52.670> how<00:03:52.760> we<00:03:52.820> improve<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.270> in<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.690> oil<00:03:53.870> we're

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
and how we improve that in the oil we're

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.730 
and how we improve that in the oil we're
going<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.860> put<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.340> few<00:03:55.370> drops<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:56.570> MOA<00:03:57.440> in

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
going to put just a few drops of MOA in

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.940 
going to put just a few drops of MOA in
fact<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:58.850> can<00:03:59.000> use<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.300> pipette<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.680> show<00:04:00.890> you

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
fact we can use this pipette to show you

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.199 
fact we can use this pipette to show you
that<00:04:01.160> we're<00:04:01.280> not<00:04:01.400> going<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.610> use<00:04:01.670> large

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
that we're not going to use large

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.050 
that we're not going to use large
amounts

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.339 

again<00:04:09.060> we're<00:04:09.239> going<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.390> add<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.319> oil

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
again we're going to add it to the oil

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:20.770 
again we're going to add it to the oil
bath<00:04:10.730> just<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.849> few<00:04:12.060> drops<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.599> em<00:04:12.780> away

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.080 

we're<00:04:21.350> going<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.560> take<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.890> 225<00:04:22.580> pounds<00:04:23.030> of

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
we're going to take this 225 pounds of

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:32.379 
we're going to take this 225 pounds of
pressure

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.839 

now<00:04:32.990> if<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.259> notice<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.830> couple<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.699> things

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
now if you notice a couple of things

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.480 
now if you notice a couple of things
have<00:04:35.060> happened<00:04:35.090> number<00:04:35.750> one<00:04:35.960> which<00:04:36.650> we<00:04:37.250> still

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
have happened number one which we still

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.219 
have happened number one which we still
have<00:04:37.639> movement<00:04:37.939> what<00:04:38.479> would<00:04:38.629> that<00:04:38.659> tell<00:04:39.050> you

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
have movement what would that tell you

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.570 
have movement what would that tell you
that<00:04:39.710> would<00:04:39.860> tell<00:04:40.069> you<00:04:40.159> that<00:04:40.310> we've<00:04:40.430> gone

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
that would tell you that we've gone

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.179 
that would tell you that we've gone
ahead<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:40.939> we've<00:04:41.210> increased<00:04:41.659> the<00:04:42.199> lubricity

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:43.189 
ahead and we've increased the lubricity

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.610 
ahead and we've increased the lubricity
in<00:04:43.610> here<00:04:43.849> the<00:04:44.300> friction<00:04:44.539> modifiers<00:04:45.199> in<00:04:45.530> this

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
in here the friction modifiers in this

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.860 
in here the friction modifiers in this
particular<00:04:46.129> product<00:04:46.370> have<00:04:47.030> gone<00:04:47.240> ahead<00:04:47.389> and

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
particular product have gone ahead and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.129 
particular product have gone ahead and
added<00:04:48.289> filled<00:04:48.740> strength<00:04:49.159> to<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> oil<00:04:50.080> now<00:04:51.080> the

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
added filled strength to the oil now the

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.330 
added filled strength to the oil now the
goal<00:04:51.379> here<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.889> not<00:04:52.009> to<00:04:53.169> seize<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.500> oil<00:04:54.530> or<00:04:55.099> to

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
goal here is not to seize the oil or to

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.249 
goal here is not to seize the oil or to
push<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.759> down<00:04:55.969> until<00:04:56.330> we<00:04:56.419> have<00:04:56.569> four<00:04:57.080> or

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
push this down until we have four or

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.839 
push this down until we have four or
five<00:04:57.289> or<00:04:57.740> six<00:04:57.770> hundred<00:04:58.069> pounds<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.610> pressure

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
five or six hundred pounds of pressure

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.119 
five or six hundred pounds of pressure
it's<00:04:59.569> simply<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.110> show<00:05:00.319> you<00:05:00.379> what<00:05:00.620> happens

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
it's simply to show you what happens

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.200 
it's simply to show you what happens
when<00:05:01.759> we<00:05:01.939> add<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.330> motor<00:05:02.539> oil<00:05:03.280> now<00:05:04.280> I'm

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
when we add it to motor oil now I'm

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.559 
when we add it to motor oil now I'm
going<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.449> show<00:05:05.599> you<00:05:06.430> one<00:05:07.430> improvement<00:05:08.120> on<00:05:08.270> our

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
going to show you one improvement on our

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:20.700 
going to show you one improvement on our
bearing

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.190 

before<00:05:21.710> where<00:05:21.920> we<00:05:22.040> had<00:05:22.220> rough<00:05:22.580> ridges<00:05:23.060> in<00:05:23.300> this

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
before where we had rough ridges in this

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.730 
before where we had rough ridges in this
cut<00:05:24.500> we<00:05:25.400> now<00:05:25.610> can<00:05:25.880> take<00:05:25.910> our<00:05:26.390> our<00:05:27.050> screwdriver

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
cut we now can take our our screwdriver

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.490 
cut we now can take our our screwdriver
and<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.280> ridges<00:05:28.610> become<00:05:28.970> smooth<00:05:29.330> now<00:05:30.260> what's

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
and the ridges become smooth now what's

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.210 
and the ridges become smooth now what's
happened<00:05:30.980> here<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.550> basically<00:05:32.480> is<00:05:32.870> that<00:05:33.220> we've

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
happened here is basically is that we've

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.340 
happened here is basically is that we've
got<00:05:34.460> a<00:05:34.490> head<00:05:34.790> with<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.210> MOA<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:36.140> we've

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
got a head with the MOA and we've

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.500 
got a head with the MOA and we've
allowed<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.830> MOA<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.340> go<00:05:37.640> ahead<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.150> work<00:05:38.270> its

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
allowed the MOA to go ahead and work its

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.990 
allowed the MOA to go ahead and work its
way<00:05:38.690> into<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.170> metal<00:05:39.440> to<00:05:39.980> where<00:05:40.190> our<00:05:40.610> rough

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
way into the metal to where our rough

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.100 
way into the metal to where our rough
edges<00:05:41.210> become<00:05:41.750> smooth<00:05:43.390> call<00:05:44.390> it<00:05:44.480> magic<00:05:44.840> call

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
edges become smooth call it magic call

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.900 
edges become smooth call it magic call
it<00:05:45.230> whatever<00:05:45.380> you<00:05:45.560> want<00:05:45.860> but<00:05:46.160> basically<00:05:46.640> what

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
it whatever you want but basically what

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.790 
it whatever you want but basically what
it<00:05:46.940> happens<00:05:47.480> here<00:05:47.690> is<00:05:47.870> is<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.080> we're<00:05:48.320> we're

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
it happens here is is that we're we're

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.890 
it happens here is is that we're we're
having<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.460> we're<00:05:49.640> having<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:50.030> process<00:05:50.300> take

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
having it we're having a process take

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.650 
having it we're having a process take
place<00:05:50.930> where<00:05:51.470> we're<00:05:52.190> basically<00:05:53.000> filling<00:05:53.450> the

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
place where we're basically filling the

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.140 
place where we're basically filling the
gaps<00:05:53.900> those<00:05:54.500> disparities<00:05:55.040> in<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.490> metal<00:05:55.760> and

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
gaps those disparities in the metal and

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.370 
gaps those disparities in the metal and
that's<00:05:56.210> what<00:05:56.450> we're<00:05:56.600> doing<00:05:56.870> here<00:05:57.020> now<00:05:57.230> that's

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
that's what we're doing here now that's

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.080 
that's what we're doing here now that's
what<00:05:57.590> happens<00:05:57.950> if<00:05:58.100> we<00:05:58.220> start<00:05:58.250> with<00:05:58.670> a<00:05:58.700> used

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
what happens if we start with a used

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
what happens now when we add MOA to a

what happens now when we add MOA to a

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.380 
new vehicle and we're going to do that
simply<00:06:17.660> by<00:06:17.780> turning<00:06:17.840> this<00:06:18.640> to<00:06:19.640> a<00:06:19.670> new<00:06:19.880> fresh

simply by turning this to a new fresh
spot<00:06:21.940> just<00:06:22.940> moving<00:06:23.240> your<00:06:23.360> bearing<00:06:23.630> slightly

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630

we're going to take this 225 pounds
again

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.220 

this<00:07:10.950> is<00:07:11.130> the<00:07:11.250> worn<00:07:11.490> spot<00:07:11.850> when<00:07:12.720> we<00:07:12.810> started

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230 
this is the worn spot when we started

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.340 
this is the worn spot when we started
with<00:07:13.410> a<00:07:13.670> with<00:07:14.670> oil<00:07:14.970> only<00:07:15.300> and<00:07:15.630> then<00:07:15.720> added<00:07:16.050> MOA

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
with a with oil only and then added MOA

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.300 
with a with oil only and then added MOA
at<00:07:16.740> a<00:07:16.770> later<00:07:17.040> date<00:07:18.320> this<00:07:19.320> is<00:07:19.560> a<00:07:19.590> spot<00:07:19.980> when<00:07:20.190> we

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
at a later date this is a spot when we

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.000 
at a later date this is a spot when we
started<00:07:20.670> using<00:07:20.850> MOA<00:07:21.300> when<00:07:21.810> the<00:07:21.930> car<00:07:22.170> was<00:07:22.380> brand

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010 
started using MOA when the car was brand

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.510 
started using MOA when the car was brand
new

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520

I<00:07:24.350> think<00:07:25.350> there's<00:07:25.530> a<00:07:25.590> significant<00:07:26.340> difference

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
I think there's a significant difference

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.360 
I think there's a significant difference
if<00:07:27.600> in<00:07:27.780> fact<00:07:27.960> this<00:07:28.230> were<00:07:28.410> your<00:07:28.620> car<00:07:28.890> where

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 
if in fact this were your car where

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.260 
if in fact this were your car where
would<00:07:29.580> you<00:07:29.700> want<00:07:29.880> to<00:07:29.940> start<00:07:30.150> using<00:07:30.330> MOA<00:07:31.220> before

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
would you want to start using MOA before

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.020 
would you want to start using MOA before
but<00:07:33.270> it's<00:07:33.420> new<00:07:33.630> or<00:07:33.980> after<00:07:34.980> the<00:07:35.160> wear<00:07:35.340> processes

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030
