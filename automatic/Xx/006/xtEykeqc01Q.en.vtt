00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
little bit 70s and then I added these

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 
little bit 70s and then I added these
soft<00:00:26.189> romantic<00:00:26.430> waves<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.240> finish<00:00:27.510> off<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
soft romantic waves to finish off the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.140 
soft romantic waves to finish off the
look<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.410> you'd<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.279> how<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.849> done

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
look if you'd like to see how it's done

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
look if you'd like to see how it's done
then<00:00:30.570> stay<00:00:31.050> tuned<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.679> basically<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> first

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
then stay tuned so basically the first

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.130 
then stay tuned so basically the first
step<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.480> you're<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> want

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
step to do this is you're going to want

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139 
step to do this is you're going to want
a<00:00:34.230> deep<00:00:34.469> part<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.550> tend<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
a deep part so if you tend to have a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.000 
a deep part so if you tend to have a
center<00:00:36.690> part<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.110> something<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.559> just

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
center part or something like that just

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.760 
center part or something like that just
take<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.879> comb<00:00:39.120> or<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.480> finger<00:00:39.870> create

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
take a little comb or your finger create

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.740 
take a little comb or your finger create
a<00:00:40.800> deeper<00:00:41.520> part<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
a deeper part because that's going to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
a deeper part because that's going to
give<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.290> dramatic<00:00:43.410> result<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
give you a more dramatic result so to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.850 
give you a more dramatic result so to
start<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:45.000> taking<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> small<00:00:46.140> section<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
start I'm taking just a small section of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.670 
start I'm taking just a small section of
hair<00:00:47.090> from<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> front<00:00:48.360> near<00:00:49.050> where<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.289> bangs

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
hair from the front near where my bangs

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
hair from the front near where my bangs
are<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> cut<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.239> into

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
are and I'm just going to cut that into

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.010 
are and I'm just going to cut that into
three<00:00:51.809> sections<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.210> I'm

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
three sections just like that I'm

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.270 
three sections just like that I'm
holding<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.710> between<00:00:56.070> my<00:00:56.219> knuckles

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
holding them in between my knuckles

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.979 
holding them in between my knuckles
because<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.570> easier<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
because that's a little bit easier to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.260 
because that's a little bit easier to
have<00:00:58.739> control<00:00:59.129> over<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.699> we're<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.910> take

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
have control over so we're gonna take

hair there we're going to braid once

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.250 
hair there we're going to braid once
twice<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.730> here<00:03:20.970> are<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.209> three<00:03:21.390> new<00:03:21.720> strands

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
as we're going it's gonna start creating

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.809 
as we're going it's gonna start creating
a<00:03:27.150> little<00:03:27.299> bit<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.690> ladder<00:03:27.959> effect<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.760> I'm

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
a little bit of a ladder effect so I'm

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.630 
a little bit of a ladder effect so I'm
going<00:03:30.090> back<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.750> roots<00:03:30.959> here<00:03:31.640> grabbing

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
going back up to the roots here grabbing

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.420 
going back up to the roots here grabbing
some<00:03:32.880> more<00:03:33.060> hair<00:03:33.980> bringing<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.069> all<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.250> way

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
some more hair bringing it all the way

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.849 
some more hair bringing it all the way
to<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.730> bottom<00:03:36.079> we're<00:03:37.079> going<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.380> braid<00:03:38.299> once

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
to the bottom we're going to braid once

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.539 
to the bottom we're going to braid once
twice<00:03:42.799> I'm<00:03:43.799> putting<00:03:44.100> them<00:03:44.190> back<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.519> my

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
now from here instead of going straight

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.610 
now from here instead of going straight

so we have the three new strands we're

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:13.350 
so we have the three new strands we're
gonna<00:04:04.360> braid<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.930> once<00:04:06.570> twice<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:12.580> for<00:04:13.240> this

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
gonna braid this once twice and for this

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.210 
gonna braid this once twice and for this
new<00:04:13.600> strand<00:04:13.990> I'm<00:04:14.950> gonna<00:04:15.880> pull<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.570> tight<00:04:17.220> but
