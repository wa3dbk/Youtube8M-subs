00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
files on the driving test to go over

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.849 
files on the driving test to go over
them<00:00:06.359> too<00:00:06.569> fast<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.049> make<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> bumpy<00:00:07.710> ride

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
them too fast and make it a bumpy ride

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.339 
them too fast and make it a bumpy ride
and<00:00:08.189> very<00:00:09.030> relevant<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.599> reaction<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:10.050> hazard

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and very relevant to reaction or hazard

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.049 
and very relevant to reaction or hazard
so<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.889> got<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.309> your<00:00:11.340> drug<00:00:11.580> test<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
so have you got on your drug test and

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.539 
so have you got on your drug test and
you<00:00:12.120> go<00:00:12.269> over<00:00:12.420> around<00:00:12.780> too<00:00:13.170> fast<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.830> he<00:00:14.400> makes

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
you go over around too fast and he makes

you go over around too fast and he makes
it<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.000> bumpy<00:00:15.299> roads<00:00:15.599> you'll<00:00:15.780> get<00:00:15.960> mad<00:00:16.109> for

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
it the bumpy roads you'll get mad for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.410 
it the bumpy roads you'll get mad for
reaction<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.770> hazard<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.210> four

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
reaction that hazard if you do have four

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.910 
reaction that hazard if you do have four
times<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.869> your<00:00:18.960> driving<00:00:19.140> test<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.710> far

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
times in your driving test and get far

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070 
times in your driving test and get far
away<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> fall<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.670> you'll<00:00:21.119> fail<00:00:21.359> when

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
away to fall to that you'll fail when

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.269 
away to fall to that you'll fail when
you<00:00:22.199> approach<00:00:22.380> around<00:00:22.680> during<00:00:22.949> your<00:00:23.039> driving

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
you approach around during your driving

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.650 
you approach around during your driving
test<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> make<00:00:24.090> sure<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.449> over

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
test you have to make sure you go over

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.359 
test you have to make sure you go over
to<00:00:24.689> smoothly<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.010> speed<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to smoothly so you just your speed and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.099 
to smoothly so you just your speed and
your<00:00:26.460> gears<00:00:26.760> sometimes<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.420> accordance<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
your gears sometimes in accordance to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
your gears sometimes in accordance to
that<00:00:28.230> ramp<00:00:28.580> generally<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> red<00:00:30.029> brick

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that ramp generally if it's a red brick

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.849 
that ramp generally if it's a red brick
from<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.750> more<00:00:30.990> severe<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> go

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
from it's more severe so you have to go

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.840 
from it's more severe so you have to go
over<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.040> bit<00:00:32.160> slower<00:00:32.430> than<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> normally

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
over a bit slower than you normally

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.459 
over a bit slower than you normally
would<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.660> black<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.989> white<00:00:34.079> mount<00:00:34.290> for

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
would but black and white mount for

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.229 
would but black and white mount for
example<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> show<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
example so I'm now going to show you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.729 
example so I'm now going to show you
examples<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:37.110> kinds<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.500> ramps

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
examples of different kinds of ramps

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.900 
examples of different kinds of ramps
that<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.920> may<00:00:38.070> encounter<00:00:38.219> during<00:00:38.640> your

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that you may encounter during your

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.630 
that you may encounter during your
driving<00:00:39.180> test

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.420 

once<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:43.600> turn<00:00:43.810> up<00:00:43.840> this<00:00:43.990> role<00:00:44.230> of<00:00:45.160> the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
once I turn up this role of the

once I turn up this role of the
importing<00:00:45.850> run<00:00:46.060> back<00:00:46.360> my<00:00:46.570> grandson<00:00:46.960> Jacob

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
importing run back my grandson Jacob

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.420 
importing run back my grandson Jacob
warmer<00:00:47.530> relatively<00:00:47.920> quickly

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
warmer relatively quickly

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.450 
warmer relatively quickly
or<00:00:48.610> maybe<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.030> tried<00:00:49.240> to<00:00:49.360> reach<00:00:49.510> 45<00:00:50.470> 50<00:00:51.190> stones

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
or maybe the tried to reach 45 50 stones

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.950 
or maybe the tried to reach 45 50 stones
of<00:00:51.580> the<00:00:51.670> car<00:00:51.880> just<00:00:52.330> going<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.540> class<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.840> guys

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
of the car just going to class the guys

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.500 
of the car just going to class the guys
for<00:00:53.170> split<00:00:53.380> seconds<00:00:53.830> over<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.910> back<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.360> gas

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
for split seconds over a back on the gas

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.200 
for split seconds over a back on the gas
the<00:00:56.050> next<00:00:56.290> ramp<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.590> really<00:00:56.950> flat<00:00:57.190> so<00:00:57.940> it<00:00:58.060> can

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
the next ramp is really flat so it can

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.870 
the next ramp is really flat so it can
now<00:00:58.300> get<00:00:58.510> my<00:00:58.600> speed<00:00:58.840> in<00:00:59.020> between<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.559> go<00:00:59.880> 4550

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
now get my speed in between to go 4550

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.500 
now get my speed in between to go 4550
to<00:01:01.059> talk<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.420> girls<00:01:01.540> again<00:01:02.640> over<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:04.300> there

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
to talk to girls again over and there

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.850 
to talk to girls again over and there
will<00:01:04.630> wait<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.900> increase<00:01:05.140> my<00:01:05.290> speed<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.770> I'm

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
will wait and increase my speed so I'm

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.940 
will wait and increase my speed so I'm
making<00:01:06.340> good<00:01:06.460> progress<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:08.410> I<00:01:08.530> don't<00:01:08.710> need<00:01:08.860> to

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
making good progress and I don't need to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.800 
making good progress and I don't need to
break<00:01:09.070> for<00:01:09.250> example<00:01:09.670> unless<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.060> dormitory

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.050 

these<00:01:15.740> are<00:01:15.860> relatively<00:01:16.159> new<00:01:16.280> realms<00:01:16.700> money<00:01:16.909> to

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
these are relatively new realms money to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.609 
these are relatively new realms money to
do<00:01:17.270> anything<00:01:17.450> more<00:01:17.659> please<00:01:17.930> we're<00:01:18.140> breaking<00:01:18.560> a

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
do anything more please we're breaking a

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.289 
do anything more please we're breaking a
little<00:01:18.860> bit<00:01:18.979> more<00:01:19.219> here<00:01:19.460> from<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.729> tour<00:01:19.969> here

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
little bit more here from the tour here

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.690 
little bit more here from the tour here
so<00:01:20.990> just<00:01:21.020> approaching<00:01:21.469> it<00:01:21.680> now<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.130> just<00:01:22.369> off<00:01:22.520> -

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
so just approaching it now so just off -

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.690 
so just approaching it now so just off -
gasps<00:01:22.899> thought<00:01:23.899> gently<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.680> break<00:01:24.950> after

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
gasps thought gently on the break after

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.730 
gasps thought gently on the break after
breaking<00:01:26.270> all<00:01:26.420> work<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.140> my<00:01:27.259> speed<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:27.500> about

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
breaking all work so my speed is about

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.980 
breaking all work so my speed is about
20<00:01:28.070> kilometers<00:01:28.100> an<00:01:28.549> hour<00:01:28.640> going<00:01:28.880> over<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.179> 40

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
20 kilometers an hour going over that 40

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.550 
20 kilometers an hour going over that 40
would<00:01:30.140> feel<00:01:30.350> too<00:01:30.560> fast

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.830 

they<00:01:38.400> were<00:01:38.460> parking<00:01:38.850> at<00:01:38.940> red<00:01:39.270> brick<00:01:39.510> ramps

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
they were parking at red brick ramps

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.220 
they were parking at red brick ramps
which<00:01:40.050> are<00:01:40.310> generally<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.550> refer<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.880> as

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
which are generally what we refer to as

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.660 
which are generally what we refer to as
Torquay<00:01:43.230> rumps<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.160> are<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.370> little<00:01:44.550> bit

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
Torquay rumps but these are a little bit

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
Torquay rumps but these are a little bit
more<00:01:45.390> severe<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.380> need<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.710> buddies<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
more severe so need to go buddies a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.310 
more severe so need to go buddies a
little<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.370> flour<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.750> 25

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
little bit flour so it's just about 25

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.860 
little bit flour so it's just about 25
kilometres<00:01:49.800> an<00:01:49.860> hour<00:01:49.950> there<00:01:50.690> again<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.720> don't

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
kilometres an hour there again I don't

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.270 
kilometres an hour there again I don't
need<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.320> over<00:01:52.440> these<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> second<00:01:53.100> gear

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
need to go over these and second gear

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
need to go over these and second gear
once<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.910> over<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.330> slowing<00:01:54.750> off<00:01:54.900> going

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
once I go over them slowing off going

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.140 
once I go over them slowing off going
over<00:01:55.410> these<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.710> second<00:01:56.100> gear<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.460> unnecessary

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
over these in second gear is unnecessary

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.820 
over these in second gear is unnecessary
but<00:01:57.900> just<00:01:58.050> need<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.320> over<00:01:58.410> them<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> little

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
but just need to go over them a little

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.120 
but just need to go over them a little
bit<00:01:58.979> slower<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.720> when<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> approach<00:02:01.500> any<00:02:01.770> ramp

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
bit slower so when you approach any ramp

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.609 
bit slower so when you approach any ramp
the<00:02:02.310> first<00:02:02.550> thing<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.910> is<00:02:03.290> analyze<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.500> as

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the first thing to do is analyze it as

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.469 
the first thing to do is analyze it as
you<00:02:04.740> approach<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.550> how<00:02:05.640> high<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.910> is<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you approach it and see how high it is a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.840 
you approach it and see how high it is a
red<00:02:07.440> brick<00:02:07.619> round<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.039> there<00:02:08.220> any<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.520> severe

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
red brick round is there any more severe

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.400 
red brick round is there any more severe
than<00:02:08.970> black<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.330> moist<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:10.050> need<00:02:10.350> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
than black of moist so you will need to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.460 
than black of moist so you will need to
maybe<00:02:10.619> break<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.310> bit<00:02:11.430> more<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.390 

they're<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.680> show<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.860> black<00:02:17.160> boy

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
they're going to show you black boy

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
they're going to show you black boy

be<00:03:17.549> too<00:03:17.670> close<00:03:17.879> for<00:03:17.999> Harrison<00:03:18.569> so<00:03:18.689> I<00:03:18.749> want<00:03:18.870> to

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
be too close for Harrison so I want to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.629 
be too close for Harrison so I want to
go<00:03:19.019> over<00:03:19.200> smoothly<00:03:19.439> a<00:03:19.739> bit<00:03:19.859> of<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.040> wheels<00:03:20.249> a

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
go over smoothly a bit of the wheels a

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.640 
go over smoothly a bit of the wheels a
little<00:03:21.180> bit<00:03:21.359> bumpy<00:03:21.629> there<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.139> that's<00:03:22.319> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
little bit bumpy there but that's the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.449 
little bit bumpy there but that's the
best<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:22.980> do

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
best I can do
