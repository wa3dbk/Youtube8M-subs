00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 temporary use devices 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.940
 used when the track is under construction 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.940
 or in emergency situations 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 devices are 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.400
 which use luminous resources 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.010
 to provide better 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.170
 visualization of the signaling or 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.380
 coupled with electronic elements 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.500
 allow the variation of the signaling or 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.700
 messages as situation warning 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.410
 unexpected forward educational messages 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.559
 transit guidance for the use of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.460
 of alternative routes and regulation of 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.460
 use of the route 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 the traffic light 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.410
 have the function of carrying out the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.800
 traffic control at intersections 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.270
 through luminous indications 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.609
 alternating the right of passage of 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.580
 several streams of vehicles or 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.460
 pedestrians for vehicles composed of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.860
 three luminous indications arranged in the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.530
 sequence set when 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.770
 composed of two luminous indications 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.680
 red and green is for exclusive use in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.680
 specific access control such as 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.409
 toll plazas and ferries symbols that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 can be isolated or integrated into a 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.860
 two or three indicator lights 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:40.409
 luminous means controlled direction 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.450
 to control the flow of pedestrians are 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.450
 in green and red colors 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.830
 warning signaling 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.400
 has the function of warning of the existence 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.159
 obstacle or dangerous situation composes 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.909
 one or two lights of yellow color 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:08.780
 whose operation is intermittent or 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:12.140
 Flashing alternating sound signal one 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.030
 short hiss remains used to release 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.200
 the traffic towards the direction 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.600
 indicated by the agent 2 short hisses 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.750
 stop indicates a mandatory stop for

 confer documents or other purposes 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.510
 a long hiss slow down when 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.720
 need to slow down 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:38.570
 of agent vehicles 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.510
 vertically raised arm transit 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.670
 with the palm of the hand to the order 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.680
 a mandatory stop for all 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.690
 vehicles extended arms 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.060

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.340
 all vehicles coming from directions 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.910
 that orthogonally cut the direction

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.370
 stop for all vehicles that come 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.799
 directions that cut orthogonally to the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.799
 direction indicated by extended arm 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.000
 arm extended horizontally with the

 palm down doing 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.799
 vertical movements decrease order

 speed arm waving 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:38.829
 a red light the stop order for 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.829
 vehicles to which the light is directed to 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.540
 order to follow arm lifted with the 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:51.019
 forearm moving the palm of the hand 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:54.280
 Rear-facing driver's gestures 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.330
 left arm stretched horizontally 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.970
 left conversion 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.760
 the left arm stretched out

 signs down and up 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:27.120
 slow down or stop alert 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.750
 conductive nature of the danger 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.470
 plates warning services 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.470
 without an indication of 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.470
 regulation 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.470
 increases the visibility of the 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.110
 There are no plumbing 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.570
 longitudinal marks six marks 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.570
 crosses of studs and studs 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:09.469
 for inspection of documents the agent 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:12.649
 should use a long hiss of 15 brief 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.339
 two short hisses from any of the 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:15.339
 previous alternatives 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:28.019
 the signaling subsystem which is 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:32.699
 use of side plates or suspended plates 

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:37.189
 on the horizontal and vertical track c 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.189
 all indications above 

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:47.669
 the purpose of the use on the road 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.669
 public white color cones 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.379
 reflective and orange is to alert 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.829
 drivers for emergency situations 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:58.459
 or danger of what I channel the 

00:05:55.829 --> 00:06:01.079
 traffic to protect pedestrians 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:05.749
 construction workers and equipment 

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:05.749
 hence all the statements are correct 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:18.089
 the control panel is used for the 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:21.059
 Unexpected situation warning 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:24.989
 front of all the statements are 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:28.039
 with no educational messages to the 

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:30.389
 road users' behavior 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:33.319
 speed regulation in function 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.319
 of the flow of vehicles 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.699
 the standard shape of the 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:51.840
 regulation is to be rectangular and 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.840
 circular and square v. to go now 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:03.940
 the pre-set color lights are 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:07.389
 used for flow control of the 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.639
 only for animal-drawn vehicles and 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:13.419
 only for propulsion vehicles 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:25.539
 vehicle parking and 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:27.370
 of pedestrians and / or vehicles on a 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:29.560
 whose traffic lanes are or are 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:33.580
 separated white balls we can say 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.570
 there is a one-way street 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.870
 double-handed 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.870
 it is a road Bie a bicycle path 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:51.669
 the direction and direction plates 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:55.630
 direction and distance of rectangular shape 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:08:00.220
 are shown in black and green 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:03.660
 be white and blue I know black and white of 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.660
 green and white
