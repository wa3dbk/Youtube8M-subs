00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone, we are starting a new one 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.790
 rubric to be called tips 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.040
 and tricks 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.860
 the pain must pass under funny 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 motto you want to learn to teach yourself 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.289
 this other this heading will be 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.250
 from a series of short little videos 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 minute or two 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.490
 I will not talk about my little 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 the tricks and secrets that I use 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.599
 in the hope that it will be useful to someone 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.550
 but not according to 2 the motto will be if 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:37.170
 you can not help all this is not a reason 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.670
 help one and so part 1 that is for now 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.789
 the only first she will be with us about 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 silicone bait me personally in 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.110
 silicone bait 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 very annoying one factor if 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 soft silicone 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.920
 Consider the example of this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.390
 wonderful creamer 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 from keitech so here if the silicone is soft and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.360
 and watch out for all kinds of not only ops 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.909
 these and on simple hooks he has one 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.680
 highly 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.890
 nasty nervously you feature but 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.430
 worst of all is that this feature affects 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.710
 wiring quality often bait 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.520
 Slazit software of this hook is how we 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.530
 We see here and so it hangs like that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.150
 there is if she clings to rakushnyak for 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.030
 something is firmly on necessarily 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.250
 slezet somehow at and, respectively, 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 wiring quality and lost more accurately 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.939
 not only the wiring quality is lost 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 all its meaning is completely lost and 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.200
 expediency but beyond that me 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.250
 it's just annoying 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 very much and I was thinking about 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.509
 principle, of course not particularly thought that there 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.759
 think and found a way out how to deal with it 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.869
 to help to combat this disease in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.329
 I've got such things here 100 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.850
 Park usually for on ordinary fishing line 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.610
 who hang in float fishing 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.750
 Well, not only these are naturally 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.610
 100 park and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.160
 help me get rid of this not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.970
 good bait creep effect 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.460
 I will show you how on these 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.980
 photos you see that these 100 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.860
 barge cut into several pieces and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.310
 hooked in the future help 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.680
 protect very well from this 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.260
 the effect of creeping bait like us 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.660
 cycle and the normal hook I am now 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.810
 I use it all over the place and I can say 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.290
 With confidence that she works on 146 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.709
 percent so if you are tormented 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.380

 This weaponry works very well 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.660
 and helps to keep 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.560
