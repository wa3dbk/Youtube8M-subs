 alice under the orders of albert wesker 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.090
 the character was integrated into the movie 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.550
 as one of the many requests of the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.769
 fans of the video game despite the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.870
 controversial romantic relationship that exists 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.120
 between this character and leoneses kennedy 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.489
 in the original material and commented that the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.470
 relationship between both will be subtle the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.860
 actress commented that to prepare for 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.780
 his character analyzed videogames 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.430
 arianna engineer as betty is the daughter

 of one of Alice's clones in the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.740
 escape from the facilities 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.900
 or to be like Carlos Olivera a couple of 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.290
 clones created by umbrella from 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.840
 adn of the deceased agent Moriscos as 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.730
 Luther is a former basketball player 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.500
 that survived the global outbreak of 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.080
 virus that when taking refuge in a prison 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.450
 of the angels after having separated 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.490
 alice chris and clair luther has 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.050
 united to the resistance together with lions and 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.210
 kennedy 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.610
 salmon colin like james guancha from a 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.410
 clone of the deceased agent developed 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.140
 thanks to the umbrella technology 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.150
 works for jill valentine and her mission 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.120
 is to prevent the alice project from achieving 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.210
 escape now I will talk about the monsters and 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.130
 villains of the movie zombies that were 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.350
 normal people who became infected with 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.180
 the virus that you are all the time in 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.360
 the movie and they will only care 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.130
 feed on meat from living people 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.200
 zombies with weapons that are a version 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.790
 improved of the zombies but with the 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.090
 ability to use firearms and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.310
 ax executioner vehicles that had already 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.560
 appearance in the previous delivery but in 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.450
 this delivery appear two executioners for 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.700
 end with alice da 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.010
 giant clicker is a bug that has 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.360
 increased proportionally and 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.570
 It will make the 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.120
 protagonists clones de rain ocampo 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.130
 Carlos Olivera and James Guancha 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.980
 they will be part of the umbrella army 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.290
 serving there and jill valentine with 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.270
 controller now returns as villain 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.450
 who runs the umbrella team for 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.790
 capture lis but then join alice 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.860
 and finally the red queen if the same 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.930
 that appeared in the first installment but 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.060
 now renewed she is controlling 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.670
 umbrella and its purpose is to destroy all the 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.460
 humanity now my analysis of the 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.380
 movie and opinion for me this movie 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.140
 I thought it was good and entertaining there 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.300
 some moments that surprised me but 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.340
 now as fans of the good game in 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.290
 reality at this point is ridiculous 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.170
 judge and compare this movie with the 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.550
 video game in a matter of history 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.740
 frankly I consider the movies 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.290
 based on video games as a spin off 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.090
 or it will always be an alternate story 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.670
 that has nothing to do with the game 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.470
 original I will only compare the relationship with 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.300
 the game characters and the actors 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.030
 who interpret them 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.340
 lions and kennedy their clothes are the same as 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.919
 resident evil 4 but its appearance 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.870
 it looks like the resident evil lion 6 in his 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.150
 acting as a rescue leader is 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.400
 Well always work in an equal team 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.500
 as in the game but there was a part that 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.840
 I was disappointed in the scene that escape 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.300
 of the base and the lic the giant captures 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.069
 the lion girl does not care about her and 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.349
 discuss with Alice when she wants 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.659
 rescue her the real lion would be the 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.030
 first to offer to rescue her and 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.979
 Finally I found funny and 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.129
 that in a scene he touches his leg to 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.800
 this lion came out a long hand xd a 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.229
 dawang his physical resemblance is the same but 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.819
 in his way of acting, I was not convinced 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.340
 true fairy behaves in a way 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.650
 discreet and mysterious and his performance in 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.159
 the movie is not the same and I thought 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.379
 something shy jill valentine the acting 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.569
 it was good frankly I liked the 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.759
 interpretation of the actress in particular 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.129
 in the combat scene because it looked 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.259
 very pretty xd almost the same as in the 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:34.050
 Resident Evil 5 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.060
 barry burton the performance was fine 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.230
 but the bad thing is that he did not have much 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.180
 dialogue and the worst 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.860
 is that they kill him I would have wanted 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.410
 it was like in the first resident evil 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.410
 that betrays his friends but then he 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.200
 Repent and try to fix his mistake 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.360
 and finally Albert Wesker as in 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.550
 the previous movie was fine its 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.770
 acting in this movie he is the boss 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.960
 of the last defense of humanity and 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.490
 he went planning the alice rescue he 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.580
 wants to stop the red queen and 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.650
 destroy good umbrella I will not tell you 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.870
 how the movie ends but something that 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.760
 it is sure that there will be a sixth part and this 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.180
 It will be the last one but for the character 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.490
 alice conclusion the movie was fine 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.890
 had its pros and cons but it's 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.260
 passable good for the normal public and 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.480
 for a fan, it can displease you a little 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.700
 but remember to consider 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.010
 movies based on video games as a 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.320
 spin-off or will always be a story 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.090
 alternate that has nothing to do with the 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.940
 original game 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.699
 in a rating from 1 to 10 I give it 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.430
 a good 75 movie that is going to 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:40.470
 entertain a good time xd 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.720
 thanks for watching the video do not forget 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.669
 comment and think about the movie and so on 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.949
 share ideas and wait in the next 

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:48.949
 review of 'resident evil' the mansion
