00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.240
 in this video we will make a charger 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:14.780
 home portable for the cell 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.780
 [Music] 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.130
 to make the circuit we will need the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.950
 following components a 7805 regulator 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.850
 a 9 volt battery a connector 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.700
 for the battery a female usb connector and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 cables we grasp in this way the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.870
 connector this contact is the positive and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.350
 this the negative the two contacts of the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.020
 center we will not use them 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.510
 [Music] 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.270
 let go of the red wire 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.280
 positive and the cable black to 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.459
 negative 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.459
 [Music] 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.070
 we separated the legs a little 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.360
 regulator to be able to weld 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.360
 [Music] 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.280
 let's loose the connector positive from the 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.240
 battery to the left leg of the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.450
 regulator 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.139
 and the negative to the central leg 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.139
 [Music] 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.399
 we solder the positive of the usb connector to 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.399
 the right leg of the regulator 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.390
 [Music] 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.390
 and the negative to the middle leg 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.629
 [Music] 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.419
 [Music] 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.479
 we tested the circuit 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.479
 [Music] 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.890
 we bring the cell phone and the usb cable 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:36.660
 we connect 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:38.880
 [Music] 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:51.960
 and we see that the charger works 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:54.410
 correctly we see how much is the voltage 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.410
 of entry 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.390
 8 points 7 volts 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.939
 and the output should give us 5 volts 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.939
 [Music] 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.480
 this is the work of the regulator of 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.159
 voltage 7805 regulates the voltage to 5 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.129
 volts to use it in some 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.739
 circuit that requires 5 volts in 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.510
 this case we use the 5 volts for 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.480
 charge the battery cell that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.849
 it also requires 5 volts this 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.889
 simple circuit we can use it in 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.709
 those moments that we do not have energy 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.139
 electric at home now we go to 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.090
 manufacture the circuit housing for 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.549
 make the housing we can use 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.250
 any material in this case 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.319
 we will use rubber cut it into pieces 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.840
 the housing of a printer that no longer 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.019
 served and from there I extracted the rubber to 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.290
 do the job well we cut in six 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.409
 small pieces if you want the measurements 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.840
 will be in the description of the video in 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.510
 one of the small pieces we make a 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.680
 USB connector diameter hole 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.140
 [Music] 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.190
 now we just have to arm the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:27.170
 pieces of rubber 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:30.170
 [Music] 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.170
 ah 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:05:08.620
 [Music] 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.520
 we isolate all the metal part of the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:31.529
 regulator 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:31.529
 [Music] 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.880
 we put the connector in the hole that 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.880
 we did 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.840
 we will place it in this way 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:58.210
 and we fix the connector 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:06:02.110
 [Music] 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.110
 we isolate the contacts 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.000
 and we put the circuit in the small 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.450
 drawer that we made 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.450
 [Music] 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.450
 ah 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.330
 we throw glue to join the pieces 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:31.080
 [Music] 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.080
 we put the battery 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.420
 and with the other piece we close we put 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.170
 tape to make it very easy to extract 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.170
 Battery 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.429
 [Music] 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:57.870
 and ready finished work 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:57.870
 [Music] 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.160
 good friends if the video they liked denle 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:10.790
 a click on I like subscribe to the channel 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.100
 and share the video thanks to all and 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:32.040
 until the next video
