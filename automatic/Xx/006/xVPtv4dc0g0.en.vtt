think you start rolling at the top and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.200 
think you start rolling at the top and
you<00:00:45.100> want<00:00:45.219> to<00:00:45.399> start<00:00:45.609> as<00:00:45.730> little<00:00:45.969> as<00:00:46.030> possible

bulk you have right so make it small and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.119 
bulk you have right so make it small and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.569 
there remove a first sock poking out and
you'll<00:01:26.469> just<00:01:26.619> start<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.189> rolling<00:01:27.430> process

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
you'll just start the rolling process

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.719 
you'll just start the rolling process
over<00:01:28.030> starting<00:01:28.509> by<00:01:28.630> rolling<00:01:29.110> that<00:01:29.259> over<00:01:29.799> your

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
over starting by rolling that over your

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
over starting by rolling that over your
original<00:01:30.820> sock<00:01:31.299> you<00:01:31.780> just<00:01:31.960> keep<00:01:32.109> rolling<00:01:32.469> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.770 

occasionally<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:39.820> might<00:01:39.969> have<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.240> tug<00:01:40.509> on<00:01:40.719> it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
occasionally you might have to tug on it

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.569 
occasionally you might have to tug on it
a<00:01:40.930> little<00:01:41.170> bit<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.409> get<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.649> more<00:01:41.770> compact<00:01:42.280> and

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
a little bit to get it more compact and

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.310 
a little bit to get it more compact and
that<00:01:42.700> way<00:01:42.789> you<00:01:42.880> have<00:01:42.939> more<00:01:43.180> stuff<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.570> roll<00:01:43.750> but

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
that way you have more stuff to roll but

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.959 
that way you have more stuff to roll but
you<00:01:44.409> see<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.740> creates<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.130> pretty<00:01:45.340> even<00:01:45.759> bun

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
you see it creates a pretty even bun

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.020

on<00:01:51.340> one<00:01:51.520> side<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:52.000> don't<00:01:52.179> worry<00:01:52.299> about<00:01:52.390> that

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
on one side but don't worry about that

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.240 
on one side but don't worry about that
it's<00:01:52.810> really<00:01:52.929> not<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.590> noticeable<00:01:53.770> once<00:01:54.189> you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
it's really not that noticeable once you

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.880 
it's really not that noticeable once you
put<00:01:54.399> hair<00:01:54.549> around<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:54.939> so<00:01:55.719> the<00:01:56.259> end<00:01:56.409> result<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
put hair around it so the end result and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.380 
put hair around it so the end result and
then<00:01:56.979> you'll<00:01:57.100> have<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.340> cut<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.969> end<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.240> that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
then you'll have to cut the end of that

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.510 
then you'll have to cut the end of that
obviously<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:59.109> create<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.679> sock<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.310> goes<00:02:00.429> all
