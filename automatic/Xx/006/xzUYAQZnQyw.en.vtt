with a cup of coffee or a pitcher if
you're<00:00:26.010> me<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.880> turns<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.480> is

you're me and it turns out that is
a-okay<00:00:28.260> totally<00:00:28.920> fine

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
your daily coffee intake may actually

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.190 
your daily coffee intake may actually
reduce<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.520> risk<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.940> type<00:00:36.180> 2<00:00:36.239> diabetes<00:00:36.420> yep

and<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.280> only<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> people<00:00:54.270> who

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and not only that but the people who

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
and not only that but the people who
decreased<00:00:55.140> their<00:00:55.440> coffee<00:00:55.649> consumption<00:00:56.160> by

more than a cup per day actually

more than a cup per day actually

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.260 
increase their risk for type 2 diabetes
by<00:01:00.840> 17<00:01:01.350> percent<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.190> pretty<00:01:02.370> surprising<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
by 17 percent it's pretty surprising and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.670 
by 17 percent it's pretty surprising and
keep<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.629> mind<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.960> applies<00:01:04.229> only<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
keep in mind this applies only to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
keep in mind this applies only to
caffeinated<00:01:05.369> coffee<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.880> also<00:01:06.030> tested<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
caffeinated coffee they also tested the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.649 
caffeinated coffee they also tested the
effects<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.470> decaf<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> caffeinated<00:01:08.909> tea<00:01:09.299> and

effects of decaf and caffeinated tea and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.270 
effects of decaf and caffeinated tea and
apparently<00:01:10.260> neither<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.680> those<00:01:10.770> effects<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
apparently neither of those effects the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
apparently neither of those effects the
risk<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.670> type<00:01:11.790> 2<00:01:11.850> diabetes<00:01:11.990> decaf<00:01:12.990> coffee

it's<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> joke<00:01:14.340> yeah<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.240> but

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it's just a joke yeah it really is but

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's just a joke yeah it really is but
tea<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.350> still<00:01:16.650> an<00:01:16.799> important<00:01:17.189> beverage<00:01:17.549> in

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tea is still an important beverage in

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.700 
tea is still an important beverage in
fact<00:01:18.150> new<00:01:18.450> evidence<00:01:18.810> suggests<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.229> green

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
fact new evidence suggests that green

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
fact new evidence suggests that green
tea<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.220> particular<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.390> some<00:01:21.600> positive

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
tea in particular can have some positive

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
tea in particular can have some positive
cognitive<00:01:22.799> effect<00:01:23.130> yeah<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.520> people<00:01:23.640> have

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
cognitive effect yeah so people have

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.039 
cognitive effect yeah so people have
been<00:01:23.850> talking<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> while<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:24.750> all

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
been talking for a while now about all

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.749 
been talking for a while now about all
the<00:01:25.170> benefits<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.740> green<00:01:26.009> tea<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.430> no<00:01:26.549> one's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the benefits of green tea but no one's

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
the benefits of green tea but no one's
actually<00:01:26.970> been<00:01:27.270> able<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> identify<00:01:27.780> the

neural mechanisms responsible for those

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870 
neural mechanisms responsible for those
benefits<00:01:30.780> until<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.799> team<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> Swiss

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.859 
a green tea extract which is pretty
sizable<00:01:40.710> yeah<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.250> guess<00:01:41.549> which<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.180> around<00:01:42.570> six

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
sizable yeah I guess which is around six

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
sizable yeah I guess which is around six
to<00:01:42.990> seven<00:01:43.259> cups<00:01:43.560> worth<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.490> eat

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to seven cups worth that's what we eat

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
to seven cups worth that's what we eat
and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.600> ask<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.380> perform<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.920> set<00:01:47.159> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and then ask them to perform a set of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.760 
and then ask them to perform a set of
working<00:01:47.610> memory<00:01:47.939> tasks<00:01:48.509> inside<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> an<00:01:49.140> fMRI

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
working memory tasks inside of an fMRI

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.160 
working memory tasks inside of an fMRI
machine<00:01:49.890> not<00:01:50.729> only<00:01:51.090> did<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> green<00:01:51.600> tea<00:01:51.840> help

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
machine not only did the green tea help

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.719 
machine not only did the green tea help
improve<00:01:52.560> their<00:01:52.680> performance<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> memory

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
improve their performance on the memory

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
improve their performance on the memory
tasks<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> MRI<00:01:54.990> results<00:01:55.229> showed

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
tasks but the MRI results showed

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.280 
tasks but the MRI results showed
increased<00:01:56.280> synaptic<00:01:57.149> connectivity<00:01:57.540> amongst

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
increased synaptic connectivity amongst

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.709 
increased synaptic connectivity amongst
different<00:01:58.560> areas<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> brain<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
different areas of the brain so all I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.410 
different areas of the brain so all I
have<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.680> improve<00:02:01.920> my<00:02:02.130> memory<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.759> drink

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
have to do to improve my memory is drink

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870 
have to do to improve my memory is drink
a<00:02:03.600> gallon<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.170> green<00:02:04.500> tea<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> day<00:02:05.040> yes<00:02:05.490> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a gallon of green tea a day yes that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.219 
a gallon of green tea a day yes that
seems<00:02:06.060> doable<00:02:06.329> right<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.930> mean<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.110> already

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
seems doable right I mean I already

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
seems doable right I mean I already
drink<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> gallon<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.860> wine<00:02:08.069> every<00:02:08.129> day<00:02:08.550> what's

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
drink a gallon of wine every day what's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
drink a gallon of wine every day what's
another<00:02:08.970> gallon<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.479> liquid<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.140> funny

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
another gallon of liquid and it's funny

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.230 
another gallon of liquid and it's funny
that<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.709> should<00:02:10.739> say<00:02:10.920> wine<00:02:11.489> actually

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
that you should say wine actually

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.820 
that you should say wine actually
because<00:02:12.450> another<00:02:12.870> article<00:02:13.290> published<00:02:13.710> this

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
wine a day it's actually just fine it's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.380 
wine a day it's actually just fine it's
not<00:02:19.080> bad<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.530> oh<00:02:19.620> really<00:02:19.820> yeah<00:02:20.820> really

drinking<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.370> actually<00:02:26.760> better<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.360> in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
drinking is actually better for you in

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.570 
drinking is actually better for you in
the<00:02:27.570> long<00:02:27.750> run<00:02:27.780> than<00:02:28.470> not<00:02:28.890> drinking<00:02:29.340> at<00:02:29.430> all

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the long run than not drinking at all

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.670 
the long run than not drinking at all
take<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.000> teetotal<00:02:30.630> ah<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.530> is

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
take that teetotal ah so this is

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.530 
take that teetotal ah so this is
interesting<00:02:31.950> because<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.730> current<00:02:33.120> CDC

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
interesting because the current CDC

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.810 
interesting because the current CDC
guidelines<00:02:33.810> say<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.710> women<00:02:35.400> should<00:02:35.730> not

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
guidelines say that women should not

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.870 
guidelines say that women should not
have<00:02:36.090> more<00:02:36.390> than<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.840> large<00:02:37.740> alcoholic<00:02:38.640> drink

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
have more than one large alcoholic drink

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.640 
have more than one large alcoholic drink
per<00:02:39.030> day<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.420> for<00:02:40.080> men<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.260> believe<00:02:40.530> that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
per day and for men I believe that

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.860 
per day and for men I believe that
number<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:40.980> two<00:02:41.220> which<00:02:41.640> seems<00:02:42.360> impossible<00:02:42.450> but

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
number is two which seems impossible but

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.240 
number is two which seems impossible but
that's<00:02:43.170> another<00:02:43.350> issue<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.070> here<00:02:44.220> comes

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that's another issue and then here comes

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.860 
that's another issue and then here comes
this<00:02:44.550> guy<00:02:44.670> who's<00:02:45.090> saying<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.390> drinking

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
this guy who's saying that drinking

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.360 
this guy who's saying that drinking
isn't<00:02:46.140> actually<00:02:46.590> harmful<00:02:46.890> unless<00:02:47.220> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
isn't actually harmful unless you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.180 
isn't actually harmful unless you
consume<00:02:47.700> more<00:02:47.730> than<00:02:48.000> 13<00:02:48.540> units<00:02:49.170> per<00:02:49.350> day<00:02:49.380> which

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
consume more than 13 units per day which

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490 
consume more than 13 units per day which
is<00:02:50.310> around<00:02:50.580> 5<00:02:50.850> glasses<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.450> wine<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.080> bottle

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
is around 5 glasses of wine so a bottle

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.320 
is around 5 glasses of wine so a bottle
of<00:02:52.560> wine<00:02:52.770> yeah<00:02:52.980> he's<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.340> lot<00:02:53.580> naturally

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
of wine yeah he's like a lot naturally

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.210 
of wine yeah he's like a lot naturally
people<00:02:54.570> are<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.110> know<00:02:55.140> pretty<00:02:55.410> skeptical

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
people are you know pretty skeptical

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.800 
people are you know pretty skeptical
yeah<00:02:56.400> about<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.000> for<00:02:57.210> one<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.630> wasn't

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
yeah about this for one it wasn't

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.030 
yeah about this for one it wasn't
published<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.500> scientific<00:02:58.650> journal

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
published in a scientific journal

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.980 
published in a scientific journal
secondly<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> guy<00:03:00.150> said<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.450> he<00:03:00.570> drew<00:03:00.870> this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
secondly the guy said that he drew this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.950 
secondly the guy said that he drew this
conclusion<00:03:01.380> based<00:03:01.710> on<00:03:01.920> decades<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:03.150> evidence

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
conclusion based on decades of evidence

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.590 
conclusion based on decades of evidence
which<00:03:04.650> he<00:03:05.070> didn't<00:03:05.400> actually<00:03:05.550> then<00:03:05.910> cite<00:03:06.300> any

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
which he didn't actually then cite any

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.510 
which he didn't actually then cite any
of<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.110> thirdly<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:08.070> he's<00:03:08.250> saying

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
of that and thirdly what he's saying

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.040 
of that and thirdly what he's saying
goes<00:03:08.730> against<00:03:09.090> pretty<00:03:09.330> much<00:03:09.630> every

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
goes against pretty much every

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.440 
goes against pretty much every
recommendation<00:03:10.320> out<00:03:11.160> there<00:03:11.610> yeah<00:03:11.940> I've<00:03:12.240> been

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
recommendation out there yeah I've been

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.510 
recommendation out there yeah I've been
seeing<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.720> lot<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.900> studies<00:03:13.440> recently<00:03:13.770> on<00:03:14.250> red

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
seeing a lot of studies recently on red

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.730 
seeing a lot of studies recently on red
wine<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:15.900> kind<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.170> mixed<00:03:16.530> some<00:03:16.650> of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
wine and it's all kind of mixed some of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.260 
wine and it's all kind of mixed some of
them<00:03:16.860> say<00:03:17.070> it's<00:03:17.100> good<00:03:17.610> for<00:03:17.820> your<00:03:17.910> heart
