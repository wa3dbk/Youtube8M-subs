00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.400
 It's okay, everyone here is the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.500
 max we're starting for you one more 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 video creation here our game contact 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.730
 good blender program first 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.220
 quality excuse is today is not 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.439
 with the quality so very very good 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 forgiveness there so but come what 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
 It matters and we can help. 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.170
 in this video we will be 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.630
 enabling the option to leave the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 fifa the best but now we have 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.859
 adding a logic command here 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.079
 which is forever when you press the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.180
 shift we also make a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.090
 movement of the cane but graphite I will leave 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 this movement in that camera 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.420
 constantly for 1 of interini 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 other items the scenario however at the moment 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.700
 we are seeing this option there beauty 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.250
 and even adding that will have to will not 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.809
 to have in the game, you know, it 's a 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.340
 also that this hand is not 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.280
 very good in the game's setting us 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.680
 is leaving the best with time then 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 keep following this, it is neither 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 everything we do now 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 really notice the reflexes of the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.840
 waters also reflected in the sun and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 leaving a very bad appearance the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.890
 game so at least I think right 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 So you think we 're not? 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.159
 Seeing this calmly, we see it. 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.689
 so be patient we're 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.049
 we will be solving until the end of 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.299
 creation of this game is only you also have 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.680
 Commented is what you're finding 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 in this personal video we are 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.439
 applying and a technique is indicated by the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.210
 Our friends, I'm not going to say the name. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.350
 God, why else am I going to finish? 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.659
 forgetting 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.799
 but finally our friends indicated there not 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.150
 it was just a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.920
 That's why I will not let you. 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.390
 indicate the name I may miss after 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.430
 to close a person right 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.110
 It was not just one person, it was another friend. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.200
 told us to apply this option 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.420
 here you already know this option but I decided 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.369
 apply in-game and now and apply more 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.890
 forward is that the choice of geometry 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.130
 that you choose the quantity and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.790
 Intensity of geometry this option 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.530
 leaves everything with is all with the type waves 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.770
 thus appearing floor of the scene 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.930
 It's really cool, really, you too. 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.030
 are you glad to see this option? 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.319
 applied because it leaves the game more real 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.520
 huh 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.530
 I guess so 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.120
 thereafter we are applying the rest of the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.070
 scenery this video even we go 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.350
 being after that solve a 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.130
 What is the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.260
 reflection here of these trees beauty then 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.520
 That's it folks without further ado 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.710
 a difficulty 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.450
 Vambora you can also apply this 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.070
 I already did not recommend it, I do not recommend it. 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.960
 I not highly recommend it because it was one 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.880
 little bad in the trees 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.090
 if you apply to the trees now if 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.840
 on the ground on the playing field on the nails there 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.750
 okay 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.800
 beauty has a call option 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.430
 intensity if I'm not wrong 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.070
 in that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.530
 that same option and hard option hardness 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.050
 to appear I think the colors of the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.030
 scenery these things is not your name I think 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.110
 That's right then I know you leave the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.230
 option to exit greater than or equal to 50 is 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.490
 number 51 the intensity is what 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.050
 really gives the brightness how can you 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.930
 realize the before 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.790
 is this is the reflection of the sun in the rear 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.550
 it is very well that it makes a reality that already 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.650
 to decrease the intensity leaves the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.270
 zero touch intensity 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.970
 No, do not say I'm doing it here. 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.550
 now extinct in the intensity that this 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.410
 option there from above the scene there called 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.820
 this name if you do not know how it is 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.170
 leaves your Portuguese problem and can 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.940
 watch the first video of this series 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.140
 I always show how to leave blender 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.540
 in Portuguese leave without the intensity not 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.090
 apply more reflex is this scenario only 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.220
 for you see and it's much nicer to 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.310
 people should not even like it, it's good 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.310
 neither suggestions beauty spoke and foie
