00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.420
 I welcome all fans of the network 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.070
 battles on communication tank slot and today I 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.050
 would like to talk to you about some 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.420
 news from the world of battlefield 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.369
 I also have a couple of keys giving 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.480
 access to the alpha version of the game called 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.519
 world 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.050
 but more on that at the end of the video a 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.789
 now back to the battlefield 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.949
 electronics art like any other 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.440
 the company has to report to 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.870
 their investors that they did on 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.390
 this week and during this report and not 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.430
 announced first hardline release date 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.440
 secondly, they called approximate dates 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.170
 exit star wars battlefront 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.150
 and in the third they said that playing from say 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.570
 so classic universe battlefield 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.600
 will be released no earlier than 2016 and they 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.290
 called her battlefield 5 not bad company 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.800
 3 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.290
 not battlefield 2142 namely battlefield 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.450
 5 and this is actually quite strange 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.489
 maybe electronics art just don't want 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.770
 tear off covers before time 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.380
 let's take everything first 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.370
 Hardline official and hopefully 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.850
 The final release date is March 17, 2015 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.430
 of the year 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.830
 as you probably know the release of this game 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.650
 as originally intended 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.110
 would take place but after trouble and which 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.030
 held in june month was taken 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.790
 the decision to postpone the release almost to 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.800
 half a year the official reason for the transfer as 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.780
 this is usually the case with developers 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.880
 was that they just needed 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.290
 more time to translate all ideas 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.630
 which they have 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.060
 as well as the implementation of all the ideas that 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.640
 they are not the players planted after the first troubles 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.650
 and that is pretty fair because 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.340
 The first version of hardline and which us 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.380
 have shown 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.020
 had so much in common with 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.960
 battlefield 4 no wonder many 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.299
 they said it was just reskin bf4 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.520
 or mod or gone and why should i 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.070
 pay full price for this game 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.470
 What to be and not enough for me personally, so it 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.540
 more destructibility we all know how 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.760
 it's cool when you blow a wall and 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.950
 at the same time you kill a couple of opponents who 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.380
 stood behind her and far from secret that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 the frostbyte engine is capable of that but all 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.160
 what seemed to us av 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.640
 mb you are a pair of trailers and itâ€™s difficult 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.900
 to tell 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.510
 has anything changed in terms of 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.690
 destructible or not most likely we 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.340
 this is only known during the second 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.770
 beta testing which will surely be but 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.660
 it is not known yet when most likely he 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.820
 will take about a month or so 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.720
 a half before release as it usually happens 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.130
 but deep down i'm calm for this game 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.080
 the beta version was pretty stable 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.110
 and personally i don't remember any 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.270
 serious technical problems sharing it 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.400
 death for the corners if and happened 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.800
 it is so rare that they did not throw at all 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.600
 eyes the most interesting thing is that beta 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.260
 Hardline and used the old version 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.660
 tikreyta bf4 that is, 10 gear kiss the whole 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.030
 time as bf4 had already moved on 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.670
 thirty hertz and you can of course with 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.490
 I will not agree but hardline with my 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.680
 ten hertz worked much better than in 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.140
 four who have already used thirty 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.030
 Hertz I do not know about you but I personally have 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.730
 bf4 quite often such 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.100
 feeling that I was thrown on the card with 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.200
 hands tied behind your back and the result 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.300
 shootout does not depend on me 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.310
 some completely random factors 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.270
 maybe i'm just embellishing 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.340
 memories 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.950
 but during the game in such hardline 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.080
 sensations did not arise and at least 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.720
 You should not worry about this aspect of the game 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.730
 but what will the rest look like ? 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.070
 we will see in a few months 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.690
 next in the list we have star wars 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.060
 battlefront which is engaged 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.550
 directly days approximate date 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.450
 release this so-called festive 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.340
 2015 season and it starts if i 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.380
 don't confuse anything since thanksgiving 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.450
 which is celebrated somewhere at the end 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.390
 November also promise sounded 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.610
 show directly the game that is 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.820
 finally gameplay videos somewhere 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.250
 in the spring of 2015 all that we were shown to 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.170
 This moment is a pair of video diaries 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.790
 developers where they go to places 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.130
 filming the original trilogy 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.260
 as well as a pair of ready 3d models from 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.040
 the future of the game and for the most part 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.230
 all account 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.540
 and it leaves a lot of space 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.669
 for thought that will represent 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.680
 star wars battlefront behind 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.020
 authored days they repeatedly 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.389
 stated that the battlefront would be like 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.430
 on any of the games of the battlefield series 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.560
 it seems to me to make a weapon and 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.990
 star wars are quite diverse 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.999
 it will be quite difficult after all for many 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.639
 one of the most interesting sides of the network 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:40.999
 shooter is to study the behavior of the weapon 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.949
 its return scatter and things like that and how 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:44.719
 it seems to me to make blasters and stellar 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.550
 wars are quite diverse and 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:49.550
 add them to the game in large quantities 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.460
 is not so easy unlikely blasters 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.050
 have any feedback unfortunately 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.819
 in reality they do not exist at 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.099
 least I do not know about them so 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.319
 it is impossible to compare but perhaps the battlefront 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.389
 capture its setting its 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.659
 the atmosphere of the original trilogy 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.139
 they are what came to light since 99 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.029
 of the year 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.189
 but here's what the battlefront has 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:12.620
 tremendous potential so it is in 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.360
 all kinds of air technology 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.090
 fighters are present in the universe 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.319
 star wars in huge amounts 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.449
 just imagine how it would be 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.479
 cool to experience in virtual reality 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.159
 the very scene of Sith revenge where the heap 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.289
 fighters fighting in orbit 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.300
 Coruscant and this is the way almost 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.960
 the only decent scene is new 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.210
 trilogy 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.610
 I'm probably talking like the last 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.860
 zadrot many years star wars is mine 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.750
 beloved universe since childhood and 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.899
 I have the greatest hope of the battlefront 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.000
 but what about you, what exactly are you 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:46.460
 wait on this game and whether you wait for it 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.770
 in general, as always, give your opinion 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.300
 in the comments to this video and 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.479
 finally as mentioned at the beginning 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.819
 video game battlefield 5 at least 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.969
 so now they want to release it 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:01.279
 somewhere in 2016 and if 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.560
 really will be battlefield 5 then 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.069
 most likely it will be modern again 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.990
 setting 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.169
 that is, the same thing only in the new 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.210
 packaging even the technique is also a weapon only 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.430
 in even more numbers as always and 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.680
 here I want to ask you not 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.080
 are you tired of such a setting do not want 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.939
 Do you see the same in the bad company 3 or 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.639
 battlefield 2142 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.589
 up between the battlefield 4 and the intended 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.899
 battlefield 5 will take at least three 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:28.969
 years but still changing the setting would be 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:30.740
 not bad as it seems to me modern 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.520
 the situation is already pretty much for many people 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.439
 tired of 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.930
 but at this stage it is only 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:38.750
 guesses and we are left with you only 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.800
 wait and before you leave like 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.930
 spoke at the beginning 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.190
 video i have four keys from 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.500
 alpha version of the game 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.720
 vals so if she has you even a little 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.060
 interests then take away one of 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.889
 keys if you have time and hurry 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.710
 try the game until November 2 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.900
 Well, on this I have everything if you are today 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.360
 did you learn something new or 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.370
 just had a good time don't forget 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.319
 rate the video and donâ€™t forget 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.539
 come back on monday because you 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:08.030
 waiting for the video mentioned today 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:10.970
 the game and the wolf as always great to you 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:14.560
 thanks for watching with you there was a dancing lot 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.560
 see you in the next video
