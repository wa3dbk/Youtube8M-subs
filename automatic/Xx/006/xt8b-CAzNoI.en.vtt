00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.120
 now good everyone I'm sp 26 and 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.559
 welcome to this new tutorial in the 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.210
 I want to show you how to release 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.920
 space of your hard drive without the 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.230
 use of any software 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.760
 this tutorial the truth that complements 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.680
 to other tutorials that I've already taken 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.270
 previously on my channel and I think that 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.980
 if you are interested in this tutorial or if 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.960
 will interest the previous tutorials 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.699
 so in the description of the video leaves 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.250
 of the links of other videos that I've 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.410
 uploaded voucher related to this issue of 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.670
 free hard drive space if not 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.980
 has an infection of any kind 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.109
 programs is worth saying this we are going to 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.760
 proceed with what is the tutorial and 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.620
 nothing we are going to it the first thing we're going to 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.219
 to do is to go here to start agreement 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.229
 and we 're going to go here to egypt is worth it 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.449
 what we are going to do is free up space 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.879
 hard drive where the system is located 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.540
 operative that we can recognize by 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.120
 the windows logo 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.170
 once located what is the limbo 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.760
 hard where the system is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.960
 operative what we are going to do is give 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.480
 properties right button is worth once 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.750
 here what we are going to do is place this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400
 a little ticket so you can see it better 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.550
 I want to comment one little thing before 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.620
 nothing and that is that when we see this 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.540
 little person to compress this unit to 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.490
 Save space on the hard drive 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.560
 many people the truth that the brand and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.870
 compress what is the hard disk that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.850
 The only thing it does is compress all 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.040
 data and good makes them go slower 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.500
 what is the operating system so 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.290
 I do not recommend it to us what we are going to 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.390
 to do is obviously free up space and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.280
 today we are going to click here on liberals 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.280
 as you see quite simple 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.350
 let's wait a few moments until 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.790
 finalize and good here as you can be 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.110
 seeing 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.360
 obviously it puts me 6 mb before I've 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 done before I made this procedure 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.240
 and has deleted 2 gb easy voucher needed 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.090
 that I was occupying with then with 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.390
 files that were totally temporary 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.479
 in thumbnails files of web pages 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.970
 offline connection trash files 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.540
 recycling have been elected branches that already 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.060
 had eliminated and well then we have 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.850
 removed two gigs so really if 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.650
 you do not do this in a way 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.800
 frequent then surely you have 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.840
 a lot of space I have occupied by files or 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.420
 totally unnecessary data not 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.190
 However I would like to tell you that if 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.740
 you are here in cleaning files 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.870
 of the system 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.120
 and now you give him the release 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.730
 space or you're going to do a little check-up 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.890
 deeper I was going to be calculating 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.130
 what is then all those data that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.290
 we can remove from the hard drive 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.170
 Well, it's going to deal with a lot more than 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.030
 first time we have done it then 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.920
 I heard that a little deeper and like 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.220
 You see, I'm seeing it 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.980
 as your own eyes as you can see it takes 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.800
 much more in calculating what are the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.410
 data that we can free you this this 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.370
 hard disk in this case of system 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.890
 operative in which events are centered 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.310
 well here as you can see it has already gone up more 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.920
 It's worth 8 megabytes with 15 before they were 6 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.830
 before I deleted two tours as I have 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.300
 commented and well then simply what 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.010
 what we have to do obviously is 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.740
 Mark the popcorn you know 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.210
 marked for example report files 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.270
 of windows error because that 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.850
 obviously not worth anything and 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.740
 temporary files to fight the 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.270
 cycle that all this is not worth 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.330
 absolutely for nothing and as I said 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.380
 before that deletion 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.620
 and I think there are people who do not do this 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.880
 often you probably have your 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.670
 many landlines totally occupied with 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.380
 unnecessary adhesives at once 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.720
 marked all the popcorn what 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.700
 we have to do is give in accept 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.100
 we give you in finish file as you see 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.720
 has not skipped this little window then what 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.060
 what we have to do normally is the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.620
 black the boys 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.600
 automatically, we need the bar 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.090
 of progress where afterwards it shows us 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.130
 how is it eliminating what they are in the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.870
 unnecessary files 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.200
 we wait a few moments and we have it 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.690
 in agreement we give in accepting and already what 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.670
 we would have anything goes with this we have 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.440
 finished this little tutorial but 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.450
 I want to say that this tutorial 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.460
 complements other tutorials as I have 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.350
 commented at the beginning of the video so 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.060
 I will leave in the description of the video what 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.370
 which are the tutorials that complement 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.830
 to this who sincerely believe that 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.510
 they will be very useful if you want 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.670
 free space the hard drive what 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.600
 I will teach there in those tutorials 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:47.100
 delete temporary junk files etc 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.350
 it was the people I hope this little 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.510
 tutorial has served you above all and 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.630
 with this he has asked me to greet everyone 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.630
 and see you in the next goodbye chau
