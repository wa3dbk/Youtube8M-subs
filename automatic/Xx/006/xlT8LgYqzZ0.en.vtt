00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
like this if I can still play it it's a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.110 
like this if I can still play it it's a
little<00:02:33.380> up-tempo<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.980> I've<00:02:34.489> lost<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.880> lot<00:02:35.000> of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
little up-tempo and I've lost a lot of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.790 
little up-tempo and I've lost a lot of
technique<00:02:35.480> over<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.840> years<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.440> I'm<00:02:36.590> not

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
technique over the years because I'm not

00:02:36.800 --> 00:03:12.250 
technique over the years because I'm not
as<00:02:37.040> young<00:02:37.069> as<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.489> used<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.760> be<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.090> here<00:02:38.300> we<00:02:38.360> go

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.200 

why<00:03:13.260> was<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:13.740> right<00:03:13.980> I've<00:03:14.220> lost<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.850> ton<00:03:15.180> of

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
why was your right I've lost a ton of

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.320 
why was your right I've lost a ton of
technique<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.310> was<00:03:17.460> really<00:03:17.700> sloppy<00:03:17.970> but

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
technique and that was really sloppy but

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330 
technique and that was really sloppy but
again<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> part<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.320> point<00:03:19.590> I'm<00:03:19.830> making<00:03:20.010> is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
again the part the point I'm making is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:37.450 
again the part the point I'm making is
notice<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.390> end<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:32.000> here's<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.240> Jesus
