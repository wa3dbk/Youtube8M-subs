UM like the nib listings are just so
expensive<00:03:45.519> that's<00:03:46.180> why<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.450> hadn't<00:03:47.230> gotten<00:03:47.410> her

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
because I'm slowly working on getting in

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.080 
because I'm slowly working on getting in
the<00:03:51.130> past<00:03:51.400> for<00:03:51.940> all<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.209> years<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:53.440> there's

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the past for all the years but there's

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.960 
the past for all the years but there's
she's<00:03:55.090> not<00:03:55.329> totally<00:03:55.630> floppy<00:03:59.820> she<00:04:00.820> could

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
she's not totally floppy she could

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.509
