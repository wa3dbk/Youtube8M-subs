00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
striker from Atlanta in Syria he looks

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
striker from Atlanta in Syria he looks
like<00:00:32.550> an<00:00:32.730> absolute<00:00:33.120> beast<00:00:33.300> look<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.840> issuing

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
like an absolute beast look at issuing

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.380 
like an absolute beast look at issuing
89<00:00:34.800> he<00:00:35.070> has<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.579> good<00:00:35.700> dribbling<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.210> pace

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250 
so and his heading is awesome i'm
thinking<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.910> i<00:00:39.059> might<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> go

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
thinking that i might have to have a go

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
thinking that i might have to have a go
with<00:00:40.290> him<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.829> team<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.280> he<00:00:41.550> looks

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
with him in my team because he looks

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
with him in my team because he looks
like<00:00:41.969> an<00:00:42.210> absolute<00:00:42.540> beast<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.050> no<00:00:43.230> doubt<00:00:43.469> no

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
like an absolute beast but no doubt no

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.130 
like an absolute beast but no doubt no
one<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.610> rate<00:00:45.329> him<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.750> probably

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
one will really rate him and probably

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
one will really rate him and probably
won't<00:00:46.289> even<00:00:46.500> buy<00:00:46.770> him<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.160> i<00:00:47.190> can't<00:00:47.520> imagine

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
won't even buy him so i can't imagine

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
won't even buy him so i can't imagine
him<00:00:47.910> being<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.260> money<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
him being going for that much money to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
him being going for that much money to
be<00:00:49.680> honest<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.100> pretty<00:00:50.280> good<00:00:50.539> at<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
be honest so that's pretty good at the

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
of low rate goals and maybe a bronze i'm

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.420 
of low rate goals and maybe a bronze i'm
not<00:05:38.570> really<00:05:38.780> sure<00:05:38.900> but<00:05:39.380> I'd<00:05:39.919> have<00:05:40.070> to<00:05:40.130> go<00:05:40.340> and

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
not really sure but I'd have to go and

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.740 
not really sure but I'd have to go and
database<00:05:40.909> it<00:05:41.150> before<00:05:41.389> I<00:05:41.419> could<00:05:41.630> say<00:05:41.720> anything
