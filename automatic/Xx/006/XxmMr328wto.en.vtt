00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.230
 colossal yes but it is also a work of 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.480
 huge turn until colossal means 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.550
 huge and the word circus comes from 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.990
 circles joanillo is not a circle like 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.880
 the one on this great track 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.040
 many of the first circuses were 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.030
 carried out in a colossal circular 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:04.650
 and cylindrical structure called crossing 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.340
 holder turns me over in the head and that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.469
 short circuit 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.049
 I'd better sit and rest a 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.719

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.679
 first acts of circus yes I would like 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:24.039

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.649
 well just imagine that that boot is italy 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.689
 Italy is in a drop or not 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.390
 italy has the shape of a boot to 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.149
 Sicily souvenir and from the center of the boot 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.250
 it is rome and in the center of rome is the 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.500
 stone structure called the coliseum 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.560
 the circus function was performed in a 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.179
 Large platform in the center of the arena 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.939
 well, you are in very bad condition 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.979
 what happened or giant lines not to 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.530
 my dear cantinflas and the coliseum has 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.189
 1900 years has been looted during 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.349
 centuries by armies of conquerors 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.259
 we fail to the year 79 of our era when 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.170
 It was inaugurated by the Emperor Titus 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.480
 join the crowd and swim 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.070
 How many people can make one 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.380
 good circus function small high 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.190
 strange way of dressing etc 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.770
 it seems to us a citizen of Rome and I am not 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.900
 I am cantinflas citizen of mexico 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.570
 still loves to talk about this place that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 are you doing here I came to see the turn 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.680
 in the coliseum today they tell me that it is 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.500
 very good that you know circus 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.570
 I'm not going to know if I work 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.770
 in a circus he brought water in the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.160
 animals to a slave well put on 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.440
 work buddy the animals wait 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.600
 [Music] 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.150
 this circus collision has many 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.100
 elephants of peppers and also many 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.770
 lions of winds 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.050
 these millions do not look very tame 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.260
 let 's say is that they will fight against 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.990
 Elephants, that's very bad, they should not 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.860
 of fighting in this era is considered a 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.010
 great sport 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.360
 I think I came up with an idea 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.870
 [Music] 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.730
 the function 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.739
 resolutions and the elephants 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.440
 a great caesar the lions and elephants 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.540
 They are too darned to fight in the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.690
 new nail gave them too much food and 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.370
 water the lions are purring 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.980
 slave regiment of me 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.830
 although you are the slave who ruined the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.780
 function but Mr. don Cesar that is 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.480
 the kind of function that should be in 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.459
 this great coliseum the drone of use is not 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.590
 so this coliseum made of marble 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.250
 travertine and stone was built by 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.819
 slaves who worked 12 years in the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.860
 It measures 188 meters long by 155 meters 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.500
 width has room for 100,000 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.040
 spectators and is the center of entertainment 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.960
 of the citizens of Rome 6 based 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.570
 between gladiators and they are deaths 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.390
 but someone could get hurt there 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.030
 wild land fighting had up 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.070
 that you arrive even we have battles 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.630
 fictional navies with crews of 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.660
 slaves and criminals 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.360
 today from and as well then in arme 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.590
 Coliseum with water we use our large 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:22.110
 aqueducts and many slaves hear you are 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.110
 a water hauler experiment 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.100
 you know I just remembered my doctor 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.170
 ordered to get away from sea ​​battles 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.170
 Allergies are not good for you 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.210
 [Applause] 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:42.689
 Relief aid is Mr. Caesar me 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.929
 he wants to kill and his body 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:49.050
 but milito returns to the present time 

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:52.370
 or more cruel combats 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.639
 if I feel much safer here 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:59.699
 initial sir, it's good that there's no longer 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.580
 cruel functions in the coliseum but it's 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.620
 a pity that it is collapsing itself 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.479
 but currently they have restricted the 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.639
 traffic have already placed rods 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.330
 steel in its walls and columns so that 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.789
 will resist for many more years 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.479
 has this boot of italy is very 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:20.240
 interesting because it is crowned in half 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.150
 of the boot of the coliseum in the middle of 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.780
 roma whose youngster are you doing 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.319
 for europe and this one is in the boot of 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.930
 italy and the coliseum is in the boot and 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.110
 you will be sea battles at the resort 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.720
 cantinflas battles I think you've been 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.190
 dreaming 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.839
 but that gives me a great idea 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.839
 [Music] 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.780
 I've loved my friend, it seems you have 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.210
 another colossal job yes sir but as 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.000
 I told Mr. Don cease the battles 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.260
 marinas are bad for me my allergy if 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.910
 you want wise hay fever 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.900
 [Music] 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.370
 and in the reason 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.550
