00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.139
 but no 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.919
 or the by soneros and balconeras I'm josema 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.859
 source 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.020
 and this is market day in the market 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.829
 Today we have a tire 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.509
 and specifically the Swiss brand Oz that 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:34.879
 distributes in Spain by broadcast brands 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:38.089
 mythical as with commensal or bmc the 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.839
 ride on their series bicycles and that 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.579
 it's prestige for this great brand that does not 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.899
 He has been here on the peninsula for a long time 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.850
 and certainly will wonder we 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.070
 to see a little bit the characteristics that 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.010
 have they have reached that wording 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.469
 three models let's see the three and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.160
 some of them both in 26 inches 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.890
 like in 29 inches we're going to start with 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.979
 the model links the models links 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.250
 consist of three models the links the ins 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.740
 live and the new 29-inch links that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.520
 we have the links here in the newsroom 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.890
 both 26 as 29 inch no 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 They share the same attack ado 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.520
 we see here a little bit more together he's 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.520
 created from the 26 inches 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.159
 and a little bit more separated between the 29 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.289
 inches he is created from this model 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.390
 completely different from that of the 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.909
 26 inch version tacos 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.000
 transversally they ensure a good 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.270
 acceleration and also good retention 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.490
 when braking since in ounces 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.560
 estimate that the characteristics of a 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.039
 29- inch wheel is completely 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.259
 different to the moon of 26 you need a 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.869
 good traction and especially great 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.289
 braking retention by the inertia that 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.110
 they take the big wheels the lynch is a 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.959
 tire focused on x country and 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.890
 Marathon we have it in the version 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.530
 tunnels 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.130
 and also in I had the ready to be able 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.530
 place both with the liquid 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.400
 26 inches like the 29 inches are 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.650
 of 60 pp and what gives us an idea of the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.220
 great flexibility that these have 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.380
 tires the links of both 26 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.100
 inches as of 29 inches have 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:37.370
 different measures in 26 from 195 up 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.920
 2.1 and up to 2.25 the 29-inch 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.070
 They use different rubber compounds 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.870
 soft and rubber something harder as the most 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.150
 It lasts usually in the tread 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:54.510
 central that comes to be 65 to 55 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.060
 a on the outside to give us a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.440
 idea of here claw perfectly in the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.570
 curves 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.970
 they have also another compound even more 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:09.870
 soft that goes in the middle 65 in 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.450
 the outside 45 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.940
 While it is spent much faster to 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.640
 time to grab it obviously is 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.709
 much greater within the high range 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.290
 if there is a polyvalent cover and that 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.810
 wheel like a charm that is the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.299
 model canis we will also be able to choose 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.950
 in which is your vÃ©lez I got the network and 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.379
 those who want a more weight 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.040
 content then the network tube and it's going to be 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.780
 our first option is created 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.900
 reveals that it is eminently rolling 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.620
 especially in the central yurt band that 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.900
 has given more spacing in the part of the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.269
 side that will give us an idea of 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.359
 that also when supporting in curve we will 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:57.030
 pull perfectly we will be able to 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:04:01.890
 also choose between 60 atp and 120 pp as 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:05.709
 rigid or in this case folding hoop 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.730
 obviously rolling in the version of 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.430
 29 inches 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.470
 he is that ado is even greater above all 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.270
 because the section of the tire arrives 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.270
 up to 225 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.940
 and as you are seeing ounce has some 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.580
 the models with the outer flank in 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.490
 beige what they call sky 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.290
 world this is a replica of the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.200
 tires that we saw in our 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:36.250
 mountain bike in the 90s the 26 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.500
 inches has two measures 2.0 and 225 the 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.850
 29-inch version is only 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.010
 available in the measure of 225 hardness 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.440
 of the compound exactly the same as 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.350
 that we have said of his sister the link os 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.020
 we assure that embarÃ³ surprised very 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.750
 remarkably, it seems incredible that with this 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.940
 already created traction in also in everything 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.330
 type of land is the cover 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.890
 polyvalent of ounces par excellence and the 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.980
 third model that has come today to the 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.990
 redaction is the ibex model prepared 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.070
 to face the most 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.000
 complicated 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.400
 rock roots moist terrain in order to 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.770
 the radicals of the mountain bike those 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.480
 hardened and fibroids are of 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.500
 congratulations because we have a tire 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.750
 with a compound really 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.030
 that grabs in all kinds of situations and 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.300
 of ground and with a weight really 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.420
 Content is available in 26 inches 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.760
 and shortly will be also in 27 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.550
 inches and a half despite having a 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.090
 aggressive keyboard the kevlar version of 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.510
 120 feet for x country weighs less than 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.640
 500 grams for the dark reign of 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.740
 mountain bike for our free riders 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.580
 You will also have it available in 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.310
 measure 2.4 we have seen here or the 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.500
 reaction three models of the brand of 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.200
 ounce tires that distributes bike 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.470
 dissemination but they also have models of 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.050
 tires for urban bicycles 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.060
 shooting bicycles in short span everything 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.669
 the range that the spectrum can have 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.470
 of good cycling you are onerous 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.650
 treacherous we have already seen here the 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.720
 mark ounce a few tires really 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.330
 polyvalent so you have in mind 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.660
 and monteys in show mountain bikes 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.500
 josema source and see you in a next
