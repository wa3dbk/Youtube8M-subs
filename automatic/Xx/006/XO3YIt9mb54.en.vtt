00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
okay so as you can see in the pictures

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.830 
okay so as you can see in the pictures
and<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.980> top<00:02:29.280> layer<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.670> my<00:02:29.790> hair<00:02:29.879> my<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> had<00:02:30.510> my

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and the top layer of my hair my I had my

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.050 
and the top layer of my hair my I had my
hair<00:02:31.080> was<00:02:31.230> wet<00:02:31.409> and<00:02:31.470> was<00:02:31.709> picture<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.909> looks

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
hair was wet and was picture so it looks

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.449 
hair was wet and was picture so it looks
kind<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.330> weird<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.830> top<00:02:35.040> layer<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.370> my

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
kind of weird but the top layer of my

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.100 
kind of weird but the top layer of my
hair<00:02:35.549> was<00:02:35.940> pretty<00:02:36.180> light<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:36.959> my

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
hair was pretty light just because my

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.720 
hair was pretty light just because my
hair<00:02:37.290> doesn't<00:02:37.440> really<00:02:37.650> take<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.250> color<00:02:38.519> on

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
hair doesn't really take the color on

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.589 
hair doesn't really take the color on
the<00:02:38.849> top<00:02:38.879> layer<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.510> really

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
the top layer because it's really

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.600 
the top layer because it's really
damaged<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.290> then<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.069> can<00:02:41.280> see<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.519> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
damaged and then you can see in the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.300 
damaged and then you can see in the
bottom<00:02:41.700> layer<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.390> still<00:02:43.019> red<00:02:43.409> but<00:02:43.769> it's

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
bottom layer it's still red but it's

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.960 
bottom layer it's still red but it's
just<00:02:44.700> lighter<00:02:45.390> um<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.829> what<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> did<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.430> did<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
just lighter um so what I did I did that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.759 
just lighter um so what I did I did that
and<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.659> I<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.900> let<00:02:49.019> my<00:02:49.140> hair<00:02:49.349> kind<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.590> air

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
and then I just let my hair kind of air

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.559 
and then I just let my hair kind of air
dry<00:02:50.010> i<00:02:50.040> didn't<00:02:50.370> even<00:02:50.430> let<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.760> fully<00:02:50.909> dry<00:02:51.299> and

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569

then<00:02:52.049> i<00:02:52.230> put<00:02:52.620> another<00:02:52.950> color<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.400> top<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.760> it

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849
