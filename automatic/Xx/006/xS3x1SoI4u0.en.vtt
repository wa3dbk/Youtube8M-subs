to<00:00:18.570> see<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.779> from<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.110> front<00:00:19.380> from<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.039> back

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
to see it from the front from the back

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.609 
to see it from the front from the back
and<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:21.029> both<00:00:21.180> sides<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.690> possible<00:00:22.380> she<00:00:22.529> only

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
arms notice how her arms are crossing

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.579 
arms notice how her arms are crossing
over<00:00:37.860> her<00:00:38.159> midline<00:00:38.729> there<00:00:39.659> also<00:00:39.870> she's

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
over her midline there also she's

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.130 
over her midline there also she's
holding<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.370> high<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.299> she's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
holding them really high so she's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
holding them really high so she's

shifting her shoulders from side to side

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.960 
shifting her shoulders from side to side
rather<00:00:45.780> than<00:00:45.960> pumping<00:00:46.440> her<00:00:46.830> arms<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.820> we'd

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
rather than pumping her arms what we'd

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.960 
rather than pumping her arms what we'd
like<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.299> see<00:00:48.479> Megan<00:00:48.839> do<00:00:49.019> is<00:00:49.350> drop<00:00:49.920> her<00:00:50.250> hands<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
little bit lower so that her thumbs

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.020 
little bit lower so that her thumbs
almost<00:00:54.510> touch<00:00:54.809> her<00:00:55.350> hip<00:00:55.920> bones<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.519> they<00:00:56.790> come

across by the hips all right this next
angle<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.630> we're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
angle that we're going to look at is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
angle that we're going to look at is
from<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> side<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.969> we're<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.240> see

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
from the side what we're going to see

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.499 
from the side what we're going to see
here<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.140> how<00:01:25.500> upright<00:01:25.920> megan<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.609> running<00:01:27.000> we

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
here is how upright megan is running we

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.789 
here is how upright megan is running we
need<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.899> a<00:01:27.929> little<00:01:28.079> bit<00:01:28.320> more<00:01:28.500> forward

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
need to get a little bit more forward

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
need to get a little bit more forward
lean<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.310> there<00:01:29.460> where<00:01:29.670> gravity<00:01:29.969> is<00:01:30.270> just

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
lean in there where gravity is just

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.469 
lean in there where gravity is just
pulling<00:01:30.869> megan<00:01:31.499> along<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:33.030> soon<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.359> she

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
pulling megan along so as soon as she

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.419 
pulling megan along so as soon as she
drops<00:01:33.659> her<00:01:33.929> hands<00:01:34.499> a<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.829> bit<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.189> that's

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
drops her hands a little bit more that's

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.609 
drops her hands a little bit more that's
also<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:35.969> to<00:01:36.030> help<00:01:36.359> enable<00:01:36.780> her<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
also going to help enable her to just

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.609 
also going to help enable her to just
fall<00:01:37.890> into<00:01:38.189> her<00:01:38.490> stride<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.229> really<00:01:40.229> has<00:01:40.409> some

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
fall into her stride and really has some

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.149 
fall into her stride and really has some
nice<00:01:40.829> forward<00:01:41.399> lean<00:01:42.679> so<00:01:43.679> now<00:01:43.859> we're<00:01:44.070> gonna

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
nice forward lean so now we're gonna

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.209 
nice forward lean so now we're gonna
look<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:45.060> kind<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.840> body<00:01:46.560> position<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
look at kind of the body position and

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.800 
look at kind of the body position and
the<00:01:47.310> stiffness<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.909> megan<00:01:48.329> she<00:01:48.509> looks<00:01:48.719> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the stiffness of megan she looks a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.149 
the stiffness of megan she looks a
little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.140> locked<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.649> where<00:01:49.859> her<00:01:49.979> body

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
