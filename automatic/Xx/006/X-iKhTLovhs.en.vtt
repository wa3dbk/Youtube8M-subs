00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
progression from the other recordings

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.170 
progression from the other recordings
some<00:00:26.009> of<00:00:26.099> that's<00:00:26.189> because<00:00:26.520> David's<00:00:26.849> done<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
some of that's because David's done so

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
because we found a perfect marriage of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.430 
because we found a perfect marriage of
David's<00:00:38.910> music<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.420> Jimi<00:00:39.780> Hendrix's<00:00:40.110> music

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
and how well those seem to complement

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:58.429 
and how well those seem to complement
each<00:00:42.480> other<00:00:56.150> early<00:00:57.150> on<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.869> I<00:00:57.900> was<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.409> a
