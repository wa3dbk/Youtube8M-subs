00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.950
 camera and I'll go explaining from there 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.670
 because it is not to stay focused 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.670
 we'll see 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.229

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.110
 I have not changed it 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.980
 well the roma is called for no and is not 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.230
 the beta still thing 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.080
 I have it but I quite updated 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.110
 I want to teach it 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.060
 because it's pretty cool now I'll teach 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.349
 his things look how the truth 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.349
 the little symbol grabbing 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.370
 well as you can see, it takes us to load the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.159
 pin hehehe 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.430
 is the notification sound and here 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.420
 all my things as you see the first thing 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.760
 you will say there is 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.260
 and the notification bar is where it is 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.530
 where is it 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.940
 Well, here is a bar that 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.700
 we can also hide look 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.660
 We expands and takes off the bar here 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.590
 but of course we are not going to do 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.010
 notifications and then I'll put it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.330
 cool notifications and adjustments as this 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.459
 is what I love to increase and 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.590
 decrease the brightness from here I do not 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.239
 like a touch to click on wifi to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.849
 I can activate it 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.770
 but good is another subject as you see is a 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.130
 tablet interface 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.060
 yes, no 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.060
 settings 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.329
 ta ta ta ta ta system information 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.550
 I feel 4.11 serve 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.900
 mola 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.900
 with its good 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.190
 as you go using this search the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.480
 balances will go out more cards 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.459
 what more things 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.010
 has an application that is called 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.980
 partner and android setting that with the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.080
 Applications 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.750
 you can choose the ones of pace and those of pace 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.629
 they are as very simplified as more 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.120
 big smaller you see the application 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.310
 as the resolution more or less looks by 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.540
 example on youtube we will choose the ones from 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.849
 Pepe and I have it in two in three of 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.900
 eight and you can choose the mode if you have it 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.120
 clear between tablet or normal phone 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.700
 We can give prior before I have 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.590
 makes superuser permission clear 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.199
 before we are given to live to see 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.989
 how we have left and it takes to load good 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.380
 yes the youtube explanations all the 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.650
 channels here 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.200
 good as it looks normal to give back already 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.100
 I say now I want in tablet day 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.960
 previous 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.070
 a little but there are already tablets 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.960
 well you already knew how to do with all 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.690
 applications is to say for example because 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.250
 with the whatsapp you can download the ones from page 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.630
 so that it looks to see more content 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.240
 know the smallest text and the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.700
 smaller application but see more and the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.450
 truth is that it is a pretty thing to me 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.210
 I like it a lot 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.700
 then mono backups is not one has very 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.630
 touched you can choose between hybrid 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.970
 normal to need it normal font and this is 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.830
 a tablet that is like this bar but 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.300
 from above is a very rare thing and 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.440
 tablet in small that is how I have it 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.620
 me or maybe big for the blind no no 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.080
 It's a joke but thing for people who do not 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.080
 he likes to have it so small good and that 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.260
 basically what about the widgets also 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.870
 we live it is good as you see it 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.090
 is moving yes it is good that if you want 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.000
 see a presentation of jermaine 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.800
 there you have it and basically those are 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.949
 the most aspects 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.159
 so to speak of the rom or I hope 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:41.610
 that you liked and little by little go 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:46.800

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.830
 fused there to how cool driving 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.630
