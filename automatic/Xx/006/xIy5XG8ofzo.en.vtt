00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
see if it still works probably got a

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.640 
see if it still works probably got a
fifty-dollar<00:04:42.940> then<00:04:43.330> that's<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.290> other<00:04:44.380> bit

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
fifty-dollar then that's the other bit

the auto shop and just buy a new battery
I<00:04:50.760> figure<00:04:51.760> maybe<00:04:52.390> it<00:04:52.840> happened<00:04:52.990> because<00:04:53.520> if

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
I figure maybe it happened because if

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.010 
I figure maybe it happened because if
I'd<00:04:54.730> come<00:04:54.910> here<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.210> trying<00:04:55.390> to<00:04:55.510> charge<00:04:55.780> it

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
I'd come here and trying to charge it

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.960 
I'd come here and trying to charge it
maybe<00:04:56.230> was<00:04:56.440> going<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.620> start<00:04:56.890> a<00:04:56.950> fire<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.550> this

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
maybe was going to start a fire and this

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.790 
maybe was going to start a fire and this
is<00:04:58.090> just<00:04:58.270> God's<00:04:59.110> Way<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.350> saying<00:04:59.440> you<00:04:59.710> know

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
is just God's Way of saying you know

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.100 
is just God's Way of saying you know
what<00:04:59.980> probably<00:05:00.640> not<00:05:00.700> a<00:05:00.760> good<00:05:00.880> idea<00:05:00.970> we'll<00:05:01.870> all

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
what probably not a good idea we'll all

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.530 
what probably not a good idea we'll all
stop<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.410> from<00:05:02.500> doing<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.540> probably

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
stop you from doing that I probably

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.500 
stop you from doing that I probably
would<00:05:04.720> have<00:05:04.780> rather<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:05.230> different<00:05:05.530> message

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
would have rather a different message
