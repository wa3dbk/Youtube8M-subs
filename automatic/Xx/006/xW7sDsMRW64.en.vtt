hey what's going on everybody this is
dom<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:06.060> today<00:00:06.299> i<00:00:06.330> want<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.600> do<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> performance

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
dom and today i want to do a performance

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.400 
dom and today i want to do a performance
comparison<00:00:08.250> between<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.700> nexus<00:00:09.330> 7<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
comparison between the nexus 7 and the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.160 
comparison between the nexus 7 and the
ipad<00:00:10.800> mini<00:00:11.099> now<00:00:11.580> obviously<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
ipad mini now obviously this is going to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.950 
ipad mini now obviously this is going to
be<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> bit<00:00:13.769> unfair<00:00:14.309> seeing<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.360> nexus<00:00:15.690> 7

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
be a bit unfair seeing as the nexus 7

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.750 
be a bit unfair seeing as the nexus 7
was<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.379> released<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.980> Apple<00:00:17.580> hasn't

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
was just released and Apple hasn't

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.700 
was just released and Apple hasn't
updated<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.390> ipad<00:00:18.690> mini<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:19.140> almost<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.680> year

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
updated the ipad mini in almost a year

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400 
updated the ipad mini in almost a year
but<00:00:20.369> these<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.760> both<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.210> current<00:00:21.689> miniature

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
but these are both the current miniature

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.009 
but these are both the current miniature
tablets<00:00:22.920> from<00:00:23.160> google<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.910> apple<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.990> i

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
tablets from google and apple so i

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.589 
tablets from google and apple so i
wanted<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> give<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:26.010> unbiased

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
wanted to give them an unbiased

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.480 
wanted to give them an unbiased
performance<00:00:27.599> comparison<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.769> maybe<00:00:29.279> this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
performance comparison and maybe this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
performance comparison and maybe this
will<00:00:29.730> help<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.269> make<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.810> mind<00:00:31.050> if

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
will help you make up your mind if

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870 
will help you make up your mind if
you're<00:00:31.590> looking<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> purchase<00:00:32.160> either<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you're looking to purchase either one of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.090 
you're looking to purchase either one of
these<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.690> obviously<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.350> test<00:00:34.649> isn't

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
these now obviously this test isn't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.190 
these now obviously this test isn't
going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.730> super<00:00:36.030> scientific<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.170> i

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
going to be super scientific but i

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
going to be super scientific but i
believe<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.770> tests<00:00:38.219> will<00:00:38.250> give<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> good

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
believe these tests will give you a good

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.389 
believe these tests will give you a good
idea<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.050> performance<00:00:40.530> between<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
idea on the performance between the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.150 
idea on the performance between the
nexus<00:00:41.790> 7<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.629> ipad<00:00:43.050> mini<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.680> let's<00:00:43.890> start

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
nexus 7 and the ipad mini so let's start

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
nexus 7 and the ipad mini so let's start
out<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.550> simple<00:00:44.969> boot<00:00:45.480> test<00:00:45.809> both<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
out with a simple boot test both of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440 
out with a simple boot test both of
these<00:00:46.410> devices<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.950> currently<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.270> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
these devices are currently off and we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330 
these devices are currently off and we
are<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> power<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.100> which

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
are going to power them on and see which

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.240 
are going to power them on and see which
one<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.850> booted<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.840> ready<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
one is booted up and ready to go the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.119 
one is booted up and ready to go the
quickest<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
quickest so here we go there are the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.099 
quickest so here we go there are the
logos<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> screen<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.050> said

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
logos on the screen and like I said

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
logos on the screen and like I said
these<00:00:58.800> tests<00:00:59.309> aren't<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.030> super

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
these tests aren't going to be super

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
these tests aren't going to be super
scientific<00:01:01.199> or<00:01:01.530> anything<00:01:01.980> they're<00:01:02.430> just

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
scientific or anything they're just

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
scientific or anything they're just
meant<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> give<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.210> good<00:01:03.510> idea<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
meant to give you a good idea on the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.609 
meant to give you a good idea on the
performance<00:01:05.189> between<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.540> Nexus<00:01:07.020> 7<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
performance between the Nexus 7 and the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.280 
performance between the Nexus 7 and the
ipad<00:01:08.010> mini<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.570> we're<00:01:09.810> coming

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
ipad mini so here we are we're coming

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.060 
ipad mini so here we are we're coming
around<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.950> home<00:01:11.159> stretch<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.820> believe<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
around the home stretch I believe and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.460 
around the home stretch I believe and
here<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.939> booted<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
here we go we are all booted up on the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.890 
here we go we are all booted up on the
Nexus<00:01:16.860> 7<00:01:17.159> still<00:01:17.460> waiting<00:01:17.729> around<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Nexus 7 still waiting around for the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080 
Nexus 7 still waiting around for the
ipad<00:01:19.259> mini<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.430> already<00:01:20.939> on

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
ipad mini to get there we are already on

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.539 
ipad mini to get there we are already on
the<00:01:21.150> home<00:01:21.299> screen<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> Nexus<00:01:22.229> 7<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> here

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the home screen of the Nexus 7 and here

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.480 
the home screen of the Nexus 7 and here
comes<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> ipad<00:01:24.780> mini<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.320> second<00:01:25.860> place<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
comes the ipad mini in second place and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.120 
comes the ipad mini in second place and
it<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> finally<00:01:27.780> ready<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.680> obviously

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it is finally ready to go so obviously

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.330 
it is finally ready to go so obviously
the<00:01:29.670> Nexus<00:01:30.060> 7<00:01:30.390> has<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.350> quicker<00:01:31.710> boot<00:01:32.070> time

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the Nexus 7 has the quicker boot time

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
the Nexus 7 has the quicker boot time
maybe<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.119> matters<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> maybe<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
maybe that matters to you maybe it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
maybe that matters to you maybe it
doesn't<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:34.979> know<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:36.000> does

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
doesn't but now you know which one does

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
doesn't but now you know which one does
for<00:01:36.240> sure<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.140> next<00:01:37.320> we're<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> test

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
for sure so next we're going to test

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.370 
for sure so next we're going to test
geekbench<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:40.200> are

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
geekbench and as you can see there are

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.800 
geekbench and as you can see there are
no<00:01:40.650> apps<00:01:40.890> running<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.549> either<00:01:41.850> device<00:01:42.090> except

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
no apps running on either device except

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.170 
no apps running on either device except
for<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> Geekbench<00:01:43.470> app<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.850> are<00:01:45.000> going

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
for the Geekbench app and we are going

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.660 
for the Geekbench app and we are going
to<00:01:45.360> hit<00:01:45.540> run<00:01:45.990> benchmarks<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:47.040> both<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.579> these

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to hit run benchmarks on both of these

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.539 
to hit run benchmarks on both of these
guys<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> same<00:01:48.810> time<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:50.250> we'll<00:01:50.460> get

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
guys at the same time and then we'll get

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.639 
guys at the same time and then we'll get
an<00:01:50.640> idea<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.930> win<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.350> this

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
an idea on which one will win in this

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.410 
an idea on which one will win in this
department<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.909> speed<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.210> up

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
department so I'm going to speed this up

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
department so I'm going to speed this up
a<00:01:54.689> little<00:01:54.780> bit<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.680> before<00:01:56.219> it's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
a little bit for you but before it's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.069 
a little bit for you but before it's
over<00:01:56.700> does<00:01:56.969> anybody<00:01:57.299> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> make<00:01:57.810> any

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
over does anybody want to make any

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.380 
over does anybody want to make any
wagers<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.399> which<00:01:59.610> one's<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.149> win

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
wagers here on which one's going to win

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.050 
wagers here on which one's going to win
so<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.490> Nexus<00:02:03.030> 7<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.869> have

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
so here we go with the Nexus 7 we have

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
so here we go with the Nexus 7 we have
2698<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.960> pretty<00:02:07.229> big<00:02:07.649> number<00:02:08.009> try<00:02:08.670> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
2698 that's a pretty big number try to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.940 
2698 that's a pretty big number try to
keep<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.149> mind<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.660> nexus<00:02:09.989> 7<00:02:10.319> does<00:02:10.619> have

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
keep in mind that the nexus 7 does have

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.980 
keep in mind that the nexus 7 does have
a<00:02:10.979> 1.5<00:02:11.849> gigahertz<00:02:12.180> quad-core<00:02:12.590> processor<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.660 
a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor and
ipad<00:02:14.320> mini<00:02:14.530> only<00:02:14.800> has<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> 1<00:02:15.280> gigahertz

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
ipad mini only has a 1 gigahertz

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.490 
ipad mini only has a 1 gigahertz
dual-core<00:02:16.180> processor<00:02:16.960> so<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.350> will

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
dual-core processor so that will

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.920 
dual-core processor so that will
definitely<00:02:18.070> affect<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:19.000> outcome<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.720> this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
definitely affect the outcome of this

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.290 
definitely affect the outcome of this
geekbench<00:02:20.590> test<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.220> here<00:02:21.820> we<00:02:21.910> go<00:02:22.030> with<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
geekbench test but here we go with the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.140 
geekbench test but here we go with the
ipad<00:02:22.600> mini<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:22.990> almost<00:02:23.260> done<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.950> as<00:02:24.790> you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
ipad mini it's almost done and as you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
ipad mini it's almost done and as you
can<00:02:25.300> see<00:02:25.330> here<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.990> have<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.590> measly<00:02:27.210> 759<00:02:28.210> pretty

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
can see here we have a measly 759 pretty

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.350 
can see here we have a measly 759 pretty
sad<00:02:29.470> i<00:02:29.530> mean<00:02:29.890> honestly<00:02:30.100> now<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:31.180> doesn't

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
sad i mean honestly now that doesn't

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.270 
sad i mean honestly now that doesn't
necessarily<00:02:31.600> mean<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.260> apps<00:02:32.710> are<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.190> to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
necessarily mean that apps are going to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.700

run better or worse on either tablet it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.380 
run better or worse on either tablet it
really<00:02:36.040> depends<00:02:36.400> on<00:02:36.460> how<00:02:36.520> optimized<00:02:37.210> that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
really depends on how optimized that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.990 
really depends on how optimized that
specific<00:02:37.840> app<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.380> or<00:02:38.620> what<00:02:39.280> technology<00:02:39.850> that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
specific app is or what technology that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.360 
specific app is or what technology that
app<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.420> leveraging<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.440> work<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.860> either<00:02:42.130> of

app is leveraging to work on either of
those<00:02:42.520> devices<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.330> keep<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.840> mind<00:02:44.140> this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
those devices so keep that in mind this

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.740 
those devices so keep that in mind this
may<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.710> bit<00:02:44.920> unfair<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> ipad<00:02:46.210> mini<00:02:46.240> but

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
may be a bit unfair to the ipad mini but

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.020 
may be a bit unfair to the ipad mini but
i<00:02:46.780> have<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.020> feeling<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.500> even<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.520> apple

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
i have a feeling that even when apple

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.360 
i have a feeling that even when apple
does<00:02:49.240> update<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.750> ipad<00:02:50.050> mini<00:02:50.080> here<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:50.890> still

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
does update the ipad mini here it still

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.250 
does update the ipad mini here it still
may<00:02:51.550> not<00:02:51.760> have<00:02:52.000> better<00:02:52.330> processing<00:02:53.020> power

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
may not have better processing power

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.440 
may not have better processing power
than<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.770> nexus<00:02:54.100> 7<00:02:54.460> based<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:54.910> apple's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
than the nexus 7 based on apple's

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.230 
than the nexus 7 based on apple's
incremental<00:02:56.380> update<00:02:56.890> history<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:57.940> now<00:02:58.060> we're

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
incremental update history so now we're

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.000 
incremental update history so now we're
going<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.450> take<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.690> look<00:02:58.930> at<00:02:59.170> gaming<00:02:59.650> I've

you<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.210> a<00:03:34.270> second<00:03:34.630> but<00:03:34.690> that's<00:03:34.870> just

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
you that in a second but that's just

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.260 
you that in a second but that's just
basically<00:03:35.350> due<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.010> GPU<00:03:36.490> performance<00:03:36.700> of

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
basically due to the GPU performance of

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.180 
basically due to the GPU performance of
the<00:03:37.540> device<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:38.470> let's<00:03:38.740> go<00:03:38.860> ahead<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.070> check

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
the device so let's go ahead and check

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.640 
the device so let's go ahead and check
that<00:03:39.520> out<00:03:39.730> here's<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.270> same<00:03:40.540> game<00:03:40.900> on<00:03:41.200> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
that out here's the same game on the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.980 
that out here's the same game on the
ipad<00:03:41.800> mini<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.550> i<00:03:43.210> don't<00:03:43.420> know<00:03:43.450> if<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.810> can

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
ipad mini and i don't know if you can

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.630 
ipad mini and i don't know if you can
notice<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.440> but<00:03:44.770> when<00:03:44.920> i<00:03:44.950> was<00:03:45.040> playing<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
notice it but when i was playing it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.190 
notice it but when i was playing it
definitely<00:03:46.150> right<00:03:46.300> off<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.600> bat<00:03:46.780> there<00:03:46.960> is<00:03:47.170> a

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
definitely right off the bat there is a

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.760 
definitely right off the bat there is a
difference<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:49.360> quality<00:03:49.630> here<00:03:50.440> now

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
difference in the quality here now

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.440 
difference in the quality here now
overall<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.370> game<00:03:51.550> looks<00:03:51.790> alright<00:03:52.120> but

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
overall the game looks alright but

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.810 
overall the game looks alright but
you're<00:03:52.660> missing<00:03:53.290> things<00:03:53.770> like<00:03:54.040> smooth<00:03:54.430> edges

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
you're missing things like smooth edges

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.820 
you're missing things like smooth edges

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
you're missing that water splashing up

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.130 
you're missing that water splashing up
on<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.130> screen<00:03:57.460> some<00:03:58.270> things<00:03:58.570> are<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.840> little

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
on the screen some things are a little

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.250 
on the screen some things are a little
block<00:03:59.530> year<00:03:59.770> in<00:04:00.040> comparison<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.240> Nexus<00:04:01.870> 7

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
block year in comparison to the Nexus 7

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.070 
block year in comparison to the Nexus 7
but<00:04:02.470> overall<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.250> gameplay<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.940> very<00:04:04.240> smooth

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
but overall the gameplay is very smooth

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.650 
but overall the gameplay is very smooth
it<00:04:05.440> runs<00:04:05.710> just<00:04:05.890> fine<00:04:06.280> there<00:04:07.150> aren't<00:04:07.360> any

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
it runs just fine there aren't any

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.650 
it runs just fine there aren't any
differences<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.800> actually<00:04:09.670> playing<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.300> but

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
differences in actually playing it but

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.300 
differences in actually playing it but
once<00:04:10.870> you've<00:04:11.080> been<00:04:11.290> playing<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.800> up<00:04:12.010> close

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
once you've been playing it up close

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.670 
once you've been playing it up close
like<00:04:12.580> I<00:04:12.790> have<00:04:13.030> there's<00:04:13.330> definitely<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:13.990> notable

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
like I have there's definitely a notable

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
difference in graphic performance

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.650

between<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.770> two<00:04:17.950> devices<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.790> course<00:04:19.480> the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
between the two devices of course the

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.260 
between the two devices of course the
nexus<00:04:20.080> 7<00:04:20.410> does<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:20.980> better<00:04:21.280> GPU<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.060> that's

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
nexus 7 does have a better GPU so that's

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.719 
nexus 7 does have a better GPU so that's
going<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.930> make<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.890> difference<00:04:23.919> in

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
going to make the difference in

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.790 
going to make the difference in
everything<00:04:25.630> but<00:04:25.990> why<00:04:26.140> don't<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.440> be<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
everything but why don't you be the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.750 
everything but why don't you be the
judge<00:04:27.130> let<00:04:27.430> me<00:04:27.550> know

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
judge let me know

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.270 
judge let me know
which<00:04:27.850> device<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.510> prefer<00:04:28.960> from<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.740> gaming

perspective the next and final thing I

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.650 
perspective the next and final thing I
want<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.010> show<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.850> scrolling

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
want to show you is scrolling

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.900 
want to show you is scrolling
performance<00:04:35.140> now<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.890> may<00:04:36.130> not<00:04:36.490> think<00:04:36.550> this

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
performance now you may not think this

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.970 
performance now you may not think this
is<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.090> big<00:04:37.300> deal<00:04:37.510> but<00:04:37.840> this<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:38.680> something<00:04:38.860> that

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
is a big deal but this is something that

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.400 
is a big deal but this is something that
bothers<00:04:39.460> me<00:04:39.490> about<00:04:39.820> Android<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.750> scrolling

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
bothers me about Android the scrolling

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.830 
bothers me about Android the scrolling
inside<00:04:41.950> of<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.460> web<00:04:42.760> browser<00:04:42.940> just<00:04:43.330> seems<00:04:43.570> a

inside of a web browser just seems a

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.840 
inside of a web browser just seems a
little<00:04:43.870> jittery<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.950> little<00:04:45.370> more<00:04:45.580> jittery

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
little jittery a little more jittery

little jittery a little more jittery
than<00:04:46.180> iOS<00:04:46.420> in<00:04:47.080> my<00:04:47.290> opinion<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.980> was<00:04:48.430> just<00:04:48.640> one

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
than iOS in my opinion that was just one

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.820 
than iOS in my opinion that was just one
thing<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.240> just<00:04:49.660> don't<00:04:49.840> know<00:04:50.020> why<00:04:50.290> something

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
thing I just don't know why something

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.820 
thing I just don't know why something
simple<00:04:51.280> as<00:04:51.400> this<00:04:51.670> can't<00:04:52.600> be<00:04:52.930> just<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.800> little

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
simple as this can't be just a little

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.950 
simple as this can't be just a little
bit<00:04:54.100> better<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.550> mean<00:04:54.850> scrolling<00:04:55.390> through<00:04:55.750> out

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
bit better I mean scrolling through out

the operating system just seems a little
more<00:04:58.570> jittery<00:04:58.840> than<00:04:59.230> iOS<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.980> I'll<00:05:00.040> show<00:05:00.250> you

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
more jittery than iOS and I'll show you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.910 
more jittery than iOS and I'll show you
that<00:05:00.400> here<00:05:00.850> right<00:05:01.090> now<00:05:01.330> as<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.320> can<00:05:02.470> see<00:05:02.530> we
