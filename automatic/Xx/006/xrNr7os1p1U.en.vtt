00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.450 
natural way and he he goes all the way
to<00:02:52.600> make<00:02:53.600> sure<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.530> get<00:02:54.740> exactly<00:02:54.950> what

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
to make sure that you get exactly what

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.740 
to make sure that you get exactly what
you<00:02:55.700> want<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.850> keys<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.450> make<00:02:59.630> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
you want and the keys to make the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.630 
you want and the keys to make the
patient<00:03:00.170> look<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.560> themselves<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.370> just

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
patient look like themselves but just

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.840 
patient look like themselves but just
refresh<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.630> rest<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.580> think<00:03:04.640> that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
refresh and rest it and I think that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.420 
refresh and rest it and I think that
really<00:03:05.060> is<00:03:05.750> what<00:03:05.840> defines<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.890> good<00:03:07.100> plastic

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
really is what defines a good plastic

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.520 
really is what defines a good plastic
surgery<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.210> when<00:03:08.390> nobody<00:03:08.810> else<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:09.230> tell

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530

surgery is when nobody else can tell
what<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:10.040> had<00:03:10.190> done<00:03:11.680> nobody<00:03:12.680> has<00:03:12.890> even<00:03:13.100> said
