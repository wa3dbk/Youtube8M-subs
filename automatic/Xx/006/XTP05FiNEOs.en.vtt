00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.809
 was more in the human race has no limits and when it comes to creating websites 

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.869
 on the internet and then 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.029
 many web pages are incredibly poorly made 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.999
 festivals or externally yes however 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.410
 these pages being strange and different zones 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.950
 they fit for anything 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.950
 when those sites that serve no purpose at all 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 it is not uncommon for those of you today to come out completely useless 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.180
 should be avoided 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.650
 the address is fulfilled but it is very easy to remember 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.490
 just write 18 times 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.670
 before the point 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.850
 this site shows 5 giant plush animals and danced in synchrony to the sound 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.920
 of a song that has a star 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.009
 the music is very swollen and pornography and has in hand 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.790
 however we can observe a stopwatch below the image 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980
 how long you're not alive 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
 7th place in our life 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.560
 the sixth place stayed for the city which is one of the largest travel agencies have 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.850
 foundation 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.659
 when entering the dotcom game you receive a robotic voice 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.880
 saying phrases like 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.230
 explained the reason for a good point 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.730
 having a good moment in hand 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.260
 you can do everything you want in the middle of a common point 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.649
 and you can sit and wait, because this warm reception never ends 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.999
 we did a test after being exposed for close to an hour listening to the 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.999
 greetings if there were 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.989
 Are you sick of those, your friend who was featured stays with the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.989
 your name of the Saudis that end up being threatened 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.340
 after hearing a funny joke in the results and in the 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.049
 batteries 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.059
 of those who are made shortly after the comedian ends 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.299
 the moment 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.299
 So you have only to simulate the barueri 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.990
 the filipa koala is undoubtedly the most useless and colorful place 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.199
 from Internet 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.769
 accessing with you and I will not find any content because 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.319
 he only has a background in nothing else 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.089
 but the legacy of these sites is that when we passed away in the corner of the 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:58.390
 whole page 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.390
 and appears exactly to treat an equal with nothing 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.079
 of another color 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.820
 Then we try again 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.969
 in another color 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.309
 again of another color 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:11.100
 a very well thought out idea 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.100
 who took our 4th place and is worth giving a check 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.439
 what about a website that has the site name in last 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.290
 created by someone who wanted to prove that it is not necessary to have content for 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.519
 seven visits the site more and in oblivion and never in its short 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.679
 history had a significant visitation 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:40.009
 more worth to show this site as an example missing from what to do on the net 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.839
 How many people have you seen imitating prey? 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.479
 some do the imitation very well 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.579
 others not so much 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.859
 if you want to be part too 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.450
 this class of goods the image is not my homage and beaches 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.909
 dentinho is with 68 points paulo 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.430
 is still a customer 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.430
 he thanked his colleagues and the most famous eiffel tower 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.859
 uai 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.899
 in brazil we have some representatives of the virtual entity 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.479
 the site dot dot dot com for example is an inexplicable phenomenon 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:28.740
 there does not even have dancing animals is not colorful and does not have 

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:30.930
 fabulous nobody's photo 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.160
 the cable car has only an old photo expo kara dioguardi 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.980
 even though it was one of the most visited sites in 2006 and 2007 in Brazil 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.689
 and you 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.879
 know some sites and more useless because the ones we show 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.770
 So send us back to the team. 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.439
 between are farces 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:51.059
 or a stump
