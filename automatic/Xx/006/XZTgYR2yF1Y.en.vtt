00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.880
 hi people this is gecko how are you 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.039
 you me it's going great 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.619
 and so today as you can 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.960
 see we meet again on gta 5 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.090
 so not for a glitch but for 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.250
 a little trick either from time to time 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.630
 it feels good a little trick so 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.910
 for this tip if you are going to take 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.829
 a vehicle not just any and you 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.860
 go to a los santos 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.469
 custom of there in my opinion everyone 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.420
 already noticed that rockstar in 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.120
 fat and a famous painting 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.160
 so I think you'll agree 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.860
 with me that when you go to see this 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.920
 painting of the first reaction that's 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.850
 that it's not really the color of gold 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.590
 so wait I'm going on it's 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 in metallic paints I have not 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.770
 checked in the others if they were 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.149
 so here we go 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.399
 this brownish shit color but we 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.799
 looking we will say for me it looks like 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.260
 not really a horn color for 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.390
 rockstar apparently so so where from 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.590
 the interest of the little trick so this 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.030
 video i'm going to show you how 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.580
 get a painting that really has that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.920
 looks like gold to us for that you 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.960
 go put to sleep the first in 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.700
 this category there you have selected 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.650
 the bronze just below 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.150
 when once you're done 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.130
 a little back you're going to go in 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.840
 the mc rae helping to create you go 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.869
 So look for the yellow racing is 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.540
 in the middle of the list so here is 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.220
 already there we can see that is well 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.180
 different you are going to buy these sums 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.520
 created his dressing room 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.110
 you have to get out of the garage and you 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.970
 go put yourself in place and and from there 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.400
 you really feel like you 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.570
 a gold bar in the hands is 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.600
 really blatant 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.179
 I do not know what smoke the guy created 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.369
 the paint off rockstar he will have to 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.689
 movement of our opinion before so of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.069
 look at the sun it's really 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.480
 flagrant symposium the painting is 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.420
 we really feel 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.520
 to have light in your hands and so 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.320
 here are the legs 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.230
 I hope this little tip for 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.930
 get gold- colored paint you will have 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.910
 the more you will be useful and me on this I 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.300
