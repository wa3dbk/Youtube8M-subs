 hello today on our planet 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.619
 There are several trees that have reached 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.410
 we have a long time ago this yew 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.869
 berry is a metasequoia about them we 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.300
 tell in separate plots and here's another 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.520
 one such tree ginko wa bladed 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.620
 the birthplace of this plant is mountain 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.240
 areas of china 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.670
 then it was brought here to europe here 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.239
 in the 19th century it was used 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.890
 only as an ornamental plant 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.989
 then exploring discovered healing 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.120
 properties of its leaves and have become 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.039

 and female sprawling 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.930
 luxurious such big trees despite 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.729
 the fact that it is very ancient exotic 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.390
 plant gain year lobed perfect 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.850
 not demanding well endures both heat and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.680
 drought and severe frosts though of course 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.630
 young seedlings better first time 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280
 close 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.320
 the soil is also not picky though 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.810
 Sure will grow better in good 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.180
 fertile soil is very good king 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.920
 suffers gas pollution smoke 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.759
 cities so basically it is possible 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.479
 grow 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.920
 from the condition of our city acceptable 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.380
 reproduces genka was a dangerous two 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.909
 ways seeds and cuttings here to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.770
 sorry cuttings as opposed to 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.299
 many other plants going worse 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.880
 much that is bad cuttings 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.820
 multiply 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.860
 to propagate through seeds 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.460
 a very special laborious seed process 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.490
 best planted in the fall before winter and 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.259
 spring they give their shoots the same percentage 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.640
 similar to their variety can 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.740
 be high can be low here 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.409
 it's hard to predict it all now 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.049
 experts brought out several forms of king 2 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.630
 bladed this and pyramidal shape and 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.340
 weeping form is with all that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.989
 medicinal herbs

 properties of this plant in general 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.819
 preserved they say combined 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.709
 pleasant is useful main raw material for 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.040
 production of drugs from 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.430
 ging serves his leaves cut them off 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.280
 remove dried and then from this raw material 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.360
 I do the same medicine mostly 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 uses for ready-made treatments 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.099
 which drugs are sold at the pharmacy 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.500
 such as memoplant tanakan bella 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.180
 building ford and probably beat him 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.590
 there were such names that's all 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.660
 made from this wonderful plant 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.760
 at home you can too 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.250
 make yourself extract from 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.079
 ging leaves for this fill one 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.350
 part of the dry leaves to carry the plot 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.180
 parts vodka in a dark place then let 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.250
 insist two weeks and then you can 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.019
 10 drops taken 3 times a day and so 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.780
 month about heal a little pereryvchik 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.700
 and again a month from what is this medicine 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.970
 such medicine improves blood circulation 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.120
 brain enhances brain cell resistance 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.920
 hypoxia besides experimentally 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.299
 installed anti-inflammatory and 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.670
 antiallergic action 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.290
 really plants are very useful well 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.329
 and in landscape design use for 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.980
 decoration parks large open 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.019
 spaces because the tree is still 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.359
 big grow up to 40 meters can 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.889
 grow like that and at home you 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.620
 can have such exot 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.590
 very ancient plant very beautiful 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.530
 plant 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.930
 very useful garden design plant 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.230
 king 2 paddle can be used in 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.790
 as single landings 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.379
 big parks big gardens have you 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.239
 allows space because the tree 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.760
 can grow big enough to 40 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.650
 meters so said with this you can with 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540
 him get medicinal so to speak 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.730
