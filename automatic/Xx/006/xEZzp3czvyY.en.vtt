they'll<00:04:59.909> divide<00:05:00.360> about<00:05:00.779> 50<00:05:01.379> or<00:05:01.469> 60<00:05:01.649> tons<00:05:02.189> and

they'll divide about 50 or 60 tons and
then<00:05:02.939> gradually<00:05:03.569> become<00:05:04.080> senescent<00:05:04.889> this<00:05:05.339> is

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
then gradually become senescent this is

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.269 
then gradually become senescent this is
called<00:05:05.789> senescence<00:05:06.599> under<00:05:06.899> glass<00:05:07.169> that's<00:05:08.069> why

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:08.279 
called senescence under glass that's why

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.339 
called senescence under glass that's why
I<00:05:08.309> say<00:05:08.580> there's<00:05:08.849> probably<00:05:09.149> a<00:05:09.240> clock<00:05:09.569> in<00:05:09.839> itself

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
I say there's probably a clock in itself

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:16.790 
I say there's probably a clock in itself
as<00:05:10.710> well<00:05:11.099> as<00:05:11.159> sounds<00:05:11.789> like<00:05:11.909> it's<00:05:12.059> really<00:05:15.800> you

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
as well as sounds like it's really you

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.499 
as well as sounds like it's really you

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
you look at the survival curve of people

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.429 
you look at the survival curve of people

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:43.439 
beyond 90 or 95 they're not dying so

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.350
