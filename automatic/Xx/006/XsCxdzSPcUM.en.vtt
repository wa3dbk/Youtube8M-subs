00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello everyone, yarik and slide it 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.799
 science win and today player na'vi 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.809
 teach us to analyze the setup 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.280
 the enemy so how do they do it 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.929
 professional tankers 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.929
 well, or at least try to teach 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.460
 in past issues we have chosen 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.700
 universal setup for command mode 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.550
 fight but as practice shows itâ€™s not important 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.739
 only he is equally important and that like this 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.440
 setup corresponds to the opponent stage 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.510
 therefore experienced players regardless 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.540
 from the card there is a standard algorithm 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.150
 action commander analyzes the composition 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.340
 enemy team and based on that 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.010
 analysis can make adjustments to your 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.230
 tactics for such a commander battle 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.659
 it starts from the moment of loading the map 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.430
 if your opponent has a slow technique 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.930
 And what about fast tanks? 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.269
 are there any drums pt 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.089
 as far as the enemy team is mobile 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.680
 In general, all these questions commander 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.990
 scrolls in my head for 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.000
 seconds while it compares 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.540
 setup opponent with your own 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.950
 one goal is to find the weaknesses of the enemy but 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.350
 let's get everything in order 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.260
 the first question is the presence of the enemy 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 slow technique see this play 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.190
 more aggressive from the very first seconds 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.380
 try to shoot slow tanks 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 the enemy before they can even take 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.590
 comfortable positions if it is impossible to 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.690
 do not rush 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.450
 and try to stretch the enemy 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.280
 command you plant the opponent from different 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.340
 parties and look for weak spots 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.070
 the easiest way to do this is to play from capture 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.590
 bases for this, use your t1 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 as soon as the opponent has divided the forces and there is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.070
 opportunity to attack at least 5 in 3 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.070
 act 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.700
 go further if you see the enemy 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.190
 fri-soo double care 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.430
 to give good light is of course important but 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.200
 save the firefly more importantly bt very 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.259
 dangerous but usually only until the first 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.870
 In addition, the team is wrong with them 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.970
 mobile it means you need to clamp 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.150
 the enemy on a small section of the map and 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.160
 loosen his defenses 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.370
 rush here nowhere main thing is not to get 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.000
 extra damage and if you still got 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.440
 be sure to tell the commander where 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.900
 illustrative example of prokhorovka 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.120
 devyanostik highlighted fellow in the center and 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.220
 three tyazhey on the fifth line we, too, 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.830
 grouping on it and here is our firefly 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.650
 receives completely optional damage from 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.830
 pt soup is not lit but our player says 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.290
 that the shot was salt on one side we 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.900
 already sunk on points of strength on the other 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.360
 the parties know that soup pour another 15 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.290
 seconds will be on reload opponent 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.420
 divided forces 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.300
 think here is not particularly when you need to urgently 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.940
 let go of trips first 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.830
 they must take the shells then 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.920
 the French will be able to completely defuse their 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.050
 drums and doing all this time pt 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.260
 can not help his team 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.180
 victory is ours of course their mistake 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.310
 the commander is on the run 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.050
 wrong but now it's not about that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.030
 do not tell our firefly 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.130
 where did he get the damage and the fight could 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.019
 turn out completely different so 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.010
 Be sure to inform the commander of the useful 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.330
 information 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.470
 the main thing is not to make of this farce 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.200
 the next important question is quantity 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.299
 drum if the enemy has less 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.760
 try to reduce the distance and 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.100
 impose melee tested near 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.549
 the drums trade their pc much 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.410
 more profitable than shooting from afar and 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.530
 vice versa if the opponent has less 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.100
 tower tanks such as Pershing T32 and 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.799
 of 3 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.450
 try to keep at a distance the enemy 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.640
 will not be able to use the drum by 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.799
 appointment he will have to exchange 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.930
 shot shots and armor then you have better 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.420
 In addition, you add unnecessary trouble 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.640
 each opposing their drummer 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.980
 will have to constantly think when better 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.080
 become recharge 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.450
 in the end, when you decide to go on the attack 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.190
 quite possibly one of them will be with 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.310
 longing to look at red rice 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.500
 around the sight the most difficult case if 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.079
 the enemy also has a fast tank and 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.060
 setups for teams of similar price each 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.760
 decisions of every rash action 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.590
 increases many times as a rule in such 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.540
 In cases, personal mastery is everything. 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.740
 players 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.740
 there is no universal victory recipe 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.080
 it all depends on each card 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.690
 but we'll talk about it in the following 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.729
 programs by the way if you are long 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.780
 planned to pump a few tanks 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.389
 for team battles 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.850
 now is the time for now
