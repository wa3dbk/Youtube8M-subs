00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
think she was the best part of the Dark

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.050 
think she was the best part of the Dark
Knight<00:02:12.660> Rises<00:02:12.780> which<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.470> funny<00:02:13.709> because

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
Knight Rises which is funny because

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.550 
Knight Rises which is funny because
I<00:02:14.090> thought<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.720> into<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.200> movie<00:02:15.440> if

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I thought going into the movie if

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.530 
I thought going into the movie if
anything<00:02:16.010> she<00:02:16.670> was<00:02:16.819> gonna<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.330> weak<00:02:17.510> link

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
anything she was gonna be the weak link

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.900 
anything she was gonna be the weak link
cuz<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.590> even<00:02:18.950> though<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.069> had<00:02:19.220> worship<00:02:19.760> her<00:02:19.880> as

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
cuz I even though I had worship her as

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.400 
cuz I even though I had worship her as
an<00:02:20.090> actress<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.599> couldn't<00:02:20.959> see<00:02:21.170> her<00:02:21.230> in<00:02:21.319> that

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
an actress I couldn't see her in that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.930 
an actress I couldn't see her in that
kind<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.770> role<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.520> she<00:02:22.819> would<00:02:22.910> have

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
kind of a role I think she would have

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.650 
kind of a role I think she would have
been<00:02:23.030> fabulous

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
been fabulous

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.839 
been fabulous
I<00:02:23.840> mean<00:02:24.140> she's<00:02:24.319> completely<00:02:24.739> she's<00:02:25.220> beautiful

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
I mean she's completely she's beautiful

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.520 
I mean she's completely she's beautiful
she<00:02:26.120> obviously<00:02:26.540> she<00:02:26.959> can<00:02:27.080> do<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.319> tight

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
she obviously she can do the tight

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.140 
she obviously she can do the tight
leather<00:02:27.770> jumping<00:02:28.190> around<00:02:28.280> rooftops<00:02:28.849> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
leather jumping around rooftops and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.690 
leather jumping around rooftops and
because<00:02:29.630> she<00:02:29.810> did<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.020> so<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:31.370> would<00:02:31.580> have

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
because she did it so this would have

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.100 
because she did it so this would have
been<00:02:31.760> absolutely<00:02:32.360> fascinating<00:02:32.599> would've

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
