here<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> sub<00:00:24.210> mucosa<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> mucosa

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
here is a sub mucosa here is a mucosa

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.200 
here is a sub mucosa here is a mucosa
and<00:00:27.060> here's<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> large<00:00:28.080> ulcer<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:29.029> you<00:00:30.029> could

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and here's a large ulcer as you could

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
and here's a large ulcer as you could
see<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.750> there's<00:00:31.080> complete<00:00:31.560> absence<00:00:32.250> not

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
see because there's complete absence not

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.670 
see because there's complete absence not
only<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> epithelium<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> entire

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.560 
mucosa
so<00:00:36.420> let's<00:00:36.750> look<00:00:36.930> around<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.469> little<00:00:37.590> bit<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
so let's look around a little bit and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.110 
so let's look around a little bit and
the<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:39.989> notice<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.120> others

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the first thing we notice is that others

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.200 
the first thing we notice is that others
even<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.809> inflammatory<00:00:43.610> cells<00:00:44.610> scattered

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
even some inflammatory cells scattered

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
even some inflammatory cells scattered
out<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:47.480> adventitia<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.809> serosa<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
out here in the adventitia or serosa the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.970 
out here in the adventitia or serosa the
muscle<00:00:50.700> appears<00:00:51.329> nice<00:00:52.070> smooth<00:00:53.070> uniform<00:00:54.980> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
muscle appears nice smooth uniform the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.270

the adjacent area where there is no
ulceration<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> lot<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.100> sub

ulceration you can see a lot of sub
mucosal<00:01:26.970> destruction<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.829> see

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
mucosal destruction here and you can see

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.219 
mucosal destruction here and you can see
a<00:01:29.040> lot<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.430> hemorrhage<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.390> inflammation

within<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> mucosa<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:35.180> what<00:01:36.180> could

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
within the mucosa as well what could

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.490 
within the mucosa as well what could
this<00:01:36.810> be

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
this be

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.770 
this be
well<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.159> could<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.460> lot<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.909> things<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
well it could be a lot of things it's a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.789 
well it could be a lot of things it's a
very<00:01:40.020> significant<00:01:40.829> colitis<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.590> had

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
very significant colitis and if you had

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.770 
very significant colitis and if you had
a<00:01:43.829> lot<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> time<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:46.189> you<00:01:47.189> were<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.670> look<00:01:48.509> at

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
a lot of time and you were to look at

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.060 
a lot of time and you were to look at
this<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:51.060> had<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> good<00:01:51.540> eye<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.829> might

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
this and you had a good eye you might

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.600 
this and you had a good eye you might
come<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> an<00:01:53.610> area<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:56.430> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
come to an area like this in which you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
come to an area like this in which you
could<00:01:56.759> see<00:01:57.030> within<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.860> destroyed

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
could see within this destroyed

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
could see within this destroyed
submucosa<00:01:59.700> area<00:02:02.689> little<00:02:03.689> guys<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
submucosa area little guys like this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.830 
submucosa area little guys like this
and<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:09.060> probably<00:02:10.060> here's<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.600> best

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and this and probably here's the best

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.710 
and this and probably here's the best
one<00:02:11.080> over<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:13.050> these<00:02:14.050> are<00:02:14.319> amoebas<00:02:15.720> quite

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
one over here these are amoebas quite

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.350 
one over here these are amoebas quite
frankly<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:18.100> probably<00:02:18.489> miss<00:02:18.819> them<00:02:19.030> unless

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
frankly you probably miss them unless

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.750 
frankly you probably miss them unless
you<00:02:19.480> were<00:02:19.600> really<00:02:19.810> looking<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.620> them<00:02:20.770> you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
you were really looking for them you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.340 
you were really looking for them you
might<00:02:21.790> think<00:02:22.209> oh<00:02:22.390> that's<00:02:22.600> just<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.080> piece<00:02:23.319> of

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
might think oh that's just a piece of

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.640 
might think oh that's just a piece of
smudge<00:02:23.950> or<00:02:24.280> maybe<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.819> macrophage<00:02:25.600> amoebas<00:02:26.440> do

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
smudge or maybe a macrophage amoebas do

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.160 
smudge or maybe a macrophage amoebas do
look<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.160> macrophages<00:02:27.940> they're<00:02:28.690> about<00:02:28.959> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
look like macrophages they're about the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.559 
look like macrophages they're about the
right<00:02:29.440> size<00:02:29.739> they<00:02:30.069> have<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.569> granular

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
right size they have a granular

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.190 
right size they have a granular
cytoplasm<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:36.130> didn't<00:02:36.989> suspect<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
cytoplasm and if you didn't suspect it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960 
cytoplasm and if you didn't suspect it
you<00:02:38.380> could<00:02:38.560> totally<00:02:39.040> miss<00:02:39.280> these<00:02:39.489> things

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
you could totally miss these things

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.340 
you could totally miss these things
this<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.450> amoebic<00:02:41.050> colitis<00:02:41.950> with<00:02:42.880> time<00:02:43.350> this

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
this is amoebic colitis with time this

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.070 
this is amoebic colitis with time this
could<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:44.950> significant<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:46.390> could<00:02:46.660> result

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
could be so significant it could result

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.660 
could be so significant it could result
in<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:49.239> amoebas<00:02:49.750> even<00:02:50.200> settling<00:02:50.709> into<00:02:51.069> organs

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
in the amoebas even settling into organs

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.600 
in the amoebas even settling into organs
like<00:02:51.910> liver<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:53.350> think<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.890> probably

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.940 

virtually<00:02:57.630> 90<00:02:58.630> something<00:02:58.930> percent<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.769> all

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
virtually 90 something percent of all

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.090 
virtually 90 something percent of all
cases<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.720> amoebic<00:03:01.720> liver<00:03:02.019> abscesses<00:03:02.799> are

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
cases of amoebic liver abscesses are

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.420 
cases of amoebic liver abscesses are
from<00:03:04.030> amoeba<00:03:04.660> colitis<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:06.010> think<00:03:06.250> what

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
from amoeba colitis and I think what

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.420 
from amoeba colitis and I think what
with<00:03:06.670> time<00:03:07.000> enough<00:03:07.450> significant<00:03:08.260> me<00:03:09.250> but

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
with time enough significant me but

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.240 
with time enough significant me but
colitis<00:03:09.940> could<00:03:10.780> lead<00:03:10.959> into<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> liver<00:03:11.590> abscess

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
colitis could lead into a liver abscess

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.729 
colitis could lead into a liver abscess
as<00:03:12.549> well<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:13.180> which<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.900> see<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.260> amoebas

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
as well in which you can see the amoebas

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.640 
as well in which you can see the amoebas
thank<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.190> very<00:03:15.370> much
