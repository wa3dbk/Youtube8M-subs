00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
much if that sounds confusing let's take

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.119 
much if that sounds confusing let's take
a<00:00:55.629> look<00:00:55.839> at<00:00:55.930> how<00:00:56.019> it<00:00:56.110> plays<00:00:56.350> hopefully<00:00:56.979> that

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
a look at how it plays hopefully that

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.890 
a look at how it plays hopefully that
will<00:00:57.220> clear<00:00:57.369> it<00:00:57.580> up<00:00:57.670> now<00:00:58.089> the<00:00:58.150> whole<00:00:58.390> point<00:00:58.809> of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
will clear it up now the whole point of

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.079 
will clear it up now the whole point of
this<00:00:59.049> game<00:00:59.290> is<00:00:59.409> that<00:00:59.440> you're<00:00:59.559> gonna<00:00:59.650> have

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
to select any mission from the deck so I

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.700 
to select any mission from the deck so I
can<00:03:36.700> do<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.240> giving<00:03:37.870> my<00:03:37.960> opponent<00:03:38.440> three

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
can do that and giving my opponent three

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.890 
can do that and giving my opponent three
points<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.940> where<00:03:40.090> my<00:03:40.210> opponent<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.630> take

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900

points and where my opponent can take
the<00:03:41.380> action<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.280> I'll<00:03:42.400> get<00:03:42.640> three<00:03:42.910> points<00:03:43.380> and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
the action and I'll get three points and

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.050 
the action and I'll get three points and
so<00:03:44.500> there's<00:03:44.710> many<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.040> these<00:03:45.130> free<00:03:45.490> agents<00:03:45.940> in

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.530 
draw them the top one from the discard
pile<00:04:17.380> which<00:04:18.040> will<00:04:18.220> often<00:04:18.400> be<00:04:18.790> one<00:04:19.330> of<00:04:19.420> these

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
pile which will often be one of these

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.180 
pile which will often be one of these
free<00:04:19.810> agents<00:04:20.230> since<00:04:20.380> they're<00:04:20.590> used<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.040> then

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
free agents since they're used and then

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.010 
free agents since they're used and then
discard<00:04:21.670> it<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:22.150> can<00:04:22.300> also<00:04:22.450> buy<00:04:22.750> more

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
discard it you can also buy more

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.020 
discard it you can also buy more
missions<00:04:23.530> or<00:04:25.650> basically<00:04:26.650> take<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.430> mission<00:04:27.910> of

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
missions or basically take a mission of

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.110 
missions or basically take a mission of
your<00:04:28.720> choice<00:04:29.050> from<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.979> discard<00:04:30.430> pile

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
your choice from the the discard pile

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.090 
your choice from the the discard pile
now<00:04:31.720> these<00:04:31.900> missions<00:04:32.410> can<00:04:32.530> be<00:04:32.710> played<00:04:32.949> at<00:04:33.070> the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
now these missions can be played at the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.330 
now these missions can be played at the
very<00:04:33.280> end<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.610> your<00:04:33.730> turn<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.330> each<00:04:35.340> grouping

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
very end of your turn and each grouping

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.430 
very end of your turn and each grouping
of<00:04:36.520> spies<00:04:37.210> can<00:04:37.570> have<00:04:37.750> up<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.020> two<00:04:38.199> missions

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
of spies can have up the two missions

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.680 
of spies can have up the two missions
played<00:04:38.889> on<00:04:39.040> it<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.880> this<00:04:40.060> one<00:04:40.210> here<00:04:40.389> will<00:04:40.510> give

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
played on it so this one here will give

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.840 
played on it so this one here will give
me<00:04:40.870> three<00:04:41.110> points<00:04:41.500> if<00:04:41.650> I'm<00:04:41.919> getting<00:04:42.160> no<00:04:42.430> points

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
me three points if I'm getting no points

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.200 
me three points if I'm getting no points
from<00:04:43.000> either<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.660> my<00:04:44.229> factions<00:04:44.830> here<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.820> can

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
from either of my factions here I can

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.610 
from either of my factions here I can
get<00:04:46.330> four<00:04:46.570> points<00:04:46.810> for<00:04:47.199> each<00:04:47.260> pair<00:04:47.590> of

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
get four points for each pair of

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.250 
get four points for each pair of
identical<00:04:47.880> agents<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:49.090> are<00:04:49.210> adjacent<00:04:49.570> in

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
identical agents that are adjacent in

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.500 
identical agents that are adjacent in
this<00:04:50.440> faction<00:04:50.860> missions<00:04:51.820> aren't<00:04:52.030> always<00:04:52.210> the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
this faction missions aren't always the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.240 
this faction missions aren't always the
easiest<00:04:52.900> thing<00:04:53.229> to<00:04:53.260> pull<00:04:53.680> off<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:54.040> won't

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
easiest thing to pull off this won't

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.409 
easiest thing to pull off this won't
give<00:04:54.370> me<00:04:54.460> two<00:04:54.610> points<00:04:54.970> if<00:04:55.060> this<00:04:55.180> is<00:04:55.300> the

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
give me two points if this is the

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.659 
give me two points if this is the
shortest<00:04:55.750> of<00:04:55.930> my<00:04:56.020> two<00:04:56.080> factions<00:04:56.680> but<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.460> can

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
shortest of my two factions but I can

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.219 
shortest of my two factions but I can
put<00:04:57.880> up<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.090> two<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.270> them<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:59.050> will

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
put up the two of them and this will

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.200 
put up the two of them and this will
increase<00:04:59.860> the<00:04:59.979> number<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.400> points<00:05:00.669> in<00:05:00.850> my<00:05:00.970> turn

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
increase the number of points in my turn

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.330 
increase the number of points in my turn
each<00:05:01.479> time<00:05:02.080> my<00:05:02.260> turns<00:05:02.500> over<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:02.979> I'm<00:05:03.040> finished

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
each time my turns over and I'm finished

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.730 
each time my turns over and I'm finished
with<00:05:03.430> my<00:05:03.520> two<00:05:03.669> actions<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.510> will<00:05:05.050> take<00:05:05.380> points

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
with my two actions I will take points

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.990 
with my two actions I will take points
from<00:05:05.830> any<00:05:05.979> arrows<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.669> might<00:05:06.880> have

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
from any arrows that I might have

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.150 
from any arrows that I might have
pointing<00:05:07.389> towards<00:05:07.660> me<00:05:07.720> plus<00:05:08.500> any<00:05:08.710> missions

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
pointing towards me plus any missions

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.340 
pointing towards me plus any missions
that<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.370> might<00:05:09.550> have<00:05:09.729> accomplished<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.600> this

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
that I might have accomplished and this

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.170 
that I might have accomplished and this
will<00:05:11.500> continue<00:05:11.860> you'll<00:05:12.250> be<00:05:12.400> spending<00:05:12.729> a<00:05:12.970> few

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
will continue you'll be spending a few

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.909 
will continue you'll be spending a few
points<00:05:13.510> to<00:05:13.570> get<00:05:13.750> more<00:05:13.990> agents<00:05:14.410> in<00:05:14.500> your<00:05:14.530> hand

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
points to get more agents in your hand

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.129 
points to get more agents in your hand
that's<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.820> best<00:05:16.060> way<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.240> get<00:05:16.419> agents<00:05:16.900> into

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
that's the best way to get agents into

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.620 
that's the best way to get agents into
your<00:05:17.260> hand<00:05:17.790> or<00:05:18.790> maybe<00:05:18.970> even<00:05:19.030> to<00:05:19.330> get<00:05:19.450> more

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
your hand or maybe even to get more

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.900 
your hand or maybe even to get more
missions<00:05:20.050> as<00:05:20.169> time<00:05:20.350> goes<00:05:20.560> by<00:05:20.590> but<00:05:21.430> essentially

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
missions as time goes by but essentially

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.029 
missions as time goes by but essentially
you're<00:05:22.030> trying<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.479> go<00:05:22.720> above<00:05:23.289> and<00:05:23.500> beyond<00:05:23.830> to

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
you're trying to go above and beyond to

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.430 
you're trying to go above and beyond to
get<00:05:24.190> those<00:05:24.400> 40<00:05:24.820> points<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.450> that's<00:05:26.139> how<00:05:26.380> the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
get those 40 points and that's how the

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.350 
get those 40 points and that's how the
game<00:05:26.560> works<00:05:26.950> really<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.580> first<00:05:27.700> person<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:28.090> 40

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
game works really the first person to 40

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.330 
game works really the first person to 40
points<00:05:28.539> is<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.870> winner<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.320> it's<00:05:29.919> all<00:05:30.130> about

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
points is the winner and it's all about

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.400 
points is the winner and it's all about
all<00:05:30.850> these<00:05:31.180> different<00:05:31.449> missions<00:05:32.050> that<00:05:32.260> you'll

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
all these different missions that you'll

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.260 
all these different missions that you'll
be<00:05:32.560> playing<00:05:32.800> from<00:05:32.979> your<00:05:33.070> hand<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.580> a<00:05:34.090> variety

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
be playing from your hand and a variety

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.629 
be playing from your hand and a variety
of<00:05:34.539> agents<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.530> thing<00:05:35.770> is<00:05:35.979> there<00:05:36.370> really

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
of agents the thing is there really

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.810 
of agents the thing is there really
isn't<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.539> huge<00:05:38.200> of<00:05:38.350> a<00:05:38.440> number<00:05:38.740> of<00:05:38.919> agents<00:05:39.520> or

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
isn't that huge of a number of agents or

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.950 
isn't that huge of a number of agents or
missions<00:05:40.419> in<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.720> game

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
missions in the game

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.870 
missions in the game
it's<00:05:41.380> how<00:05:41.590> they<00:05:41.800> interact<00:05:42.340> with<00:05:42.460> each<00:05:42.700> other

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
it's how they interact with each other

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.969 
it's how they interact with each other
that<00:05:43.240> really<00:05:43.630> makes<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:44.050> game<00:05:44.260> and<00:05:44.530> that's

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
that really makes the game and that's

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.159 
that really makes the game and that's
the<00:05:45.190> whole<00:05:45.460> crux<00:05:45.970> of<00:05:46.210> this<00:05:46.419> game<00:05:46.720> is<00:05:46.900> that<00:05:46.930> it's

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
the whole crux of this game is that it's

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.140 
the whole crux of this game is that it's
one<00:05:47.289> of<00:05:47.380> these<00:05:47.500> this<00:05:48.070> this<00:05:48.400> this<00:05:48.700> whole<00:05:48.910> new

rarely the agents in a mission SEC but

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.700 
rarely the agents in a mission SEC but
the<00:05:58.360> way<00:05:58.599> that<00:05:58.840> they<00:05:58.930> interact<00:05:59.229> with<00:05:59.590> each

other even though you know at first I

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.659 
other even though you know at first I
was<00:06:02.080> thinking<00:06:02.229> abs<00:06:02.680> in<00:06:02.889> an<00:06:03.010> abstracted<00:06:03.490> way

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
was thinking abs in an abstracted way

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.370 
was thinking abs in an abstracted way
you<00:06:03.729> know<00:06:04.000> flip<00:06:04.270> this<00:06:04.419> agent<00:06:04.780> over<00:06:04.870> rotate

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
you know flip this agent over rotate

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.969 
you know flip this agent over rotate
this<00:06:05.560> card

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
this card

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.070 
this card
but<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.460> theme<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:07.030> spy<00:06:07.389> theme<00:06:07.780> comes

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
but the theme the spy theme comes

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.620 
but the theme the spy theme comes
through<00:06:08.380> really<00:06:08.650> well<00:06:08.970> it<00:06:09.970> works<00:06:10.210> really<00:06:10.510> well

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
through really well it works really well

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.150 
through really well it works really well
as<00:06:10.840> a<00:06:10.900> two-player<00:06:11.260> game<00:06:11.440> it<00:06:11.590> works<00:06:11.740> well<00:06:11.919> three

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
as a two-player game it works well three

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.190 
as a two-player game it works well three
to<00:06:12.250> five<00:06:12.460> at<00:06:12.789> first<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.510> a<00:06:13.539> five<00:06:13.750> player<00:06:13.990> game

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
to five at first and a five player game

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.020 
to five at first and a five player game
I<00:06:14.289> was<00:06:14.410> thinking<00:06:14.680> okay<00:06:15.130> yeah<00:06:15.460> I<00:06:15.490> just<00:06:15.789> deal

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
I was thinking okay yeah I just deal

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.400 
I was thinking okay yeah I just deal
with<00:06:16.090> the<00:06:16.300> guy<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.479> my<00:06:16.630> right<00:06:16.660> deal<00:06:17.169> with<00:06:17.320> the

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
with the guy to my right deal with the

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.930 
with the guy to my right deal with the
guy<00:06:17.530> to<00:06:17.590> my<00:06:17.770> left<00:06:17.800> those<00:06:18.370> are<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:18.610> only<00:06:18.700> people

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
guy to my left those are the only people

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.629 
guy to my left those are the only people
I<00:06:19.150> need<00:06:19.330> to<00:06:19.419> take<00:06:19.630> care<00:06:19.900> of<00:06:19.930> but<00:06:20.680> but<00:06:21.190> those

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
I need to take care of but but those

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.070 
I need to take care of but but those
free<00:06:21.940> agents<00:06:22.270> can<00:06:22.389> be<00:06:22.479> played<00:06:22.660> against<00:06:22.930> any

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
free agents can be played against any

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.080 
free agents can be played against any
players<00:06:23.410> so<00:06:23.650> there's<00:06:23.800> that<00:06:23.950> constant<00:06:24.400> looking

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
players so there's that constant looking

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.260 
players so there's that constant looking
around<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.630> can<00:06:26.560> go<00:06:26.770> four<00:06:27.070> points<00:06:27.490> and<00:06:27.760> that's

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
around I can go four points and that's

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.940 
around I can go four points and that's
one<00:06:28.539> strategy<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.260> try<00:06:29.410> to<00:06:29.500> get<00:06:29.620> any<00:06:29.740> points

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
one strategy to try to get any points

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.650 
one strategy to try to get any points
but<00:06:30.400> if<00:06:30.520> you<00:06:30.610> take<00:06:30.789> no<00:06:30.970> commands<00:06:31.330> and<00:06:31.510> just

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
but if you take no commands and just

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.700 
but if you take no commands and just
give<00:06:31.810> all<00:06:31.900> the<00:06:32.020> commands<00:06:32.260> to<00:06:32.289> your<00:06:32.410> opponent

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
give all the commands to your opponent

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.360 
give all the commands to your opponent
and<00:06:32.770> take<00:06:32.919> points

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
and take points

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.560 
and take points
eventually<00:06:33.760> you'll<00:06:34.000> find<00:06:34.030> that<00:06:34.270> they're<00:06:34.479> the

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
eventually you'll find that they're the

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.969
