compressor<00:01:51.860> connected<00:01:52.280> up<00:01:52.369> witcha<00:01:52.550> but<00:01:52.759> the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
compressor connected up witcha but the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.150 
compressor connected up witcha but the
slip<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.149> quite<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.660> really<00:01:54.500> little<00:01:54.619> piece<00:01:54.950> to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
slip is quite a really little piece to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.550 
slip is quite a really little piece to
have<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.580> we<00:01:55.970> spent<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.300> lot<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.570> time<00:01:56.750> wine<00:01:57.259> than

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
have so we spent a lot of time wine than

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080 
have so we spent a lot of time wine than
I've<00:01:57.679> been<00:01:57.709> getting<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.160> right<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.849> I<00:01:59.000> think

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
I've been getting that right so I think

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.850 
I've been getting that right so I think
I'll<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.450> them<00:01:59.599> had<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.810> gt's<00:02:00.229> particularly

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
I'll of them had the gt's particularly

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.919 
I'll of them had the gt's particularly
so<00:02:01.009> they<00:02:01.310> they<00:02:01.729> had<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.000> Fairmont<00:02:02.450> interior

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
so they they had the Fairmont interior

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.050 
so they they had the Fairmont interior
