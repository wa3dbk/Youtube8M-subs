00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.710
 the las las las the 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.090
 now how about welcome friends are to 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.530
 another video and I hope it's very good 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.260
 wherever you are watching this video 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.340
 at the time you are watching this video 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.890
 it's probably a Saturday they were going to be 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.020
 relaxing at home and as usual 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.010
 they could see we are going to prepare enchiladas 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:34.270
 Swiss green enchiladas and in this 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.489
 Occasion we are going to fill it with tuna 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.650
 can do with other ingredients but 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.300
 I'll be mentioning it and forward 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.300
 for while we go with the ingredients 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.340
 good but let's give an introduction of what 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.070
 Enchiladas are enchiladas 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.560
 an omelet that this then seabream 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.650
 that is golden is covered with some 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.580
 cream with spicy tantito or a 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.460
 sauce and then you fill it with something and 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.320
 it is rolled up that is an enchilada the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 you may be seeing there is very 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.650
 important that you know 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.440
 because if what is explaining them yes 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.020
 what is this boy doing then? 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.160
 I will explain to you more or less what is I 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.160
 I know many more but like 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.479
 This recipe consists of three parts 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.479
 important and the first one is 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.090
 what we are doing here is roasting 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.500
 the chiles to be able to remove the skin 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.160
 when you toast and this 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.160
 it's because the skin is not good according to 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.250
 I understand and so we can 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.100
 remove easily let's hope it gets 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.960
 roast and then we put them in a bag 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.300
 to sweat and then we can 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.560
 skinning is very important to know that 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.880
 sauces can be prepared with 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.880
 any chile but from preference 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.890
 in my case, we do it with a chile 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.260
 that does not sting so much that is the chile chile 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.930
 that give it flavor cited however not 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.630
 he paints the sauce a lot then they are not 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.220
 green enchiladas for which you 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 I recommend that you prepare it with 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.720
 chile poblano only to paint a little 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.420
 more but it's much more peaks then 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.970
 well and more salt to take the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.620
 precautions needed to see what 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.780
 type of chiles you support and so on 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.750
 we have to clean the chile what 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.940
 we remove the seeds cleared the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.769
 veins that you have inside so you do not sting 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.319
 so much good if you want me to explain then 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.459
 There you leave them, we clean them with water 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.459
 let's liquefy 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.430
 and then we made in the container where 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.050
 let's dip the tortillas the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.650
 second important part of our 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.650
 recipe is 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.470
 good 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.890
 and if friends what we should do is 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.800
 to brown the tortillas we did not take anything 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.190
 we really do not let this be 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.190
 much 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.769
 Well, we hope they turn brown 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.410
 and we must discover all this oil 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.800
 so that it is not so greasy 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.790
 with another tortilla we support each other to 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.340
 discover everything 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.060
 this oil 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.060
 and later 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.819
 then we added the sauce and already 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.819
 we put English 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.110
 we drain well and this is the third of 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.110
 the last part 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.630
 well what we should do is simple 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.810
 we only submerge the tortilla 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.880
 in a way that is all covered and 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.350
 for the return to the plate where we have 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.850
 all tortillas do the same 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.850
 process with the others 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.360
 and once we have them then we will 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.360
 we add 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.260
 our fill that in this case to me 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.980
 I really like tuna but you can 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.260
 do with chicken or any other stuffing 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.430
 who want to establish very skinny 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.680
 And finally we decorate it as one 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:55.470
 little bit of cheese up 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.470
 to then heat them in the microwave 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.790
 and that's how our enchiladas look 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.580
 Swiss or green and you take the 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.740
 council of kily poblano others I had 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.170
 to venture to put chile poblano 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.270
 although it is very spicy so that 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.960
 they would see that if it takes a color he cited a 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.460
 little more intense and we're going to try them 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.460
 what tampico is 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.970
 children 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.960
 and that's how enchiladas are prepared 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.520
 Swiss, I understand that those branches 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.280
