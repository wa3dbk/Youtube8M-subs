that's<00:01:07.790> okay<00:01:08.150> your<00:01:08.540> your<00:01:08.950> MacBook<00:01:09.950> will<00:01:10.610> power

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
that's okay your your MacBook will power

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.940 
that's okay your your MacBook will power
through<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.750> USB<00:01:12.020> cable<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:12.740> have<00:01:12.830> to

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
through the USB cable you just have to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.650 
through the USB cable you just have to
make<00:01:13.100> sure<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.430> your<00:01:13.549> settings<00:01:13.820> in<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.450> back

I'll show you how to do that we'll be
able<00:01:20.480> to<00:01:20.630> power<00:01:21.050> up<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.470> get<00:01:22.070> moving<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.370> this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
able to power up and get moving on this

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.840 
able to power up and get moving on this
okay<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:24.710> let's<00:01:25.010> get<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.220> thing<00:01:25.430> plugged<00:01:25.670> in

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
okay so let's get this thing plugged in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.150 
okay so let's get this thing plugged in
we've<00:01:26.210> got<00:01:26.240> our<00:01:26.570> master<00:01:26.930> outputs<00:01:27.350> here<00:01:27.740> we're

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
we've got our master outputs here we're

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.330 
we've got our master outputs here we're
going<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.460> go<00:01:28.700> red<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.020> white<00:01:30.620> pretty<00:01:31.070> basic

so<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.460> got<00:04:02.610> your<00:04:02.700> main<00:04:02.850> output<00:04:03.270> your<00:04:03.390> pre

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
so you got your main output your pre

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.060 
so you got your main output your pre
queuing<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.020> your<00:04:04.140> microphone<00:04:04.440> basically

your headphones your mic and your main

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.690 
your headphones your mic and your main
outputs<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.440> want<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.740> change<00:04:07.980> them<00:04:08.130> click

outputs if you want to change them click
it<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:09.210> can<00:04:09.240> do<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.780> built-in<00:04:10.140> output<00:04:10.560> which

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
it you can do the built-in output which

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500 
it you can do the built-in output which
now<00:04:10.920> switches<00:04:11.370> back<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.880> computer

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
now switches back to the computer

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.260 
now switches back to the computer
if<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.260> don't<00:04:13.500> obviously<00:04:14.430> we<00:04:14.760> want<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.000> spin

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
are all going to work as far as like

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.410 
are all going to work as far as like
your<00:04:38.070> games<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.550> can<00:04:38.700> see<00:04:38.850> your<00:04:38.970> gains<00:04:39.240> that

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
your games you can see your gains that

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.050 
your games you can see your gains that
it<00:04:39.510> actually<00:04:39.840> shows<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.200> your<00:04:40.380> decibel

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
it actually shows you your decibel

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.520 
it actually shows you your decibel
changing<00:04:42.060> as<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.330> goes<00:04:42.570> down<00:04:42.810> from<00:04:43.110> unity

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
changing as it goes down from unity

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.710 
changing as it goes down from unity
there<00:04:43.980> is<00:04:44.190> no<00:04:44.460> notch<00:04:44.730> at<00:04:45.000> unity<00:04:45.390> so<00:04:45.570> when

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
there is no notch at unity so when

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.800 
there is no notch at unity so when
you're<00:04:45.840> at<00:04:45.960> zero<00:04:46.820> you've<00:04:47.820> just<00:04:48.000> got<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.180> watch

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
you're at zero you've just got to watch

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.270 
you're at zero you've just got to watch
your<00:04:49.050> computer<00:04:49.530> here<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.740> make<00:04:49.950> sure<00:04:50.100> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
your computer here and make sure that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.900 
your computer here and make sure that
now<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.410> EQ<00:04:52.410> does<00:04:52.650> have<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.070> notch<00:04:53.250> at<00:04:53.550> zero

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
now the EQ does have the notch at zero

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.900 
now the EQ does have the notch at zero
it<00:04:54.060> has<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.360> unity<00:04:54.720> notch<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.640> you're<00:04:56.640> good<00:04:56.820> to

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
it has the unity notch so you're good to

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.880 
it has the unity notch so you're good to
go<00:04:56.970> on<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.450> that's<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.960> know<00:04:58.080> obviously<00:04:58.530> for

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
go on that that's you know obviously for

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.700 
go on that that's you know obviously for
