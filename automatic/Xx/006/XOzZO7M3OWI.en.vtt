teach you some open shell voicings and

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.560 
teach you some open shell voicings and
closed-shell<00:00:08.540> so<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:10.050> example<00:00:11.000> this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.210> C

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
closed-shell so for example this is C

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.480 
closed-shell so for example this is C
dominant<00:00:13.469> 7<00:00:14.070> right

basic<00:00:15.890> basic<00:00:16.890> chord<00:00:17.510> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:19.400> kind<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
basic basic chord this is kind of the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.509 
basic basic chord this is kind of the
basic<00:00:21.090> shell<00:00:21.890> 1<00:00:22.890> 3<00:00:23.580> 7

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
basic shell 1 3 7

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.460 
basic shell 1 3 7
but<00:00:26.519> what<00:00:26.699> sounds<00:00:26.970> better<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> 1<00:00:27.599> 7<00:00:27.930> 3<00:00:30.470> because

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
but what sounds better is 1 7 3 because

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.610 
but what sounds better is 1 7 3 because
it's<00:00:31.619> more<00:00:31.830> open<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:33.230> have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.440> able<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's more open you have to be able to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's more open you have to be able to
hit<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> tenth<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.250> order<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> play<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.950> if

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
hit a tenth in order to play this but if

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.619 
hit a tenth in order to play this but if
not<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.579> use<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:38.879> hands<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.360> edit

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
not you can just use two hands and edit

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.459 
not you can just use two hands and edit
no<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.140> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
no it up here you know like so I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.740 
no it up here you know like so I
recommend<00:00:44.160> putting<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.000> 12<00:00:45.270> keys<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
recommend putting that in 12 keys and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:56.310 
recommend putting that in 12 keys and
the<00:00:45.809> dominant<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> F<00:00:48.320> B<00:00:49.320> flat<00:00:49.350> E<00:00:50.030> flat<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:52.100> flat

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.569 

then<00:00:57.320> I<00:00:57.440> also<00:00:57.559> recommend<00:00:58.129> doing<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.460> miners

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
then I also recommend doing the miners

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:10.440 
then I also recommend doing the miners
one<00:01:01.300> seven<00:01:01.809> three<00:01:01.989> same<00:01:02.800> format<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.640> majors

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
one seven three same format then majors

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
one seven three same format then majors
so<00:01:11.440> Snoopy<00:01:11.890> flat<00:01:12.130> major

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.830 

yes<00:01:21.820> now<00:01:22.120> let's<00:01:22.510> do<00:01:22.660> two<00:01:22.840> fives<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.740> two<00:01:24.840> five

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
yes now let's do two fives so two five

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.750 
yes now let's do two fives so two five
one<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.480> do<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.720> move<00:01:28.870> one<00:01:29.050> now

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:41.510 

or<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.900> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.260> view<00:01:37.700> or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.500 

it's<00:01:42.520> got<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> nice<00:01:42.820> because<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.150> just<00:01:43.300> have<00:01:43.420> to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
it's got a nice because you just have to

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's got a nice because you just have to
move<00:01:43.630> one<00:01:43.810> note<00:01:44.050> so<00:01:44.260> it's<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.380> I'd

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
move one note so it's or so I'd

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.650 
move one note so it's or so I'd
recommend<00:01:50.590> putting<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.220> two<00:01:51.400> 5s<00:01:51.970> in<00:01:52.150> 12<00:01:52.420> keys

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
recommend putting the two 5s in 12 keys

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.730 
recommend putting the two 5s in 12 keys
so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:10.949 

you<00:01:59.740> can<00:01:59.890> practice<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.369> both<00:02:00.520> ways<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:09.959> yeah

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
you can practice it both ways so or yeah

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.620 
you can practice it both ways so or yeah
so<00:02:11.680> that's<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.280> use<00:02:12.970> those<00:02:13.090> codes<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> lot

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
so that's it I use those codes a lot

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.210 
so that's it I use those codes a lot
it's<00:02:13.930> perfect<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.290> solo<00:02:14.620> piano<00:02:14.860> because

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
it's perfect for solo piano because

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's perfect for solo piano because
you're<00:02:15.340> getting<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.640> bass<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.690> then<00:02:17.200> you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
you're getting the bass and then you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.229 
you're getting the bass and then you
have<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.069> two<00:02:18.250> most<00:02:18.430> important<00:02:18.940> notes

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
have the the two most important notes

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.820 
have the the two most important notes
that<00:02:20.110> form<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> tritone<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:23.170> know<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.620> it's

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
that form the tritone you know and it's

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.160 
that form the tritone you know and it's
nice<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.220> open<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.989> just

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
