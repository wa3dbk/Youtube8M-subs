I'm not going to put it on this mail yet

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.980 
I'm not going to put it on this mail yet
because<00:04:32.669> you<00:04:32.819> do<00:04:33.000> have<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.330> let<00:04:33.509> that<00:04:33.539> glitter

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
because you do have to let that glitter

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.080 
because you do have to let that glitter
dry<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> little<00:04:34.590> bit<00:04:34.860> otherwise<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.970> will<00:04:36.030> just

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
dry a little bit otherwise it will just

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.020 
dry a little bit otherwise it will just
sort<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.539> kind<00:04:36.900> of<00:04:36.960> Smosh<00:04:37.590> around<00:04:37.949> but<00:04:38.819> I<00:04:38.849> will

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
sort of kind of Smosh around but I will

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.490 
sort of kind of Smosh around but I will
put<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.270> little<00:04:39.389> top<00:04:39.630> coat<00:04:39.870> here<00:04:40.080> on<00:04:40.169> one<00:04:40.319> of<00:04:40.410> my

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
put a little top coat here on one of my

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.379 
put a little top coat here on one of my
other<00:04:40.620> nails<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.430> would<00:04:41.639> say<00:04:41.819> that<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.180> top

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
other nails and I would say that the top

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.730 
other nails and I would say that the top
coat<00:04:42.660> actually<00:04:43.110> will<00:04:43.289> help<00:04:43.590> enhance<00:04:44.449> the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
coat actually will help enhance the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.680 
coat actually will help enhance the
sparkle<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:46.949> your<00:04:47.340> glitter<00:04:47.669> more<00:04:48.330> than<00:04:48.539> it

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
sparkle of your glitter more than it

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.620 
sparkle of your glitter more than it
would<00:04:48.930> dull<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.860> because<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.400> really<00:04:50.789> because

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
would dull it because it really because

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.570 
would dull it because it really because
the<00:04:51.750> top<00:04:51.960> coat<00:04:52.169> adds<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.500> shine<00:04:52.800> on<00:04:52.830> top<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.460> it

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
the top coat adds a shine on top of it

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.670 
the top coat adds a shine on top of it
it<00:04:53.970> really<00:04:54.180> does<00:04:54.449> enhance<00:04:54.599> that<00:04:55.020> glitter<00:04:55.320> so

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
it really does enhance that glitter so

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.969 
it really does enhance that glitter so
it<00:04:55.800> looks<00:04:55.979> pretty<00:04:56.190> pretty<00:04:56.759> good<00:04:57.199> but<00:04:58.199> that's

it<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.639> one<00:04:59.849> is<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> really<00:05:00.599> easy<00:05:00.780> little

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110
