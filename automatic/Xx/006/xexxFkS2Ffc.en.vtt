00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.100
 For centuries 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.870
 Ai Lun is like the tower of hope of the Republic 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.240
 Until the advent of the empire 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.140
 Under a brutal attack... 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.060
 I beat Ai Lun. 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.500
 Time is running out now 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200
 And only a few people stayed to face the enemy in front of them. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.600
 For those of us survivors 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 We only have one choice 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.600
 We must fight 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.190
 In order to win, to follow 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.780
 Fight for the Republic! 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.700
 - Let's go! - Advance! 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.200
 Flanking fast 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.150
 Even knowing that there will be serious sacrifices... 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.620
 We continue to struggle forward 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.210
 A little courage... 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.350
 Can also ignite the fire of hope 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.700
 And bring peace to the entire galaxy 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:30.701
 Star Wars: Old Republic
