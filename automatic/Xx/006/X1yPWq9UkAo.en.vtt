that are independent of any other
operating<00:01:10.400> system<00:01:10.790> right<00:01:10.940> they<00:01:11.180> are<00:01:11.330> just

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
operating system right they are just

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.350 
operating system right they are just
their<00:01:11.720> own<00:01:11.810> bed

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

Samantha<00:01:14.600> mark<00:01:15.600> device<00:01:16.170> yeah<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.190> you<00:01:17.370> can

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
Samantha mark device yeah but you can

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.270 
Samantha mark device yeah but you can
use<00:01:17.730> a<00:01:17.760> SmartWatch<00:01:18.510> math<00:01:19.260> homework<00:01:19.710> android

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
use a SmartWatch math homework android

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.180 
use a SmartWatch math homework android
for<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:20.730> iphone<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
for an iphone and use it that way to

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.850 
for an iphone and use it that way to
reach<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> crowd<00:01:23.940> system<00:01:24.510> so<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.680> have

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
reach the crowd system so you don't have

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.000 
reach the crowd system so you don't have
any<00:01:26.010> now<00:01:26.340> installing<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.300> smartphone<00:01:27.870> you<00:01:28.830> use

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
any now installing a smartphone you use

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.310 
any now installing a smartphone you use
only<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> petricka<00:01:29.940> villages<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.840> lettering

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
only the petricka villages so lettering

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.830 
only the petricka villages so lettering
on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> house

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.520 

so<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.050> example<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.830> Michael

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
so for example this is Michael

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.800 
so for example this is Michael
would<00:01:38.710> be<00:01:38.860> impossible<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.520> me<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:40.060> insert<00:01:40.450> such

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
would be impossible to me to insert such

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.370 
would be impossible to me to insert such
kind<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.350> information<00:01:42.600> into<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.630> SmartWatch

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
kind of information into the SmartWatch
