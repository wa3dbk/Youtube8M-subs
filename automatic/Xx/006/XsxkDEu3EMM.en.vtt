00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
in multiplayer there is a level called

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.029 
in multiplayer there is a level called
library<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.539> basically<00:00:25.080> there<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.769> couple

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
library and basically there are a couple

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.650 
library and basically there are a couple
of<00:00:26.160> places<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
of places you can get to the way you

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.269 
of places you can get to the way you
look<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.080> moment<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.980> top<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.189> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
look at the moment is the top of that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.400 
look at the moment is the top of that
clock<00:00:29.720> basically<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> way<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.050> into<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
clock basically the way you get into it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.680 
clock basically the way you get into it
is<00:00:31.590> through<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> secret<00:00:32.520> kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> hidden

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
is through a secret kind of hidden

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
is through a secret kind of hidden
bookshelf<00:00:34.200> sort<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.190> entrance<00:00:35.550> there's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
bookshelf sort of entrance there's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000 
bookshelf sort of entrance there's
basically<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.750> book<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.170> poking<00:00:37.950> out

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
basically like a book this poking out

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.369 
basically like a book this poking out
slightly<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:39.000> interact<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
slightly you interact with it and it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
slightly you interact with it and it
opens<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.910> first<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
opens up so this first one here this is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240 
opens up so this first one here this is
how<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> behind<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> clockface

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
how you get to the behind the clockface

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.580 
how you get to the behind the clockface
and<00:00:44.700> typically<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.539> go<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:45.989> there

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and typically if you go up there there

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
and typically if you go up there there
is<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.980> sniper<00:00:47.219> rifle<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> obviously

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is a sniper rifle is there and obviously

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.630 
is a sniper rifle is there and obviously
where<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.110> where<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.469> stand<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:50.340> gives<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
where you where you stand it gives you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.779 
where you where you stand it gives you
kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> sight<00:00:51.780> lines<00:00:51.960> over<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> entire<00:00:52.789> kind

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
kind of sight lines over the entire kind

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.520 
kind of sight lines over the entire kind
of<00:00:53.879> walk<00:00:54.570> away<00:00:54.750> down<00:00:54.989> below<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.500> all

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of walk away down below that's got all

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
of walk away down below that's got all
the<00:00:55.680> other<00:00:55.949> bookshelves<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.670> things<00:00:56.760> like

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the other bookshelves in all things like

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.459 
the other bookshelves in all things like
that<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.809> you've<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> sniper<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.440> there

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that so if you've got a sniper up there

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.049 
that so if you've got a sniper up there
then<00:00:59.010> you've<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> good<00:00:59.489> sword<00:00:59.789> line<00:00:59.940> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
then you've got a good sword line of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.720 
then you've got a good sword line of
sight<00:01:00.210> over<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> enemies<00:01:00.690> below

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
sight over all the enemies below

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.500 
sight over all the enemies below
obviously<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> buscar<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
obviously there's a buscar there at the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.539 
obviously there's a buscar there at the
moment<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.899> I've<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
moment because I've just got that is the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.980 
moment because I've just got that is the
weapon<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> spawn<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.780> yeah<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
weapon to spawn there but yeah it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.200 
weapon to spawn there but yeah it
typically<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> sniper<00:01:07.650> rifle<00:01:07.939> you<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.060> also

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
typically is a sniper rifle you do also

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.969 
typically is a sniper rifle you do also
have<00:01:09.299> view<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> side<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.650> well<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> your

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
have view to the side as well on your

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.679 
have view to the side as well on your
left<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.570> see

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
left so you can see you can see

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.570 
left so you can see you can see
basically<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.350> two<00:01:13.500> rooms<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
basically down there's two rooms so you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.370 
basically down there's two rooms so you
know<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.090> trying<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.570> catch

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
know if you're trying to kind of catch

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
know if you're trying to kind of catch
someone<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.549> probably<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.820> good

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
someone out then it's probably a good

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.420 
someone out then it's probably a good
way<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.200> another<00:01:19.380> way<00:01:19.619> this

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
way to go there is also another way this

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.620 
way to go there is also another way this
is<00:01:20.640> probably<00:01:20.820> better<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.150> you're<00:01:21.360> being

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
is probably better if you're being

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.499 
is probably better if you're being
pinned<00:01:21.840> down<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.110> area<00:01:23.060> again<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
pinned down in this area again from the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.789 
pinned down in this area again from the
middle<00:01:24.720> walkway<00:01:24.840> where<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> bookshelves<00:01:25.619> are

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
middle walkway where the bookshelves are

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.429 
middle walkway where the bookshelves are
if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.310> open<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.640> door<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.290> go

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
if you open this door and then you go

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.230 
if you open this door and then you go
around<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.520> isn't<00:01:29.729> quite<00:01:29.759> sort<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> as

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
around this one isn't quite sort of as

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
around this one isn't quite sort of as
long<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.900> come<00:01:31.770> out<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> other<00:01:31.979> side<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
long but come out the other side and it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
long but come out the other side and it
brings<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.880> into<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.439> room<00:01:34.619> that's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
brings you into kind of the room that's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.819 
brings you into kind of the room that's
just<00:01:35.100> before<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.549> walkway<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.770> where<00:01:37.770> this

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
just before that walkway so where this

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.710 
just before that walkway so where this
orbit<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> mile<00:01:38.280> creek<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> see

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
orbit a mile creek so if you kind of see

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
orbit a mile creek so if you kind of see
where<00:01:39.869> you've<00:01:40.020> gone<00:01:40.140> full<00:01:40.590> circle<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.100> if

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
where you've gone full circle there if

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.039 
where you've gone full circle there if
for<00:01:41.640> example<00:01:41.729> I'll<00:01:42.420> say<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.720> were<00:01:42.930> being

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
for example I'll say you were being

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469 
for example I'll say you were being
pinned<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.350> by<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> enemy<00:01:44.369> team<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
pinned down by the enemy team then you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.760 
pinned down by the enemy team then you
can<00:01:45.600> run<00:01:45.780> around<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.619> drop<00:01:46.710> on
