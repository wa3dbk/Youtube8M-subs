so<00:00:03.139> continuing<00:00:03.650> with<00:00:03.860> our<00:00:04.069> dirt<00:00:04.370> coverage<00:00:04.880> I

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
so continuing with our dirt coverage I

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.210 
so continuing with our dirt coverage I
obviously<00:00:06.050> had<00:00:06.350> a<00:00:06.410> couple<00:00:06.620> of<00:00:06.710> runs<00:00:06.950> there

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
obviously had a couple of runs there

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.789 
obviously had a couple of runs there
looking<00:00:07.550> at<00:00:07.610> the<00:00:07.730> different<00:00:08.090> views<00:00:08.780> now<00:00:09.469> we<00:00:09.530> go

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799 
looking at the different views now we go

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.499 
looking at the different views now we go
on<00:00:09.829> to<00:00:10.039> a<00:00:10.070> clean<00:00:10.400> run<00:00:10.669> obviously<00:00:10.910> I<00:00:11.119> go<00:00:11.299> back<00:00:11.450> to

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
on to a clean run obviously I go back to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:12.850 
on to a clean run obviously I go back to
my<00:00:11.599> bonnet<00:00:12.019> view<00:00:12.200> which<00:00:12.379> is<00:00:12.499> why<00:00:12.650> most

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
my bonnet view which is why most

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.770 
my bonnet view which is why most
comfortable<00:00:13.490> along<00:00:14.299> with<00:00:14.419> a<00:00:14.480> couple<00:00:14.690> of

comfortable along with a couple of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.200 
comfortable along with a couple of
replays<00:00:15.259> so<00:00:15.679> check<00:00:16.219> this<00:00:16.369> is<00:00:16.580> how<00:00:16.760> much<00:00:16.910> in<00:00:17.180> a

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
replays so check this is how much in a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.179 
replays so check this is how much in a
constant<00:00:17.630> rate<00:00:17.779> for<00:00:17.960> a<00:00:17.990> moment<00:00:18.170> see<00:00:18.560> if<00:00:18.650> I<00:00:18.769> can

constant rate for a moment see if I can

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
of these services you know the wrapping

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.489 
of these services you know the wrapping
is<00:01:22.280> going<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.520> be<00:01:22.609> a<00:01:22.640> bit<00:01:22.789> looser<00:01:23.319> cars<00:01:24.319> going

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
is going to be a bit looser cars going

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.470 

I've<00:01:35.689> got<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:35.930> bit<00:01:36.080> wide

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
I've got a bit wide

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.430 

right<00:01:47.150> until<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.690> have<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.870> tall<00:01:48.260> man

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.770 
right until we have the tall man
balancing<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.100> car

city corner here when we go to the
bridge<00:01:52.720> isn't<00:01:53.720> about<00:01:53.930> making<00:01:54.140> around<00:01:54.590> there

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
bridge isn't about making around there

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.490 
bridge isn't about making around there
that's<00:01:54.979> probably<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.369> handbrake<00:01:55.790> turn<00:01:56.119> but<00:01:56.500> we

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
that's probably a handbrake turn but we

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.460 
that's probably a handbrake turn but we
managed<00:01:57.860> it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.620 

just<00:02:04.830> over<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.250> finish<00:02:05.400> line<00:02:05.550> have<00:02:06.300> a<00:02:06.330> clean

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
just over the finish line have a clean

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.710 
just over the finish line have a clean

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
section there to go okay so a clean

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.560 
section there to go okay so a clean
section<00:02:10.320> then<00:02:10.560> much<00:02:11.400> better<00:02:11.670> obviously<00:02:12.150> bags

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
section then much better obviously bags

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.360

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
of time to find there you know I wasn't

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.310 
of time to find there you know I wasn't
getting<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.030> car<00:02:15.210> into<00:02:15.390> some<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.750> apex<00:02:16.110> is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
getting a car into some of the apex is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.660 
getting a car into some of the apex is
it<00:02:16.500> wasn't<00:02:16.710> on<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> power<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.370> should<00:02:17.550> have

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it wasn't on the power and I should have

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.910 
it wasn't on the power and I should have
been<00:02:17.850> all<00:02:18.060> sensitive<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.690> some<00:02:18.930> areas<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.710> car

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
been all sensitive on some areas the car

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.980 
been all sensitive on some areas the car
at<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.100> moment<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:21.090> very<00:02:21.480> twitchy<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
at the moment is very twitchy on the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.050 
at the moment is very twitchy on the
front<00:02:22.200> end<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.980> kind<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.340> all<00:02:23.730> over<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
front end and you kind of all over the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.030 
front end and you kind of all over the
place<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.360> bit<00:02:24.600> with<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.020> there<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.650> say<00:02:25.890> it's

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
place a bit with it and there I say it's

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.250 
place a bit with it and there I say it's
because<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> power<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> car<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.900> my

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
because of the power of the car it's my

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.380 
because of the power of the car it's my
oversensitivity<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> pad<00:02:29.460> but<00:02:29.670> also<00:02:29.790> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
oversensitivity with a pad but also you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.820 
oversensitivity with a pad but also you
know<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> say<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> very<00:02:31.440> early

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
know like I say this is a very early

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.980 
know like I say this is a very early
version<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.460> it's<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.820> representative<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
version so it's not representative of

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.240 
version so it's not representative of
the<00:02:34.140> final<00:02:34.500> build<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.920> guys<00:02:35.100> are

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the final build that you guys are

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.770 
the final build that you guys are
actually<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.670> play<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.090> initial<00:02:36.660> my

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
and downs as I learned that mode it's

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.980 
and downs as I learned that mode it's
certainly<00:06:32.979> very<00:06:33.070> challenging<00:06:33.789> and<00:06:33.940> will<00:06:34.780> take

certainly very challenging and will take

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.620 
certainly very challenging and will take
a<00:06:35.020> lot<00:06:35.770> of<00:06:35.830> time<00:06:35.949> to<00:06:36.250> learn<00:06:36.280> but<00:06:36.669> check<00:06:37.300> out<00:06:37.449> my

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
a lot of time to learn but check out my
