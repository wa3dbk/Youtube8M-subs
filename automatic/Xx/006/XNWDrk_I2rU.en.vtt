most<00:00:15.640> Prolotherapy<00:00:16.640> doctors<00:00:17.060> including

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
most Prolotherapy doctors including

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.929 
most Prolotherapy doctors including
myself<00:00:17.630> don't<00:00:18.109> like<00:00:18.589> fusion<00:00:19.039> operations

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
myself don't like fusion operations

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.730 
myself don't like fusion operations
whether<00:00:20.150> it's<00:00:20.359> ankle<00:00:20.779> fusion<00:00:21.050> low<00:00:21.500> back

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
whether it's ankle fusion low back

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.700 
whether it's ankle fusion low back
fusion<00:00:22.460> neck<00:00:22.699> fusion<00:00:23.269> the<00:00:23.900> reason<00:00:24.320> being<00:00:24.529> is

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
fusion neck fusion the reason being is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.489 
fusion neck fusion the reason being is
it<00:00:24.890> doesn't<00:00:25.279> really<00:00:25.550> correct<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.240> underlying

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 
it doesn't really correct the underlying

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.050 
it doesn't really correct the underlying
problem<00:00:27.499> so<00:00:27.679> let's<00:00:27.859> say<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.669> underlying

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
problem so let's say the underlying

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.280 
problem so let's say the underlying
problem<00:00:29.599> is<00:00:29.749> lumbar<00:00:30.339> instability<00:00:31.339> or<00:00:31.369> neck

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
problem is lumbar instability or neck

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.799 
problem is lumbar instability or neck
instability<00:00:33.290> because<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:33.829> ligament<00:00:34.160> injury

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
instability because of a ligament injury

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.479 
instability because of a ligament injury
people<00:00:35.809> sometimes<00:00:36.320> forget<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:36.739> mean<00:00:37.039> by

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
people sometimes forget I mean by

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.250 
people sometimes forget I mean by
definition<00:00:38.000> fusion<00:00:38.719> means<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.170> they're

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
definition fusion means that they're

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.049 
definition fusion means that they're
going<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.440> fuse<00:00:39.710> some<00:00:39.949> bones<00:00:40.190> together<00:00:40.520> well

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
going to fuse some bones together well

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.760 
going to fuse some bones together well
if<00:00:41.420> you're<00:00:41.629> going<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.809> fuse<00:00:42.109> a<00:00:42.140> couple<00:00:42.590> bones

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
if you're going to fuse a couple bones

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.389 
if you're going to fuse a couple bones
together<00:00:43.100> then<00:00:43.579> where<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.010> motion<00:00:46.010> gonna

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
together then where is the motion gonna

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.250 
together then where is the motion gonna
come<00:00:46.670> from<00:00:46.850> where's<00:00:47.180> your<00:00:47.359> low<00:00:47.510> back<00:00:47.780> or<00:00:47.809> neck

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
come from where's your low back or neck

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.259 
come from where's your low back or neck
motion<00:00:48.710> gonna<00:00:48.890> come<00:00:49.190> from<00:00:49.399> after<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.969> fusion

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
motion gonna come from after the fusion

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.020 
motion gonna come from after the fusion
it's<00:00:50.539> gonna<00:00:50.660> come<00:00:50.989> from<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:52.010> vertebrae<00:00:52.640> above

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
it's gonna come from the vertebrae above

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.299 
it's gonna come from the vertebrae above
the<00:00:53.600> fusion<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.140> below<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.620> fusion<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.190> all

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
the fusion and below the fusion so all

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.340 
the fusion and below the fusion so all
the<00:00:55.489> fusion<00:00:55.969> operation<00:00:56.690> does<00:00:56.989> is<00:00:57.230> delay<00:00:59.350> it

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
the fusion operation does is delay it

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.669 
the fusion operation does is delay it
delays<00:01:00.949> a<00:01:00.980> little<00:01:01.429> bit<00:01:01.609> in<00:01:01.879> pain<00:01:02.269> because

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
delays a little bit in pain because

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.420 
delays a little bit in pain because
eventually<00:01:03.679> you're<00:01:03.800> gonna<00:01:03.920> end<00:01:04.250> up<00:01:04.370> having

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
eventually you're gonna end up having

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.600 
eventually you're gonna end up having
pain<00:01:05.059> in<00:01:05.239> other<00:01:05.390> vertebral<00:01:06.260> segments<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.070> you

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
pain in other vertebral segments so you

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.050 
pain in other vertebral segments so you
might<00:01:07.820> have<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.480> lot<00:01:08.690> of<00:01:08.750> pain<00:01:09.080> in<00:01:09.110> l5<00:01:09.740> s1<00:01:10.190> then

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
might have a lot of pain in l5 s1 then

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.640 
might have a lot of pain in l5 s1 then
the<00:01:11.240> doctor<00:01:11.570> says<00:01:11.780> they're<00:01:11.930> gonna<00:01:12.020> fuse<00:01:12.410> that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the doctor says they're gonna fuse that

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.400 
the doctor says they're gonna fuse that
area<00:01:13.160> well<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:14.030> get<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.360> fusion<00:01:14.630> operation

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
area well you get the fusion operation

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.810 
area well you get the fusion operation
and<00:01:15.500> all<00:01:15.590> that's<00:01:15.770> going<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.980> happen<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> few

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
and all that's going to happen is a few

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.880 
and all that's going to happen is a few
years<00:01:16.850> down<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.540> line<00:01:17.570> you're<00:01:18.410> gonna<00:01:18.560> have

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
years down the line you're gonna have

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.200 
years down the line you're gonna have
pain<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.670> your<00:01:19.790> sacroiliac<00:01:20.540> joints<00:01:21.170> or<00:01:21.320> the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
pain and your sacroiliac joints or the

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.210 
pain and your sacroiliac joints or the
segments<00:01:23.210> above<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.650> have<00:01:24.770> an<00:01:24.890> ankle

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
segments above it you have an ankle

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.710 
segments above it you have an ankle
fusion<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:26.060> know<00:01:26.150> you're<00:01:26.270> gonna<00:01:26.360> end<00:01:26.600> up

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
fusion you know you're gonna end up

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.590 
fusion you know you're gonna end up
having<00:01:26.780> pain<00:01:27.620> in<00:01:27.650> your<00:01:27.950> foot<00:01:28.250> above<00:01:28.820> below<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
having pain in your foot above below the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.400 
having pain in your foot above below the
fusion<00:01:30.050> or<00:01:30.170> in<00:01:30.350> your<00:01:30.590> knee<00:01:31.330> above<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.930> fusion

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
fusion or in your knee above the fusion

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.320 
fusion or in your knee above the fusion
so<00:01:33.620> it's<00:01:34.070> not<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.610> doesn't<00:01:34.910> really<00:01:35.000> correct

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
so it's not it doesn't really correct

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.730 
so it's not it doesn't really correct
the<00:01:35.510> underlying<00:01:35.660> problem

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
the underlying problem

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.190 
the underlying problem
what<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.400> need<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.960> stabilization<00:01:38.960> but<00:01:39.110> you

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
what you need is stabilization but you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.440 
what you need is stabilization but you
need<00:01:39.350> stabilization<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.430> basically<00:01:41.240> that

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
need stabilization of basically that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.840 
need stabilization of basically that
whole<00:01:41.720> area<00:01:42.230> so<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.650> best<00:01:42.860> treatment<00:01:43.400> if

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
whole area so the best treatment if

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.570 
whole area so the best treatment if
you're<00:01:44.090> having<00:01:44.300> lumbar<00:01:45.080> instability<00:01:46.040> low

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
you're having lumbar instability low

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.820 
you're having lumbar instability low
back<00:01:46.820> pain<00:01:47.210> neck<00:01:47.540> pain<00:01:47.600> from<00:01:48.350> cervical

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
back pain neck pain from cervical

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.040 
back pain neck pain from cervical
instability<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.700> need<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.150> get<00:01:50.300> Prolotherapy

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
instability you need to get Prolotherapy

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.550 
instability you need to get Prolotherapy
because<00:01:51.350> Prolotherapy<00:01:52.070> can<00:01:52.760> stabilize<00:01:53.630> those

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
because Prolotherapy can stabilize those

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.640 
because Prolotherapy can stabilize those
segments<00:01:55.280> without<00:01:55.610> totally<00:01:56.510> eliminating<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
segments without totally eliminating the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.160 
segments without totally eliminating the
motion<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.220> still<00:01:58.490> got<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.820> have<00:01:58.970> some<00:01:59.840> motion

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
motion you still got to have some motion

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.470 
motion you still got to have some motion
in<00:02:00.500> your<00:02:00.620> neck<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.070> lower<00:02:01.250> back<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.910> function

Prolotherapy<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> much<00:02:10.069> better<00:02:10.340> option

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
Prolotherapy is a much better option

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.440 
Prolotherapy is a much better option

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.640 
fusion
cervical<00:02:16.520> fusion<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.330> you'll<00:02:17.900> stabilise

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
cervical fusion because you'll stabilise

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.520

arthritis on the x-ray maybe just mainly
in<00:02:46.100> one<00:02:46.340> segment<00:02:46.700> trust<00:02:47.270> me

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
in one segment trust me

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.660 
in one segment trust me
you<00:02:48.050> know<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.380> segment's<00:02:48.860> above<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.370> below

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
you know the segment's above and below

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.940 
you know the segment's above and below
it<00:02:49.700> are<00:02:49.910> also<00:02:50.090> affected<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.050> with<00:02:51.260> pro<00:02:51.500> therapy

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
it are also affected so with pro therapy

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.430 
it are also affected so with pro therapy
we<00:02:52.130> can<00:02:52.160> do<00:02:52.460> all<00:02:52.670> those<00:02:52.910> segments<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:53.870> that's

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
we can do all those segments so that's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.800 
we can do all those segments so that's
