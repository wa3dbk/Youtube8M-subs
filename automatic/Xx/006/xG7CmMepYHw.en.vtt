00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
hi welcome back to my photo tutor to

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.150 
hi welcome back to my photo tutor to
series<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.420> tutorials<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.200> using<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.800> digital

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
series of tutorials on using the digital

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.549 
series of tutorials on using the digital
SLR<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.880> today<00:00:12.600> we're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:13.050> to<00:00:13.140> be<00:00:13.260> looking

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
SLR and today we're going to be looking

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.000 
SLR and today we're going to be looking
at<00:00:13.740> how<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> use<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.510> of<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.019> other<00:00:16.260> modes

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
at how to use some of the other modes

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.980 
at how to use some of the other modes
that<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.449> remember<00:00:18.840> there

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
that we have on this you remember there

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.010 
that we have on this you remember there
in<00:00:19.410> our<00:00:19.710> previous<00:00:20.480> tutorial<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.600> were<00:00:21.750> looking

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
in our previous tutorial we were looking

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.990 
in our previous tutorial we were looking
at<00:00:22.140> using<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.740> fully<00:00:23.039> programmed<00:00:23.610> where

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
at using it on fully programmed where

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.330 
at using it on fully programmed where
you<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.440> anything<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.920> let<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
you don't really do anything you let the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.580 
you don't really do anything you let the
camera<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.850> it<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.020> time<00:00:28.410> we're

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
camera do it all but this time we're

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.070 
camera do it all but this time we're
going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.830> look<00:00:29.100> at<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.180> three<00:00:30.449> other<00:00:30.720> modes

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
going to look at the three other modes

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.520 
going to look at the three other modes
that<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:32.030> giving<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.210> control<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.050> then

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
that are giving you control and then

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.049 
that are giving you control and then
we'll<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.829> focusing<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.670> them<00:00:35.910> so

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we'll be focusing on one of them so

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.490 
we'll be focusing on one of them so
we're<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> look<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> modes<00:00:37.230> where

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
we're going to look at the modes where

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.549 
we're going to look at the modes where
it<00:00:37.620> says<00:00:37.829> M<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:39.410> might<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.739> V<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:42.300> TV<00:00:43.260> or

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it says M a might be a V and then TV or

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.360 
it says M a might be a V and then TV or
on<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.250> cameras<00:00:44.700> s<00:00:45.170> okay<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> might<00:00:46.800> say<00:00:47.040> M

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
on some cameras s okay so it might say M

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.430 
on some cameras s okay so it might say M
which<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.230> manual<00:00:49.230> mode<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:50.040> gives<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
which is manual mode which gives you the

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
which is manual mode which gives you the
total<00:00:52.440> control<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> camera<00:00:53.430> you're

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
total control of the camera you're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
total control of the camera you're
deciding<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.690> shutter<00:00:55.020> speed<00:00:55.350> you're

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
deciding what shutter speed you're

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
deciding what shutter speed you're
deciding<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:57.030> aperture<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.200> use<00:00:58.440> I'll

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
deciding what aperture to use I'll

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.939 
deciding what aperture to use I'll
explain<00:00:59.190> aperture<00:00:59.640> again<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.239> moment

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
explain aperture again in just a moment

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.389 
explain aperture again in just a moment
then<00:01:01.949> we've<00:01:02.100> got<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> V<00:01:02.579> or<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
then we've got a V or just a and that is

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.660 
then we've got a V or just a and that is
the<00:01:05.640> aperture<00:01:06.509> priority<00:01:07.170> mode<00:01:07.679> an<00:01:08.039> aperture

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the aperture priority mode an aperture

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
the aperture priority mode an aperture
priority<00:01:08.939> simply<00:01:09.479> means<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.259> choose

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
priority simply means that you choose

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.609 
priority simply means that you choose
the<00:01:11.189> aperture<00:01:11.459> your<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.179> the<00:01:12.689> priority<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the aperture your so you the priority is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
the aperture your so you the priority is
given<00:01:14.579> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.969> aperture<00:01:15.389> you<00:01:15.659> control<00:01:16.139> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
given to the aperture you control that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.519 
given to the aperture you control that
and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.429> camera<00:01:18.060> decides<00:01:18.509> what<00:01:19.200> shutter

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:19.529 
and then the camera decides what shutter

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:21.980 
and then the camera decides what shutter
speed<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.490> needed<00:01:20.819> to<00:01:21.389> get<00:01:21.539> the<00:01:21.599> correct

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
speed is needed to get the correct

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.129 
speed is needed to get the correct
exposure<00:01:22.549> okay<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.539> we're<00:01:24.810> coming<00:01:24.899> back

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
exposure okay and then we're coming back

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:26.839 
exposure okay and then we're coming back
to<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.469> in<00:01:25.499> just<00:01:25.709> a<00:01:25.770> moment<00:01:26.130> then<00:01:26.579> you<00:01:26.700> go

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:26.849 
to that one in just a moment then you go

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:28.760 
to that one in just a moment then you go
to<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.179> next<00:01:27.359> one<00:01:27.509> which<00:01:27.630> might<00:01:27.869> say<00:01:28.139> s<00:01:28.380> on

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to the next one which might say s on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.219 
to the next one which might say s on
your<00:01:29.009> camera<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.459> it<00:01:29.609> might<00:01:29.789> say<00:01:30.029> TV<00:01:30.599> they're

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
your camera or it might say TV they're

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
your camera or it might say TV they're
both<00:01:31.499> the<00:01:31.709> same<00:01:31.740> thing<00:01:32.219> I<00:01:32.429> won't<00:01:32.729> bore<00:01:33.029> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
both the same thing I won't bore you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
both the same thing I won't bore you
with<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.419> details<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.959> why<00:01:34.200> they<00:01:34.409> call<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.619> TV

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
with the details of why they call it TV

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.510 
with the details of why they call it TV
but<00:01:35.639> this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.959> shutter<00:01:37.499> priority<00:01:38.039> mode

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
but this is the shutter priority mode

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.059 
but this is the shutter priority mode
and<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.719> is<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> opposite<00:01:40.499> of<00:01:40.590> aperture

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
and so this is the opposite of aperture

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.399 
and so this is the opposite of aperture
in<00:01:41.399> that<00:01:41.849> the<00:01:42.240> priority<00:01:42.779> is<00:01:42.959> given<00:01:43.109> to<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
in that the priority is given to the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.099 
in that the priority is given to the
shutter<00:01:43.619> speed<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.669> decide<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.840> shutter

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
shutter speed you decide what shutter

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.389 
shutter speed you decide what shutter
speed<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.499> use<00:01:46.919> for<00:01:47.549> example<00:01:48.179> one<00:01:49.099> 250th<00:01:50.099> of<00:01:50.279> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
speed to use for example one 250th of a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.050 
speed to use for example one 250th of a
second<00:01:50.819> and<00:01:51.349> the<00:01:52.349> camera<00:01:52.889> will<00:01:53.039> decide<00:01:53.399> what

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
second and the camera will decide what

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
second and the camera will decide what
aperture<00:01:54.749> is<00:01:54.959> needed<00:01:55.679> to<00:01:55.829> give<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.099> correct

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
aperture is needed to give the correct

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.209 
aperture is needed to give the correct
exposure<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.389> that<00:01:57.539> photo<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.829> we'll<00:01:59.009> talk

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
exposure for that photo now we'll talk

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.510 
exposure for that photo now we'll talk
more<00:01:59.609> about<00:01:59.669> the<00:02:00.419> shutter<00:02:00.929> priority<00:02:01.139> in<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
more about the shutter priority in the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.669 
more about the shutter priority in the
next<00:02:02.880> tutorial<00:02:03.419> in<00:02:03.569> this<00:02:03.959> one<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.349> going<00:02:04.499> to

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
next tutorial in this one we're going to

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.609 
next tutorial in this one we're going to
look<00:02:04.859> at<00:02:05.039> a<00:02:05.279> or<00:02:05.849> a<00:02:06.270> V<00:02:06.569> which<00:02:06.929> is<00:02:07.079> aperture

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
look at a or a V which is aperture

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.339 
look at a or a V which is aperture
priority<00:02:08.209> before<00:02:09.209> before<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> we

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
priority before before we do that we

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.920 
priority before before we do that we
need<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.530> say<00:02:10.800> what<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:12.120> aperture

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
need to say what is the aperture

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.319 
need to say what is the aperture
that<00:02:13.079> the<00:02:13.200> aperture<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.459> like<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.849> iris

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
that the aperture is just like the iris

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.130 
that the aperture is just like the iris
of<00:02:15.510> your<00:02:15.780> eye

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
of your eye

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.069 
of your eye
okay<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.609> iris<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.299> your<00:02:18.359> eye<00:02:18.510> which<00:02:18.959> of

is<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> black<00:02:20.609> hole<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.390> opens<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.260> closes

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
is a black hole and it opens and closes

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770 
is a black hole and it opens and closes
if<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.459> look<00:02:23.730> at<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.939> bright<00:02:24.180> light

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
if you look at a bright light

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.990 
if you look at a bright light
the<00:02:25.230> iris<00:02:25.620> closes<00:02:26.310> down<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> very

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the iris closes down you get a very

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.649 
the iris closes down you get a very

chim on the camera allowing a little bit
of<00:02:33.090> light<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.299> go<00:02:33.510> through<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:34.379> if<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.739> go

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
of light to go through but if you go

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.459 
of light to go through but if you go
into<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.129> dark<00:02:35.489> room<00:02:35.639> it<00:02:36.239> opens<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.290> allow

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
into a dark room it opens up to allow

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.170 
into a dark room it opens up to allow
more<00:02:37.829> light<00:02:37.889> through<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.519> that's<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
more light through and that's what the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.599 
more light through and that's what the
aperture<00:02:39.659> is<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.930> your<00:02:40.049> camera<00:02:40.379> okay<00:02:40.859> works<00:02:41.430> in

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
aperture is on your camera okay works in

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.119 
aperture is on your camera okay works in
exactly<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.150> same<00:02:42.359> way<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.530> you're<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.099> a

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
exactly the same way so if you're in a

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.379 
exactly the same way so if you're in a
darker<00:02:44.609> area<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.299> need<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> wider<00:02:46.109> aperture

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
darker area you need a wider aperture

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.500 
darker area you need a wider aperture
now<00:02:48.389> wider<00:02:48.780> aperture<00:02:49.139> is<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.980> small<00:02:50.519> number<00:02:51.120> on

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
now wider aperture is a small number on

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.099 
now wider aperture is a small number on
your<00:02:52.230> camera<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.939> slightly<00:02:54.209> backwards

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
your camera so it's slightly backwards

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.520 
your camera so it's slightly backwards
to<00:02:55.290> what<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.620> might<00:02:55.769> think<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:57.319> small<00:02:58.319> aperture

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
to what you might think a small aperture

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.659 
to what you might think a small aperture
might<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.900> 2.8<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:02.209> f/4<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:03.810> always<00:03:04.079> call<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.439> f

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
might be 2.8 or f/4 we always call it f

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.559 
might be 2.8 or f/4 we always call it f
for<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:05.700> aperture<00:03:06.329> number<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:08.090> if<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.329> do

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
for the aperture number and if you do

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.509 
for the aperture number and if you do
that<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:10.319> you're<00:03:10.500> gonna<00:03:10.650> get<00:03:10.829> a<00:03:10.859> nice<00:03:11.129> wide

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
that then you're gonna get a nice wide

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.429 
that then you're gonna get a nice wide
open<00:03:11.969> aperture<00:03:12.209> which<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.719> nice<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.230> wide

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
open aperture which is nice and wide

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.300 
open aperture which is nice and wide
okay

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
okay

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.180 
okay
allowing<00:03:14.849> lots<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.419> light<00:03:15.629> through<00:03:16.190> if

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
allowing lots of light through if

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.729 
allowing lots of light through if
however<00:03:17.669> you<00:03:18.419> choose<00:03:18.449> one<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.290> high

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
however you choose one of the high

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.860 
however you choose one of the high
numbers<00:03:20.430> maybe<00:03:21.229> f-16<00:03:22.229> or<00:03:22.790> f-22<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:24.690> it's

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
numbers maybe f-16 or f-22 then it's

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.360 
numbers maybe f-16 or f-22 then it's
going<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.169> other<00:03:25.199> way<00:03:25.409> it's<00:03:25.919> going<00:03:26.129> to<00:03:26.190> make<00:03:26.340> a

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
going the other way it's going to make a

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.059 
going the other way it's going to make a
very<00:03:26.609> small<00:03:27.090> hole<00:03:27.389> allowing<00:03:28.319> only<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.829> little

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
very small hole allowing only a little

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.289 
very small hole allowing only a little
light<00:03:29.370> through<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:29.669> obviously<00:03:30.120> look<00:03:30.269> like

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
light through so obviously look like

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.839 
light through so obviously look like
sunny<00:03:30.810> day<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.829> can<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.489> because

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
sunny day you you can do that because

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.599 
sunny day you you can do that because
you<00:03:33.120> don't<00:03:33.239> need<00:03:33.479> so<00:03:33.689> much<00:03:33.870> light<00:03:34.229> that<00:03:34.609> does

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
you don't need so much light that does

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.789 
you don't need so much light that does
make<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:35.909> difference<00:03:36.109> for<00:03:37.109> something<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.680> we

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
make a difference for something that we

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.969 
make a difference for something that we
call<00:03:38.099> depth<00:03:38.699> of<00:03:39.000> field<00:03:39.449> but<00:03:40.409> that's<00:03:40.620> something

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
call depth of field but that's something

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.890 
call depth of field but that's something
again<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.280> I'll<00:03:41.549> be<00:03:41.669> explaining<00:03:42.299> properly

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
again that I'll be explaining properly

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.469 
again that I'll be explaining properly
and<00:03:43.739> given<00:03:44.069> showing<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.549> some<00:03:44.759> examples<00:03:44.790> off

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
and given showing you some examples off

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.210 
and given showing you some examples off
in<00:03:45.870> another<00:03:46.470> tutorial

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
in another tutorial

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.939 
in another tutorial
okay<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.449> for<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.810> moment<00:03:49.019> what<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.680> need<00:03:49.829> to

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
okay but for the moment what we need to

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.550 
okay but for the moment what we need to
remember<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.879> we're<00:03:51.449> controlling<00:03:52.349> that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
remember is that we're controlling that

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.059 
remember is that we're controlling that
aperture<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:53.389> so<00:03:54.389> let's<00:03:54.930> say<00:03:55.139> we<00:03:55.169> choose<00:03:55.709> an

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
aperture and so let's say we choose an

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.670 
aperture and so let's say we choose an
aperture<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.759> F<00:03:57.239> five<00:03:58.169> point<00:03:58.500> six<00:03:58.709> okay<00:03:59.519> that's

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
aperture of F five point six okay that's

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.990 
aperture of F five point six okay that's
an<00:04:01.680> aperture<00:04:01.979> that<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.459> will<00:04:02.639> have<00:04:02.819> on<00:04:02.970> your

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
an aperture that you will have on your

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.129 
an aperture that you will have on your
lens<00:04:03.439> pretty<00:04:04.439> much<00:04:05.030> any<00:04:06.030> less<00:04:06.419> it's<00:04:06.810> going<00:04:07.019> to

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
lens pretty much any less it's going to

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.039 
lens pretty much any less it's going to
have<00:04:07.349> that<00:04:08.009> particular<00:04:08.340> aperture<00:04:08.939> some<00:04:09.509> some

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
have that particular aperture some some

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.839 
have that particular aperture some some
lenses<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.530> course<00:04:10.799> have<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.099> minimum<00:04:11.669> aperture

things<00:04:43.290> like<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.680> okay<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:45.120> we've<00:04:45.510> said<00:04:45.750> it

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
things like that okay so we've said it

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.680 
things like that okay so we've said it
at<00:04:46.110> 5.6<00:04:46.830> now<00:04:47.400> we<00:04:47.520> go<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.730> do<00:04:48.060> our<00:04:48.210> little<00:04:48.420> half

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
at 5.6 now we go to do our little half

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.990 
at 5.6 now we go to do our little half
press<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.260> we've<00:04:49.470> learned<00:04:49.890> before<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.370> we

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
press like we've learned before and we

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.330 
press like we've learned before and we
look<00:04:51.180> at<00:04:51.330> what<00:04:51.510> shutter<00:04:51.750> speed<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.230> chosen<00:04:52.590> and

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
look at what shutter speed is chosen and

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.490 
look at what shutter speed is chosen and
it<00:04:53.580> might<00:04:53.760> have<00:04:54.000> chose<00:04:54.270> chosen<00:04:54.990> something

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
it might have chose chosen something

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.680 
it might have chose chosen something
like<00:04:55.710> one<00:04:56.340> hundred<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:56.970> twenty-fifth<00:04:57.390> of<00:04:57.570> a

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
like one hundred and twenty-fifth of a

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.900 
like one hundred and twenty-fifth of a
second<00:04:58.050> or<00:04:58.170> two<00:04:58.380> hundred<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.280> fiftieth<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.820> a

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
second or two hundred and fiftieth of a

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.730 
second or two hundred and fiftieth of a
second<00:05:00.770> if<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:02.070> was<00:05:02.730> then<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.180> move<00:05:03.600> the

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
second if I was then to move the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.640 
second if I was then to move the
aperture<00:05:04.740> if<00:05:05.670> I<00:05:05.910> was<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.360> open<00:05:07.230> the<00:05:07.350> aperture

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
aperture if I was to open the aperture

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.490 
aperture if I was to open the aperture
more<00:05:07.980> remember<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.760> means<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.180> number<00:05:09.780> goes

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
more remember that means the number goes

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.670 
more remember that means the number goes
down<00:05:11.120> okay<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.180> from<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.810> five<00:05:13.020> point<00:05:13.290> six<00:05:13.470> if

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
down okay so from the five point six if

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.850 
down okay so from the five point six if
I<00:05:13.830> went<00:05:14.070> to<00:05:14.250> f/4<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.180> open<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.200> aperture<00:05:16.470> more

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
I went to f/4 and open the aperture more

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.520 
I went to f/4 and open the aperture more
then<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.700> shutter<00:05:18.060> speed<00:05:18.330> would<00:05:19.050> become

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
then the shutter speed would become

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.910 
then the shutter speed would become
faster<00:05:20.520> because<00:05:21.510> of<00:05:21.630> course<00:05:21.840> if<00:05:22.020> I'm<00:05:22.170> letting

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
faster because of course if I'm letting

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.920 
faster because of course if I'm letting
more<00:05:23.100> light<00:05:23.160> in<00:05:23.610> then<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.210> only<00:05:24.390> need<00:05:24.750> the

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
more light in then I only need the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.530 
more light in then I only need the
shutter<00:05:25.170> to<00:05:25.320> be<00:05:25.530> open<00:05:26.010> for<00:05:26.550> less<00:05:26.850> time<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.360> let

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
shutter to be open for less time to let

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.390 
shutter to be open for less time to let
the<00:05:27.630> same<00:05:27.810> amount<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.200> light<00:05:28.380> through<00:05:28.650> okay

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
the same amount of light through okay

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.790 
the same amount of light through okay
and<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.970> same<00:05:30.180> thing<00:05:30.450> goes<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.170> other<00:05:31.320> way

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
and the same thing goes the other way

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.650 
and the same thing goes the other way
if<00:05:31.950> I<00:05:32.160> was<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.520> choose<00:05:32.790> an<00:05:32.940> aperture<00:05:33.210> which<00:05:33.480> is

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
if I was to choose an aperture which is

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.530 
if I was to choose an aperture which is
smaller<00:05:34.170> then<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.610> camera<00:05:36.090> will<00:05:36.270> choose<00:05:36.510> a

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
smaller then the camera will choose a

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.820 
smaller then the camera will choose a
shutter<00:05:36.900> speed<00:05:37.110> which<00:05:37.770> is<00:05:38.120> longer<00:05:39.120> open<00:05:39.990> so<00:05:40.680> it

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
shutter speed which is longer open so it

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.320 
shutter speed which is longer open so it
might<00:05:40.980> be<00:05:41.190> one<00:05:41.370> sixtieth<00:05:41.850> of<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.970> second

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
might be one sixtieth of a second

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.240 
might be one sixtieth of a second
something<00:05:42.510> like<00:05:42.810> that<00:05:43.020> so<00:05:43.830> that<00:05:43.980> it's

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
something like that so that it's

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.520 
something like that so that it's
allowing<00:05:44.610> time<00:05:44.970> for<00:05:45.030> more<00:05:45.630> light<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.380> pass

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
allowing time for more light to pass

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.220 
allowing time for more light to pass
through<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.100> camera<00:05:47.610> okay<00:05:48.270> now<00:05:48.750> these<00:05:49.020> are

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
through to the camera okay now these are

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.410 
through to the camera okay now these are
things<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.500> we<00:05:49.740> can<00:05:49.950> talk<00:05:50.730> about<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:51.060> lot<00:05:51.360> more

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
things that we can talk about a lot more

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.900 
things that we can talk about a lot more
but<00:05:52.230> remember<00:05:52.770> when<00:05:53.130> you<00:05:53.220> get<00:05:53.400> out<00:05:53.550> there<00:05:53.760> on<00:05:53.790> a

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
but remember when you get out there on a

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.240 
but remember when you get out there on a
sunny<00:05:54.240> day<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:54.810> would<00:05:55.440> recommend<00:05:56.070> that<00:05:56.130> you

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
sunny day I would recommend that you

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.900 
sunny day I would recommend that you
start<00:05:56.820> off<00:05:57.090> with<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.680> middle<00:05:58.680> aperture<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.730> by

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
start off with a middle aperture and by

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.650 
start off with a middle aperture and by
that<00:06:00.180> I<00:06:00.390> would<00:06:00.600> mean<00:06:00.840> f/8<00:06:01.500> or<00:06:01.850> f/11<00:06:02.850> if<00:06:03.540> you

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
that I would mean f/8 or f/11 if you

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.620 
that I would mean f/8 or f/11 if you
start<00:06:04.110> around<00:06:04.530> about<00:06:04.830> there<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.400> if<00:06:06.390> the

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
start around about there and if the

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.880 
start around about there and if the
shutter<00:06:06.930> speed<00:06:07.350> is<00:06:07.730> too<00:06:08.730> slow<00:06:08.760> and<00:06:09.660> it<00:06:10.260> is<00:06:10.530> too

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
shutter speed is too slow and it is too

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.210 
shutter speed is too slow and it is too
slow<00:06:11.100> to<00:06:11.220> handhold<00:06:11.940> I<00:06:12.330> would<00:06:12.570> say<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:13.230> less

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
slow to handhold I would say is less

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.320 
slow to handhold I would say is less
than<00:06:14.460> one<00:06:14.730> sixtieth<00:06:15.330> of<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.690> second<00:06:16.760> then<00:06:17.760> you

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
than one sixtieth of a second then you

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.210 
than one sixtieth of a second then you
that<00:06:18.600> so<00:06:18.750> maybe<00:06:18.900> one<00:06:19.200> thirtieth<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.830> second

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
that so maybe one thirtieth of a second

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.000 
that so maybe one thirtieth of a second
something<00:06:20.430> like<00:06:20.790> that<00:06:21.170> then<00:06:22.170> I<00:06:22.470> would<00:06:22.770> suggest

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
something like that then I would suggest

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.790 
something like that then I would suggest
that<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.430> need<00:06:23.700> to<00:06:23.850> open<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.600> aperture<00:06:24.900> so<00:06:25.560> go

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
that you need to open the aperture so go

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.180 
that you need to open the aperture so go
try<00:06:25.860> down<00:06:26.730> to<00:06:26.970> f/8<00:06:27.440> and<00:06:28.440> when<00:06:28.680> you've<00:06:28.830> got<00:06:28.860> to

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
try down to f/8 and when you've got to

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.670 
try down to f/8 and when you've got to
f/8<00:06:29.550> have<00:06:29.850> a<00:06:29.880> look<00:06:30.090> again<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.900> will<00:06:31.020> find<00:06:31.080> that

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
f/8 have a look again you will find that

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.440 
f/8 have a look again you will find that
the<00:06:31.860> shutter<00:06:32.070> speed<00:06:32.460> will<00:06:32.640> have<00:06:32.760> got<00:06:32.940> winner

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
the shutter speed will have got winner

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.700 
the shutter speed will have got winner
will<00:06:33.780> have<00:06:33.810> opened<00:06:34.290> up<00:06:34.410> to<00:06:34.590> a<00:06:34.620> faster<00:06:35.160> speed

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
will have opened up to a faster speed

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.300 
will have opened up to a faster speed
okay<00:06:36.540> if<00:06:37.540> it<00:06:37.780> gets<00:06:38.020> to<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.199> 1/16<00:06:38.830> of<00:06:38.860> a<00:06:38.949> second

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
okay if it gets to the 1/16 of a second

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.150 
okay if it gets to the 1/16 of a second
then<00:06:39.790> great<00:06:40.060> let's<00:06:40.389> go<00:06:40.570> for<00:06:40.780> that<00:06:40.930> but<00:06:41.680> if<00:06:41.949> it's

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
then great let's go for that but if it's

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.370 
then great let's go for that but if it's
still<00:06:42.250> too<00:06:42.430> slow<00:06:42.729> open<00:06:43.479> it<00:06:43.570> up<00:06:43.660> a<00:06:43.750> bit<00:06:43.900> more<00:06:44.050> f

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
still too slow open it up a bit more f

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.670 
still too slow open it up a bit more f
5.6<00:06:45.370> okay<00:06:46.120> and<00:06:46.419> that's<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.110> way<00:06:47.229> we<00:06:47.500> work

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
5.6 okay and that's the way we work

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.040 
5.6 okay and that's the way we work
we're<00:06:48.310> trying<00:06:48.520> to<00:06:48.880> get<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.539> maximum<00:06:49.960> amount

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
we're trying to get the maximum amount

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.050 
we're trying to get the maximum amount
of<00:06:50.320> light<00:06:50.560> but<00:06:50.979> we're<00:06:51.160> also<00:06:51.340> trying<00:06:51.550> to<00:06:51.820> get<00:06:52.000> a

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
of light but we're also trying to get a

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.659 
of light but we're also trying to get a
speed<00:06:52.509> that<00:06:52.780> we<00:06:53.169> can<00:06:53.350> hand<00:06:53.620> hold<00:06:54.009> the<00:06:54.190> camera

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
speed that we can hand hold the camera

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.240 
speed that we can hand hold the camera
if<00:06:55.030> the<00:06:55.360> camera<00:06:55.780> is<00:06:55.810> at<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.169> opening<00:06:57.100> the

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
if the camera is at the opening the

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.850 
if the camera is at the opening the
shutter<00:06:57.520> for<00:06:57.910> one<00:06:58.840> fifteenth<00:06:59.320> of<00:06:59.410> a<00:06:59.530> second

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
shutter for one fifteenth of a second

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.960 
shutter for one fifteenth of a second
you're<00:06:59.949> going<00:07:00.100> to<00:07:00.160> find<00:07:00.370> it<00:07:00.520> very<00:07:00.550> difficult

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
you're going to find it very difficult

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
you're going to find it very difficult
to<00:07:01.210> hold<00:07:01.570> it<00:07:01.780> very<00:07:02.740> still<00:07:03.160> for<00:07:03.900> getting<00:07:04.900> a

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
to hold it very still for getting a

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.200 
to hold it very still for getting a
really<00:07:05.320> sharp<00:07:05.620> picture<00:07:06.460> and<00:07:06.669> that's<00:07:06.940> what<00:07:07.090> we

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
really sharp picture and that's what we

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.480 
really sharp picture and that's what we
really<00:07:07.240> want<00:07:07.570> okay<00:07:08.500> sir

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
really want okay sir

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.840 
really want okay sir
start<00:07:09.880> at<00:07:10.090> roundabout<00:07:10.510> f/8<00:07:10.840> or<00:07:10.870> f/11<00:07:11.380> and<00:07:11.860> work

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
start at roundabout f/8 or f/11 and work

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.980 
start at roundabout f/8 or f/11 and work
from<00:07:13.120> there<00:07:13.389> if<00:07:13.990> it's<00:07:14.229> too<00:07:14.500> dark<00:07:14.979> then<00:07:15.580> or<00:07:16.479> so

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
from there if it's too dark then or so

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.350 
from there if it's too dark then or so
if<00:07:17.169> the<00:07:17.260> shutter<00:07:17.470> speed<00:07:17.620> is<00:07:17.770> too<00:07:18.130> slow<00:07:18.360> then

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 
if the shutter speed is too slow then

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.659 
if the shutter speed is too slow then
open<00:07:20.199> the<00:07:20.320> aperture<00:07:20.560> go<00:07:21.130> to<00:07:21.190> a<00:07:21.310> higher<00:07:21.580> number

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669 
open the aperture go to a higher number

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.969 
open the aperture go to a higher number
so<00:07:22.180> that<00:07:22.479> it<00:07:22.750> will<00:07:22.840> allow<00:07:22.960> more<00:07:23.410> light<00:07:23.470> in

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
so that it will allow more light in

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.490 
so that it will allow more light in
which<00:07:24.430> will<00:07:24.669> enable<00:07:25.090> it<00:07:25.330> to<00:07:25.389> have<00:07:25.660> a<00:07:25.930> faster

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.500 
which will enable it to have a faster

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.469 
which will enable it to have a faster
shutter<00:07:26.680> speed<00:07:27.039> and<00:07:27.250> that's<00:07:27.610> what<00:07:27.820> aperture

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 
shutter speed and that's what aperture

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.170 
shutter speed and that's what aperture
priority<00:07:28.690> is<00:07:29.440> all<00:07:29.650> about<00:07:29.949> and<00:07:30.639> in<00:07:30.760> the<00:07:30.880> next

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
priority is all about and in the next

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.210 
priority is all about and in the next
tutorial<00:07:31.780> we're<00:07:32.110> going<00:07:32.260> to<00:07:32.349> look<00:07:32.530> at<00:07:32.710> shutter

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220 
tutorial we're going to look at shutter

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.150 
tutorial we're going to look at shutter
speed<00:07:33.550> priority<00:07:33.580> and<00:07:34.479> the<00:07:35.110> one<00:07:35.380> after<00:07:35.590> that<00:07:35.919> so

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 
speed priority and the one after that so

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.589 
speed priority and the one after that so
that<00:07:36.310> you<00:07:36.400> know<00:07:36.550> what's<00:07:36.789> coming<00:07:37.120> we're<00:07:37.479> going

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 
that you know what's coming we're going

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.390 
that you know what's coming we're going
to<00:07:37.660> be<00:07:37.750> looking<00:07:37.840> at<00:07:38.080> depth<00:07:38.349> of<00:07:38.530> field<00:07:38.770> so<00:07:39.220> we're

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 
to be looking at depth of field so we're

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.879 
to be looking at depth of field so we're
seeing<00:07:39.639> how<00:07:39.940> these<00:07:40.180> work<00:07:40.900> together<00:07:41.199> in

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:41.889 
seeing how these work together in

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:42.779 
seeing how these work together in
relationship

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:42.789 
relationship

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:44.670 
relationship
so<00:07:43.000> that's<00:07:43.240> aperture<00:07:43.630> priority<00:07:43.810> for<00:07:44.199> now<00:07:44.320> hope

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
so that's aperture priority for now hope

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.189 
so that's aperture priority for now hope
you<00:07:44.889> have<00:07:45.340> understood<00:07:45.550> that<00:07:45.910> but<00:07:46.210> remember<00:07:46.360> my

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 
you have understood that but remember my
