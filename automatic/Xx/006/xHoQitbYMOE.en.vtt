00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.080 

the<00:02:35.500> Flambeau<00:02:36.010> utility<00:02:36.520> boxes<00:02:36.850> are<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
the Flambeau utility boxes are the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.910 
the Flambeau utility boxes are the
foundation<00:02:37.810> for<00:02:37.840> all<00:02:38.110> your<00:02:38.350> tackle<00:02:38.830> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
foundation for all your tackle and

general equipment storage and the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.780 
general equipment storage and the
interesting<00:02:41.350> thing<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.370> 0's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
interesting thing is that the 0's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.170 
interesting thing is that the 0's
material<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.480> actually<00:02:44.370> embedded<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.610> each<00:02:45.910> of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
material is actually embedded in each of

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.030 
material is actually embedded in each of
the<00:02:46.540> little<00:02:46.810> blue<00:02:46.960> dividers<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.710> utility

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the little blue dividers in the utility

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.540 
the little blue dividers in the utility
box<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.150> when<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.780> close<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.260> box<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.160> 0's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
hard plastics you use these lures can

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.590 
hard plastics you use these lures can
get<00:03:12.310> expensive<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.000> last<00:03:13.270> thing<00:03:13.450> you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
get expensive and the last thing you

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.990 
get expensive and the last thing you
want<00:03:13.810> them<00:03:13.960> to<00:03:13.990> do<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:15.040> corrode<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.700> rust

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
want them to do is to corrode and rust

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.390 
want them to do is to corrode and rust
well<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:16.930> many<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.410> Flambeau<00:03:17.890> tackle

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
well so many of the Flambeau tackle

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.370 
well so many of the Flambeau tackle
boxes<00:03:18.790> are<00:03:18.910> actually<00:03:19.300> set<00:03:19.510> up<00:03:19.540> with<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.960> zero

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
boxes are actually set up with the zero

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.140 
boxes are actually set up with the zero
system<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.430> when<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.790> put<00:03:22.000> those

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
system so that when you put those

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.240 
system so that when you put those
expensive<00:03:22.780> plastic<00:03:23.260> lures<00:03:23.410> in<00:03:23.740> there<00:03:23.890> they're

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
expensive plastic lures in there they're

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.530 
expensive plastic lures in there they're
not<00:03:24.430> going<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.700> rust<00:03:24.910> they're<00:03:25.180> not<00:03:25.330> going<00:03:25.480> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
not going to rust they're not going to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.810 
not going to rust they're not going to
corrode<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.140> an<00:03:26.800> example<00:03:27.130> with<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.460> flamvell
