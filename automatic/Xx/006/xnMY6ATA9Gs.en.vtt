your signal lights that it's on the
light<00:00:23.699> butter<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:24.689> broken<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.980> light

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
light butter out or broken so this light

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.670 
light butter out or broken so this light
or<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.660> side<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
or the one on the side or the one in the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.350 
or the one on the side or the one in the
front<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.929> do<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.990> other<00:00:31.170> signal<00:00:31.560> light

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
front and do the other signal light

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.819 
front and do the other signal light
so<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> our<00:00:34.020> supposed<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> blink

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
so this is our supposed to blink

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.670 
so this is our supposed to blink
normally<00:00:35.780> normal<00:00:36.780> blink<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:39.079> if<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.440> this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
normally normal blink so if it's on this

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.180 
normally normal blink so if it's on this
side<00:00:40.739> it'll<00:00:41.129> start<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> flashing<00:00:41.820> real<00:00:42.000> fast<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
side it'll start a flashing real fast so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.170 
side it'll start a flashing real fast so
I'm<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> show<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> looks<00:00:45.000> like

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
I'm going to show you how it looks like

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.100 
I'm going to show you how it looks like
on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> dashboard<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.079> normal

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
on the dashboard so so this is normal

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.279 
on the dashboard so so this is normal
that's<00:00:52.110> normal<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.140> your
