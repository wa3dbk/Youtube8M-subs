00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
make a video or it won't be that

make a video or it won't be that
interested<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.189> it<00:01:57.340> because<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.729> just<00:01:57.880> thought

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
interested in it because I just thought

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.850

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
it was obvious but from the looks of the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.530 
it was obvious but from the looks of the
responses<00:02:00.520> on<00:02:00.640> some<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:00.909> those<00:02:01.000> videos<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.390> lot
