gonna last forever

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.090 
gonna last forever
because<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.960> only<00:04:40.110> thing<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.560> would<00:04:40.650> say

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
because the only thing that I would say

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.040 
because the only thing that I would say
is<00:04:41.340> my<00:04:41.490> brother<00:04:41.910> pointed<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.390> out<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.840> only

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
is my brother pointed this out the only

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.540 
is my brother pointed this out the only
like<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.740> think<00:04:43.800> problem<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.430> I'll

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
like I think problem that I'll

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.520 
like I think problem that I'll
eventually<00:04:44.820> have<00:04:45.090> with<00:04:45.450> it<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.900> guess<00:04:45.990> this<00:04:46.350> is

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
eventually have with it I guess this is

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.610 
eventually have with it I guess this is
with<00:04:46.710> all<00:04:46.950> like<00:04:47.880> leather<00:04:48.210> or<00:04:48.360> soft<00:04:48.870> leather<00:04:49.260> is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
with all like leather or soft leather is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.800 
with all like leather or soft leather is
that<00:04:50.070> I<00:04:50.340> don't<00:04:50.760> know<00:04:50.940> if<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.060> guys<00:04:51.180> can<00:04:51.390> see

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
that I don't know if you guys can see

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.620 
that I don't know if you guys can see
that<00:04:51.840> right<00:04:52.229> there<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.970> creases

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
that right there but it is it creases

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.719 
that right there but it is it creases
where<00:04:55.110> like<00:04:55.440> you're<00:04:55.620> where<00:04:55.919> you<00:04:56.039> step<00:04:56.400> where

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
where like you're where you step where

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.060 
where like you're where you step where
your<00:04:56.850> toe<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.450> it<00:04:57.900> also<00:04:58.080> creased<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.800> little

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
your toe is and it also creased a little

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.210 
your toe is and it also creased a little
bit<00:04:59.280> right<00:04:59.550> here<00:05:00.410> that's<00:05:01.410> because<00:05:01.830> when<00:05:02.190> I

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
bit right here that's because when I

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.400 
bit right here that's because when I
guess<00:05:02.520> when<00:05:02.700> I<00:05:02.729> packaged<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.720> left<00:05:04.229> the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
guess when I packaged it I left the

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.860 
guess when I packaged it I left the
tongue<00:05:04.680> out<00:05:04.890> boys<00:05:05.190> should<00:05:06.120> technically<00:05:06.510> be<00:05:06.600> in

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
tongue out boys should technically be in

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.080 
tongue out boys should technically be in
like<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.260> yeah<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.190> he<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.490> creasing<00:05:09.000> a

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
like this yeah so he just creasing a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.990 
like this yeah so he just creasing a
little<00:05:09.360> bit<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:09.979> but<00:05:10.979> we<00:05:11.130> asked<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.850> guy

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
little bit here but we asked the guy

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.800 
little bit here but we asked the guy
it's<00:05:12.360> like<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.820> design<00:05:15.180> will<00:05:15.390> like<00:05:15.539> peel

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
it's like the the design will like peel

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.540 
it's like the the design will like peel
off<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.289> flake<00:05:16.650> off<00:05:16.860> or<00:05:17.039> anything<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.490> he

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
off and flake off or anything and he

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.640 
off and flake off or anything and he
said<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:18.240> will<00:05:18.419> never<00:05:18.570> happen<00:05:18.840> so<00:05:19.380> I

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
said that that will never happen so I

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.240 
said that that will never happen so I
guess<00:05:21.169> that's<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.350> one<00:05:22.560> good<00:05:22.590> thing<00:05:22.800> about<00:05:23.039> it

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
guess that's the one good thing about it

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.590 
guess that's the one good thing about it
but<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.430> mean<00:05:23.669> creasing<00:05:24.030> will<00:05:24.150> happen<00:05:24.479> with

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
but I mean creasing will happen with

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.260 
but I mean creasing will happen with
every<00:05:24.930> shoe<00:05:25.139> it<00:05:25.410> just<00:05:25.889> bothers<00:05:26.370> me<00:05:26.610> right

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
every shoe it just bothers me right

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.860 
every shoe it just bothers me right
there<00:05:28.700> but<00:05:29.700> it's<00:05:30.150> not

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
there but it's not

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.980 
there but it's not
it's<00:05:31.080> not<00:05:31.259> too<00:05:31.469> bad<00:05:32.219> I<00:05:32.249> just<00:05:32.909> took<00:05:33.120> make<00:05:33.809> sure<00:05:33.960> I

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
it's not too bad I just took make sure I

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.879 
it's not too bad I just took make sure I
take<00:05:34.229> care<00:05:34.499> of<00:05:34.559> it

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
take care of it

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.980 
take care of it
the<00:05:35.159> bottom<00:05:35.550> sole<00:05:35.819> here<00:05:36.210> it's<00:05:36.809> actually

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
the bottom sole here it's actually

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.439 
the bottom sole here it's actually
rubber<00:05:37.529> so<00:05:37.979> I<00:05:38.249> first<00:05:38.610> thought<00:05:38.819> that<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.330> would

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
rubber so I first thought that it would

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.209 
rubber so I first thought that it would
be<00:05:39.569> really<00:05:39.809> really<00:05:39.930> like<00:05:40.529> hard<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.949> clean

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
be really really like hard to clean

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.040 
be really really like hard to clean
because<00:05:41.879> you<00:05:42.089> know<00:05:42.270> how<00:05:42.360> like<00:05:42.629> white<00:05:42.839> gets

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
because you know how like white gets

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.200 
because you know how like white gets
dirty<00:05:43.319> so<00:05:43.559> fast<00:05:43.770> obviously<00:05:44.039> but<00:05:44.699> because<00:05:45.029> it's

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
dirty so fast obviously but because it's

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.700 
dirty so fast obviously but because it's
rubber<00:05:45.539> you<00:05:45.900> can<00:05:46.169> just<00:05:46.409> use<00:05:47.870> like<00:05:48.870> okay<00:05:49.499> also

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
rubber you can just use like okay also

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.790 
rubber you can just use like okay also
for<00:05:50.279> the<00:05:50.430> receipt<00:05:50.879> for<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.210> shoes<00:05:51.870> um<00:05:52.289> they

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.939 
really I don't really wear jeans or
whatever<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:20.939> I<00:06:21.319> needed<00:06:22.319> a<00:06:22.469> pair<00:06:22.649> of<00:06:22.680> shoes

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
whatever so I needed a pair of shoes

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.480 
whatever so I needed a pair of shoes
that<00:06:22.979> I<00:06:23.310> could<00:06:23.639> look<00:06:23.819> nice<00:06:24.330> in<00:06:25.039> wearing<00:06:26.039> sweats

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
that I could look nice in wearing sweats

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.049 
that I could look nice in wearing sweats

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
guess you could say like casual clothing

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.619 
guess you could say like casual clothing
and<00:06:31.860> these<00:06:32.460> were<00:06:32.789> the<00:06:32.939> ones<00:06:33.120> there<00:06:33.419> were<00:06:33.509> these

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:33.629 
and these were the ones there were these

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.239 
and these were the ones there were these
other<00:06:33.870> had<00:06:34.169> these<00:06:34.349> other<00:06:34.589> ones<00:06:34.830> I'll<00:06:35.009> put<00:06:35.219> a

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 
other had these other ones I'll put a

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.670 
other had these other ones I'll put a
picture<00:06:35.460> in<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:36.419> they<00:06:37.020> were<00:06:37.080> kind<00:06:37.409> of<00:06:37.469> like<00:06:37.649> a

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
picture in and they were kind of like a

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.899 
picture in and they were kind of like a
burnt<00:06:38.069> orange<00:06:38.399> and<00:06:39.240> it<00:06:39.569> was<00:06:40.039> snakeskin<00:06:41.039> Python

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
burnt orange and it was snakeskin Python

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.019 
burnt orange and it was snakeskin Python
no<00:06:42.389> Python<00:06:43.169> I<00:06:43.409> think<00:06:44.099> it<00:06:44.159> was<00:06:44.279> Python<00:06:44.699> and<00:06:44.969> they

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:45.029 
no Python I think it was Python and they

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.899 
no Python I think it was Python and they
had<00:06:45.149> like<00:06:45.300> scales<00:06:45.689> on<00:06:45.930> it<00:06:46.110> they<00:06:46.709> were<00:06:46.909> so

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
had like scales on it they were so

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.139 
had like scales on it they were so
beautiful<00:06:48.810> but<00:06:49.409> they<00:06:49.560> were<00:06:49.620> like<00:06:49.889> I<00:06:50.399> think

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:51.149 
beautiful but they were like I think

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:53.510 
beautiful but they were like I think
there<00:06:51.270> were<00:06:51.330> two<00:06:51.509> thousand<00:06:51.899> dollars<00:06:52.199> so<00:06:53.159> I

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
there were two thousand dollars so I

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.800 
there were two thousand dollars so I
didn't<00:06:53.729> get<00:06:53.819> those<00:06:53.969> cuz<00:06:54.270> that's<00:06:54.419> just<00:06:54.539> too

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
didn't get those cuz that's just too

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.129 
didn't get those cuz that's just too
much<00:06:54.959> for<00:06:55.349> shoes<00:06:55.560> I<00:06:56.029> could<00:06:57.029> justify<00:06:57.479> these<00:06:57.839> but

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
much for shoes I could justify these but

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.189 
much for shoes I could justify these but
I<00:06:58.169> could<00:06:58.379> not<00:06:58.469> justify<00:06:58.889> those<00:06:59.509> because<00:07:00.509> that's

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
I could not justify those because that's

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.189 
I could not justify those because that's
just<00:07:01.409> a<00:07:01.620> lot<00:07:01.770> of<00:07:02.069> money<00:07:02.339> for<00:07:03.089> shoes<00:07:03.300> so<00:07:03.930> these

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 
just a lot of money for shoes so these

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.899 
just a lot of money for shoes so these
look<00:07:04.409> really<00:07:04.620> nice<00:07:04.830> with<00:07:05.099> sweat<00:07:05.310> pants<00:07:05.639> I<00:07:05.759> wear

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909 
look really nice with sweat pants I wear

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.149 
look really nice with sweat pants I wear
them<00:07:06.060> with<00:07:06.149> tights<00:07:06.389> and<00:07:06.749> I<00:07:07.649> haven't<00:07:07.919> wore<00:07:08.039> them

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:08.159 
them with tights and I haven't wore them

them with tights and I haven't wore them
with<00:07:08.279> jeans<00:07:08.490> yet<00:07:08.759> but<00:07:08.909> they'll<00:07:09.029> probably<00:07:09.180> look

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:09.509 
with jeans yet but they'll probably look

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.619 
with jeans yet but they'll probably look
fine<00:07:09.779> with<00:07:10.020> jeans<00:07:10.259> and<00:07:10.560> I<00:07:11.310> look<00:07:11.520> like<00:07:11.819> a<00:07:12.029> mouse

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:12.629

wearing them cuz and another thing I

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:17.749 
wearing them cuz and another thing I
think<00:07:16.259> like<00:07:16.649> if<00:07:16.770> you<00:07:16.860> really<00:07:17.129> wanted<00:07:17.339> to<00:07:17.399> beat

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.059 
think like if you really wanted to beat
someone<00:07:18.149> up<00:07:18.180> with<00:07:18.479> them<00:07:18.689> and<00:07:18.959> you<00:07:19.620> hit<00:07:19.860> them

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:20.069 
someone up with them and you hit them

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:22.570 
someone up with them and you hit them

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
with the Medusa head it would hurt

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.170 
with the Medusa head it would hurt
that's<00:07:23.580> another<00:07:23.879> nice<00:07:24.120> thing<00:07:24.419> too<00:07:24.659> so<00:07:26.180> yeah
