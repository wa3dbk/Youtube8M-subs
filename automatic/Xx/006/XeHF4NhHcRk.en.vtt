00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.200 

what<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> recommend<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.070> is<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> drive<00:02:11.940> fit

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
what I recommend to do is do a drive fit

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.420 
what I recommend to do is do a drive fit
so<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.870> 3m<00:02:13.320> tape<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.770> still<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.280> right<00:02:14.400> now

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
so the 3m tape is still on it right now

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.180 
so the 3m tape is still on it right now
with<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.630> backing<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:18.240> make<00:02:18.360> sure<00:02:19.190> it

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
with the backing and just make sure it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.860 
with the backing and just make sure it
will<00:02:20.340> fit<00:02:20.400> properly<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.210> car<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> that's
