00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
but they're gonna get a lot of air in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.340 
but they're gonna get a lot of air in
there<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.600> them<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.870> get<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.260> out

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
there and for them to get in and out

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.810 
there and for them to get in and out
just<00:02:19.830> unzip<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.580> where<00:02:23.730> your

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
just unzip that and this is where your

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.310 
just unzip that and this is where your
child<00:02:24.060> sits<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.720> first<00:02:24.930> single<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
child sits so this is first single it

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.080 
child sits so this is first single it
also<00:02:25.440> comes<00:02:25.769> for<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> double<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.610> two<00:02:26.790> children

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
also comes for a double for two children

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.020 
also comes for a double for two children
and<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.810> has<00:02:28.019> a<00:02:28.260> 5<00:02:28.590> point<00:02:28.920> padded<00:02:29.040> harness<00:02:29.400> now

and it has a 5 point padded harness now

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.460 
and it has a 5 point padded harness now
this<00:02:30.150> highest<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.510> believe<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.840> gonna<00:02:30.930> change<00:02:31.320> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
this highest I believe is gonna change a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.080 
this highest I believe is gonna change a
little<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.799> but<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.400> ones<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:32.910> have

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
little bit but the ones that we have

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.150 
little bit but the ones that we have
here<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.690> slides<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.799> you're<00:02:34.950> taller

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
here it slides up so that you're taller

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.800 
here it slides up so that you're taller
children<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.790> get<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.000> hit<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.269> no<00:02:36.420> problem

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
children can get it hit in no problem

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.990 
children can get it hit in no problem
and<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.350> has<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.860> buckle<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.640> that's

and it has this buckle right here that's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.880 
and it has this buckle right here that's
pretty<00:02:39.570> easy<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:40.019> do<00:02:40.140> I'd<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.739> be<00:02:40.799> a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
pretty easy to do I'd like it to be a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.650 
pretty easy to do I'd like it to be a
little<00:02:41.190> bit<00:02:41.430> harder<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:41.790> my<00:02:41.970> child<00:02:42.209> can't<00:02:42.510> get

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
little bit harder so my child can't get

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.140 
little bit harder so my child can't get
out<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.440> didn't<00:02:43.680> wanted<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.030> not

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
out if I didn't wanted to but it's not

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.970 
out if I didn't wanted to but it's not
too<00:02:45.390> bad<00:02:45.540> because<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.470> squeeze

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
too bad because you do have to squeeze

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.280 
too bad because you do have to squeeze
it<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:48.030> get<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.330> come<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.019> can<00:02:49.140> see
