the hydrator so it will look like this
and<00:00:27.410> what<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:30.480> happen<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> baby

and what I do is I happen to have a baby
bullet<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> might<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.540> able<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> use<00:00:34.079> your

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
bullet but you might be able to use your

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
bullet but you might be able to use your
own<00:00:35.600> maybe<00:00:37.910> blender<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:40.010> version<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.160> big

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
own maybe blender or version of big

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.270 
own maybe blender or version of big
bullet<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.930> would<00:00:44.000> put<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:46.280> sink

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
bullet so you would put it in sink

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.270 
bullet so you would put it in sink
acceptable<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:52.050> screw<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
acceptable like so and I screw on the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
acceptable like so and I screw on the
top<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.890> baby<00:00:56.100> bullet<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.680> this

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
top the baby bullet like that and this

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.490 
top the baby bullet like that and this
is<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> Millett<00:00:59.489> blade<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> baby<00:01:01.109> bullet

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
is the Millett blade on the baby bullet

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.010 
is the Millett blade on the baby bullet
so<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> smaller<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:06.020> put

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so it's the smaller one and then I put

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.520 
so it's the smaller one and then I put
it<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.830> pull<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.610> down<00:01:09.170> I'll<00:01:10.170> take<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it in and pull it down I'll take you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.840 
it in and pull it down I'll take you
through<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> grinding<00:01:11.189> process<00:01:11.310> because<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
through the grinding process because it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.420 
through the grinding process because it
doesn't<00:01:12.119> take<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> long

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.080 

okay<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.390> ground<00:01:26.630> version<00:01:28.090> of

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
okay so this is the ground version of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.110 
okay so this is the ground version of
what<00:01:29.330> we<00:01:29.480> previously<00:01:29.930> have<00:01:31.300> and<00:01:33.670> ground<00:01:34.670> it

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
what we previously have and ground it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.110 
what we previously have and ground it
