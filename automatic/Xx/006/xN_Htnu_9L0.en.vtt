00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.540
 with this princess 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.910
 a few hours we r- 4 sent 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.389
 iPhones and in this version of the game there 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.330
 something interesting must put 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.970
 likes if you want to see more videos by 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.490
 this game and let's get started pretty 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.939
 Scott endured for a long time 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.699
 fnaf4 on apple devices and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.150
 starting today every 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.329
 Anyone can buy fnaf 4 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.210
 iphone or ipad link to the game 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.239
 left for you in the description under this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.090
 video I want to notice no one advertising 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 do the same for you and killed her mine 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.910
 friends and if you play this 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.180
 the version is sure to write that but you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.550
 managed to find maybe what scott exactly 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.270
 added something to this version 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.010
 the new one is actually this version 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.789
 practically no different from 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.260
 android versions however some of those 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.960
 who have already managed to buy 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.049
 and try out this game on your devices 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 immediately found the first difference that you can 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 see immediately when you start the game will appear 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.920
 picture with the image 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.430
 nightmare freddie in black background and figure 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.680
 four 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.820
 which picture was not in others 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.090
 versions of the game 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.000
 However, the version of the game on the PC was similar 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.390
 picture as you can see this same freddie 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.850
 however, as long as it is depicted larger at that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.000
 time as iphone version head 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.630
 Freddy can be seen completely and also a little 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.270
 you can see the neck and shoulders and this is so far the first 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.119
 and perhaps the only difference is 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.180
 version of the game but still hope for 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.180
 what scott left here any 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.619
 secrets so if you find 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.360
 write something interesting 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.930
 comments under this video are also friends 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.380
 I want to tell you that fnaf goes on and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.740
 to the theory of me is still very, very much there 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.040
 already 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.580
 October 31 Scott prepares something for us 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.180
 really cool and maybe what 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.670
 later he still decides to do in the top 5 to 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.970
 the same for the game creates an official 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.410
 a film that might bring more 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.750
 longer and in this mysterious story of the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.630
