cuz<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.269> cool<00:00:15.599> man<00:00:16.940> speed<00:00:17.940> your<00:00:18.660> odometer<00:00:19.500> or

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359

four thousand miles which is that much

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
four thousand miles which is that much
guess<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> blew<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.609> cuz<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> turbo<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.480> don't

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
guess it blew up cuz the turbo I don't

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.670 
guess it blew up cuz the turbo I don't

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
know

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.970 
know
so<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> turbo<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.939> making<00:00:27.240> lower<00:00:27.359> heat<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:28.650> got

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
so the turbo is making lower heat it got
