00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
kind of used all of the trees going up

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.270

the hill here and then it comes out

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.690 
the hill here and then it comes out
across<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.490> thing

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
across there back there the same thing

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.649 
across there back there the same thing
applies<00:01:21.450> down<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:23.119> actually<00:01:24.119> turned<00:01:24.509> out

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
applies down here actually turned out

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.200

posts<00:01:27.630> I'd<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> fence<00:01:28.229> posts<00:01:28.530> across<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
posts I'd use the fence posts across the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
posts I'd use the fence posts across the
front<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.460> those<00:01:29.640> trees<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.150> 25

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
