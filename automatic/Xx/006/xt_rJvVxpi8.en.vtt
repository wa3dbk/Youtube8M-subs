00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.360
 welcome to another music test back 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.010
 today we are in the factory electro sales 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.869
 and let's try an amplifier of your 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 production prototype although it will soon 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 to be if we are showing something 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.020
 only contrast this is this online 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.780
 is already starting to market is a 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.649
 small team version of new team we are going to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.059
 see it we have here the prototype 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.300
 Well it's a very small hospital like 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.300
 you can see 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.690
 half the normal width and height 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 it is also more tiny the deep not 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.269
 because from what I was observing the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.530
 equipment weighs a ton and a half or 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.120
 that the jobs you have inside are 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.949
 great guys and girls everything is also 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.460
 shrinks the audio specifically 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.440
 shrink the works the audio is done 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.540
 well here the people in sight is electric 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.159
 of treaty of person happen then what 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.560
 what they tried to do was put in a 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 smaller amplifier in size and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.060
 power but in the same kind of range 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 dynamic they had big strokes 2 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.729
 vargas 6 b 6 that are the most 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 chiquititas of 6 l 6 has that same 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.360
 ring type more or less but less 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 power 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.030
 about 22 watts 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 equally tremendously devastating in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 the volume to play in pubs and musicians 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.840
 another against surplus but the team yields 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.270
 very good at normal volumes its good 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.740
 equipment to record has two channels and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 a lot of all the chirimbolos that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.550
 they usually have the type equipments that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.550
 they have channel 2 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 when I give them severe acute means and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.270
 volume 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.270
 the channel distorts the equation 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.780
 back we have light type options all 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.429
 they're all because it's a prototype of 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.049
 the names of the base 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.400
 the controls are put on a tape 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.310
 adhesive 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.269
 these typical magician that allows me a 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.780
 good system let's approve this 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.950
 wide that we have here with a visual 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.290
 after r9 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.950
 and in the recording booth we have 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.160
 put a box with the eminent wizard 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.420
 which are the speakers and has an audio 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 very particular is to listen with this 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.239
 team we are taking everything directly 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.239
 to the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.720
 in the next video you will listen 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.250
 specifically how this mini sounds 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.250
 youtube in the beatles
