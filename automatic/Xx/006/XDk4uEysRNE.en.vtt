it down very thoughtful very good put
that<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.369> carbon<00:01:05.820> fiber

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
that over there it's all carbon fiber

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.030 
that over there it's all carbon fiber
let's<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> main<00:01:08.729> thing<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:10.880> cap<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
let's get to the main thing here cap it

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.140 
let's get to the main thing here cap it
so<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.250> USB<00:01:15.830> get<00:01:16.830> some<00:01:17.070> nuts<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> bolts<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so your USB get some nuts and bolts and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
so your USB get some nuts and bolts and
washers<00:01:18.560> not<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> hun<00:01:19.830> percent<00:01:20.250> sure<00:01:20.520> with
