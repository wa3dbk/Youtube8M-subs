cassava fresh cassava there as you can
see<00:00:18.029> closely<00:00:18.470> there<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.449> you<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.689> peel

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
see closely there and you have to peel

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.849 
see closely there and you have to peel
it<00:00:22.230> wash<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.070> boil<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.529> make<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.560> boil

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.009 
it wash it and boil it and make it boil
to<00:00:26.160> solve<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.390> string<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
to solve but here is some string in the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.070 
to solve but here is some string in the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cassava and when it's boiled you remove

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
cassava and when it's boiled you remove
all<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> string<00:00:35.460> from<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> middle<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
all the string from in the middle and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.350 
all the string from in the middle and
this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:39.059> soft

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
gold and you much it really sort well

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
gold and you much it really sort well
obviously<00:00:50.760> after<00:00:51.270> straining<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:52.500> really

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and here is how you mash it really soft

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630 
and here is how you mash it really soft
and<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.299> boil<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.750> egg<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:08.220> stick<00:01:08.610> it
