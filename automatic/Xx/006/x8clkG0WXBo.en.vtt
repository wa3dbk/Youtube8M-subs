00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.720
 we will take as the basis of infrastructure 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.450
 necessary the facilities and 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.640
 plant equipment for light wheat 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.910
 are sufficient to meet a demand 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.369
 of 15 thousand salted per day thousand dishes 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.950
 ready and 5 thousand candies 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.820
 you must have a minimum area 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.340
 of 150 square meters the structure 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.130
 should have a separate area 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.980
 for the preparation of the dishes that must 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.600
 be the largest area of ​​the company an area 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.690
 for the office and

 administration and a separate area 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.370
 for the deposit because of the requirements 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.040
 and sanitary ware 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.320
 the factory should be far from sources 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.990
 producers of undesirable odors of 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.730
 any nature 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.269
 the external windows must be protected 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.700
 to prevent entry of insects should 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.360
 have waterproofed flooring for easy 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.299
 conservation and cleanliness must have 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.470
 coated partitions or 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.649
 waterproofed with easily 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.350
 washing and sanitation must have 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.490
 lining of suitable material in all 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.609
 dependencies 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.890
 it is imperative that the company has a 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.579
 utility vehicle for the carriage of 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.049
 products to the consumer market 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.869
 in which case the products are being 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.990
 placed in styrofoam boxes because the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.119
 distance to market is too short 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.850
 for large cities the ideal vehicle 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.460
 is refrigerated because it is essential that the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.530
 freezing temperature is maintained 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.530
 to the point of sale to maintain the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.749
 quality of the product is required 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.270
 purchase a cryogenic cabinet with 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.530
 capacity for both dishes that 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.329
 intends to produce 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.679
 it should be close to the production area 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.259
 in this cabinet all the shelves 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.399
 came in contact with the cold that passes 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.160
 underneath them 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.090
 so the food is frozen more 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.610
 quickly 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.180
 so this type of equipment is the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.400
 ideal that is not the case with the frízeres 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.220
 common horizontal conditions where food 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.890
 are stacked and those on top 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.320
 did not come into direct contact with the cold 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.060
 but at least one common freezer is also 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.390
 necessary for some steps of the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.370
 cold chamber is required. 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.850
 for storing ready-made products 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.100
 with capacity for its production should 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.800
 stay close to the ambassador 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.290
 a packer is also required 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.390
 remove the air from the inside of the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.820
 so that the product does not enter into 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.780
 in direct contact with the cold when 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.120
 already stored it is still necessary to 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.670
 an industrial grater for cheese 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.780
 hams and any raw materials 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.380
 that need to be revealed 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.160
 an electric slicer for a cold one 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.050
 industrial mixer for cold and 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.280
 an industrial beater to beat 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:19.120
 hot masses it is necessary to acquire a 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.870
 Meat grinder one machine with 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.500
 cylinders for stretching pasta a stove 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.790
 industrial furnaces with capacity for 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.620
 production that can be electrical or 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.870
 which are more economical 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.040
 depending on the ease of obtaining the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.040
 firewood in your region 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.510
 purchase cabinets for growth of

 pizza pasta and mini pizza 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.370
 if these are products you want

 marketing and carts for 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.680
 transport of the trays left 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.050
 a precision balance is 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.160
 essential for your product to be 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.670
 standardized 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.440
 you will see later because each 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.780
 employee should have a table of 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.170
 work with waterproof top and 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.690
 easy to hygienize too 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.200
 smaller equipment as a cutter for
