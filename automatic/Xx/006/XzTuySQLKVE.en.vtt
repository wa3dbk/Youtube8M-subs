00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Welcome to the new video 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.740
 Monday 10 Today it's in the pc itself 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.050
 Bahn see 2013 about the installation of the alarm 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 In that case, the corsa is the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.099
 so-called vengeance ran 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.900
 he is 53 mm high and we will now 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.760
 See how easy or how complicated 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.760
 it works a lot of fun in the video 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 this room should be as already mentioned 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.760
 be installed on this board 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.230
 the slots for the frame are located 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.850
 here now I'm looking for you this 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.760
 Let's see what's happening here 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.300
 is the ram has so small here 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 limitations in it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.730
 they are now at the installation 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.800
 relatively important because you have to look 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.910
 that you like the edge and accordingly 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 also installed correctly 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.210
 I'll do the thing on this one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.129
 the two ram building blocks are me 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.199
 here it is only for the first time 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.329
 two 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.420
 and before the installation at all 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.260
 As always you have to start in yours 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 this is about the fn 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.680
 275 profile of us talk and in here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.020
 is an occupancy of you guys you 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 could orient the looks 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.720
 Let's see if we like it 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.000
 something very exactly 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.530
 So there is the possibility the board 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.360
 different with rank to prove 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 in case you have two ram slots 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.729
 you may want to prove the slot a1 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.939
 and b1 take the whole in the dual 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.040
 Channel mode works on the board 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.920
 this now means either 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.710
 this slot will be occupied and this slot 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.619
 or do we make the two to the b 1 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.659
 a and the b 28 will prove what is the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.110
 advantage or disadvantage 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.229
 you can see the anc slot here 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.369
 closer to the apu 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.020
 so it looks now it looks even a 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.939
 the heat sink is a little better 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.149
 relatively small and you want one 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.049
 full occupancy of the ram slots then you can 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.550
 a1 and b1 to accept the 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.739
 and exactly for the variant decides 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.910
 me now and now we come to 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.730
 Great installation it does not continue 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.440
 I can not worry how 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.900
 always before that he completely forgot me 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.400
 important to I will soon 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.620
 make an extra video because they often 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 we are asked to come to the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.930
 frame building block 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.180
 you see there is a small one here 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.130
 notching the counterpart to the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.680
 notch is also on the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.580
 corresponding ram slots and now is 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.320
 of course, of course 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.850
 both must fit into each other 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.260
 You must not try this here 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.330
 that can not work through it 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.510
 you make only mainboard and ram broken 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.280
 So quickly turn around again so must 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.770
 the whole look at the installation 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.780
 that means the two of these notch 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.370
 must match the notch 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.140
 only then does that work with the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.090
 installation the rest is relative 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.490
 just to the right and left are 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.840
 such small rails and there must be 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.780
 clean room with these corners 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.870
 that is carefully watching that one 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.310
 also go right start 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.630
 he is now right and left in the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.400
 already seemed to be here in these two 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.920
 parts can be turned back and forth klapphandy 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.140
 later turn the ram and now press 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.940
 just cautiously enter the room 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.160
 I still have the mainboard here 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.690
 This foam pad is the one 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.520
 quite useful now at the 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.140
 installation of the ram otherwise could 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.900
 that is, if it is not good there 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.700
 was fabricated when installing the rams 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.040
 I can break that in the back 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.110
 here with now prevent this 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.580
 who has such a fabric underlay 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.580
 every case used during installation 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.310
 the ram now enough talk I press 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.620
 Just put the ram down first 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.290
 the right side it is there click makes 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.180
 and this little slider here that 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.160
 you see whole here on the other 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.580
 side is not so now I press 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.590
 on the other side on 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.890
 and you just heard it is 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.230
 now properly installed right and 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.600
 The small levers on the left now hold the one 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.980
 ram building blocks and exactly the same 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.440
 Let's do it on the slot b 1 now 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.450
 yes, the next block is installed 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.620
 become 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.639
 next we have to look first 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.080
 that again the notch 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.240
 that's right, that means we're training once 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.189
 now the whole thing is over 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.770
 Look right and left that again 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:35.779
 in the guides come in the whole 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.259
 then right down it makes it click 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:42.620
 left to click on it and that was 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.659
 The installation of the rapeseed looks like that 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.180
 all done then of course you can 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.499
 even only the other slots prove whether 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.729
 I will do that I will 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.770
 see the next video if I have the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.389
 heat sink install what that 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.090
 I will not say one here 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.669
 he comes now if you on the cpu or 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.409
 apu again click on the first part 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.509
 the series namely for the installation of 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.520
 Apu above, I link you now 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.930
 time the new hardware forum motivation 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.550
 dot com / forum 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.500
 There you can ask your questions 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.629
 or comments also post 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.139
 to the current video that's all no 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.300
 problem 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.400
 it's about things like hardware 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.379
 video card installation your wish 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.000
 configuration or just yours 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.550
 ask to my hardware channel 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.539
 See you on Monday 10 I wish 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.539
 you have fun on youtube
