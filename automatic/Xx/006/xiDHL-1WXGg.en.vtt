product<00:01:40.690> set<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.350> now<00:01:41.590> so<00:01:41.979> it's<00:01:42.130> pretty<00:01:42.820> cool

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
product set to now so it's pretty cool

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.539 
product set to now so it's pretty cool
now<00:01:43.299> usually<00:01:44.049> you<00:01:44.229> would<00:01:44.350> run<00:01:44.530> 3d<00:01:44.920> wall<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.520> a

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
now usually you would run 3d wall and a

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.840 
now usually you would run 3d wall and a
cylinder<00:01:46.030> but<00:01:46.299> now<00:01:46.540> in<00:01:47.200> do<00:01:47.470> or<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.220> can<00:01:48.580> draw

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
cylinder but now in do or you can draw

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.419 
cylinder but now in do or you can draw
this<00:01:49.119> quicker<00:01:49.869> if<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.229> have<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.500> jar<00:01:50.740> set<00:01:51.070> so

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
this quicker if you have the jar set so

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.210 
this quicker if you have the jar set so
that's<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.149> only<00:01:52.179> difference<00:01:52.539> there<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
that's the only difference there to

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.930 
that's the only difference there to
