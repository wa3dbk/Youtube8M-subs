another<00:04:16.230> difference<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.950> didn't<00:04:17.160> notice

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
another difference that I didn't notice

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.289 
another difference that I didn't notice
was<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.480> forearms<00:04:19.230> here<00:04:19.760> seem<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.790> be<00:04:20.940> molded

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
was the forearms here seem to be molded

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.810 
was the forearms here seem to be molded
white<00:04:23.180> while<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.210> revealed<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.930> shield<00:04:25.820> seems

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
white while the revealed a shield seems

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.370 
white while the revealed a shield seems
to<00:04:26.970> have<00:04:27.060> been<00:04:27.210> molded<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.840> different<00:04:28.200> color

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
to have been molded a different color

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.520 
to have been molded a different color
probably<00:04:28.890> black<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.400> then<00:04:29.820> painted<00:04:30.420> like<00:04:30.660> I

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
probably black and then painted like I

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.710 
probably black and then painted like I
think<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.190> do<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.400> how<00:04:32.880> these<00:04:33.090> arms<00:04:33.540> look

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
think I do like how these arms look

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.100 
think I do like how these arms look
better<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.320> might<00:04:34.620> do<00:04:34.800> some<00:04:35.010> swapping<00:04:37.310> but

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
better so I might do some swapping but

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.980 
better so I might do some swapping but
I'm<00:04:40.110> really<00:04:40.410> glad<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:41.010> got<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.970> United<00:04:42.420> version

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
I'm really glad I got the United version

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.090 
I'm really glad I got the United version
I<00:04:43.140> think<00:04:43.260> it's<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.650> much<00:04:43.860> better<00:04:44.790> version<00:04:46.100> but

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
I think it's a much better version but

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.310 
I think it's a much better version but
before<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.850> money<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:49.070> think<00:04:50.070> it's<00:04:50.190> probably

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
before the money I think it's probably

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.530 
before the money I think it's probably
better<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.470> get<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.890> reveal<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.340> shield<00:04:53.580> but

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
better to get the reveal the shield but

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.360 
better to get the reveal the shield but
I<00:04:54.810> didn't<00:04:55.050> mind<00:04:55.200> spending<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.800> extra<00:04:55.980> bucks

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
I didn't mind spending the extra bucks

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.240 
I didn't mind spending the extra bucks
for<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.820> imported<00:04:58.070> United<00:04:59.070> version<00:04:59.550> I<00:05:01.250> just

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
for the imported United version I just

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.890 
for the imported United version I just
think<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.580> looks<00:05:02.820> much<00:05:03.300> better<00:05:05.480> but<00:05:06.480> it<00:05:06.750> may

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
think it looks much better but it may

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.540 
think it looks much better but it may
