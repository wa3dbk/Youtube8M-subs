are just like the regular cords of the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.980 
are just like the regular cords of the
red<00:01:40.140> yellow<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.710> white<00:01:41.540> if<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.720> recording

red yellow and white if you're recording
from<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.500> HDTV<00:01:44.869> then<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> chance<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
from an HDTV then you have the chance to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.370 
from an HDTV then you have the chance to
use<00:01:48.930> these<00:01:49.380> which<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.630> HD<00:01:51.630> television

use these which are for HD television

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410 
use these which are for HD television
but<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:52.979> it'll<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> lot<00:01:54.210> better

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
but I think it'll get a lot better

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
but I think it'll get a lot better
quality<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.130> HDTV<00:01:57.680> then<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.979> can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
quality so if you have HDTV then you can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.530 
quality so if you have HDTV then you can
use<00:01:59.340> these<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:01.579> lastly<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.880> obviously<00:02:03.390> need

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
red blue and green plunks back here if

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.280 
red blue and green plunks back here if
you<00:02:33.400> see<00:02:33.430> any<00:02:33.790> red<00:02:33.970> blue<00:02:34.240> or<00:02:34.360> green<00:02:34.570> plugs<00:02:34.930> back

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290

output are you looking for the board out

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.380 
output are you looking for the board out
or<00:02:55.780> output<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:57.370> would<00:02:57.489> be<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:58.060> would

there's a yellow thing right here I'd be
able<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.790> plug<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.840> those<00:03:13.989> cables<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.860> red

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
able to plug in those cables the red

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.940 
able to plug in those cables the red
white<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.640> yellow<00:03:15.760> cable<00:03:16.420> um<00:03:16.810> I'll<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.709> able

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
white and yellow cable um I'll be able

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.160 
white and yellow cable um I'll be able
to<00:03:18.100> plug<00:03:18.310> those<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.810> would<00:03:19.900> be<00:03:19.989> no

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
to plug those in and it would be no

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.009 
to plug those in and it would be no
problem<00:03:20.200> but<00:03:20.980> since<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.400> don't<00:03:21.430> have<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:22.060> um

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
problem but since I don't have it um

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.380 
problem but since I don't have it um
it's<00:03:23.709> kind<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.459> makes<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:25.030> little

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
it's kind of a it makes it a little

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.789 
it's kind of a it makes it a little
harder<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.290> um<00:03:26.860> if<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.420> if<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.560> have

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
harder so um if you do if you do have

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.100 
harder so um if you do if you do have
the<00:03:29.830> yellow<00:03:30.310> part<00:03:30.910> right<00:03:31.150> here<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.720> output

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
the yellow part right here in the output

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.880 
the yellow part right here in the output
then<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.070> can<00:03:33.190> just<00:03:33.340> plug<00:03:33.549> in<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.910> cables<00:03:34.390> and

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
then you can just plug in the cables and

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.009 
then you can just plug in the cables and
you<00:03:35.890> can<00:03:36.040> skip<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:37.470> part<00:03:38.470> in<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.830> next<00:03:40.019> apart

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
you can skip to a part in the next apart

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.460 
you can skip to a part in the next apart
later<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.799> video<00:03:41.980> but<00:03:42.540> if<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.720> don't<00:03:44.019> have

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.009 
you're going to need are these these are
the<00:04:06.910> splitters<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.360> I<00:04:07.540> was<00:04:07.690> talking<00:04:07.810> about

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
the splitters that I was talking about

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.580 
the splitters that I was talking about
these<00:04:08.290> are<00:04:09.090> officially<00:04:10.090> called<00:04:10.330> RCA<00:04:11.220> adapters

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
these are officially called RCA adapters

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.770 
these are officially called RCA adapters
yrc<00:04:14.590> so<00:04:14.980> there<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:16.000> have<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.269> make<00:04:16.479> sure<00:04:16.510> that

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
these you're going to have to plug them

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.080 
these you're going to have to plug them
in<00:04:43.660> into<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.350> input<00:04:44.650> instead<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.669> output

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
in into the input instead of the output

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.400 
in into the input instead of the output
so<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:47.229> just<00:04:47.410> plug<00:04:47.740> in<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.130> splitters<00:04:48.520> the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
so you just plug in the splitters the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.469 
so you just plug in the splitters the
