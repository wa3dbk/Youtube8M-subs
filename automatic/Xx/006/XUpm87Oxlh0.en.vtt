which is of tiny mini USB sort of at the
top<00:05:29.470> here<00:05:30.070> so<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:31.780> see<00:05:32.020> underneath<00:05:32.380> here<00:05:32.800> I

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
top here so you see underneath here I

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.070 
top here so you see underneath here I
don't<00:05:34.630> know<00:05:34.810> if<00:05:34.840> you<00:05:34.930> can<00:05:35.020> see<00:05:35.230> it<00:05:35.290> or<00:05:35.380> not<00:05:35.500> but

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
there it's somewhere in the middle there

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:53.720 
there it's somewhere in the middle there
so<00:05:41.950> what<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.670> do<00:05:42.820> is<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.600> you<00:05:43.900> line<00:05:44.140> it<00:05:44.320> up

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:01.380 

and<00:05:54.730> then<00:05:55.480> you<00:05:55.540> just<00:05:55.780> clip<00:05:56.050> it<00:05:56.080> up<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:01.270> then

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
and then you just clip it up and then

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.670 
and then you just clip it up and then
you<00:06:01.480> go<00:06:01.660> you<00:06:02.080> have<00:06:02.230> a<00:06:02.260> wired<00:06:02.560> connection

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
you go you have a wired connection

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.270 
you go you have a wired connection
flipping<00:06:05.680> it<00:06:05.800> over

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
flipping it over

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.560 
flipping it over
you<00:06:06.880> got<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:08.050> laser<00:06:08.910> which<00:06:09.910> is<00:06:10.090> here<00:06:10.419> and

you got the laser which is here and
there's<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:11.530> switch<00:06:13.200> if<00:06:14.200> you<00:06:14.770> flip<00:06:15.040> it<00:06:15.070> to<00:06:15.340> the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
there's a switch if you flip it to the

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.820 
there's a switch if you flip it to the
