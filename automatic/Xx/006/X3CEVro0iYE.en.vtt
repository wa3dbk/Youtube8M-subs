00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.910
 comfortable to tourmaline crystals 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.980
 are the main example of minerals that 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 charged or electrically when the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.050
 subject to temperature changes 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.330
 permanent electrical potential and 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.260
 are found in various colors and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.300
 tonalities the tourmaline initially 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.060
 developed without granites by activities 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.120
 volcanic rocks turned into rally rocks 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.450
 in the black whose composition was changed 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.430
 by the action of heat in there apreça 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.400
 several scientific studies on the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.740
 tourmaline and concluded that it is the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.290
 single stone that receives the electrons from 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.630
 atmosphere being from then on 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.820
 called electric stone 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.310
 this tremendous electric and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.280
 It stimulates the nervous system and regulates 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.930
 temperature of the body to 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.630
 heart beats 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.890
 the hormonal rate and increases the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.440
 body 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.310
 the existing infrared a tourmaline 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.410
 stimulate cells facilitates metabolism 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.510
 helps in the active dermal renewal 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.160
 blood circulation and act as 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.830
 various information 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.989
 simone silva showed us step by step 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.640
 how is the skin treatment with the 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.890
 tourmaline stone 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.130
 first we do an analysis of the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.220
 skin right Silmar skin for example is 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.790
 a skin that contains a lot of micro tavo 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.000
 season cloves little ones at 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.030
 Sometimes we do not see it but it's 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.390
 disrupts the luminosity of the skin, not 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 leaves sometimes skin so beautiful and also 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.989
 the carnations who have many carnations produces 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.519
 an excess of oiliness on the skin 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.700
 then the person will always be with the 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:15.690
 skin shining does not give an appearance 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.109
 very good then in the national 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.390
 We are going to work with 10 sessions 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.530
 because she has some sun spots 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.860
 accentuated here 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.370
 here is also cheese but we go 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.710
 treat both hands while cases 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.750
 so melo will extract you that 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.190
 usually we make a sepsis in 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.250
 skin removing free radicals there 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.970
 who does the treatment will use on the face 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.270
 any time you clean the rosso 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.960
 to use only the soap let the 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.570
 line 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.940
 massage is important because it is 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.690
 She also works with drainage 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.790
 easy then sometimes the customer she has 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.500
 a very large retention of books 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.360
 especially the woman in the face and so 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.210
 massage while while you are 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.350
 doing the cleaning is important to you 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.030
 shine 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.830
 this excess of liquid to the clean 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.729
 after paying attention when the customer 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.260
 A cleaning finish is a treatment. 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.139
 with the thinnest face 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.640
 this association also the client can 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.120
 is doing it at home 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.570
 even those who do not treat skin and 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.570
 in a salon in a clinic is very 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.380
 important for skin makes this choice 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:48.270
 option at least once a week you 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:52.710
 treats the skin only by doing this 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.410
 important that you remove your skin not only 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.530
 of the face of the body also the cells 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.919
 dead to renew the dermis 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:07.050
 here we will want a mask for 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:09.240
 extraction and concentration of the nails is 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.760
 that we will also work in the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:19.080
 skin elastin for those who have flaccidity 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.760
 we also work with the reduction of 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.560
 expression lines 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.120
 neco is that in the eye area 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.979
 especially the contour of the mouth that 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.820
 we are going to make this application where 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:35.280
 let it dry to remove remembering 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.110
 also that with treatment despite its 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.350
 job 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.800
 which contains no acid is very important 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:48.140
 that the customer uses sunscreen is the 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.840
 sunscreen people is even the law 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.750
 because they do not make a kind of treatment the 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.380
 use of day-to-day sunscreen it is 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.650
 fundamental to health is not bad. 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.630
 just in the face also on the shoulders of the 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.490
 is exposed to the sun 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.610
 she also told us about the 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.290
 properties that tubaline stone 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:13.340
 gives our beauty the tourmaline 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:16.520
 when used in skin treatment 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:20.600
 it works on the inflammations, when the 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.270
 customer he has here is inflamed skin 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.000
 very inflamed also to the active 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:30.650
 circulation stimulates the cells 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.890
 and facilitates the metabolism of the face and 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.530
 also in renovation nothing 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.600
 the course done by simone silva in são 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.660
