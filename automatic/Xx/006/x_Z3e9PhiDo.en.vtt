00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
this is this is the e6000 glue it really

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.289 
this is this is the e6000 glue it really
really<00:02:50.079> sticks<00:02:50.409> now<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:50.919> can<00:02:51.340> slightly<00:02:51.819> sand

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
really sticks now you can slightly sand

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
the back of the tiles to make them stick

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.159 
the back of the tiles to make them stick
better<00:02:54.370> I've<00:02:54.549> already<00:02:54.849> done<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.540> then

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
better I've already done that and then

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.500 
better I've already done that and then
you<00:02:56.349> just<00:02:56.379> take<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:56.950> glue<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.879> you<00:02:58.180> put<00:02:58.389> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
you just take the glue and you put the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.089 
you just take the glue and you put the
glue<00:02:58.689> in<00:02:58.719> the<00:02:58.900> back<00:02:59.079> now<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.680> don't<00:02:59.889> want<00:03:00.069> to

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
glue in the back now you don't want to

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.789 
glue in the back now you don't want to
go<00:03:00.219> crazy<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.180> glue<00:03:01.209> because<00:03:02.169> too<00:03:02.680> much

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
go crazy with the glue because too much

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.379 
go crazy with the glue because too much
glue<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.459> it's<00:03:03.760> going<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:03.909> squirt<00:03:04.180> out<00:03:04.239> the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
glue and it's going to squirt out the

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.199 
glue and it's going to squirt out the
sides<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.870> here<00:03:05.349> is<00:03:05.439> a<00:03:05.560> tip<00:03:05.829> be<00:03:06.400> careful<00:03:07.000> not

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
sides and here is a tip be careful not

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.000 
sides and here is a tip be careful not
to<00:03:07.389> get<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.689> glue<00:03:07.719> on<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.049> top<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> tiles

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
to get the glue on the top of the tiles

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.490 
to get the glue on the top of the tiles
because<00:03:09.459> when<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.450> spray<00:03:10.810> them<00:03:10.959> at<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.349> end

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
because when you spray them at the end

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.379 
because when you spray them at the end
with<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.829> polyurethane<00:03:12.159> spray<00:03:12.639> you<00:03:12.969> will<00:03:13.209> be

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
with the polyurethane spray you will be

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.599 
with the polyurethane spray you will be
able<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.750> see<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.290> slight<00:03:14.560> marks<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.159> the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
able to see a little slight marks on the

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.129 
able to see a little slight marks on the
top<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.030> if<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.209> anal<00:03:16.569> you<00:03:16.599> want<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:16.989> make

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
top so if you're anal you want to make

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.649 
top so if you're anal you want to make
sure<00:03:17.349> there's<00:03:17.590> no<00:03:17.709> glue<00:03:18.069> on<00:03:18.280> top<00:03:18.609> also<00:03:19.479> make

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
sure there's no glue on top also make

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.449 
sure there's no glue on top also make
sure<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.139> cover<00:03:20.620> your<00:03:20.799> workspace<00:03:21.310> because

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
sure you cover your workspace because

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.000 
sure you cover your workspace because
the<00:03:21.699> glue<00:03:21.879> can<00:03:22.060> get<00:03:22.239> kind<00:03:22.479> of<00:03:22.599> messy<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.709> again

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
the glue can get kind of messy so again
