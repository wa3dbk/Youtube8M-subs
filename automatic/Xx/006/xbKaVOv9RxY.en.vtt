00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
of where I met other than in the URL bar

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.029 
of where I met other than in the URL bar
it's<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.000> straight<00:00:57.289> link<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.549 
it's just a straight link right to that
image<00:00:59.250> which<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.239> guess<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.719> fine<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
image which I guess is fine but for a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
image which I guess is fine but for a
marketing<00:01:01.949> branding<00:01:02.430> standpoint<00:01:02.730> that's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
marketing branding standpoint that's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.810 
marketing branding standpoint that's
probably<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.080> idea<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:05.489> thinking

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
probably not a good idea so and thinking

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.370 
probably not a good idea so and thinking
about<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.330> thinking<00:01:06.570> man<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> write<00:01:07.140> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
about it I was thinking man I write this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170 
about it I was thinking man I write this
photo<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.830> doesn't<00:01:08.280> quite<00:01:08.430> fit<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> text<00:01:09.000> so
