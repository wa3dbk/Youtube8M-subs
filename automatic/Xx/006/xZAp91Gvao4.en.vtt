00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:10.700
 Well, we have 20 liters 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:17.970
 fresh squeezed apple juice with pulp 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:21.210
 practically idiot i am going to put 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.480
 two kilograms of sugar the whole thing 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.140
 stir and leave 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.610
 under the top I will cover with gauze and leave the days 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 five scattered look 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.739
 will we have a fermentation without yeast 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.539
 but so I got it acquired I 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.859
 2 bottles of 20 liters each poured 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:57.239
 10 liters of apple juice with mashed potatoes and in 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:01.449
 each added a kilo of sugar 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.289
 holy matter is now dissolved for 5 days 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.940
 hole digestion in open view from above 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:12.850
 just sentence the cloth to 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.319
 nothing fell until the trash hit then 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:22.060
 if in five days this thing is for me 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:25.270
 I will ferment to the top with sugar 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:31.409
 syrup at the rate of 4 and a half liters 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 water per kilogram of sugar and I will wait 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.310
 complete ejection 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:50.320
 but it took just three days the whole thing 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:57.000
 we began to ferment hissed for cracking I 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 already decided not to wait until the syrup poured in here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.900
 sugar 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.330
 in each module four and a half 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.040
 liters of water and a kilo of sugar roughly 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.830
 speaking in each battalion is now two 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.130
 kilograms of sugar and four each 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.400
 half a liter of water added this 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.490
 the whole thing is wandering now the whole thing is taking 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.290
 something aside didn't interfere 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.800
 I have how much it will wander so much 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.800
 were wandering I'll wait until the end 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.550
 Well, a month has passed and 10 days 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.220
 the gloves are still standing 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.680
 but everyone is friends 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.620
 sour sugar-free sugar worked 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.720
 we will wait no more today 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.209
 overtake 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.030
 3 weeks left until the new year 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:04.599
 things should have time to insist on 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.599
 apple spivak what 's the way 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.850
 but pick up the head 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:24.620
 without sukhoparnika bubbler directly but here 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.620
 we got 3 liters 600 grams 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:33.850
 homebrew from apple brogue is not enough 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.830
 considering that there was pure apple juice 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.770
 but imagine sofia we did not put there 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.030
 4 kilograms of sugar to a general 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.820
 nothing happened but for the new year 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.830
 we now have apple backs 3 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.860
 liter 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:57.590
 Calvados is we tasting today in 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.300
 Generally this is small but I hope that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:09.740
 it cost almost six weeks 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:12.580
 stood Braga would not say that at the exit 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.590
 the product has some apple flavor 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.590
 only light shade 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.210
 but the opportunity this thing will open 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.610
 shipboard stand in general we made it 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.270
 I do not know whether I will repeat it seems to me 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.540
 next time I will try all the same 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.790
 make apple mash on yeast and 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.760
 check the difference considering that without 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.169
 yeast to be able to eat will be an option than 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.820
 compare then be sure to tell 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.820
 all bye to new meetings
