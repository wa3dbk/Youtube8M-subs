you've added a lot of custom ingredients
you<00:01:30.240> may<00:01:30.450> need<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> add<00:01:30.869> those<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.170> before<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you may need to add those in before you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.830 
you may need to add those in before you
try<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.490> use<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> importer<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
try and use the importer because it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.030 
try and use the importer because it
won't<00:01:33.990> find<00:01:34.200> any<00:01:34.350> matches<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.920> those

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
won't find any matches for those

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740 
won't find any matches for those
ingredients<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.729> it'll<00:01:36.329> tell<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> how<00:01:36.659> many

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
ingredients and it'll tell you how many

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
ingredients and it'll tell you how many
it<00:01:37.079> couldn't<00:01:37.350> find<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.090> option

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it couldn't find but you have an option

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
it couldn't find but you have an option
of<00:01:39.450> either<00:01:39.600> moving<00:01:40.200> those<00:01:40.439> over<00:01:40.710> ahead<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
of either moving those over ahead of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.910 
of either moving those over ahead of
time<00:01:41.280> or<00:01:41.640> waiting<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.530> moving<00:01:43.530> those<00:01:43.619> over

manually<00:01:44.369> at<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> later<00:01:44.670> time<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> that's<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
manually at a later time so that's the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
manually at a later time so that's the
quick<00:01:47.520> quick<00:01:47.909> overview<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> import<00:01:48.810> wizard
