00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
actually editing my own ships I didn't

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.309 
actually editing my own ships I didn't
have<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.239> particular<00:03:08.689> part<00:03:09.049> of<00:03:09.200> the

tutorial<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:11.030> was<00:03:11.420> jumping<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.230> gun<00:03:12.379> there<00:03:12.650> a

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
tutorial I was jumping the gun there a

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.709 
tutorial I was jumping the gun there a
little<00:03:12.920> bit<00:03:13.099> but<00:03:13.969> there<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.269> is<00:03:14.299> by

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
little bit but there it is by

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.119 
little bit but there it is by
right-clicking<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.739> delete<00:03:15.980> the

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
right-clicking you can delete the

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.670 
right-clicking you can delete the
components<00:03:16.870> had<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.900> known<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.409> lot

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
components had I known that a lot

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.349 
components had I known that a lot
earlier<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.459> would<00:03:19.579> have<00:03:19.700> saved<00:03:19.969> me<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.269> lot

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
earlier that would have saved me a lot

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.360 
earlier that would have saved me a lot
of<00:03:20.629> frustration<00:03:21.379> in<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.650> ship<00:03:21.920> editor<00:03:22.310> um

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
of frustration in the ship editor um

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.589 
of frustration in the ship editor um

that feature is in this game I I am a
big<00:03:36.169> fan<00:03:36.500> of<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:38.510> particular<00:03:38.930> ash<00:03:39.829> bank<00:03:40.159> what

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
big fan of that particular ash bank what

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.220 
big fan of that particular ash bank what
is<00:03:40.519> this<00:03:40.669> what's<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.269> damage<00:03:41.599> on<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.049> that's

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
is this what's the damage on that that's

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.819 
is this what's the damage on that that's
twenty<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.040> damage<00:03:43.400> on<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:43.669> is<00:03:43.879> 30<00:03:44.560> range<00:03:45.560> is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
twenty the damage on this is 30 range is

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:53.280 
twenty the damage on this is 30 range is
60<00:03:46.430> projectile<00:03:47.030> speed<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.419> 20

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.080 

range<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.470> 50<00:03:54.980> so<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:55.370> has<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.580> little<00:03:55.910> bit

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
range is 50 so this has a little bit

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.330 
range is 50 so this has a little bit
longer<00:03:56.300> range<00:03:56.600> will<00:03:56.780> put<00:03:56.990> will<00:03:57.890> put<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.070> couple

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
longer range will put will put a couple

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.590 
longer range will put will put a couple
of<00:03:58.640> these<00:03:58.760> on<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.150> front<00:03:59.510> here<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> couple

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
of these on the front here get a couple

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.760 
of these on the front here get a couple
small<00:04:02.900> reactors<00:04:04.480> go<00:04:05.480> back<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.870> our<00:04:05.900> guns<00:04:06.380> will

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
small reactors go back to our guns will

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.570 
small reactors go back to our guns will
do<00:04:06.920> particle<00:04:07.780> cannons<00:04:09.970> will<00:04:10.970> do<00:04:12.370> one<00:04:13.370> small

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
do particle cannons will do one small

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:21.430 
do particle cannons will do one small
engine<00:04:14.090> there<00:04:15.970> one<00:04:16.970> small<00:04:17.239> center<00:04:17.720> there<00:04:20.440> can

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
engine there one small center there can

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.270 
engine there one small center there can
put<00:04:21.590> another<00:04:21.799> engine<00:04:22.510> no<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.890> is<00:04:25.010> too<00:04:25.250> much

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
put another engine no that is too much

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.280 
put another engine no that is too much
power<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.990> we'll<00:04:30.260> call<00:04:30.530> this<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:32.110> will<00:04:33.110> call

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
power and we'll call this a will call

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:41.040 
power and we'll call this a will call
this<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:34.090> rocket<00:04:35.770> freig

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.469 

learn<00:04:41.710> more<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.190> wasn't<00:04:42.580> sure<00:04:42.970> if<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.210> wanted<00:04:43.300> to

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
learn more I wasn't sure if I wanted to

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.240 
learn more I wasn't sure if I wanted to
call<00:04:43.659> it<00:04:43.690> just<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.020> frigate<00:04:44.409> forget<00:04:44.800> there<00:04:45.009> for

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
call it just a frigate forget there for

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:56.149 
call it just a frigate forget there for
a<00:04:45.280> second<00:04:46.889> so<00:04:49.440> let's<00:04:50.440> go<00:04:50.710> ahead<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:53.879> move<00:04:54.879> on

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
a second so let's go ahead and move on

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.890 
a second so let's go ahead and move on
it<00:04:57.159> should<00:04:57.370> be<00:04:57.400> saved<00:04:57.789> let's<00:04:58.240> let's<00:04:58.509> build<00:04:58.810> a

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
it should be saved let's let's build a

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:13.230 
it should be saved let's let's build a
couple<00:04:59.110> of<00:04:59.379> rows<00:05:05.759> so

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.529 

so<00:05:13.810> now<00:05:13.900> we'll<00:05:14.050> have<00:05:14.199> four<00:05:14.530> ships<00:05:14.830> built<00:05:15.130> us<00:05:15.819> if

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
so now we'll have four ships built us if

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.629 
so now we'll have four ships built us if
there<00:05:16.780> are<00:05:16.840> 33<00:05:17.289> turns<00:05:17.620> each<00:05:17.889> that<00:05:18.250> I<00:05:18.400> might

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
there are 33 turns each that I might

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:32.499 
there are 33 turns each that I might
take<00:05:18.819> a<00:05:18.849> while<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:23.789> let's<00:05:24.789> see<00:05:24.970> you

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.839
