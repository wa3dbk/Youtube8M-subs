00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 but 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:11.160
 and I say the word corvette though 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.340
 you hear an engine of this v8 engine with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.190
 that's the noise of man is not that thing 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.750
 strong to see that engine is a v8 engine 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 which is manufactured as it is known that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.210
 any other engine not when talking 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.939
 high performance in corvette without 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 no doubt it is requires certain 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.009
 craftsmanship remains 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.260
 present even in the biggest brands and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.530
 even in the most emblematic models what 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.730
 I invite us to see how a weapon is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.730
 corp engine 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.230
 to the best self-technical style I propose 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.120
 that we are going to witness how a 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.070
 engine but this time I also charge it for 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.320
 one thing that we have by the window the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.420
 ecology the fuel economy in 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.100
 the use of foundations also knows why 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.559
 I say it because you can not me 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.780
 deny that driving a car with the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.909
 true in the 700 hp can 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.060
 be extremely fun but 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.429
 700 is empty magistrate take the proxy 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.210
 how economical today is still impossible 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:19.069
 let's go to a plant where weapons are 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.960
 handcrafted the engines for the 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.149
 correct the engines where this one should 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.970
 have a person who has to put together 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.560
 all the engine and not only would 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.200
 brothers but in the end he puts his 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.200
 I stamp his signature saying I at least two 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 what we are seeing is a powerful 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.259
 gold motor money 7 liters almost nothing 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.420
 corvette with a technology 2012 but 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.250
 adapted these monsters that have 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.750
 tendency to disappear but 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.360
 fortunately he keeps insisting 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.280
 it is still very funny what is 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.490
 watching now is how the blog is assembled 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.710
 the skeleton of the module in which you 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.690
 placed the signal you run with the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.090
 cranks nobody the very special 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.380
 prepared to support it the regime of 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.380
 that engine we pistons too very 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.540
 specials and a fastening system 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.209
 crankshaft also very special if you 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.459
 they are fixed and observed to see that you have two 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.709
 balls per bench that's to give 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.900
 much more solidity much faster given 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.700
 to withstand the power of the engine that is 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.440
 a compressed engine has a compressor 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.480
 that is going to inject air and goes to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.220
 arrive with great force is very 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.190
 submitted but let's move forward 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.830
 now we are going to place a shampoo that is 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.420
 to prevent the oil from getting beat and if 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.090
 I'm going to tour many revolutions 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.250
 minute the crankcase the lower part 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.410
 of the engine and is the oil and is 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.440
 subjected to the crankshaft revolution 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.750
 ingredients mix with air 7 of 107 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.239
 I am placed that time to avoid the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.920
 shake the shaker the air step too 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.510
 to win some ponies that 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.430
 they would spend on stirring 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.250
 we are seeing singing to face the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.530
 trap in front and we are placing the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.209
 carter a poster that is not the poster of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.620
 that you did a lot in 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.110
 another destination they call poster 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.140
 structural are aluminum and are 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.420
 extremely rigid because that insistence 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.790
 make it from rigid aluminum of the child to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.650
 that dissipates the heat more easily the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.900
 oil that cool the market part 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.489
 of oil good part in one's own 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.010
 crankcase cools the other debris 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.260
 rigid because it is so rigid so that the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.440
 engine is not deformed because the price is 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.599
 he sees it as a mass of solid iron the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.159
 engine moves the same but moves and 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.200
 since we are talking about lights that are 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.450
 of hundredths of a millimeter good 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.650
 then it can be altered if there 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.810
 displacements due to temperature 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.389
 of glasses to mechanical solicitation 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.190
 of the engine then with that it helps that 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.990
 that shoe box to say it some 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.600
 way to be more solid 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.270
 here our special trainers go to 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.730
 place the cylinder caps and this one goes 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.680
 to have a very special device for 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.920
 adjust the cylinder heads to 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.410
 put on the pins there you have it because 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.060
 all bolts are adjusted at the same time 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.460
 they avoid distortions if I adjust 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.080
 the screws one by one I can make 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.610
 that the system is formed in some way 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.670
 way instead if I do everything 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.230
 secondary we will not move forward 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.510
 let's start placing other 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.700
 accessories in this case are going to be the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.650
 they call the seesaws the seesaws are 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.940
 those who come from a power station that 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.530
 called camshaft that through a 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.480
 mechanism make the valves 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.700
 open and close in the order that 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.500
 has to do we adjust everything 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.260
 we have to adjust and we keep going 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.630
 now we are putting the top 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.130
 which would be the valve cover for the 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.890
 some way in which it was closed and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.740
 some little black machines that are coils 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.960
 this motor needs a coil for 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.430
 cylinder by big type energy 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.840
 Caesar and also because of a frequency issue 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.340
 so that it does not get saturated in the coils 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.170
 all other so many but forming in 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.460
 internet here we are placing the 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.889
 intake system 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.139
 intake manifold multiple emissions 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.880
 I have to call differently and up 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.880
 of that we are going to place that gadget that 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.580
 it is a compressor no more and no less with its 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.740
 corresponding cooler because a 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.020
 winner because the compression work 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.000
 causes the temperature of the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.680
 air the appliance temperature and there 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.949
 that cool you have your own 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.810
 cooler that compressor deals with 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.849
 getting more air into the engine could 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.740
 naturally aspirate and if the engine 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.900
 breathe horses appear for 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.639
 life nutrition this is an engine that 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.349
 has approximately the power of two 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.900
 trucks spinning together and a torque 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.820
 will also provide that we are all 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.590
 are motor guarantees and all the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.039
 transmission calls them paul train the 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.560
 English 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.320
 that is guaranteed for 160 thousand 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.360
 kilometers and has a gigantic 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.490
 power a wonderful because a 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.229
 impressive amount of energy that 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.570
 transmit you have to transmit will be the 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.130
 speed box and the transmission to 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.949
 is the placement in what is known 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.720
 as motor flywheel and the amount 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.000
 interesting of screws that have to 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.949
 withstand the spin effort of that 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.139
 flyer and later we go to the 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.319
 mute placement 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.389
 in the clutch where you start to 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.520
 try to convey the power of your 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.930
 engine to the speed box there we are 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.629
 looking at the close-up of the compressor 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.219
 also and a cover that stays its 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.169
 celestial that is simply by 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.240
 large prolixity formed for 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.610
 protect it from vehicle hits 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.379
 finished when you accelerate it if 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.249
 They are fortunate to make beech trees and 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.249
 there he will let go
