00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.030
 greetings to all androidworld.it friends 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.150
 today I want to focus on inspiring az 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.950
 ultrÃ  and on his office side i 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.619
 accessories that are there on the right not 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.180
 they are for decorative purposes instead 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.860
 of the tools we will use 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.180
 really this thing is really a lot 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.360
 Interesting 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.160
 I want to move them aside for a moment e 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.029
 show you a moment office suite 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.219
 usually in the reviews name does not 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.129
 I almost see more because now the 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.539
 office suites more or less everywhere well 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.660
 considered the same consideration applies 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.249
 actually even on this z over though 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.339
 given the very generous dimensions 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.390
 I think it fits particularly 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.859
 for office use and management 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.320
 documents here for example we can 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.539
 see the word document management that is 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.339
 truly remarkable 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.129
 unfortunately the change is only relative 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.649
 to the paid version of office 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.319
 suite we can go full screen 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.280
 to use all the space of these 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:14.480
 6 inches and 4 same thing applies to the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:18.800
 xls here we can not then 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.900
 modify it for powerpoint files and 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.560
 also for pdf this is the power point 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.340
 exact with lots of presentations with 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.460
 transitions and finally the classic pdf in 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.930
 this case here it is in this case the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.930
 same office suite manual 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.360
 here we always have this bar that is 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.520
 can drag now ok here they were 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.230
 few pages but in short 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.850
 closed this parenthesis I want to talk to you 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.060
 of the possibility of using it 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.890
 screen with a pencil or a penalty 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.020
 metal now actually these plastic 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.510
 for the top and metal part e 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.410
 so it will work I can show you 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.270
 instead how it doesn't work with a 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.950
 any plastic accessory 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.390
 there are more layers then gods 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 more levels on the screen than they are 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.280
 applied to be answered instead 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:17.190
 with metal and pencil 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.900
 actually also rubber though a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.840
 a little less precisely here 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.230
 just for the type of accessory 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.790
 from type of material excused that 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.950
 so with the pencil you can exactly 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.799
 do what you do exactly with the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 then browse the web 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.150
 obviously don't pinch to zoom 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.579
 but you can do exactly what 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:50.730
 you expect then we can open 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:51.989
 even the notes and quietly write 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.489
 obviously we will meet the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.010
 human writing but we will see it between a 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.629
 instant for what happens it happens that 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.709
 if I drag the notification bar 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.209
 down is the classic sony se 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.760
 do it with a pencil though 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.849
 we have to do see it not from above but 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.040
 taking the dragging down 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.840
 this z ultra will recognize that we have 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.819
 used a pencil and will allow us to 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.220
 take a new note or make a 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.060
 new sketch in haste actually one 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.620
 once arrived at the new note 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.359
 exactly what we were there 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.040
 so it's not particularly useful but 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.410
 the recognition of the works 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.160
 writing works well but then it is 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.160
 so I do a test 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.950
 hello everybody hello i learned in 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.400
 automatic and adds spaces 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.400
 we see 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.890
 hi to all our readers has 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.700
 must work is not fluid 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.349
 how to write on a sheet of paper 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.910
 living because the screen does much more 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.730
 resistance however works 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:08.300
 you can tick the word to delete it 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:11.750
 if I write we see reader is instead 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.269
 I wanted readers I can do so apple 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.709
 so it really changes automatically 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.359
 really an idea very very well 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.690
 thought this os 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.550
 this applies to the pencil as it is worth 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.729
 also for we have said an object 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.930
 metallic a metallic pen like 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.360
 maybe just a punishment that 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.240
 professional than this one 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.780
 actually serves only to draw yes 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.680
 I can also show you this is the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.680
 software to perform a sketch 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.950
 obviously the possibility is not present 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.030
 to calibrate the route based on 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.000
 pressure as the line does not come 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.700
 you try to fano straight line is 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.770
 quite straight but not too much 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.250
 it's still a good tool for drawing 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.169
 because it's definitely better than a finger 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.090
 draw with pencil so surely 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.490
 a pencil can come into your hand 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.830
 anywhere will therefore allow you not to 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.380
 you should no longer have to owe yourself no more 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.360
 buy a separate accessory for 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.000
 do what we are showing you but 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.810
 just any pencil you need 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.510
 you can find in your office for 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.919
 do any draw for this focus 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.780
 on use with accessories and on 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.099
 part office is all a greeting dai 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.099
