00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you just don't need the oil so this is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.219

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
looking good so from here what I do is I

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
looking good so from here what I do is I
add<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.799> tablespoon<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.640> Worcestershire

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360

organic<00:01:30.900> chicken<00:01:31.710> broth<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
organic chicken broth now this is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.179 
organic chicken broth now this is
actually<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> tip<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> got<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.920> reader

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
actually a tip that I got from a reader

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
actually a tip that I got from a reader
at<00:01:35.400> clean<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.759> delicious<00:01:35.900> adrianel

at clean and delicious adrianel

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.920 
at clean and delicious adrianel
and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.430> idea<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.210> whenever<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.750> work

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and the idea here is whenever you work

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469 
and the idea here is whenever you work
with<00:01:39.960> ground<00:01:40.770> turkey<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.490> ground<00:01:41.549> chicken<00:01:42.000> has

with ground turkey or ground chicken has
a<00:01:42.509> tendency<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.229> very<00:01:43.590> dry<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.490> by<00:01:44.670> adding

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
a tendency to get very dry so by adding

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.179 
a tendency to get very dry so by adding
the<00:01:45.329> extra<00:01:45.689> liquid<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.350> vegetables<00:01:46.979> it's
