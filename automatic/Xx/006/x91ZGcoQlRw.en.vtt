00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
Connecticut PlayStation Network what are

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.250 
Connecticut PlayStation Network what are
your<00:00:13.549> thoughts<00:00:13.670> about<00:00:13.850> those<00:00:14.750> capabilities

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
your thoughts about those capabilities

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.080 
your thoughts about those capabilities
when<00:00:15.590> it<00:00:15.680> comes<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:16.099> applying<00:00:16.279> to<00:00:16.820> the

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
when it comes to applying to the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.240 
when it comes to applying to the
skateboarding<00:00:17.570> job<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:18.170> think<00:00:18.920> there's<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:19.130> lot

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
skateboarding job I think there's a lot

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.510 
skateboarding job I think there's a lot
of<00:00:19.279> potential<00:00:19.580> to<00:00:19.939> do<00:00:20.230> motion<00:00:21.230> control<00:00:21.890> games

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
of potential to do motion control games

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.269 
of potential to do motion control games
specially<00:00:23.060> with<00:00:23.210> skateboarding<00:00:23.980> we<00:00:24.980> found

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
specially with skateboarding we found

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.450 
specially with skateboarding we found
also<00:00:25.610> with<00:00:26.029> just<00:00:26.560> with<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.739> release<00:00:28.040> of<00:00:28.220> ride

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
also with just with the release of ride

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.190 
also with just with the release of ride
that<00:00:28.759> not<00:00:28.880> everyone<00:00:29.180> wants<00:00:29.329> to<00:00:29.450> get<00:00:29.779> up<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.110> be

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
that not everyone wants to get up and be

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.990 
that not everyone wants to get up and be
active<00:00:30.380> that<00:00:30.919> is<00:00:31.009> playing<00:00:31.279> games<00:00:31.460> even<00:00:31.700> if<00:00:31.880> we

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
active that is playing games even if we

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.450 
active that is playing games even if we
encourage<00:00:32.419> them<00:00:32.450> to<00:00:32.630> be<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.530> I<00:00:33.829> think<00:00:33.950> that<00:00:34.280> if

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
encourage them to be so I think that if

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.639 
encourage them to be so I think that if
we<00:00:34.489> were<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.970> do<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.149> game<00:00:35.480> that<00:00:36.140> had<00:00:36.410> motion

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
we were to do a game that had motion

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.709 
we were to do a game that had motion
controls<00:00:37.280> we<00:00:37.969> would<00:00:38.149> have<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.300> make<00:00:38.600> it

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
controls we would have to make it

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.780 
controls we would have to make it
available<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:39.200> also<00:00:39.649> do<00:00:39.860> joystick<00:00:40.430> controls

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
available to also do joystick controls

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.310 
available to also do joystick controls
you<00:00:41.000> have<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.660> option<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:41.930> one<00:00:42.110> or<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.290> other

seeing<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.120> same<00:03:18.330> words<00:03:18.510> instead<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.050> just

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
seeing the same words instead of just

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.470 
seeing the same words instead of just
their<00:03:19.440> employee<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:21.090> that's<00:03:21.300> when<00:03:21.420> I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
their employee and that's when I

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.630 
their employee and that's when I
remember<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.080> don't<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.980> want<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> do

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
remember like I don't think I want to do

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.390 
remember like I don't think I want to do
a<00:03:23.670> game<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.180> them<00:03:24.890> what<00:03:25.890> thing<00:03:26.160> we're<00:03:26.280> going

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
a game with them what thing we're going

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160 
a game with them what thing we're going
to<00:03:26.459> do<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.640> anyway<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.090> they<00:03:27.750> don't<00:03:27.930> exist

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
to do it anyway and they don't exist

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.410 
to do it anyway and they don't exist
today<00:03:28.350> either<00:03:28.790> yeah<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.090> think<00:03:33.180> that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
today either yeah and but I think that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.300 
today either yeah and but I think that
probably<00:03:34.260> one<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.620> proudest<00:03:34.950> moments

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
probably one of the proudest moments

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.680 
probably one of the proudest moments
which<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.670> after<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> first<00:03:36.239> image<00:03:36.510> released

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
which was after the first image released

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.009 
which was after the first image released
you<00:03:37.530> know<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:37.830> most<00:03:38.220> concern<00:03:38.610> about<00:03:39.019> escape

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
you know I was most concern about escape

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.559 
you know I was most concern about escape
the<00:03:40.739> hardcore<00:03:41.310> escaped<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:41.970> streets<00:03:42.299> take

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
the hardcore escaped in the streets take

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.780 
the hardcore escaped in the streets take
on<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.260> how<00:03:43.560> they<00:03:43.920> interpreted<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.640> if

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
on it and how they interpreted it if

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.610 
on it and how they interpreted it if
they<00:03:44.940> thought<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.299> was<00:03:45.590> legitimate<00:03:46.590> and

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
they thought it was legitimate and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.759 
they thought it was legitimate and
represents<00:03:47.549> gaming<00:03:47.850> well<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.989> some<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.739> my

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
represents gaming well and some of my

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.699
