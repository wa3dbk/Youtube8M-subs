00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.500 
of uniqueness to it and I've talked
about<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.459> before<00:03:59.580> one<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.910> our<00:04:00.060> other<00:04:00.150> videos

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510

i did on the wii RT MPG main page and
one<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.810> things<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.050> said<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.380> that

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
one of the things that I said is that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.040 
one of the things that I said is that
the<00:04:05.160> actually<00:04:05.970> developer<00:04:06.450> said<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.870> they

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
the actually developer said that they

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.220 
the actually developer said that they
made<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.680> canvas<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.720> or<00:04:10.110> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
made this like a canvas and that or the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.479 
made this like a canvas and that or the
environment<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.800> like<00:04:10.920> your<00:04:11.040> canvas<00:04:11.370> and

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
environment is like your canvas and

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.400 
environment is like your canvas and
basically<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.360> build<00:04:12.690> upon<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.260> don't

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410
