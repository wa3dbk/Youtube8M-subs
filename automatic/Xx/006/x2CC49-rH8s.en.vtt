00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
is that they give the option they do a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
is that they give the option they do a
photosphere<00:01:22.439> which<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.770> only<00:01:23.009> exclusive<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
photosphere which is only exclusive to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.140 
photosphere which is only exclusive to
Nexus<00:01:24.090> devices<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.979> Nexus<00:01:25.979> based<00:01:26.220> roms<00:01:26.520> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
Nexus devices or Nexus based roms so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.399 
Nexus devices or Nexus based roms so
that<00:01:27.299> means<00:01:27.479> photosphere<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.080> i<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that means photosphere which i think is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.690 
that means photosphere which i think is
a<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.680> cool<00:01:28.799> feature<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.189> multiple
