maintain<00:04:26.070> it<00:04:26.580> sort<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:27.000> hundred<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.450> eighty

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
maintain it sort of a hundred and eighty

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.320 
maintain it sort of a hundred and eighty
degrees<00:04:27.690> status<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:29.220> around<00:04:29.550> about<00:04:29.790> 25

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
degrees status for around about 25

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.780 
degrees status for around about 25
minutes<00:04:30.630> but<00:04:31.260> go<00:04:31.470> into<00:04:31.680> all<00:04:32.010> about<00:04:32.250> half<00:04:32.610> an

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
minutes but go into all about half an

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.200 
minutes but go into all about half an
hour<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.750> shift<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.740> little<00:04:35.210> tin

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
hour in you can shift the little tin

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.450 
hour in you can shift the little tin
around<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.840> it's<00:04:36.960> got<00:04:37.080> even<00:04:37.410> heat<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.310> also

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
around so it's got even heat and also

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.250 
around so it's got even heat and also
just<00:04:38.850> check<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> temp<00:04:39.450> if<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:39.750> gone<00:04:39.900> down<00:04:40.110> to

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
just check the temp if it's gone down to

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.350 
just check the temp if it's gone down to
160<00:04:40.950> you<00:04:41.580> can<00:04:41.700> just<00:04:41.850> get<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.000> little<00:04:42.180> bit<00:04:42.270> of

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
160 you can just get a little bit of

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.120 
160 you can just get a little bit of
kindling<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.930> just<00:04:43.320> throw<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.590> up<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> few

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
kindling and just throw it up a few

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.350 
kindling and just throw it up a few
little<00:04:44.310> extra<00:04:44.550> bits<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:44.820> kindling<00:04:45.090> I'll<00:04:45.240> just

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
little extra bits of kindling I'll just

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.750 
little extra bits of kindling I'll just
take<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.810> heat<00:04:45.990> slowly<00:04:46.440> up<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.430> keep<00:04:47.640> it

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
take the heat slowly up and keep it

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.500 
take the heat slowly up and keep it
around<00:04:47.910> if<00:04:48.420> it's<00:04:48.750> around<00:04:49.020> about<00:04:49.280> 170<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.790> 185

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
around if it's around about 170 to 185

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.570 
around if it's around about 170 to 185
that's<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.380> sweet<00:04:52.680> spot<00:04:52.830> that's<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.310> really
