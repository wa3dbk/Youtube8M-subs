00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
go to work the geigerrig hydration

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.420 
go to work the geigerrig hydration
system<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.619> end<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.860> drinking<00:01:59.130> more<00:01:59.399> water

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
system you end up drinking more water

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.039 
system you end up drinking more water
than<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> traditional<00:02:00.899> hydration

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
than you do with a traditional hydration

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
than you do with a traditional hydration
pack<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.070> reason<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.969> because

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pack and the reason for this is because

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.539 
pack and the reason for this is because
the<00:02:03.719> system<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.560> shoots<00:02:04.890> water<00:02:05.130> into<00:02:05.460> your

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the system just shoots water into your

the system just shoots water into your
mouth<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:06.000> means<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> don't<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.689> to

mouth which means that you don't have to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.859 
mouth which means that you don't have to
slow<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:08.310> get<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.700> heart<00:02:09.000> rate<00:02:09.209> down<00:02:09.450> or

these systems than they do with a

these systems than they do with a

it wasn't advice

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.940 
it wasn't advice
to<00:02:26.640> fill<00:02:26.819> up<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> stream<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.750> river<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.230> lake<00:02:28.650> or

a pond and the reason for that is

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.150 
a pond and the reason for that is
because<00:02:30.510> they<00:02:30.840> become<00:02:31.050> petri<00:02:31.560> dishes<00:02:31.739> for
