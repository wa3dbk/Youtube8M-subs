00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.840
Due to copyright infringements, alterations all from me.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.380

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.540

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.080

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.300
Don't fucking shoot him!

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.500
What the hell is happening?!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.660
Well go get him, guy!

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.060
*Laughs uncontrollably*

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.680
Dude, that clip ended with fucking comedy?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.420
The hell you talking about fucking food?!

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.560
I don't fucking know!

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.780
WHO THE FUCK GIVES A SHIT ABOUT HIS HAT?!

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.780
Fuck you.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.240
Oh my God, WHO THE FUCK WOULD KNOW THIS?!

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.620
Fucking nailed it!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.460
Knew it!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.500
Oh, well-

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.160
I mean-

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.080
Obviously it's-

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.000
*Groaning noises*

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.860

Tom Cruise is in Collateral?!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.460
WHAT?!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.440
I should see that movie.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.880
That's just a fucking stupid line.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.520
If he said that in EVERY movie, Robert De Niro would NOT have a fucking career!

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.040
Yeah, it better be Midnight Run!

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.160
It better NOT fucking be All...

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.860
Robert!

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.720
I saw fucking all three Meet the Parents movies!

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.020
ALL THREE!

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.760
Game: I have a problem in compositing!

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.260
Michael: Fuck!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.900
Name that Movie!

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.960
What the hell is this?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.740
Oh.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.280
It's totally got a body now.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.280
It was just-

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.320
It was invisible.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.380
Uh...

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.480
He's in a recording studio.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.660
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.460
AHHHHHHH!

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.140
What happened?

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.620
Why are you in Iron Man 2?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.720
I want more money!

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.040
Yeah, that's what you get!

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.120
That's what you get!

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.240
Fuck you, fitch!

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.200
I guess I should've-

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.060
Uh, answer this question.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.560
No-

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.240
Oh shit.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.880
Well, I'm in 1st place...

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.880
against no one.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.120
Game: Movie may belong to.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.700
Michael: AHHHH!

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.360
Oh shit!

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.800
I thought I was gonna get road runnered there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.560
What is-

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.140
What is this?

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.040
What um-

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.780
What am I fucking selecting here?

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.260
I've never seen any of these.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.800
Corey Haim, dead.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.640
Corey Feldman, gonna be dead soon.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.060
Oh, come on!

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.600
FUCK!!

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.940
Nobody gives a shit.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.340
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THESE FUCKING MOVIES!

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.620
Where do these come out?!

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.880
WHO THE FUCK IS MIRA SORVINO?!

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.460

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.100
WHO THE FUCK SAW BEWITCHED?!

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.360
Brazil, of course!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.500
The fucking movie,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.280
Brazil.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.740
If I knew how to buzz in.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.620
Oh, here we go.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.120
Here we g-

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.640
Oh,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.420
it's Buffy.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.700
The answer was Buffy.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.080
Are you kidding me?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.260
WHAT?!

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.460
AHHHHHHHH, SHIT!!!

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.160
I actually knew the answer to that, and I hit-

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.220
I hit Taxi.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.820
'Cause it's that TV show.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.060
That sounds very similar to the movie, but is not the movie.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.780
ALSO...

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.460
never seen that movie.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.680
"The tabloids won't leave me alone."

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.380
*Alien language*

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.160
HOW THE FUCK-

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.220
ALL OF THEM SAID THAT!!

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.120
I'm in 'Zoolander'.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.640
Fucking-

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.160
No.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.500
It was Ben Stiller.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.080
The fucking star of the goddamn movie.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.400
I went with Jack Black.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.040
I went with a wild card!

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.580
Yeah, maybe they'll throw him in there!

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.960
NO SHIT BEN STILLER WAS IN THE FUCKING MOVIE!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.120
HE'S ON THE GODDAMN FUCKING POSTER!!

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.180
HOW THE HELL WAS -9,183 A SMASHING SUCCESS?!

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.920
Because that's what you just called it!

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.800
I am fucking horrible at trivia.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:21.900
