here<00:00:01.930> is<00:00:02.080> my<00:00:02.320> home<00:00:03.180> brewed<00:00:04.800> set<00:00:05.800> up<00:00:05.980> to<00:00:06.640> be<00:00:07.210> like

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
here is my home brewed set up to be like

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.610 
here is my home brewed set up to be like
the<00:00:08.010> torpedo<00:00:09.010> system<00:00:09.309> from<00:00:09.760> Sierra<00:00:10.120> Nevada

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620

let<00:00:11.620> me<00:00:11.769> explain<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.860> is<00:00:15.070> a<00:00:15.099> fermenter<00:00:15.760> from

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:16.169 
let me explain this is a fermenter from

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:22.950 
let me explain this is a fermenter from
sabko<00:00:17.369> brewing<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:19.810> have<00:00:19.960> a<00:00:20.909> fermenting<00:00:21.960> IPA

here<00:00:23.489> this<00:00:24.489> is<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:24.789> dip<00:00:24.999> tube<00:00:25.239> that<00:00:25.449> comes<00:00:25.689> out

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
here this is the dip tube that comes out

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.279 
here this is the dip tube that comes out
of<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.019> bottom<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.329> flow<00:00:28.689> down<00:00:28.989> this

of the bottom see the flow down this
tube<00:00:29.559> here<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:31.509> bubbles<00:00:32.079> are<00:00:32.230> from

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
tube here the bubbles are from

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.340 
tube here the bubbles are from
carbonation<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.520> not<00:00:33.670> oxygen<00:00:34.540> ingress<00:00:37.350> comes

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.490 
carbonation and not oxygen ingress comes
down<00:00:38.650> here<00:00:39.040> and<00:00:39.250> goes<00:00:39.400> into<00:00:39.640> this<00:00:39.970> two<00:00:40.960> gallon

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500

through<00:00:50.080> here<00:00:52.710> into<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:54.240> liquid<00:00:55.240> hop<00:00:56.140> rocket

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
through here into a liquid hop rocket

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.670 
through here into a liquid hop rocket
and<00:00:57.880> then<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.060> bottom<00:00:58.480> which<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.350> filled<00:00:59.590> with

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
and then the bottom which is filled with

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.069 
and then the bottom which is filled with
two<00:01:00.010> three<00:01:00.579> three<00:01:00.880> ounces<00:01:01.329> of<00:01:01.540> hops<00:01:02.489> leaf<00:01:03.489> hops

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
two three three ounces of hops leaf hops

two three three ounces of hops leaf hops
comes<00:01:05.079> out<00:01:05.289> the<00:01:05.439> top<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.780> aquarium<00:01:08.170> tubing<00:01:08.380> is

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
comes out the top the aquarium tubing is

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.910 
comes out the top the aquarium tubing is
nice<00:01:08.890> because<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.549> allows<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.590> bubbles<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.799> go

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
nice because it allows the bubbles to go

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.620 
nice because it allows the bubbles to go
down<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.369> move<00:01:12.520> through<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:12.999> system<00:01:13.270> rather

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
down and move through this system rather

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.809 
down and move through this system rather
than<00:01:13.810> build<00:01:14.170> up<00:01:14.350> an<00:01:14.499> airlock<00:01:14.859> it's<00:01:15.639> gone

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
than build up an airlock it's gone

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.590 
than build up an airlock it's gone
behind<00:01:16.210> there<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.630> along<00:01:17.109> here<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.420> then

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
behind there and along here and then

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.999 
behind there and along here and then
back<00:01:19.899> in<00:01:20.170> through<00:01:20.499> this<00:01:20.939> compression<00:01:21.939> fitting

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009

fermenter<00:01:28.030> as<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.139> can<00:01:29.319> see<00:01:29.649> we're<00:01:29.889> right<00:01:30.130> at

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
fermenter as you can see we're right at

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:33.260 
fermenter as you can see we're right at
about<00:01:30.959> 68<00:01:31.959> degrees

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
about 68 degrees

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.209 
about 68 degrees
that's<00:01:34.270> boosted<00:01:34.810> that<00:01:34.929> up<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.259> into<00:01:35.499> the<00:01:35.619> 70s

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
that's boosted that up to into the 70s

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.569 
that's boosted that up to into the 70s
and<00:01:36.340> then<00:01:36.869> slow<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:37.929> get<00:01:38.109> up<00:01:38.229> there<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:39.490> you

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
and then slow to get up there do you

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.779 
and then slow to get up there do you
have<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.759> temperature<00:01:40.630> controller<00:01:41.109> here<00:01:41.789> this

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
have a temperature controller here this

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.999 
have a temperature controller here this
heat<00:01:43.060> band<00:01:43.359> here<00:01:43.719> is<00:01:43.899> warm<00:01:44.439> now<00:01:44.679> and<00:01:44.920> it's

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
heat band here is warm now and it's

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.709 
heat band here is warm now and it's
trying<00:01:45.279> to<00:01:45.340> keep<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.609> warm<00:01:45.819> the<00:01:46.090> garage<00:01:46.329> isn't

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
trying to keep it warm the garage isn't

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.429 
trying to keep it warm the garage isn't
that<00:01:46.869> cold<00:01:47.170> with<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:49.329> this<00:01:49.479> going<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:49.990> it's

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
that cold with all this going on it's

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
that cold with all this going on it's
quite<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.950> little<00:01:52.049> enterprise<00:01:53.049> Sierra<00:01:53.619> Nevada

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
quite a little enterprise Sierra Nevada

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.669 
quite a little enterprise Sierra Nevada
probably<00:01:55.090> uses<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.509> system<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.170> has<00:01:56.349> about

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
probably uses a system that has about

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.279 
probably uses a system that has about
the<00:01:56.889> same<00:01:56.999> amount<00:01:57.999> of<00:01:58.329> hop<00:01:58.509> volume<00:01:58.959> for<00:01:59.259> a

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
the same amount of hop volume for a

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.779 
the same amount of hop volume for a
volume<00:01:59.709> of<00:01:59.829> beer<00:02:00.299> maybe<00:02:01.299> I've<00:02:01.569> got<00:02:01.719> a<00:02:01.779> more<00:02:02.139> but

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
volume of beer maybe I've got a more but

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.079 
volume of beer maybe I've got a more but
I'm<00:02:03.789> doing<00:02:04.060> my<00:02:04.179> best<00:02:04.359> to<00:02:04.509> make<00:02:04.599> it<00:02:04.899> work
