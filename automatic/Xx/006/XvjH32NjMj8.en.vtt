great<00:00:47.479> musician<00:00:47.799> play<00:00:48.799> is<00:00:49.610> they<00:00:49.940> seem<00:00:50.299> to<00:00:50.620> have

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
great musician play is they seem to have

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.360 
great musician play is they seem to have
this<00:00:51.890> very<00:00:52.670> fluid<00:00:53.150> motion<00:00:53.690> where<00:00:54.320> they're<00:00:54.530> not

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
this very fluid motion where they're not

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.030 
this very fluid motion where they're not
wasting<00:00:55.909> much<00:00:56.120> time<00:00:56.589> there's<00:00:57.589> not<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.769> lot<00:00:58.010> of

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
wasting much time there's not a lot of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.119 
wasting much time there's not a lot of
effort<00:00:58.580> in<00:00:58.760> releasing<00:00:59.390> their<00:00:59.720> fingers<00:01:00.129> so

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
effort in releasing their fingers so

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.430

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
we're going to talk about a guide finger

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.440 
we're going to talk about a guide finger
and<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:14.060> pivot<00:01:14.330> finger<00:01:14.860> let<00:01:15.860> me<00:01:15.950> start<00:01:16.250> with

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
and a pivot finger let me start with

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.810 
and a pivot finger let me start with
with<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.960> guide<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:18.950> look<00:01:19.250> at<00:01:19.370> this<00:01:19.520> G

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
with the guide if you look at this G

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.540 
with the guide if you look at this G
chord<00:01:20.120> I've<00:01:20.330> got<00:01:20.510> framed<00:01:20.840> up<00:01:21.050> here<00:01:21.380> as<00:01:22.340> I

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
chord I've got framed up here as I

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.230 
chord I've got framed up here as I
switch<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.300> d7<00:01:24.430> you'll<00:01:25.430> notice<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.030> what<00:01:26.210> I

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
switch to d7 you'll notice that what I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.480 
switch to d7 you'll notice that what I
can<00:01:26.510> do<00:01:26.690> is<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.050> leave<00:01:27.380> my<00:01:27.620> ring<00:01:27.860> finger<00:01:28.250> leave

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
can do is is leave my ring finger leave

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.270 
can do is is leave my ring finger leave
my<00:01:28.670> third<00:01:28.910> finger<00:01:29.150> on<00:01:29.500> so<00:01:30.500> what<00:01:30.710> rather<00:01:31.070> than

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
my third finger on so what rather than

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.170 
my third finger on so what rather than
release<00:01:31.640> all<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.360> fingers

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
release all of the fingers

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.840 
release all of the fingers
I'm<00:01:35.180> gonna<00:01:35.360> use<00:01:35.600> my<00:01:35.840> ring<00:01:36.229> finger<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.920> guide<00:01:37.430> me

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
I'm gonna use my ring finger to guide me

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.749 
I'm gonna use my ring finger to guide me
into<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.689> transition<00:01:39.380> from<00:01:39.619> G<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.920> d7<00:01:40.369> and

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
into that transition from G to d7 and

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.710 
into that transition from G to d7 and
then<00:01:41.450> back<00:01:41.810> from<00:01:42.500> d7<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.880> G<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.479> really

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
then back from d7 to G so a really

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.770 
then back from d7 to G so a really
simple<00:01:44.840> concept<00:01:46.090> but<00:01:47.090> you'd<00:01:47.270> be<00:01:47.360> surprised

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
simple concept but you'd be surprised

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.740 
simple concept but you'd be surprised
how<00:01:47.990> powerful<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.770> when<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.580> leave<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:50.119> finger

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
how powerful is when you leave a finger

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.020
