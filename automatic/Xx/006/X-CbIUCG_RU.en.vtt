00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello, how are you, how are you happy? 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.670
 say hello in this video if you stay 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.130
 with me and accompany me from showing you 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.960
 how to make this Christmas pine that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:18.930
 aten the video accompanies mind I show you 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:21.449
 everything is obviously done to create 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.119
 a tree we will need then clean 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 pipes in green color but of course this 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 depend on your taste you can substitute 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.840
 the color and use the tone that you more 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.610
 you prefer to create the tree that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 more you like I'm going to take the first 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 clean alive and I will cut pieces in 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.140
 this case I will need three of the same 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 size the pieces that you have left not the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.590
 you're going to throw away the keepsakes since we 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 will serve later once 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.280
 have the three pieces you're going 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.710
 match in this way you will take them 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 with your two hands and right in the middle 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.739
 you are going to roll them 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.780
 to form in this way one of the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.630
 bodies of the tree the next step will be 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.309
 Then cut small pieces for 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.559
 go forming each of the twigs 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.900
 that will form the pine foliage 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.030
 we are going to need two for each of 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.369
 we are going to place the first one in the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.700
 point on one of the strips and we're going to 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 roll up 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.280
 and we will place it then and each one 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.649
 of the balls in this way with the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.420
 six remaining wands then we go to 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.189
 Replace them with a little 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.990
 space just below which we have already 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.840
 placed and we will have something like 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.700
 this ok now we're going to need to perform 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.520
 different measures obviously as 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.709
 let's make a pine we will have to place 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.530
 from a large piece and in a way 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.569
 descending we will be forming more pieces 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.700
 small until you reach the tip that 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.500
 it will be just one more star but 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.719
 will attach it to the top surface 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.209
 a few extra sticks so good for 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.039
 thus form the pine tree cup well 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.780
 it will be necessary now if you join them all 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.599
 for the center for this I will help from 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.549
 wire covered in a brown color although 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.739
 Of course, you can also help me 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.439
 cleaner pipes to form the center 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.119
 of the pine what the tree will support 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.920
 so for this case I'm going to use 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.530
 the two solutions I will take a piece 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.119
 wire lined tone coffee and clear 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.759
 I will also use very clean pipes 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.160
 to camouflage the wire once 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.019
 is already attached to the tree and this 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.819
 so that it does not break much with the design 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.560
 I'm going to take the wire and I'm going to fold it 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.220
 in half and start then by 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.770
 the part 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.770
 high long I'll introduce it like this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.770
 in this way and I'm going to start 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.680
 roll up to hold it 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.870
 I'm going to introduce the next one and I'm going to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.710
 go trying that the branches remain 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.050
 alternate if there is a space between 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.480
 this one and this one is good I'm going to try that 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.880
 that space matches the branch of the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.530
 top to fill this gap and I'm going 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.780
 to try to give the same number of 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.720
 turns to leave the same space 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.730
 between branch and branch once they are 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.340
 all subjects then we will have to separate 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.110
 each of the branches to leave them 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.000
 a symmetrical shape and that are not left 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.310
 hollows in the foliage and pine with 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.760
 clean pipes that I reserve I will cover the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.760
 trunk 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.329
 the next step will be to get a 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.129
 small container in this case used 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.739
 this little boat we will put a 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.049
 plaster preparation on the inside 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.000
 well, so that it serves as a basis for 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.010
 support the pin in this way to 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.959
 hold it and that I do not fall 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.879
 help with heavy objects to support 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.620
 and that in this way it does not move and that 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.720
 the crook so I put it in this 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.060
 way and I 'll wait for it to dry for 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.099
 that sets the plaster to continue with the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.230
 decoration to hide the base and that 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.140
 see a little more aesthetic I've cut 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.359
 this box of diamond foami with 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.970
 contact glue help I'm going to 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.620
 line the entire base of the pot 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.720
 supports the pine so that I stay 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.609
 this form will then be necessary 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.010
 Decorate your pine as you like it more 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.840
 that for that I will need a meter of this 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.700
 sequence of plastic balls in a 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.129
 golden tone to match the base 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.019
 and with the help of contact glue 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.579
 hot silicone in this case let's go 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.950
 placing the we can go doing 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.049
 contact at strategic points for 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.670
 avoid losing the design that we have 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.799
 determined so that we are left then 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.690
 in this way then it will be 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.550
 necessary to put the spheres as 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.670
 we need a material that does not weigh 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.140
 use these chocolates as they do not weigh 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.910
 will prevent you from losing the stability of 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.180
 tree so with help of glue 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.980
 we are going to place them strategically 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.350
 depending on your taste and where it seems 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.420
 that looks nicer and to finish the 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.650
 design will only be necessary to put some 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.330
 detail at the tip in this case 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.700
 I will use a ball 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.710
 but good you can use a 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.510
 star or whatever else you think is 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.550
 see better and I show you then the 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.760
 final result as you know the clean 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.250
 pipes are real materials very 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.770
 economic I do not remember exactly the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.110
 cost but it's pennies each 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.000
 them so the expense is really mini 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.580
 the result for my opinion is beautiful and 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.830
 good will serve to decorate a desk 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.410
 to give it to a teacher at a 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.540
 friend or a friend your girlfriend your boyfriend me 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.220
 I think it's a very original gift and very 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.690
 suitable for these dates 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.850
 I wish then that you liked the 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.610
 I thank you very much for the time 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.509
 of this reproduction that you are very well 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.509
 until next time
