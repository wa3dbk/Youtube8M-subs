the<00:02:29.010> front<00:02:29.280> way<00:02:29.489> is

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the front way is

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.690 
the front way is
is<00:02:32.080> some<00:02:32.710> update<00:02:33.670> your<00:02:33.880> Windows<00:02:34.530> normally

is some update your Windows normally

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.590 
is some update your Windows normally
happens<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.330> little<00:02:37.630> thing<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.350> updates

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
happens here a little thing that updates

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.270 
happens here a little thing that updates
sometimes<00:02:40.600> when<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.080> updates<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.830> doesn't

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
sometimes when it updates it doesn't

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.360 
sometimes when it updates it doesn't
work<00:02:42.550> because<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.810> don't<00:02:43.990> know<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:44.410> you

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
work because I don't know really you

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.510

have<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.610> wait<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> another<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:47.040> while<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.400> it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
have to wait it another a while so it

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.580 
have to wait it another a while so it
comes<00:02:48.790> against<00:02:49.270> update<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.870> we'll<00:02:50.080> fix<00:02:50.440> that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
comes against update and we'll fix that

what happened to me the second time it's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.260 
what happened to me the second time it's
fixed<00:02:53.950> because<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> update<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.240> you
