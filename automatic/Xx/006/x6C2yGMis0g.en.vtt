00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you're playing around with the software

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.939 
you're playing around with the software
in<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.640> contained<00:00:51.090> environment<00:00:51.739> sandbox<00:00:52.739> is

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
in a contained environment sandbox is

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.850 
in a contained environment sandbox is
actually<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.699> contained<00:00:54.300> environment<00:00:54.449> term<00:00:55.230> in

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
actually a contained environment term in

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.380 
actually a contained environment term in
the<00:00:56.070> development<00:00:56.550> field<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.000> computer

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the development field of computer

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
the development field of computer
industry<00:00:57.930> where<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.859> could<00:00:59.100> take<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> section

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
industry where you could take a section

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
industry where you could take a section
of<00:00:59.969> your<00:01:00.329> computer<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.230> isolate<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of your computer and you can isolate it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.789 
of your computer and you can isolate it
move<00:01:02.760> things<00:01:03.059> around<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:04.290> affect<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
move things around and not affect the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.429 
move things around and not affect the
rest<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.159> your<00:01:05.220> system<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.960> had<00:01:07.140> maybe

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
rest of your system so if you had maybe

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.800 
rest of your system so if you had maybe
something<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.909> questionable<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.780> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
something that was questionable like a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
something that was questionable like a
virus<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.439> something<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
virus or something like that or you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010 
virus or something like that or you
wasn't<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.909> weren't<00:01:12.119> sure<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> virus

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
wasn't you weren't sure it was a virus

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
wasn't you weren't sure it was a virus
you<00:01:13.290> could<00:01:13.439> throw<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> sandbox<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you could throw it in the sandbox and it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.550 
you could throw it in the sandbox and it
wouldn't<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.780> fact<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.259> entire

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
wouldn't have in fact your entire

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.660 
wouldn't have in fact your entire
computer<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.030> version<00:01:18.750> 8<00:01:19.520> we've<00:01:20.520> got

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
computer now in version 8 we've got

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.490 
computer now in version 8 we've got
something<00:01:20.880> kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> similar<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.170> sandbox

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
something kind of similar it's a sandbox

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.480 
something kind of similar it's a sandbox
for<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.250> audio<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.530> put<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
for your audio so you can put the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.730 
for your audio so you can put the
software<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> sandbox<00:01:27.540> mode<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.409> will

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
software in the sandbox mode it will

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
software in the sandbox mode it will
output<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> master<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.720> audience<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
output the master to your audience and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.200 
output the master to your audience and
then<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> fool<00:01:32.250> around<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.670> both<00:01:32.880> decks

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
then you can fool around with both decks

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
then you can fool around with both decks
it's<00:01:33.450> almost<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.869> having<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.290> second

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it's almost like having a second

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's almost like having a second
computer<00:01:35.189> available<00:01:35.729> where<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.270> play

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
computer available where you would play

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.789 
computer available where you would play
around<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.170> personal<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
around with it for personal use and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.530 
around with it for personal use and
nobody<00:01:38.280> would<00:01:38.400> hear<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:38.820> doing<00:01:39.060> but

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
nobody would hear what you're doing but

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
nobody would hear what you're doing but
now<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.229> done<00:01:40.500> inside<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
now it can all be done inside the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.700 
now it can all be done inside the
software<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.970> guess<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> best<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> explain

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
software I guess the best way to explain

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
software I guess the best way to explain
it<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.329> jump<00:01:45.810> into<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> software

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it is to actually jump into the software

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730 
it is to actually jump into the software
and<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.479> make<00:01:49.049> sense<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> for

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and see if I can make sense of it for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380 
and see if I can make sense of it for
you<00:01:49.829> guys<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.549> clear<00:01:50.939> concise

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
you guys a little more clear concise

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.240 
you guys a little more clear concise
manner<00:01:51.600> let's<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> look

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.830 

all<00:01:56.250> right<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.759> few<00:01:56.789> notes<00:01:57.179> before<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.719> get

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
all right just a few notes before we get

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.800 
all right just a few notes before we get
started<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:59.070> sandbox<00:01:59.729> mode<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.539> an

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
started with sandbox mode it is an

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.499 
started with sandbox mode it is an
audio-only<00:02:01.229> mode<00:02:01.859> so<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.789> cannot<00:02:03.119> use<00:02:03.179> it

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
audio-only mode so you cannot use it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.410 
audio-only mode so you cannot use it
with<00:02:03.659> video<00:02:03.929> currently<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.939> will<00:02:06.090> need<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
with video currently you will need to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.350 
with video currently you will need to
have<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.899> master<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> headphone<00:02:08.459> channel<00:02:08.940> so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
have a master and headphone channel so

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.059 
have a master and headphone channel so
this<00:02:09.569> means<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.679> able<00:02:10.799> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
this means that you will not be able to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.520 
this means that you will not be able to
use<00:02:11.280> an<00:02:11.459> external<00:02:11.790> mixer<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.780> any<00:02:13.049> controller

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
use an external mixer so any controller

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.259 
use an external mixer so any controller
that<00:02:13.739> supports<00:02:14.160> master<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.849> headphones

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
that supports master and headphones

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.289 
that supports master and headphones
which<00:02:15.540> most<00:02:15.810> do<00:02:16.049> or<00:02:16.340> any<00:02:17.340> audio<00:02:17.790> card<00:02:18.090> that

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
which most do or any audio card that

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.190 
which most do or any audio card that
sapote<00:02:18.660> supports<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.590> well<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.810> let's<00:02:21.989> go

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
sapote supports that as well so let's go

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.520 
sapote supports that as well so let's go
in<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.620> actually<00:02:22.830> see<00:02:23.549> what<00:02:23.900> sandbox<00:02:24.900> does<00:02:25.230> I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
in and actually see what sandbox does I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.539 
in and actually see what sandbox does I
have<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.709> couple<00:02:25.920> tracks<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:26.599> that<00:02:27.599> are

it transfers that song in the deck into

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.490 
it transfers that song in the deck into
the<00:03:02.760> sandbox<00:03:03.329> mode<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.139> now<00:03:04.290> your

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the sandbox mode so that is now your

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.629 
the sandbox mode so that is now your
master<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.600> watch<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.989> playhead

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
master so if you watch the playhead

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:16.930 
master so if you watch the playhead
inside<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.840> sandbox<00:03:10.260> mode<00:03:11.720> look<00:03:12.720> around<00:03:13.079> here

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:29.140 

and<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.150> doesn't

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.280 
to find a spot where I can mix that we
want<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.409> be<00:03:41.180> around<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:42.480> somewhere<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:43.230> is

want<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.480> go<00:03:52.139> about<00:03:52.819> here<00:03:54.139> around<00:03:55.139> here<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:55.409> can

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
want to go about here around here I can

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.399 
want to go about here around here I can
actually<00:03:55.799> stop<00:03:59.540> I'll<00:04:00.540> mark<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.810> with<00:04:01.139> a<00:04:01.169> hot

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
actually stop I'll mark that with a hot

actually stop I'll mark that with a hot
cue<00:04:01.709> as<00:04:01.829> well<00:04:02.719> so<00:04:03.719> now<00:04:03.900> if<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.379> get<00:04:04.530> out<00:04:04.650> of

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
cue as well so now if you get out of

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.800 
cue as well so now if you get out of
sandbox<00:04:05.129> modes<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.730> play<00:04:05.849> marker<00:04:06.329> will

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
sandbox modes of play marker will

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.199 
sandbox modes of play marker will
actually<00:04:07.169> move<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.579> see<00:04:11.609> that<00:04:12.060> we're

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
actually move you can see that we're

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.819 
actually move you can see that we're
coming<00:04:12.510> up<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.659> that<00:04:12.780> point<00:04:13.169> that<00:04:13.349> we<00:04:13.530> want<00:04:13.739> to

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
coming up to that point that we want to

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.259 
coming up to that point that we want to
mix<00:04:13.980> -<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:16.380> I'm<00:04:17.009> gonna<00:04:17.130> be<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.430> master<00:04:17.669> mixer

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
mix - so I'm gonna be the master mixer

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:26.840 
mix - so I'm gonna be the master mixer
here<00:04:18.449> but<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.780> kind<00:04:19.229> of<00:04:19.289> find<00:04:19.590> it

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.700 

not<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.390> great<00:04:27.750> next<00:04:28.880> idea

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
not a great next idea

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.969 
not a great next idea
now<00:04:32.190> we've<00:04:32.370> gone<00:04:32.550> into<00:04:32.880> our<00:04:32.910> second<00:04:33.449> track

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
now we've gone into our second track

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.340 
now we've gone into our second track
we've<00:04:34.979> mixed<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.639> where<00:04:35.850> we<00:04:36.000> wanted<00:04:36.419> to

we've mixed it in where we wanted to

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.650 
we've mixed it in where we wanted to
and<00:04:38.830> we<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.100> go<00:04:39.220> back<00:04:39.430> into<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.730> sandbox<00:04:40.210> mode

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
and we can go back into the sandbox mode

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.230 
and we can go back into the sandbox mode

we<00:04:54.080> can<00:04:54.230> find<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:54.560> mix<00:04:54.800> everyone

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
we can find a mix everyone

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.350

I'm<00:04:56.650> going<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.860> say<00:04:57.039> great<00:04:57.490> about

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
I'm going to say great about

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.240 
I'm going to say great about
there<00:04:59.810> looks<00:05:00.110> like<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.349> good<00:05:00.590> make<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:01.009> point

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
there looks like a good make that point

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.649 
there looks like a good make that point
so<00:05:01.490> I'll<00:05:01.580> just<00:05:01.729> mark<00:05:01.909> again<00:05:02.330> with<00:05:02.539> another

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
so I'll just mark again with another

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:09.909 
so I'll just mark again with another
hotkey<00:05:03.289> for<00:05:03.500> simplicity<00:05:06.580> back<00:05:07.580> into<00:05:07.909> here

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
hotkey for simplicity back into here

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.869 
hotkey for simplicity back into here
I<00:05:10.780> spot<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.080> liked<00:05:12.520> where<00:05:13.520> there's<00:05:13.699> a<00:05:13.729> big

down<00:05:14.150> three<00:05:14.810> voltage<00:05:16.240> lines<00:05:17.240> up<00:05:17.539> a<00:05:17.659> bit<00:05:18.759> I'll

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
down three voltage lines up a bit I'll

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.809 
down three voltage lines up a bit I'll
mark<00:05:20.150> that<00:05:20.889> so<00:05:21.889> now<00:05:22.069> if<00:05:22.159> we<00:05:22.219> get<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.550> sandbox
