00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
definitely worth quite a bit of coinage

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.120 
definitely worth quite a bit of coinage
especially<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.030> third<00:01:51.720> inform<00:01:52.170> Gareth

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
especially I think third inform Gareth

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.060 
especially I think third inform Gareth
Bale<00:01:53.340> could<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.210> gonna<00:01:54.720> drag<00:01:55.110> him<00:01:55.290> over<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
Bale could be I'm gonna drag him over a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.289 
Bale could be I'm gonna drag him over a
million<00:01:56.280> Jack<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.820> he<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.060> under<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
million Jack and he will go under a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.100 
million Jack and he will go under a
million<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.049> mean<00:01:58.439> um<00:01:59.540> it's<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.810> at

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
million because I mean um it's right at

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
million because I mean um it's right at
left<00:02:01.409> mid<00:02:01.590> his<00:02:01.770> second<00:02:02.100> inform<00:02:02.340> life<00:02:02.490> midcard

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
left mid his second inform life midcard

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
left mid his second inform life midcard
goes<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.950> 500<00:02:05.880> k<00:02:06.090> maybe<00:02:06.360> 600<00:02:06.840> k<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
goes for I think 500 k maybe 600 k and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.949 
goes for I think 500 k maybe 600 k and
so<00:02:07.979> magic<00:02:08.280> went<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:08.910> striker<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.539> his<00:02:09.720> second

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
so magic went into striker if his second

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.420 
so magic went into striker if his second
one<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> strike<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.679> will<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.830> layin<00:02:11.160> okay

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
one was a strike it will be layin okay

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.650 
one was a strike it will be layin okay
so<00:02:11.910> i<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.330> third<00:02:12.660> in-form<00:02:13.050> striker

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
so i think a third in-form striker

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.510 
so i think a third in-form striker
I<00:02:13.690> think<00:02:14.080> our<00:02:14.170> million<00:02:14.710> maybe<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.160> little<00:02:15.250> under

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
I think our million maybe a little under

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.620 
I think our million maybe a little under
a<00:02:15.580> million<00:02:15.760> will<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.210> why<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:16.510> happening

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
a million will see why it's happening

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.630 
a million will see why it's happening
