I<00:00:18.060> get<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> video<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.900> center<00:00:19.199> so

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
I get the video up here at the center so

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:29.540 
I get the video up here at the center so
i<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.590> drive<00:00:21.410> all<00:00:22.410> right<00:00:25.939> ok<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.769> had

actually<00:00:29.730> thought<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.480> figured<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.170> most

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
actually thought I figured out most

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
actually thought I figured out most
technically<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.130> how<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> wanted<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> do<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
technically of how I wanted to do this a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.090 
technically of how I wanted to do this a
little<00:00:33.930> over<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> year<00:00:34.350> ago<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:34.920> were

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
little over a year ago when we were

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.500 
little over a year ago when we were
talking<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.460> doing<00:00:35.760> something<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> wii

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
talking about doing something on the wii

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.160 
talking about doing something on the wii
I<00:00:36.840> am<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.610> spit<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.930> ahead

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I am but when i spit out to to go ahead

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.860 
I am but when i spit out to to go ahead
if<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.070> went<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.399> fairly<00:00:41.969> smoothly<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
if this went really fairly smoothly and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.900 
if this went really fairly smoothly and
here<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:44.129> all<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> mega

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
here we have really all of the mega

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.400 
here we have really all of the mega
textured<00:00:45.360> goodness<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.989> were<00:00:46.110> used<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
textured goodness that were used to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.190 
textured goodness that were used to
enrage<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.850> many<00:00:48.059> ways<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
enrage and in many ways this is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.950 
enrage and in many ways this is
incredibly<00:00:49.890> cool<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.489> an<00:00:50.610> ipad<00:00:51.059> where<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
incredibly cool on an ipad where the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.229 
incredibly cool on an ipad where the
touch<00:00:52.199> move<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.949> around<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.460> looking<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.910> i

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
touch move it around and looking at it i

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
touch move it around and looking at it i
did<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:54.870> fairly<00:00:55.110> clever<00:00:55.410> things<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
did some fairly clever things to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
did some fairly clever things to
approximate<00:00:56.610> sub-pixel<00:00:57.270> precision<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
approximate sub-pixel precision on the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
approximate sub-pixel precision on the
movement<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.820> visceral<00:00:59.820> feel<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.390> just

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
movement and the visceral feel of just

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.229 
movement and the visceral feel of just
kind<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.840> dragging<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
kind of dragging the thing around I is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.830 
kind of dragging the thing around I is
very<00:01:03.300> very<00:01:04.049> neat<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> running<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.570> an

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
pulling this into a game framework but I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.260 
pulling this into a game framework but I
this<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.030> great

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
points where I'm able to just kind of go

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
points where I'm able to just kind of go
in<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.820> something<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:52.020> leverage<00:01:52.500> all

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
in and do something really leverage all

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
in and do something really leverage all
of<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.040> skills<00:01:53.369> come<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.210> leave<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of my skills come in and just leave a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.420 
of my skills come in and just leave a
lot<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.659> people<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.170> huh<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:58.430> but

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
lot of people going huh what how but

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.590 
lot of people going huh what how but
then<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.909> turn<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> other

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
then I get to turn it over to other

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.300 
then I get to turn it over to other
people<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.170> ahead<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.500> through<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
real hard work of actually turning it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.709 
real hard work of actually turning it
into<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.200> full-fledged<00:02:04.469> game<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.210> there's<00:02:06.540> my

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.389 
into a full-fledged game but there's my
little<00:02:06.869> demo<00:02:07.290> there<00:02:07.590> which<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.160> kind<00:02:08.369> of

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
little demo there which I was kind of

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:19.230 
little demo there which I was kind of
proud<00:02:08.640> ok

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.830 

and<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.190> imagine<00:02:21.360> things<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.600> this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and so you can imagine things like this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.590 
and so you can imagine things like this
going<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.620> look<00:02:24.550> towards<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.910> industry<00:02:25.420> in

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
going I look towards the industry in

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.810 
going I look towards the industry in
future<00:02:25.960> years<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.950> idea<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.340> yeah<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.640> just

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
future years the idea that yeah I just

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.310 
future years the idea that yeah I just
pulled<00:02:28.240> out<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.360> my<00:02:28.510> pocket<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.990> machine

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
pulled out of my pocket the machine

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.440 
pulled out of my pocket the machine
there<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.760> know<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.880> could<00:02:31.120> kill

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
there that you know I could kill

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.480 
there that you know I could kill
anything<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.440> previous<00:02:32.710> generation

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
anything on a previous generation

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.660 
anything on a previous generation
console<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.240> an<00:02:34.420> Xbox<00:02:34.690> or<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.640> ps2<00:02:36.640> or

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
console like an Xbox or I a ps2 or

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.640 
console like an Xbox or I a ps2 or
something<00:02:37.210> on<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.840> hardware<00:02:38.200> that's<00:02:38.410> there

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
something on the hardware that's there

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.530 
something on the hardware that's there
it's<00:02:38.860> not<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.280> powerful<00:02:39.550> as<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.150> current

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
it's not as powerful as a current

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.930 
it's not as powerful as a current
generation<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:41.740> not<00:02:41.950> all<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.520> far<00:02:42.910> off

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
generation but it's not all that far off

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.820 
generation but it's not all that far off
where<00:02:43.900> you're<00:02:44.140> basically<00:02:44.260> looking<00:02:44.500> at

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
where you're basically looking at

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.960 
where you're basically looking at
something<00:02:45.070> with<00:02:45.340> vertex<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.910> fragment

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
something with vertex and fragment

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.440 
something with vertex and fragment
shaders<00:02:46.720> 512<00:02:47.590> megabytes<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.190> memory<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.820> pretty

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
shaders 512 megabytes of memory I pretty

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.290 
shaders 512 megabytes of memory I pretty
good<00:02:49.660> storage<00:02:49.990> on<00:02:50.350> there<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:52.150> can

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
good storage on there and you can

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.670 
good storage on there and you can
imagine<00:02:52.390> coming<00:02:52.960> up<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.200> playing<00:02:53.440> some

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
imagine coming up and playing some

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.140 
imagine coming up and playing some
things<00:02:53.950> plugging<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.490> flicked<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> big

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
things plugging in flicked on the big

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.000 
things plugging in flicked on the big
screen<00:02:55.480> or<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.900> small<00:02:56.170> screen<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.710> there

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
screen or on the small screen on there

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.550 
screen or on the small screen on there
it<00:02:57.400> still<00:02:57.880> lacks<00:02:58.120> tactile<00:02:58.780> feedback<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.530> a

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
it still lacks tactile feedback and a

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.170 
it still lacks tactile feedback and a
bunch<00:02:59.740> of<00:02:59.800> different<00:03:00.100> things<00:03:00.280> there<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:00.940> it's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
bunch of different things there but it's

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.420 
bunch of different things there but it's
any
