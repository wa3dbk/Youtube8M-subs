 we have a rather interesting arcade to 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.120
 main task which will be destruction 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.340
 We use old blocks for this. 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.949
 good picks with different efficiency 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.960
 by the way in the course of the game we discover new 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.239
 levels we collect points and we can 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.989
 use either another more powerful 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.210
 weapon 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.460
 either even explosive game at first 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.650
 the look seems pretty simple but it 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.019
 far from it and I think you yourself in this 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.290
 make sure with the passage of new levels 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.960

 smash and all enemies on our way 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.100
 as I think you guessed the game wears 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 comic character and here everything is built 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.979

 old chuck game is done in a pleasant 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.149
 drawing style and the game itself 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.520
 the process is also quite interesting as 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.429
 at least if you respect chuck noris then 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.719

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.549

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.490
 the next toy from fox nail studio 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.740
 called wounds swimming wounds we play 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.319

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.810
 family of colors big forest cup 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.210
 as you already understood we will participate in 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.700

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.729
 sneakers 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.190
 all this we do of course to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.710
 defeat new shoes and other various 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.140
 gadgets will give us strength and order 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.819
 most increase our chances of winning over 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.190
 rivals and among which will be 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.620
 reactive snails mosquitoes and grasshoppers 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.930
 and other games are very high quality far 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.950
 not all rooms have a story 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.740
 and meaning 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.260
 Well, here everything is with you is very cool 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.510
 the toy is very nice and addictive 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.600
 so everybody must advise the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.000
 task here is a logical toy about turtles 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.370
 you will need attentiveness and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.380
 logical thinking and deftly of in order 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.660
 to help our hero pass through 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.000
 a whole take in- turtles obstacles 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.100
 always work together in this way 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.980
 for example one of them will visit us 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.500
 way for example destroy lions cannons or 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.170
 so on but the other one will be 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 getting to the exit toy is very me 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.160
 I will immediately say that she is far away 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.500
 not easy so on some levels 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.200
 you can get stuck like a plan 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.900
 logic and in terms of dexterity because 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.810
 often either the turtle is killed or she 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.060
 falls or something else happens to her and 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.340
 we don't always have time to prevent it 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.140
 the game is free and I think lovers 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.050
 logical projects she must 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.640
 like moving on 10 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.730
 million one of the most popular 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.800
 quizzes now on our devices 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.140
 to answer questions do 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.300
 betting on the correct answers in your 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.790
 the disposal is 10 million rubles 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.220
 who need to save until the end of the game 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.590
 40 packs of money can be put on 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.630
 one answer if you are confident in it and so 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.790
 and divided into several depending on 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.280
 probability levels if you like 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.260
 educational toys this is something that you 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.420
 because every answer is needed 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.730
 there is an explanation so you can 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.220
 develop your horizons the game is very 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.310
 interesting both in terms of sound design 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.500
 escorts and generally in general when 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.080
 games besides usual entertainment also 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.840
 brings some benefit is very cool 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.610
 the toy is also free 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.519
 the next game combines a small 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.190
 quest and comics called she escape from 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.010
 terrible dead in general I will immediately say 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.320
 that I really liked this idea 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.780
 a book in which we ourselves will decide what 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.419
 do our main character in my opinion 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.700
 This is a great and very interesting approach. 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.190
 Well, now a little story our hero 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.410
 woke up in my room from screaming with 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.400
 the streets outside the window he saw a mob walking 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.370
 dead 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.590
 y itself is not good and necessary 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.930
 something to do just what we do with 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.210
 you and we will solve this text 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.220
 atmospheric play exactly qnet you with 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.259
 head to this zombie apocalypse and 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.100
 make you make certain decisions 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:55.259
 by itself the main task is to survive 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.850
 so you need to think logically choose 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.820
 the right solutions which 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.889
 will affect the fate of our hero are waiting for us 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.680
 just three kinds of happy endings 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.410
 Game Guy just a huge variety of 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.690
 many defeats so good luck personally 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.789
 I really liked the toy interesting 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.010
 It was in this play and I confess honestly 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.740
 I died many times before 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.860
 defeat the toy of course free 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.900
 all the exact advice now remember the old 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.460
 Good Dinze or rather a game called 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.620
 battle toads 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.919
 and all this because we play in 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.960
 a clone of this game bike thats I think many 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.240
 remember this level on space 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.020
 bikes so here and in this runner we 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.630
 we can again 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.479
 enjoy it we only have two 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.520
 control buttons this up and down but 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.830
 at the same time the game is very difficult we need 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.010
 shy away from the wall while avoiding 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.560
 enemy attacks don't know how you are 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.750
 play forgotten whether the game is more difficult than 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.820
 It was on dendy but very little I can 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.919
 hold out anyway game 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.470
 reminded me of childhood and for that 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.289
 many thanks to the developers for all 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.870
 children of the 90s must download and 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.760
 I think young people need to play like this 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.370
 and feel good old taste 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.949
