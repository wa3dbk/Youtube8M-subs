00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.059
 let's talk about a recommendation here 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.779
 in auto explore I am oscar sanabria the 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.960
 more vehicle for the whole market already by 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.050
 that has two popcorn is the chevrolet 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.320
 nuance this car has a very motor 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.289
 small 1.0-liter capacity is 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.559
 able to develop 65 horses 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.410
 power has 67 pound foot of torque 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.330
 engine is an urban vehicle but 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.550
 I would really recommend it so it's the 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.070
 second car at home is a car for 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.290
 learn to drive or outright is my 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.870
 first vehicle I have few resources and 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 I do not want to get into debt too much with this 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.550
 auto I will secure my transfers 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.800
 basic and return to work and 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.440
 going back to school was going to be a car 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.670
 very saver 18.9 kilometers per liter 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.110
 the truth is a super compact useful car 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.879
 super compact that will fit in 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.860
 any side if I have to leave it 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.300
 parked on the street where not yet 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.410
 there are parking meters 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.140
 surely I will not have any 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.550
 I'm going to be able to park it very 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.580
 all right 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.880
 and I'm going to have many kilometers of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.280
 fun I like this vehicle has 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 manual transmission only and there is a 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.060
 version with air conditioning and other 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.900
 without air conditioning 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.720
 obviously 94 thousand 900 pesos is the price 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.060
 of start the hue has had a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.190
 versatility for being a hatchback the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 fifth door allows you well 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.720
 knock down on the back of the seat 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.240
 back allows you to become a car 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.570
 very functional to carry some things 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.640
 or to transfer some others the I 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 I think it's a very personal car and that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.320
 well somehow it's going to translate 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.480
 in fuel economy if I what 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.820
 I want to save the chevrolet nuance 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.150
 surely make my best choice of 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.150
 purchase 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 ah
