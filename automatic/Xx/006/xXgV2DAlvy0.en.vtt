00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
found better or worse learner to Mueller

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.100 
found better or worse learner to Mueller
I<00:01:44.010> had<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.910> say<00:01:45.120> without<00:01:45.330> sort<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.780> really

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I had to say without sort of really

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.859 
I had to say without sort of really
giving<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.590> thing<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.220> it's

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
giving it a good thing but it's

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.270 
giving it a good thing but it's
cornering<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.050> lot<00:01:49.560> more<00:01:49.740> different<00:01:50.100> but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
cornering so a lot more different but

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
cornering so a lot more different but
but<00:01:50.729> easier<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.300> can<00:01:51.420> sort<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.869> stride

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
but easier you can sort of really stride

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.270 
but easier you can sort of really stride
around<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.410> corner<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.100> can

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
around the corner it's not like you can

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.950 
around the corner it's not like you can
do<00:01:53.400> on<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.760> bike<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.150> certain<00:01:54.420> times<00:01:54.630> yeah

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
do on on a bike at certain times yeah

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.890 
do on on a bike at certain times yeah
and<00:01:55.800> how<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> find<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.520> their<00:01:56.700> BS<00:01:56.970> linked

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
and how do you find like their BS linked

yeah<00:02:20.489> how<00:02:21.060> long<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.390> been<00:02:21.450> riding<00:02:21.660> for

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
yeah how long have you been riding for

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.699 
yeah how long have you been riding for
Dave<00:02:22.110> off<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.300> twenty<00:02:24.300> years<00:02:24.570> yeah<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.350> you

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
Dave off and on twenty years yeah so you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.800 
Dave off and on twenty years yeah so you
think<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.040> more<00:02:26.250> targeted<00:02:27.180> at<00:02:27.360> someone<00:02:27.690> who

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
think it's more targeted at someone who

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.870 
think it's more targeted at someone who
hasn't<00:02:28.050> done<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> lot<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> riding<00:02:28.770> or<00:02:29.130> someone

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
hasn't done a lot of riding or someone

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.590 
hasn't done a lot of riding or someone
who's<00:02:30.060> maybe<00:02:30.450> again<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> bit<00:02:30.959> older<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:33.000> decide

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
who's maybe again a bit older I decide

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.150 
who's maybe again a bit older I decide
needs<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.989> certain<00:02:34.200> sporty<00:02:34.680> element<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> them

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
needs a certain sporty element to them

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.330 
needs a certain sporty element to them
as<00:02:35.310> well<00:02:35.459> especially<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.630> area<00:02:36.900> Swan<00:02:37.340> but

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
as well especially in the area Swan but

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.650 
as well especially in the area Swan but
I<00:02:38.370> think<00:02:38.670> definitely<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.420> someone<00:02:39.600> who

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
I think definitely for someone who

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.850 
I think definitely for someone who
hasn't<00:02:39.780> ridden<00:02:40.019> before<00:02:40.170> because<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.709> can

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
hasn't ridden before because you can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.190 
hasn't ridden before because you can
ride<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.010> your<00:02:41.220> car<00:02:41.370> license<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.600> way<00:02:42.870> easier

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
ride on your car license so way easier

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.199 
ride on your car license so way easier
there<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.680> maybe<00:02:44.250> once<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.850> know<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.090> you're

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
there and maybe once you know if you're

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.340 
there and maybe once you know if you're
