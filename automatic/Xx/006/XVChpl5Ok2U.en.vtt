like<00:00:17.830> to<00:00:17.859> show<00:00:18.220> you<00:00:18.250> first<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:19.779> how<00:00:19.960> the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
like to show you first just how the

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.010 
like to show you first just how the
tuning<00:00:20.410> Stan<00:00:20.650> works<00:00:21.300> essentially<00:00:22.300> there's<00:00:22.690> a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
tuning Stan works essentially there's a

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.970 
tuning Stan works essentially there's a
width<00:00:24.660> adjustment<00:00:25.660> for<00:00:26.200> the<00:00:26.470> width<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.920> your

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
width adjustment for the width of your

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.590 
width adjustment for the width of your
hub<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.990> then<00:00:29.260> there's<00:00:29.500> also<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:30.600> height

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
hub and then there's also a height

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.130 
hub and then there's also a height
adjustment<00:00:32.379> for<00:00:32.680> how<00:00:32.860> big<00:00:33.550> diameter<00:00:33.969> how<00:00:34.899> big

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
adjustment for how big diameter how big

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.549 
adjustment for how big diameter how big
of<00:00:35.199> a<00:00:35.320> diameter<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.860> wheel<00:00:36.160> you<00:00:36.370> have<00:00:36.399> there

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
of a diameter of wheel you have there

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.910 
of a diameter of wheel you have there
and<00:00:38.559> then<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.159> third<00:00:39.399> one<00:00:39.699> is<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.809> width<00:00:41.649> of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
and then the third one is the width of

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.069 
and then the third one is the width of
the<00:00:42.190> rim<00:00:42.399> as<00:00:42.729> you<00:00:43.329> can<00:00:43.510> see<00:00:43.749> it<00:00:43.929> will

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
the rim as you can see it will

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.229 
the rim as you can see it will
accommodate<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.679> really<00:00:45.039> wide<00:00:45.370> rim<00:00:45.909> or

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
accommodate a really wide rim or

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.529 
accommodate a really wide rim or
something<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:48.309> really<00:00:48.760> skinny<00:00:49.089> as<00:00:49.329> well

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
something that's really skinny as well

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.099 
something that's really skinny as well
so<00:00:50.249> before<00:00:51.249> I<00:00:51.280> get<00:00:51.460> started<00:00:52.059> I<00:00:52.420> always<00:00:52.479> like<00:00:52.960> to

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
so before I get started I always like to

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.919 
so before I get started I always like to
check<00:00:53.379> my<00:00:53.620> hub<00:00:53.999> make<00:00:54.999> sure<00:00:55.269> that<00:00:55.539> this<00:00:55.690> isn't

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
check my hub make sure that this isn't

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.529 
check my hub make sure that this isn't
loose<00:00:56.260> because<00:00:56.620> if<00:00:56.920> your<00:00:57.100> hub<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.519> loose<00:00:57.789> then

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
loose because if your hub is loose then

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.569 
loose because if your hub is loose then
it<00:00:58.839> can<00:00:58.989> allow<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.260> whole<00:00:59.559> wheel<00:00:59.859> to<00:01:00.129> wobble

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
it can allow the whole wheel to wobble

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.729 
it can allow the whole wheel to wobble
and<00:01:00.729> you'll<00:01:01.329> get<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.510> false<00:01:01.870> read<00:01:02.260> on<00:01:02.499> how

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
and you'll get a false read on how

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.640 
and you'll get a false read on how
straight<00:01:03.219> your<00:01:03.399> wheel<00:01:03.729> is<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.199> go<00:01:05.470> I'm

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
straight your wheel is here I go I'm

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.090 
straight your wheel is here I go I'm
going<00:01:05.799> to<00:01:05.860> go<00:01:06.010> drop<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:07.120> in<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:08.470> little<00:01:08.740> slot

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
going to go drop this in a little slot

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.910 
going to go drop this in a little slot
so<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:09.520> should<00:01:09.700> pull<00:01:09.880> dropouts<00:01:10.420> up<00:01:10.810> there<00:01:11.079> do<00:01:11.860> a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
so we should pull dropouts up there do a

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.380 
so we should pull dropouts up there do a
nice<00:01:12.219> firm<00:01:13.020> crank<00:01:14.020> there<00:01:14.460> line<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.759> one<00:01:16.119> up

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
nice firm crank there line this one up

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.029 
nice firm crank there line this one up
with<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.930> side<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.710> rim<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.229> then

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
with the side of the rim and so and then

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.270 
with the side of the rim and so and then
these<00:01:21.250> I<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:21.759> adjust<00:01:22.390> inward<00:01:23.039> you<00:01:24.039> can

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
these I just adjust inward you can

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.999 
these I just adjust inward you can
already<00:01:24.520> see<00:01:24.909> how<00:01:25.780> it's<00:01:25.960> scraping<00:01:26.590> in<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> few

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
already see how it's scraping in a few

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.270 
already see how it's scraping in a few
spots<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.750> indicating<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:28.899> pretty<00:01:29.170> bad<00:01:29.409> so

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
spots that indicating it's pretty bad so

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.550 
spots that indicating it's pretty bad so
we're<00:01:30.520> going<00:01:30.609> to<00:01:30.700> cut<00:01:30.880> away<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.119> a<00:01:31.329> closer<00:01:32.020> shot

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
we're going to cut away to a closer shot

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.340 
we're going to cut away to a closer shot
here<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.159> you<00:01:33.250> can<00:01:33.429> see<00:01:33.670> how<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.119> actually<00:01:35.079> get

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
here so you can see how to actually get

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.999 
here so you can see how to actually get
the<00:01:36.219> spoke<00:01:36.579> wrench<00:01:36.880> in<00:01:37.179> action<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.859> this

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
the spoke wrench in action so for this

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.940 
the spoke wrench in action so for this
portion<00:01:39.369> up<00:01:39.850> which<00:01:40.659> is<00:01:40.869> actually<00:01:41.350> going<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.770> be

snug fit and I'm just going to start

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.590 
snug fit and I'm just going to start
turning<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:14.260> spoke<00:02:14.710> which<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.060> know<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
turning this spoke which is you know the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.480 
turning this spoke which is you know the
opposing<00:02:17.290> side<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:18.160> the

and so hopefully that will you know
straighten<00:02:22.330> some<00:02:22.510> things<00:02:22.540> out<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.590> have

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
straighten some things out just have

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.530 
straighten some things out just have
turn<00:02:24.550> at<00:02:24.790> times<00:02:25.120> really<00:02:25.420> all<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.780> takes<00:02:26.370> right

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
turn at times really all it takes right

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:40.350 
turn at times really all it takes right
there<00:02:36.630> turning<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.870> until<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.320> see<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:39.360> stop

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
there turning it until I see it stop

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
there turning it until I see it stop
scuffing<00:02:42.000> still<00:02:43.000> scuffing<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> bit<00:02:44.080> right

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
scuffing still scuffing in a bit right

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.850 
scuffing still scuffing in a bit right
there<00:02:47.490> this<00:02:48.490> one<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:48.910> really<00:02:49.180> just<00:02:49.750> loose<00:02:50.050> so

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
there this one was really just loose so

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.890 
there this one was really just loose so
sometimes<00:02:51.340> if<00:02:51.580> they're<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:51.970> loose<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
sometimes if they're really loose you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.020 
sometimes if they're really loose you
can<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.350> tighten<00:02:54.100> them<00:02:54.340> up<00:02:54.460> till<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.790> feel

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
can just tighten them up till you feel

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.260 
can just tighten them up till you feel
the<00:02:55.240> spoke<00:02:55.570> intention<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.730> pretty

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
the spoke intention and it's pretty

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.600 
the spoke intention and it's pretty
obvious<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.800> get<00:02:59.980> intention<00:03:00.400> by<00:03:00.550> the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
obvious that you get intention by the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.540 
obvious that you get intention by the
pinging<00:03:01.000> noise<00:03:01.420> there<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:05.340> pretty<00:03:06.340> much

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
pinging noise there so pretty much

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.120 
pinging noise there so pretty much
successfully<00:03:07.390> cleared<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.410> little<00:03:08.710> scuff

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
successfully cleared the little scuff

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.310 
successfully cleared the little scuff
off<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.580> this<00:03:09.730> side<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:11.110> not

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
off of this side so that it's not

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.900 
off of this side so that it's not
rubbing<00:03:11.800> these<00:03:11.980> us<00:03:12.340> these<00:03:13.330> rim<00:03:13.960> gauges<00:03:14.500> here

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
rubbing these us these rim gauges here

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.290 
rubbing these us these rim gauges here
although<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> notice<00:03:16.600> right<00:03:16.840> here<00:03:18.090> I'm<00:03:19.090> getting

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
although I notice right here I'm getting

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.650 
although I notice right here I'm getting
a<00:03:19.510> little<00:03:19.630> rub<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.910> I'm<00:03:22.120> going<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.450> go<00:03:22.540> ahead

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
a little rub so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.110 
a little rub so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:22.870> do<00:03:22.960> there<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.560> tighten<00:03:24.340> these<00:03:24.580> spokes

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
and do there is tighten these spokes

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.830 
and do there is tighten these spokes
these<00:03:25.900> two<00:03:26.200> right<00:03:26.440> here<00:03:26.790> which<00:03:27.790> are<00:03:28.030> opposing

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
these two right here which are opposing

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.430 
these two right here which are opposing
the<00:03:29.230> side<00:03:29.470> that's<00:03:29.710> been<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.910> from<00:03:31.300> here<00:03:31.690> find

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
the side that's been so from here find

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.110 
the side that's been so from here find
that<00:03:32.590> spoke<00:03:32.950> wrench<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.400> fits<00:03:33.460> nice<00:03:34.090> and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
that spoke wrench that fits nice and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.470 
that spoke wrench that fits nice and
snug<00:03:34.950> otherwise<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.220> wind<00:03:36.430> up<00:03:36.730> rounding

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
snug otherwise you wind up rounding

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.230 
snug otherwise you wind up rounding
these<00:03:37.660> spokes<00:03:38.110> out<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.890> that's<00:03:39.760> not<00:03:39.970> good

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
these spokes out and that's not good

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.850 
these spokes out and that's not good
because<00:03:40.450> then<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.930> won't<00:03:41.110> need<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.350> replace

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
because then you won't need to replace

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:55.620 
because then you won't need to replace
the<00:03:42.130> whole<00:03:42.160> slope<00:03:53.940> you'll<00:03:54.940> see<00:03:55.180> it's<00:03:55.330> getting

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
the whole slope you'll see it's getting

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.490 
the whole slope you'll see it's getting
better<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.290> uh<00:03:56.830> I'm<00:03:57.790> going<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.030> show<00:03:58.240> you<00:03:58.500> how

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
better but uh I'm going to show you how

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.160 
better but uh I'm going to show you how
to<00:03:59.560> fine-tune<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:01.450> can<00:04:01.720> get<00:04:02.020> it

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
to fine-tune it so you can get it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.680 
to fine-tune it so you can get it
perfectly<00:04:02.620> straight<00:04:02.770> so<00:04:03.640> once<00:04:04.150> I've<00:04:04.360> got<00:04:04.390> all

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
perfectly straight so once I've got all

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.610 
perfectly straight so once I've got all
the<00:04:04.990> major<00:04:05.550> bob<00:04:06.550> bends<00:04:07.540> out<00:04:08.020> of<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.320> I'm<00:04:08.560> just

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
the major bob bends out of it I'm just

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.370 
the major bob bends out of it I'm just
kind<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.310> cranking<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:10.030> thing<00:04:10.390> in<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:11.200> get

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
kind of cranking this thing in to get

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.490 
kind of cranking this thing in to get
closer<00:04:11.710> and<00:04:11.980> closer<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.970> rim<00:04:13.840> therefore

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
closer and closer to the rim therefore

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.400 
closer and closer to the rim therefore
giving<00:04:14.830> me<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:14.950> more<00:04:15.510> tight<00:04:16.510> tolerance<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
giving me a more tight tolerance and

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.039 
giving me a more tight tolerance and
that<00:04:17.830> will<00:04:18.250> make<00:04:18.760> for<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.120> more<00:04:19.270> accurate<00:04:19.510> read

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
that will make for a more accurate read

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.100 
that will make for a more accurate read
so<00:04:20.859> I've<00:04:21.070> noticed<00:04:21.310> right<00:04:21.670> here<00:04:22.210> got<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:23.020> little

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
so I've noticed right here got a little

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.170 
so I've noticed right here got a little
bit<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.710> scuffing<00:04:24.280> on<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:27.340> rim<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:27.940> I'm<00:04:28.030> going

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
bit of scuffing on the rim so I'm going

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.360 
bit of scuffing on the rim so I'm going
to<00:04:28.270> tighten<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.600> spoke<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.560> hear

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
to tighten this spoke just to hear

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.830 
to tighten this spoke just to hear
well<00:04:32.370> it's<00:04:32.520> kind<00:04:32.759> of<00:04:32.909> drawn<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.360> into<00:04:33.750> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
well it's kind of drawn it into the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.869 
well it's kind of drawn it into the
center<00:04:35.539> right<00:04:36.539> there<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.050> got<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.229> little

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879 
center right there you got a little

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.020 
center right there you got a little
portion<00:04:38.879> where<00:04:39.030> it's<00:04:39.180> cuffing<00:04:39.659> on<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:40.020> side

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
portion where it's cuffing on this side

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.899 
portion where it's cuffing on this side
so<00:04:42.030> same<00:04:42.360> thing<00:04:42.389> goes<00:04:43.319> I<00:04:43.770> just<00:04:44.039> tighten<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.669> a

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
so same thing goes I just tighten it a

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.899 
so same thing goes I just tighten it a
few<00:04:45.539> spokes<00:04:45.930> on<00:04:46.169> this<00:04:46.409> side<00:04:46.680> on<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.340> opposite

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
few spokes on this side on the opposite

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.230 
few spokes on this side on the opposite
end<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.020> bend<00:04:49.289> and<00:04:50.159> if<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:50.759> look<00:04:50.940> closely

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
end of the bend and if you look closely

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.200 
end of the bend and if you look closely
you'll<00:04:51.599> actually<00:04:51.780> see<00:04:52.349> it'll<00:04:53.159> draw<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.580> the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
you'll actually see it'll draw the the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:03.409 
you'll actually see it'll draw the the
rim<00:04:54.449> back<00:04:54.659> in<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.020> center<00:04:55.319> I<00:05:01.940> picked<00:05:02.940> an<00:05:03.120> old

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
rim back in the center I picked an old

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.649 
rim back in the center I picked an old
wheel<00:05:04.229> that's<00:05:04.889> actually<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.430> steel<00:05:05.849> wheel<00:05:06.180> so

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
wheel that's actually a steel wheel so

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.140 
wheel that's actually a steel wheel so
it<00:05:06.870> will<00:05:07.050> have<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.289> bit<00:05:07.770> of<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.340> wobble<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:09.000> it

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
it will have a bit of a wobble to it

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.200
