00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
one of the times when he set up to hit

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.920 
one of the times when he set up to hit
really<00:05:14.360> early<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.020> one<00:05:15.530> day<00:05:15.650> went<00:05:15.889> well<00:05:16.930> look

really early and one day went well look
at<00:05:18.020> these<00:05:18.110> spine<00:05:18.410> crawlers<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:18.860> good<00:05:19.010> as<00:05:19.130> I

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
at these spine crawlers so good as I

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.100 
at these spine crawlers so good as I
mean<00:05:19.430> I've<00:05:20.000> finishing<00:05:20.720> up<00:05:20.780> here<00:05:20.870> in<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:20.990> moment

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
mean I've finishing up here in a moment

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.300 
mean I've finishing up here in a moment
I'm<00:05:21.350> should<00:05:21.560> make<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.770> defense<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.220> little

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
I'm should make this defense a little

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
I'm should make this defense a little
bit<00:05:22.520> easier<00:05:22.669> a<00:05:22.820> little<00:05:23.000> bit<00:05:23.090> more<00:05:23.180> manageable

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
bit easier a little bit more manageable

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.060 
bit easier a little bit more manageable
we<00:05:23.720> got<00:05:23.840> links<00:05:24.080> on<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.260> way<00:05:24.350> but<00:05:24.410> 22<00:05:24.800> them

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
we got links on the way but 22 them

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.620 
we got links on the way but 22 them
without<00:05:25.190> speed<00:05:25.669> will<00:05:26.150> certainly<00:05:26.360> take<00:05:26.479> some

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
without speed will certainly take some

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.180 
without speed will certainly take some
time<00:05:26.780> cancels<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.560> spine<00:05:27.740> rebuilds<00:05:28.130> it

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
time cancels the spine rebuilds it

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.680 
time cancels the spine rebuilds it
immediately<00:05:28.490> queens<00:05:29.120> are<00:05:29.240> getting<00:05:29.419> around<00:05:29.600> by

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
immediately queens are getting around by

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.120 
immediately queens are getting around by
they<00:05:29.780> gonna<00:05:29.870> get<00:05:30.050> low<00:05:30.229> time<00:05:30.710> warps<00:05:30.979> gonna

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
they gonna get low time warps gonna

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.210 
they gonna get low time warps gonna
catch<00:05:31.310> them<00:05:31.720> for<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:32.780> spine<00:05:32.960> completes<00:05:33.350> do

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
catch them for the spine completes do

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.360 
catch them for the spine completes do
geez<00:05:34.430> doesn't<00:05:34.760> have<00:05:34.880> enough<00:05:35.120> jejeje<00:05:36.370> DRG

Jones<00:05:37.639> look<00:05:37.910> like<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.210> Archie<00:05:38.450> was<00:05:38.570> holding

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
Jones look like the Archie was holding

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.409 
Jones look like the Archie was holding
it<00:05:39.250> yeah<00:05:40.250> I<00:05:40.280> think<00:05:40.610> if<00:05:40.669> that<00:05:40.700> seconds<00:05:41.150> finally

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
it yeah I think if that seconds finally

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.580 
it yeah I think if that seconds finally
gotten<00:05:41.570> up<00:05:41.720> instead<00:05:41.990> of<00:05:42.050> me<00:05:42.139> forced<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.440> cancel

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
gotten up instead of me forced to cancel

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.849 
gotten up instead of me forced to cancel
that<00:05:42.919> could<00:05:43.070> have<00:05:43.160> been<00:05:43.280> a<00:05:43.340> very<00:05:43.550> different
