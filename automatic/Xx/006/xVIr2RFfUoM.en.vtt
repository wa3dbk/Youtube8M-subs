already started painting the other shoe
and<00:01:03.780> yeah<00:01:04.710> that's<00:01:05.129> getting<00:01:06.000> along<00:01:06.240> okay<00:01:06.570> but

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and yeah that's getting along okay but

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.830 
and yeah that's getting along okay but
yeah<00:01:06.900> pretty<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.250> here<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> go<00:01:08.520> um<00:01:08.840> quality

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
yeah pretty much here you go um quality

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.039 
yeah pretty much here you go um quality
usual<00:01:10.740> body<00:01:11.010> line<00:01:11.280> quality<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:12.510> pretty<00:01:12.750> good

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
usual body line quality it's pretty good

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.380 
usual body line quality it's pretty good
um<00:01:13.350> obviously<00:01:14.310> since<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.090> white

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
um obviously since these are white

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.520 
um obviously since these are white
they'll<00:01:15.630> scratch<00:01:16.049> more<00:01:16.409> easily<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.310> guess<00:01:17.909> um

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
they'll scratch more easily I guess um

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
they'll scratch more easily I guess um
one<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> things<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.100> bodyline<00:01:20.729> shoes

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
one of the things about bodyline shoes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
one of the things about bodyline shoes
is<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> accidentally<00:01:22.140> hit<00:01:22.530> them

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
is that if you accidentally hit them

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.190 
is that if you accidentally hit them
against<00:01:23.100> each<00:01:23.189> other<00:01:23.720> you're<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> get

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
against each other you're going to get

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.999 
against each other you're going to get
sort<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> black<00:01:26.490> skid<00:01:27.090> marks<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.900> lines<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
sort of black skid marks or lines and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.880 
sort of black skid marks or lines and
that<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> ruins<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.509> shoe<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.740> were

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that kind of ruins the shoe so if I were

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.160 
that kind of ruins the shoe so if I were
you<00:01:32.040> I'd<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.640> careful<00:01:33.030> walking<00:01:33.270> with

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
check this out the incline isn't that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.789 
check this out the incline isn't that
high<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:57.509> feet<00:01:57.750> aren't<00:01:57.990> exactly<00:01:58.530> too
