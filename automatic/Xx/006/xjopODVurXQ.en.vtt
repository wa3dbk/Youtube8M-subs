00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
preferred network list so now we can go

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.900 
preferred network list so now we can go
to<00:04:16.170> where<00:04:17.170> it<00:04:17.200> says<00:04:17.320> no<00:04:17.680> network<00:04:18.160> click<00:04:18.549> there

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
to where it says no network click there

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.630 
to where it says no network click there
and<00:04:19.180> my<00:04:19.930> network<00:04:20.140> is<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:20.710> morphin<00:04:21.190> time<00:04:21.220> so

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
and my network is it's morphin time so

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.320 
and my network is it's morphin time so
I'm<00:04:21.700> going<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:21.880> click<00:04:22.030> on<00:04:22.090> that<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.980> now<00:04:24.330> I'm

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
I'm going to click on that and now I'm

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.010 
I'm going to click on that and now I'm
going<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.860> put<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.040> password

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.890 

so<00:04:32.020> they<00:04:32.230> messed<00:04:32.530> up<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.760> really<00:04:37.180> hit<00:04:37.390> connect

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
so they messed up and really hit connect

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.580 
so they messed up and really hit connect
and<00:04:39.870> then<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:42.520> should<00:04:42.580> see<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.210> solid<00:04:43.590> Wi-Fi

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590
