00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
from top to bottom I think everyone's

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
from top to bottom I think everyone's
pretty<00:01:55.649> similar<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.969> can

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pretty similar and I think we can

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.719 
pretty similar and I think we can
compete<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.540> other<00:01:57.719> conferences<00:01:58.610> mind<00:01:59.610> I've

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
like the SEC but I think we have really

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
like the SEC but I think we have really
good<00:02:03.960> teams<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.159> compete<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.670> any

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
good teams and we can compete with any

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.180 
good teams and we can compete with any
conference<00:02:06.329> talking<00:02:07.290> about<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> SEC<00:02:07.979> that

more you're accomplishing a lot more

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.850

when<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.450> beat<00:02:36.660> sec<00:02:37.290> or<00:02:37.470> any<00:02:37.680> other

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
conference team no biggies they contain

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.500 
conference team no biggies they contain
whatever<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.890> know<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.130> always

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
whatever you know it's always

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.780 
whatever you know it's always
representing<00:02:42.510> your<00:02:42.660> own<00:02:42.780> conference<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.790> think

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
representing your own conference I think

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.460 
representing your own conference I think
it<00:02:44.849> also<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.300> those<00:02:45.569> shows<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.319> can

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
it also just those shows that we can

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.050 
it also just those shows that we can
compete<00:02:46.769> if<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.010> come<00:02:47.190> back<00:02:47.340> with<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.550> wind<00:02:47.819> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
compete if we come back with a wind and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.729 
compete if we come back with a wind and
it<00:02:48.150> starts<00:02:48.810> raising<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.170> questions<00:02:49.530> more

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
it starts raising the questions more

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.600 
it starts raising the questions more
that<00:02:50.010> maybe<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.459> SEC<00:02:50.850> isn't<00:02:51.620> as<00:02:52.620> tough<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.489> mean

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
that maybe the SEC isn't as tough I mean

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.820 
that maybe the SEC isn't as tough I mean
HTC<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.420> compete<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:54.750> SEC<00:02:55.290> schools<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.799> I

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
HTC can compete with SEC schools so I

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.890 
HTC can compete with SEC schools so I
think<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.280> real<00:02:56.880> important<00:02:57.269> for<00:02:57.450> us<00:02:57.840> to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
think it's real important for us to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.150 
think it's real important for us to
start<00:02:58.200> off<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> season<00:02:58.560> well<00:02:58.830> against

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
in both yell stadiums and they get very

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.920 
in both yell stadiums and they get very
loud<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:02.790> y'all's<00:04:03.180> opinion<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
loud in y'all's opinion and the

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.780 
loud in y'all's opinion and the
quarterback<00:04:04.290> position<00:04:04.549> what<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
quarterback position what is the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.210 
quarterback position what is the
toughest<00:04:06.180> place<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.630> play<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.290> ACC<00:04:07.829> on<00:04:08.069> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
toughest place to play in the ACC on the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.129 
toughest place to play in the ACC on the
road<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.510> go<00:04:09.630> first<00:04:09.870> ah<00:04:11.690> kissing<00:04:12.690> will<00:04:12.870> buy<00:04:13.079> it

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
road and go first ah kissing will buy it

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.319 
road and go first ah kissing will buy it
so<00:04:13.350> i<00:04:13.410> think<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.910> loudest<00:04:14.910> place<00:04:15.120> I've<00:04:15.299> been

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
so i think the loudest place I've been

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.960 
so i think the loudest place I've been
is<00:04:15.600> Virginia<00:04:16.019> Tech<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:17.070> place<00:04:17.250> rocks<00:04:17.519> but

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
is Virginia Tech that place rocks but

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.890 
is Virginia Tech that place rocks but
this<00:04:18.329> year<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:19.320> think<00:04:19.590> every<00:04:19.950> state<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.280> hazard

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
this year I think every state in hazard

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.110 
this year I think every state in hazard
smaller<00:04:21.829> same<00:04:22.009> like<00:04:22.190> wait<00:04:22.340> for<00:04:22.370> several<00:04:22.910> times

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
smaller same like wait for several times

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.879 
smaller same like wait for several times
where<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.449> got<00:04:23.570> pretty<00:04:23.750> bad<00:04:23.870> in<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.259> course

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
where it got pretty bad in the course

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.249 
where it got pretty bad in the course
Florida<00:04:25.220> State<00:04:25.780> that's<00:04:26.780> probably<00:04:26.900> loud<00:04:27.139> to

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
Florida State that's probably loud to

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.200 
Florida State that's probably loud to

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
coming up and a probably just kind of

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.689 
coming up and a probably just kind of
stay<00:05:23.870> calm<00:05:24.169> drivin<00:05:24.710> working<00:05:25.039> on<00:05:25.099> do<00:05:25.400> it<00:05:25.430> on<00:05:25.580> the

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
stay calm drivin working on do it on the

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.730 
stay calm drivin working on do it on the
part<00:05:25.970> I'm<00:05:26.690> not<00:05:26.870> really<00:05:27.050> worried<00:05:27.349> about<00:05:27.440> the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
part I'm not really worried about the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.689 
part I'm not really worried about the
whole<00:05:28.930> spotlight<00:05:29.930> being<00:05:30.260> on<00:05:30.440> me<00:05:30.680> on<00:05:30.949> us<00:05:30.979> so<00:05:31.669> I

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
whole spotlight being on me on us so I

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.360 
whole spotlight being on me on us so I
think<00:05:32.150> just<00:05:32.419> approach<00:05:32.720> it<00:05:32.750> like<00:05:33.160> means<00:05:34.160> more

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
think just approach it like means more

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.800 
think just approach it like means more
than<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:34.580> practice<00:05:35.030> but<00:05:35.180> you<00:05:35.300> kind<00:05:35.449> of<00:05:35.510> got<00:05:35.690> to

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
than a practice but you kind of got to

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.420 
than a practice but you kind of got to
take<00:05:35.990> a<00:05:36.020> approach<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.919> this<00:05:37.039> is<00:05:37.159> what<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.310> do

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
take a approach that this is what I do

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.700 
take a approach that this is what I do
every<00:05:37.550> day<00:05:37.909> and<00:05:38.180> take<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.840> from<00:05:38.900> there<00:05:38.990> right<00:05:39.470> I

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
every day and take it from there right I

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.290 
every day and take it from there right I
would<00:05:39.949> say<00:05:40.099> I<00:05:40.130> just<00:05:40.490> stay<00:05:40.639> in<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:40.820> moment<00:05:40.940> you
