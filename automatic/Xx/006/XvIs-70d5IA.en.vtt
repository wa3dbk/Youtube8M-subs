putting this on glass a nice trick is to

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.850

turn it over and you can see kind of

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.710 
turn it over and you can see kind of
where<00:04:13.040> you've<00:04:13.220> put<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.380> just<00:04:15.380> keep

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
template once I peel it off once it's

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.300 
template once I peel it off once it's
wet<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:34.720> been<00:05:35.050> under<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.380> cream<00:05:35.650> it's<00:05:35.830> pretty

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.120 
wet and been under the cream it's pretty
much<00:05:36.490> at<00:05:36.640> one<00:05:36.850> time<00:05:36.880> I<00:05:37.560> mean<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.680> can<00:05:38.830> try<00:05:39.100> I

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
much at one time I mean you can try I

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.190 
much at one time I mean you can try I
guess<00:05:39.280> if<00:05:39.550> you<00:05:39.670> had<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:39.850> very<00:05:40.060> simple<00:05:40.540> display

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
guess if you had a very simple display

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.280 
guess if you had a very simple display
you<00:05:41.410> could<00:05:41.770> try<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:43.180> get<00:05:43.480> more<00:05:43.660> time<00:05:43.930> out<00:05:44.140> of

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
you could try and get more time out of

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.620 
you could try and get more time out of
it<00:05:44.440> now<00:05:45.160> I<00:05:45.190> think<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:45.970> would<00:05:46.180> make<00:05:46.210> the

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630
