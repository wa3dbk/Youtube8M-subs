00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:06.110
 Hi friends, Good day to all 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.210
 this is again divanich well here it is the video 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.340
 will be dedicated 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.570
 another adapt for bike 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.300
 here I have two such lines 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.999
 length somewhere 30 centimeters and well 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.359
 both ends respectively velcro he 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.109
 so what is it and this is my brothers 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.289
 parking brake 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.679
 I explain there are such needs 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.630
 especially somewhere in the field 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:37.190
 secure the bike so that it does not 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.589
 moved backwards somewhere on some 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.949
 while there is often a slope 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.899
 or you need to fix it tightly 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.839
 so that he again, so here is not walking 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.460
 let's link some cargo 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.780
 very convenient and remove the lock 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.239
 when pumping up the wheel 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.949
 but how to do it well, not really 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.809
 put the shelves in the wheels so that he 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.569
 skated and that's it for me and 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.449
 there is such a thing as parking 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:10.270
 brake as it is fixed everything is very 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.280
 just push the brake lever and 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.280
 hooked onto velcro all lever 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.040
 fixed in the liquid state and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.229
 the bike does not twitch anywhere 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.780
 keeps it strong enough 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.490
 fairly safely you can safely 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.310
 do what maintenance 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.530
 for example it is good to accurately pump or pacifier 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.539
 boss's bike did not leave anywhere from you 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.259
 Well, just as calmly all this is possible 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:40.880
 As you see, release the belt to me these 2 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:45.170
 on the front and rear brakes here they are 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.119
 I have cable and I watched this idea 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.289
 again on the channel of one wonderful 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.140
 man, if I remember, I will not find 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.570
 necessarily a reference so that not 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.750
 giving someone else's idea for your idea is not mine 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.399
 the idea was honestly overseen but I decided 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.070
 to share with you as they say 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:10.340
 promote a good idea to the masses because 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.420
 that when we let other people's ideas honest 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 talking about the fact that they are strangers 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.120
 this is not plagiarism, I think it's just 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.670
 spreading good kids and this 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 good and right so it should be 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.780
 be therefore such a wonderful 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.750
 I think the idea is simply necessary 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.540
 promote and share it with you so 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.489
 what if you liked it 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.489
 and thank you all for your attention
