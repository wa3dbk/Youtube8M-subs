00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.620 
doing you know kind of very different
cinema<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> particular<00:02:06.150> reason

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
cinema so is there a particular reason

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.100 
cinema so is there a particular reason
behind<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.190> well<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.110> thing

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
behind that well I think that the thing

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.540 
behind that well I think that the thing
about<00:02:10.350> different<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:10.890> commercial<00:02:11.400> or

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
about different and commercial or

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.490 
about different and commercial or
whatever<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.910> think<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.300> these<00:02:12.500> definitions

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
whatever I think all these definitions

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.320 
whatever I think all these definitions
are<00:02:13.710> going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> cease<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> exist<00:02:14.490> soon<00:02:15.060> enough

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
are going to cease to exist soon enough

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.290 
are going to cease to exist soon enough
the<00:02:15.960> most<00:02:16.110> whatever<00:02:16.850> different<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:17.970> unlikely

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
the most whatever different and unlikely

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.700 
the most whatever different and unlikely
of<00:02:18.510> films<00:02:18.810> are<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.110> turn<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> be<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
of films are going to turn out to be the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.470 
of films are going to turn out to be the
most<00:02:19.890> commercially<00:02:20.430> successful<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:21.330> that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
most commercially successful and that

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.820 
most commercially successful and that
has<00:02:21.630> been<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> trend<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.230> last<00:02:22.290> two<00:02:22.590> years

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
has been the trend in the last two years

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.320 
has been the trend in the last two years
and<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.580> one<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.850> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.150> really

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and this one is going to be really

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.390 
and this one is going to be really
commercially<00:02:24.720> successful<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.440> I'm<00:02:25.980> sure<00:02:26.220> of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
commercially successful so I'm sure of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.780 
commercially successful so I'm sure of
it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.600

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
actually I've known him for a little bit

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.740 
actually I've known him for a little bit
there<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.550> sauciness<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.660> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
there is there is a sauciness and a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.390 
there is there is a sauciness and a
cheekiness<00:02:37.380> which<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.010> which<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.250> very

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
cheekiness which is which is very

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.610 
cheekiness which is which is very

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
interesting to watch and I think he's

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
interesting to watch and I think he's
got<00:02:40.830> caught<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.430> his<00:02:41.520> genes<00:02:41.790> he<00:02:42.300> may<00:02:42.480> not

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
got caught it in his genes he may not

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.449 
got caught it in his genes he may not
agree<00:02:42.840> he<00:02:43.290> may<00:02:43.440> think<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.770> he's<00:02:44.040> worked<00:02:44.250> hard

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
agree he may think that he's worked hard

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.390 
agree he may think that he's worked hard
for<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.850> but<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.270> do<00:02:45.600> see<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> lot<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.190> nature<00:02:47.190> in

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
