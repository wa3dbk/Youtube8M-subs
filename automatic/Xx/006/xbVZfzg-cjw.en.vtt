00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
it's a chip it's got idea there's got to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.269 
it's a chip it's got idea there's got to
be<00:00:27.269> by<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> deed<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.560> tea-making<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.189> it
