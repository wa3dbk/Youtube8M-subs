00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.060
 Welcome to my channel this time 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.250
 let's prepare gorditas then 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.120
 we are going we are going to occupy the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.610
 ingredients is drier 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.369
 salt wheat flour 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.070
 baking powder 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.019
 and of course there is water then we 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 here we have 33 maseca houses we're going 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:47.670
 to add a quarter of wheat flour 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.699
 we also give you to put 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.949
 a teaspoon of salt and we're going to 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.070
 put a teaspoon of powder to 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.070
 to bake 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.850
 and the water because the water is going to be the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.850
 required 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.030
 already as they carry I do not understand that there is a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.600
 Soft consistency is what we are going to 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.310
 go doing but more or less is this 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.720
 flour this amount takes away I think 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.110
 as ideal 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.110
 and again 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.770
 Now what we are going to do is be at 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.350
 I will be randomly Taped water 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.649
 our masses so that it looks like the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649
 we want 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.390
 now we have kneading 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.390
 5 minutes 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.230
 we are already staying 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.230
 to the textures we want it to be 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.300
 we are already doing our gorditas 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.490
 can be made as the size that 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.300
 we like and we are going to put them in our 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.300
 oil 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.719
 it's already the taste of size 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.120
 I say it's a little easier like that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.800
 by the hand that using the machine but 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.580
 yes you legs to the machine 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.580
 and it's OK 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.590
 then we are going to put it 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.590
 to fry 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.920
 to leave them in a little while at medium heat 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.300
 because we want to be sewn by 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.880
 inside and already when we look down and 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.880
 they are already a little bit so clear 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.300
 although then here they already have a 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.660
 respect and I'm going to flip them with a 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.660
 palita 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.079
 it has how they are left like this golden brown 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.550
 there are we are going to put them on a plate 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.530
 a small pot with our project 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.280
 closed package 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.100
 it does it in excess of the oil 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.690
 and we just fry our gorditas and 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.440
 are left this way and now what 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:41.240
 we're going to do is open it in the middle 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.280
 but not all of a little more than half 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.320
 and then be careful because they are 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.660
 hot like that 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.270
 we want to burn and then was 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.840
 so society inside as you see and 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.950
 we 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.980
 and then we have here ground beef that is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.790
 the one we're going to put inside also 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.840
 let's put beans from the pot that 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.590
 we have 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.170
 that you can already fill them with what 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.910
 that you have that if you do not have 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.629
 nothing more than that 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.629
 lettuce 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.300
 let's try to put everything like this 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.300
 in 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.450
 we are going to put also us 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.500
 we have a chili and tomato sauce 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.350
 very rich 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.360
 and we're going to put cheese cotija cheese 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.160
 fresh cheese that you want 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.770
 you can fill them as they are 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.780
 we want we do it from this 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.940
 way and it looks very good very chubby 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.750
 so I hope you liked this 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.290
 recipe and have an idea more about how 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:58.830
 make another meal more for you and 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.830
 thank you very much for visiting my channel
