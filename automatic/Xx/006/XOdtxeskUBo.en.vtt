hey guys and in this video we're gonna
be<00:00:01.800> talking<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.190> DMX<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.389> if<00:00:03.510> you're

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
be talking about DMX and if you're

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.210 
be talking about DMX and if you're
completely<00:00:04.049> new<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.290> DMX<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.799> video<00:00:05.040> should

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
completely new to DMX this video should

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.140 
completely new to DMX this video should
help<00:00:05.430> you<00:00:05.549> out<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.700> lot

help you out a lot
DMX<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> system<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.620> allows<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.950> to

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
DMX is a system that allows you to

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.440 
DMX is a system that allows you to
control<00:00:08.370> your<00:00:08.580> lighting<00:00:08.790> effects<00:00:09.179> from<00:00:09.300> a

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
control your lighting effects from a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.509 
control your lighting effects from a
controller<00:00:09.840> now<00:00:10.559> works<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.010> system<00:00:11.400> where

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
controller now works on a system where

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.039 
controller now works on a system where
you<00:00:11.580> give<00:00:11.730> each<00:00:11.969> parameter<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.719> light<00:00:12.870> a

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
you give each parameter of the light a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.020 
you give each parameter of the light a
number<00:00:13.259> known<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:13.830> its<00:00:13.950> Channel<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.519> then<00:00:14.910> by

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
number known as its Channel and then by

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.730 
number known as its Channel and then by
selecting<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.660> number<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.199> your<00:00:16.379> controller

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
selecting that number on your controller

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.010 
selecting that number on your controller
you<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.190> control<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.760> parameter<00:00:18.270> now<00:00:18.930> if

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
you can control that parameter now if

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.029 
you can control that parameter now if
you<00:00:19.080> look<00:00:19.199> at<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> specs<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.740> your<00:00:19.800> light

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
you look at the specs of your light

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
you look at the specs of your light
fixture<00:00:20.490> you'll<00:00:20.609> say<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.880> runs<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.300> six<00:00:21.630> DMX

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
fixture you'll say it runs in six DMX

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
fixture you'll say it runs in six DMX
channels<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.070> basically<00:00:23.490> means<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> have

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
channels this basically means you have

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.279 
channels this basically means you have
six<00:00:24.119> different<00:00:24.330> parameters<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> light

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
six different parameters of the light

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.830 
six different parameters of the light
that<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.619> control<00:00:26.070> via<00:00:26.340> DMX<00:00:26.609> now<00:00:27.539> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that you can control via DMX now some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.169 
that you can control via DMX now some
fixed<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> will<00:00:28.410> say<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> has<00:00:28.740> three<00:00:29.490> four<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
fixed it will say it has three four and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.510 
fixed it will say it has three four and
five<00:00:30.210> DMX<00:00:30.929> channel<00:00:31.230> modes<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:32.130> basically

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
five DMX channel modes this basically

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.979 
five DMX channel modes this basically
means<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.059> choose<00:00:33.270> how<00:00:33.510> many<00:00:33.570> channels

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
means you can choose how many channels

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
means you can choose how many channels
you<00:00:34.200> want<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> fixture<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> run<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.160> consider

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you want the fixture to run in consider

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.720 
you want the fixture to run in consider
it<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.120> an<00:00:36.420> advanced<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> simple<00:00:37.680> mode<00:00:37.920> now

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it to be an advanced and simple mode now

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
lights now you're going to need DMX

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
lights now you're going to need DMX
cable<00:00:48.629> which<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> usually<00:00:49.320> three<00:00:49.710> pin<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.280> five

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
cable which is usually three pin or five

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.540 
cable which is usually three pin or five
pin<00:00:50.940> XLR<00:00:51.149> cable<00:00:51.989> most<00:00:52.680> DJ<00:00:53.039> lights<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.430> use

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
pin XLR cable most DJ lights will use

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.029 
pin XLR cable most DJ lights will use
three<00:00:53.850> pin<00:00:54.090> you'll<00:00:54.660> only<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.379> find<00:00:55.680> five

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
three pin you'll only really find five

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.410 
three pin you'll only really find five
pin<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.640> some<00:00:56.789> more<00:00:56.850> professional

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
pin when you get some more professional

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
pin when you get some more professional
lighting<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:58.469> three<00:00:58.710> pin<00:00:58.890> DMX<00:00:59.280> cable<00:00:59.609> looks

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
lighting now three pin DMX cable looks

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
lighting now three pin DMX cable looks
exactly<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> same<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.570> normal<00:01:01.050> XLR<00:01:01.559> audio

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
exactly the same as normal XLR audio

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
exactly the same as normal XLR audio
cable<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.940> theory<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:03.989> normal

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
cable and in theory you can use normal

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.950 
cable and in theory you can use normal
XLR<00:01:04.860> audio<00:01:05.010> cable<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.700> controlling<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.270> DMX

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
XLR audio cable for controlling your DMX

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740 
XLR audio cable for controlling your DMX
lights<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.890> don't<00:01:08.130> recommend<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.729> DMX<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
lights but I don't recommend it DMX is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.820 
lights but I don't recommend it DMX is
shielded<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> stop<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:10.650> getting

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
shielded to stop you're getting

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.590 
shielded to stop you're getting
interference<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> DMX<00:01:12.030> signal<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
interference with the DMX signal a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.899 
interference with the DMX signal a
normal<00:01:12.990> XLR<00:01:13.380> cable<00:01:13.710> isn't<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.760> really

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
normal XLR cable isn't but that's really

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.330 
normal XLR cable isn't but that's really
a<00:01:15.000> topic<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.420> another<00:01:15.509> separate<00:01:16.049> video<00:01:16.340> now

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a topic for another separate video now

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.469 
a topic for another separate video now
when<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.850> back<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.240> lights

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
when you look at the back of your lights

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
when you look at the back of your lights
you'll<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> DMX<00:01:19.229> input<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.920> outputs<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you'll see a DMX input and outputs you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
you'll see a DMX input and outputs you
can<00:01:21.240> daisy<00:01:21.659> chain<00:01:21.840> DMX<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.710> basically<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.369> go

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
can daisy chain DMX so basically you go

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.850 
can daisy chain DMX so basically you go
DMX<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.720> controller<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.740> your

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
DMX out of your controller and into your

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
DMX out of your controller and into your
first<00:01:26.130> fixture<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> first

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
first fixture then out of the first

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
first fixture then out of the first
fixture<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.770> second<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.640> on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
fixture into the second and so on

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
fixture into the second and so on
through<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.329> fixtures<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.560> can

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
through all of your fixtures you can

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.319 
through all of your fixtures you can
also<00:01:31.799> get<00:01:32.040> DMX<00:01:32.490> splitters<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> need<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
also get DMX splitters if you need to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
also get DMX splitters if you need to
split<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.720> signal<00:01:34.170> which<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.710> useful<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
split your signal which is useful if you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
split your signal which is useful if you
need<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.460> run<00:01:35.579> dmx<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.240> either<00:01:36.479> side<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> a

need to run dmx down either side of a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.499 
need to run dmx down either side of a
venue<00:01:37.759> now<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:38.909> important<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
venue now one important thing to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.850 
venue now one important thing to
remember<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.840> setting<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.290> lights<00:01:40.650> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
remember when setting up your lights is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.420 
remember when setting up your lights is
DMX<00:01:41.610> cable<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> only<00:01:42.329> handle<00:01:42.840> 512<00:01:43.829> channels

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
or parameters of light control now this

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.990 
or parameters of light control now this
will<00:01:46.770> become<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.189> clearer<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.729> minute

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
will become a bit clearer in a minute

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.480 
will become a bit clearer in a minute
it's<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> good<00:01:48.960> idea<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> DMX<00:01:49.950> Terminator

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it's a good idea to use a DMX Terminator

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.850 
it's a good idea to use a DMX Terminator
on<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> end<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.060> daisy<00:01:51.390> chain<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:52.590> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
on the end of your daisy chain all this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
on the end of your daisy chain all this
is<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.340> basically<00:01:53.520> an<00:01:53.880> XLR<00:01:54.360> plug<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
is is basically an XLR plug with a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660 
is is basically an XLR plug with a
resistor<00:01:55.350> inside<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.369> when<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> put

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
resistor inside of it and when you put

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.730 
resistor inside of it and when you put
it<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> end<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.329> your<00:01:57.390> DMX<00:01:57.810> chain<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> stops

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it on the end of your DMX chain it stops

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
it on the end of your DMX chain it stops
you<00:01:58.860> getting<00:01:58.979> signals<00:01:59.549> reflected<00:02:00.149> back<00:02:00.360> down

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you getting signals reflected back down

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.899 
you getting signals reflected back down
the<00:02:00.780> cable<00:02:00.990> basically<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> ends<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> DMX

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the cable basically it ends the DMX

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.850 
the cable basically it ends the DMX
signal<00:02:03.299> there

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
signal there

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.230 
signal there
DMX<00:02:04.860> reflections<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.579> give<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> errors<00:02:06.119> in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
DMX reflections can give you errors in

DMX reflections can give you errors in
your<00:02:06.360> lights<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:07.350> using<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:07.799> DMX

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
your lights now using your DMX

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
your lights now using your DMX
Terminator<00:02:08.610> isn't<00:02:08.970> essential<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.569> think

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
Terminator isn't essential but I think

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.290 
Terminator isn't essential but I think
it's<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.020> good<00:02:10.140> idea<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.970> now<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.000> need<00:02:12.209> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
it's a good idea to do now you need to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
it's a good idea to do now you need to
address<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.750> lighting<00:02:13.110> fixture

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
address your lighting fixture

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
address your lighting fixture
is<00:02:13.920> basically<00:02:14.130> saying<00:02:14.580> which<00:02:14.880> channels<00:02:15.330> out

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is basically saying which channels out

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.870 
is basically saying which channels out
of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.660> 512<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.860> particular<00:02:17.370> fixture<00:02:17.640> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
of the 512 that particular fixture is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.060 
of the 512 that particular fixture is
controlled<00:02:18.270> with<00:02:18.480> I've<00:02:19.170> drawn<00:02:19.620> out<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.800> plan<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
controlled with I've drawn out a plan to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.860 
controlled with I've drawn out a plan to
hopefully<00:02:20.580> make<00:02:20.700> explaining<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.510> clearer

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
hopefully make explaining this clearer

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.470 
hopefully make explaining this clearer
each<00:02:22.500> number<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.010> see<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.520> single<00:02:24.060> DMX

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
each number you see is a single DMX

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
each number you see is a single DMX
channel<00:02:24.900> now<00:02:25.500> remember<00:02:25.920> one<00:02:26.190> single<00:02:26.490> line<00:02:26.790> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
channel now remember one single line of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.780 
channel now remember one single line of
DMX<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.540> only<00:02:27.660> hold<00:02:27.900> 512<00:02:28.860> channels<00:02:29.340> which<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
DMX can only hold 512 channels which is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.860 
DMX can only hold 512 channels which is
why<00:02:30.000> when<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.210> scroll<00:02:30.570> through<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
why when you scroll through the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.750 
why when you scroll through the
addressing<00:02:31.320> on<00:02:31.440> your<00:02:31.560> DMX<00:02:31.920> light<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.580> only

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
addressing on your DMX light it only

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.960 
addressing on your DMX light it only
goes<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.180> 512<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:35.100> my<00:02:35.250> plan<00:02:35.460> here<00:02:35.760> only

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
goes up to 512 now my plan here only

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.640 
goes up to 512 now my plan here only
goes<00:02:36.120> up<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.300> 80<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.050> would<00:02:37.230> go<00:02:37.440> all<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
goes up to 80 but it would go all the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.850 
goes up to 80 but it would go all the
way<00:02:37.740> up<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.950> 512<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.180> had<00:02:39.330> rim<00:02:39.570> now<00:02:40.530> let's<00:02:40.710> say

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
way up to 512 if I had rim now let's say

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.860 
way up to 512 if I had rim now let's say
we<00:02:40.980> wanted<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> address<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.880> mega<00:02:42.150> pal<00:02:42.390> profile

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
we wanted to address a mega pal profile

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.200 
we wanted to address a mega pal profile
in<00:02:43.050> 3<00:02:43.380> channel<00:02:43.740> mode<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.730> let's<00:02:44.910> set<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.060> to

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
in 3 channel mode so let's set it to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.660 
in 3 channel mode so let's set it to
address<00:02:45.510> 1<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.950> takes<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.340> 3

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
address 1 now you can see it takes up 3

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.180 
address 1 now you can see it takes up 3
out<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:48.060> our<00:02:48.180> DMX<00:02:48.570> channels<00:02:48.990> now<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> want<00:02:50.100> to

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
out of our DMX channels now I want to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.190 
out of our DMX channels now I want to
add<00:02:50.310> another<00:02:50.550> mega<00:02:50.790> part<00:02:51.090> profile<00:02:51.570> now

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
add another mega part profile now

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.170 
add another mega part profile now
channels<00:02:52.590> 1<00:02:52.770> 2<00:02:53.010> &amp;<00:02:53.160> 3<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.550> being<00:02:53.790> used<00:02:53.970> by<00:02:54.120> the

channels 1 2 &amp; 3 are being used by the
other<00:02:54.360> light<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.870> I'm<00:02:54.960> going<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> put<00:02:55.350> this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
other light so I'm going to put this

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.250 
other light so I'm going to put this
light<00:02:55.710> on<00:02:55.920> channels<00:02:56.280> 4<00:02:56.550> 5<00:02:56.850> &amp;<00:02:57.060> 6<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.110> also

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
light on channels 4 5 &amp; 6 now I also

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.870 
light on channels 4 5 &amp; 6 now I also
want<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.590> add<00:02:58.740> one<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.980> my<00:02:59.040> scanners<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.640> that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
want to add one of my scanners and that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.450 
want to add one of my scanners and that
uses<00:03:00.240> 6<00:03:00.540> channels<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.590> add<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.220> using

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
uses 6 channels so I add that in using

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.760 
uses 6 channels so I add that in using
channel<00:03:02.970> 7<00:03:03.300> through<00:03:03.480> 12<00:03:03.660> now<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.500> don't<00:03:04.680> have

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
channel 7 through 12 now you don't have

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.290 
channel 7 through 12 now you don't have
to<00:03:04.860> do<00:03:05.010> them<00:03:05.100> all<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.340> order<00:03:05.580> using<00:03:05.940> up<00:03:06.090> all<00:03:06.240> the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
to do them all in order using up all the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.970 
to do them all in order using up all the
channels<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.900> could<00:03:07.440> throw<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.770> lighter

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
channels I could throw in a lighter

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.520 
channels I could throw in a lighter
channels<00:03:08.520> 44<00:03:09.120> through<00:03:09.360> 46<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.140> wanted<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
channels 44 through 46 if I wanted to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.680 
channels 44 through 46 if I wanted to
now<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.490> important<00:03:11.940> number<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.420> first

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
now the important number is the first

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.050 
now the important number is the first
channel<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.170> each<00:03:13.290> fixture<00:03:13.710> when<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:14.610> go<00:03:14.760> set

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
channel of each fixture when you go set

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.940 
channel of each fixture when you go set
your<00:03:15.210> DMX<00:03:15.600> address<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.080> your<00:03:16.110> light<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.740> is

your DMX address on your light this is

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.800 
your DMX address on your light this is
the<00:03:16.980> number<00:03:17.310> you'll<00:03:17.460> use<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.360> when<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:18.630> go<00:03:18.720> on

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
the number you'll use so when we go on

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.600 
the number you'll use so when we go on
to<00:03:18.930> our<00:03:19.020> digital<00:03:19.170> display<00:03:19.740> or<00:03:19.980> using<00:03:20.280> our<00:03:20.400> dip

switches depending on your light we can

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.770 
switches depending on your light we can
set<00:03:22.410> our<00:03:22.500> DMX<00:03:22.860> address<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.270> example<00:03:24.660> that

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
set our DMX address so for example that

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.600 
set our DMX address so for example that
first<00:03:24.840> mega<00:03:25.410> power<00:03:25.650> profile<00:03:26.130> we're<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.520> to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
first mega power profile we're going to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.820 
first mega power profile we're going to
set<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.030> DMX<00:03:27.360> channel<00:03:27.660> 1<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.110> our<00:03:28.440> second

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
set that to DMX channel 1 and our second

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.470 
set that to DMX channel 1 and our second
mega<00:03:28.980> power<00:03:29.190> profile<00:03:29.670> well<00:03:30.090> that's<00:03:30.240> going<00:03:30.420> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
mega power profile well that's going to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.230 
mega power profile well that's going to
be<00:03:30.540> set<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.020> DMX<00:03:31.440> address<00:03:31.740> number<00:03:32.040> 4<00:03:32.280> now<00:03:33.120> how

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
be set to DMX address number 4 now how

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.460 
be set to DMX address number 4 now how
you<00:03:33.300> set<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.660> light<00:03:33.840> varies<00:03:34.230> on<00:03:34.350> your

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
you set the light varies on your

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.530 
you set the light varies on your
particular<00:03:34.710> fixture<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:36.000> also<00:03:36.270> you<00:03:36.360> want<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
particular fixture and also you want to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.480 
particular fixture and also you want to
make<00:03:36.720> sure<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.050> have<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.320> correct<00:03:37.500> DMX<00:03:38.190> mode

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
make sure you have the correct DMX mode

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.770 
make sure you have the correct DMX mode
if<00:03:38.670> you're<00:03:38.790> fixed<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.240> do<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.540> for

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
if you're fixed you can do that for

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.540 
if you're fixed you can do that for
example<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.680> mega<00:03:40.920> power<00:03:41.130> profile

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
example I have this mega power profile

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.820 
example I have this mega power profile
set<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.910> 3<00:03:42.240> channel<00:03:42.600> mode<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:43.170> address<00:03:43.530> number

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
set in 3 channel mode at address number

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.100 
set in 3 channel mode at address number
4<00:03:44.070> now<00:03:44.790> if<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.000> wanted<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.480> could<00:03:45.750> have<00:03:45.780> more

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
4 now if I wanted to I could have more

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.720 
4 now if I wanted to I could have more
than<00:03:46.140> one<00:03:46.320> light<00:03:46.680> fixture<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.520> same

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
than one light fixture on the same

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.940 
than one light fixture on the same
Channel<00:03:48.210> so<00:03:48.930> I've<00:03:49.050> got<00:03:49.200> my<00:03:49.320> 2<00:03:49.380> mega<00:03:49.740> power

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
Channel so I've got my 2 mega power

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.740 
Channel so I've got my 2 mega power
profiles<00:03:50.400> I've<00:03:50.550> just<00:03:50.700> set<00:03:50.880> up<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.210> I<00:03:51.390> want<00:03:51.600> to

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
profiles I've just set up and I want to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.210 
profiles I've just set up and I want to
have<00:03:51.900> them<00:03:52.080> both<00:03:52.230> doing<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.650> same<00:03:52.860> thing<00:03:53.100> at

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
have them both doing the same thing at

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.470 
have them both doing the same thing at
the<00:03:53.250> same<00:03:53.310> time<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.150> doesn't<00:03:54.390> matter

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
the same time and it doesn't matter

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.690 
the same time and it doesn't matter
about<00:03:54.780> controlling<00:03:55.380> them<00:03:55.530> separately<00:03:56.010> now<00:03:56.670> I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
about controlling them separately now I

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.520 
about controlling them separately now I
can<00:03:56.880> set<00:03:57.030> them<00:03:57.150> both<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.540> be<00:03:57.570> DMX<00:03:58.020> channel<00:03:58.350> 1

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
can set them both to be DMX channel 1

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.200 
can set them both to be DMX channel 1
and<00:03:58.770> then<00:03:59.040> both<00:03:59.220> do<00:03:59.370> exactly<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.820> same<00:03:59.880> thing

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
and then both do exactly the same thing

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.370 
and then both do exactly the same thing
so<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.420> don't<00:04:00.450> have<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.870> have<00:04:00.990> them<00:04:01.140> all<00:04:01.350> on

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
so you don't have to have them all on

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.140 
so you don't have to have them all on
separate<00:04:01.950> addresses<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.490> can<00:04:02.700> double<00:04:03.090> up

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
separate addresses you can double up

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.940 
separate addresses you can double up
lighting<00:04:03.540> fixtures<00:04:03.900> using<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.320> same<00:04:04.530> DMX

lighting fixtures using the same DMX

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.890 
lighting fixtures using the same DMX
address<00:04:05.280> now<00:04:06.150> if<00:04:06.240> you<00:04:06.330> ever<00:04:06.420> get<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.690> point

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
address now if you ever get to the point

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.420 
address now if you ever get to the point
where<00:04:07.140> you're<00:04:07.260> using<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:07.770> many<00:04:07.890> lights<00:04:08.220> you

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
where you're using so many lights you

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.820 
where you're using so many lights you
need<00:04:08.520> more<00:04:08.760> than<00:04:08.910> 512<00:04:09.780> channels<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.500> DMX

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
need more than 512 channels of DMX

need more than 512 channels of DMX
control<00:04:11.490> you'll<00:04:12.000> need<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.209> get<00:04:12.330> a<00:04:12.360> controller

that<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:13.080> run<00:04:13.200> additional<00:04:13.830> lines<00:04:14.070> of<00:04:14.280> DMX<00:04:14.700> now

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
that can run additional lines of DMX now

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.240 
that can run additional lines of DMX now
each<00:04:15.510> line<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.780> DMX<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.440> known<00:04:16.620> as<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.770> DMX

each line of DMX is known as a DMX

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.430 
each line of DMX is known as a DMX

course<00:04:19.620> 512<00:04:20.430> channels<00:04:20.850> now<00:04:21.480> for<00:04:21.660> most<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.930> us

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.990

we're<00:04:22.350> never<00:04:22.500> going<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.740> go<00:04:22.860> near<00:04:23.130> 512

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
we're never going to go near 512

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.490 
we're never going to go near 512
channels<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.570> wouldn't<00:04:24.810> worry<00:04:24.930> about<00:04:25.260> it

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500

now<00:04:26.190> we've<00:04:26.310> addressed<00:04:26.520> our<00:04:26.820> lights<00:04:27.000> we<00:04:27.180> can<00:04:27.270> go

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
now we've addressed our lights we can go

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:27.680 
now we've addressed our lights we can go
over

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690
