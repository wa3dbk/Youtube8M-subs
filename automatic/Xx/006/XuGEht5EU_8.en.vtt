00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.299
 about what I think so far 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.830
 place or first we go for a moment 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.480
 about the connection at the moment 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.370
 because a connection at the moment is real 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.660
 just heavy poo i want the other 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.370
 is not telling me what I actually am 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.590
 means because I actually want you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.150
 I know what I want to say 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.619
 just call it heavy poo the connection 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 at the moment is just heavy poop on the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 playstation on the xbox I don't know 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.109
 I don't remember the computer on the place 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 This one is just heavy poo if you come with one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.980
 party for example, newspaper start as 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.789
 you it and nine man party gel for we 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.380
 start 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.899
 takes a while before you're not playing 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100
 the party falls apart very often and me 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.110
 don't know what is happening mars 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.640
 just really annoying right now 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 just chill black or they play and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.309
 further 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.170
 if you shit in a portal then you get it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.670
 also very often frame work and that she likes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.200
 in that just suddenly your whole call or 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.300
 duty is leaking while still on one 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.620
 4 bar plays and even when I'm not on you 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.270
 a party it's just something 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.800
 two blackops because I was just sitting 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.629
 I was a little single player 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.370
 crazy about the multiplayer so that's the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.289
 is called objects that I go for a moment 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 to the single player and there I had it 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.890
 frame black still when i single 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.149
 player was the first mission 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.860
 the doing was leaking me call of duty 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.780
 just still no me for a moment 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.950
 Do zombies to tasty ones still 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.659
 I don't know if it's a picture of mine 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.130
 cd i don't know if it's the pictures of the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.119
 game mania i don't know if the pictures are from 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.380
 call of Duty 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.119
 I don't know if it is just a break or 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.710
 just so my question to you 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.060
 is momentarily 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 whether you have this or you too 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.570
 so have a frame black or that you 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.950
 also really clean really bad 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.840
 have a connection or something in that direction 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.130
 because then I know the week that I am not 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.509
 I am the only one with lots and lots 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.259
 Friends of mine hear that theirs too 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.759
 to have 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.680
 and further place or two I think it's real 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.200
 just a fantastic game it plays 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.810
 tasty and the little perth in there 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.460
 have few weapons compared to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.350
 another call of duty is but that makes 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 it is balanced again the less 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.579
 weapons are in it, the more they balance 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.380
 able to make i think video i 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.329
 this week also another update will be 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.130
 for the connection to whatever 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.899
 things to call them because the most on this 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.670
 moment I grenades that always throws the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.140
 frames and everything I find on this 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.430
 Currently still sucks a bit about going 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.210
 you also hear me say in a red 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.770
 commander 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 I have with the scientific update 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 you i quit red commander i 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 me explain why this is coming 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.509
 because i have 21 episode on faith of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 that big bowl and the we are alive to 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.479
 32 level 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.340
 and also one that I have played I have 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.020
 recorded only after a while 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.620
 that frame black and so I could not 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.349
 chill spa 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.580
 each and every one that i joined, leaked my gates 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.019
 that fall and just have a hard time 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.430
 a lot kees floor i just go to them 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.319
 all I have uploaded so far 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.069
 made and you just love it again 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.269
 some of my credit 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.560
 I still just want that red 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.909
 will do documents but the will 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.930
 probably just another 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.879
 prestige had 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.799
 maybe from prestige 10 as just that 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.030
 connection is just right and then I am 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.290
 so I also have to wait for this moment 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.970
 is now on my own grande 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.440
 being the games I have here beside me 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.150
 call of duty black I am still open 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.989
 can click your faimes and just ff again 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.060
 cold to play 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.860
 why this moment also level 34 I go 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.170
 just leveling through I'm going to a game 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.790
 place fire get a look what the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.440
 chilling weapon sawyer to chilling cd 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.760
 business you all go tips 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.349
 but currently finds in black 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.329
 or is really just a good game 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.160
 except for one point and that is that connection 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.739
 issues I just find it annoying 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.239
 that that's just the case again it is 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.859
 with every call of duty so far it 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.709
 case just had a connection 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.329
 quite dredging is the release on 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.159
 it was about three or so you could 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.530
 just pretty much not a game dude 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.440
 every one that you join the leaked now at work 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.819
 or two is it so again on black us one 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.379
 it was also a toadette connection 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.400
 the beginning was just really scared and me 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.560
 just hope they are as soon as possible 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.120
 release an update and that is 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.780
 fix the grave it now comes naturally 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.579
 also because there really is just 450 500,000 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.380
 people simultaneously want to call or online 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.889
 duty then it will work but that must 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.450
 we just don't let them lay 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.519
 that should not have the call of duty made 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.470
 even though there are 500,000 people online it 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.060
 I just have to keep working 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.230
 I hope so just go out quietly update 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.730
 and this was just brief 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.319
 few comment that I keep the time 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.280
 quite satisfactory that the game is lagging behind 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.660
 to on by 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.010
 then play tis name of sjors doing games 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.569
 I got what I didn't want 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.329
 more to play an online that I am going to 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.340
 that big bowl and the late will damn it 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.900
 make only 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.459
 charge level you also ordinary counts too 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.410
 count for your kills counts for your des 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.970
 Chaux looks is just normal game mode 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.410
 counts for everything so I find that on 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.400
 nice but bottom also best 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.560
 sometimes thailand if you want 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.030
 fucked or so in sharpshooter it succeeds 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.829
 no longer because it counts for everything 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.790
 but that is just a matter of things 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.620
 that doesn't matter to me because 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.660
 lots of sharpshooter or sticks and 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.099
 You don't play stones but yes 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.139
 black if i really just find a top 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.669
 game it's nice palace its not from 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.099
 those about power-ups are not of those 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.109
 about powertools sad you easy 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.190
 can pick up some kills i'm sure about 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.800
 pope will also take you in my road to 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.030
 commander get to see those are really too 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.170
 strong but so 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.150
 to use it is no longer normal 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.290
 I had a killstreak once 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
 I then vests of 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.130
 box this killstreak is cool yes yes 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.690
 yes yes yes and then got one 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.490
 energy boost that could already be red 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.230
 documents I just go quite a day 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.430
 upload an episode until they are set aside 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.260
 and then I'll just continue with normal 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.000
 comes like this just goes fast 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
 may all upload for you 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.820
 also give a lot of tips in i wrote 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.800
 to commander series and I think so 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.500
 you will like it but 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.450
 just every time you block 8 hours of sleep 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.740
 comes an episode online him handsome 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.150
 best at this time all land ran 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.190
 remark really only takes half an hour each 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.750
 delivery to brake for all 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.460
 episode that I have made so far 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.110
 I think one for 12 minutes 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.130
 risk card delivery mike ga nothing 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.750
 reveals more because otherwise I will collapse 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.340
 my eroticism less on families I wanted 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.070
 make this much admit to the connection 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.510
 can youse be discussed with you and or 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.740
 you ok we also bother you 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.880
 from frame black 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.320
 do you also bother you no 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.160
 you will find gamescon somewhere 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.500
 to suffer from 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.760
 at the moment with black as two because me 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.380

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.260

 if you wish you had it down and i would 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.040
 definitely recommend it 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.720
 maybe you can then just wait 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.190
 until the first updates released that 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.110
