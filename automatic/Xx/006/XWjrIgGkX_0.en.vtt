00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
about on a fruit based raw food diet so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.810 
about on a fruit based raw food diet so

what's going on here I'm going to link

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.660 
what's going on here I'm going to link
to<00:02:05.880> an<00:02:06.270> article<00:02:06.390> explaining<00:02:06.840> how<00:02:07.670> fat

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
to an article explaining how fat

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
to an article explaining how fat
consumption<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.479> directly<00:02:10.050> correlated<00:02:10.680> with

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
consumption is directly correlated with

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
consumption is directly correlated with
high<00:02:11.340> blood<00:02:12.240> sugar<00:02:12.630> levels

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
high blood sugar levels

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.760 
high blood sugar levels
high<00:02:13.470> blood<00:02:13.800> sugar<00:02:14.100> levels<00:02:15.260> basically<00:02:16.260> leads

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
high blood sugar levels basically leads

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.960 
high blood sugar levels basically leads
to<00:02:16.980> candida<00:02:17.460> overgrowth<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.930> your<00:02:19.970> as

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
to candida overgrowth because as your as

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.000 
to candida overgrowth because as your as
your<00:02:21.240> bloodstream<00:02:21.480> gets<00:02:22.380> clogged<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:22.950> with

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
your bloodstream gets clogged up with

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.760 
your bloodstream gets clogged up with
all<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.430> sugar<00:02:23.700> because<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.350> fat<00:02:25.590> in

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
all that sugar because all the fat in

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.010 
all that sugar because all the fat in
the<00:02:25.890> blood<00:02:26.070> streams<00:02:26.430> blocks<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.330> movement<00:02:27.510> of

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the blood streams blocks the movement of

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.840 
the blood streams blocks the movement of
the<00:02:28.260> sugar<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.890> bloodstream<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
the sugar in the bloodstream to the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.380 
the sugar in the bloodstream to the
cells<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.610> sugar<00:02:32.970> rushing

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
cells you then get the the sugar rushing

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.680 
cells you then get the the sugar rushing
in<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.840> smacks<00:02:34.200> up<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.460> body's<00:02:35.910> way

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
in it just smacks up and the body's way

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.500 
in it just smacks up and the body's way
of<00:02:36.720> dealing<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.100> send<00:02:39.000> Candida

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
of dealing with that is to send Candida

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.720 
of dealing with that is to send Candida
in<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:40.170> feeds<00:02:40.500> off<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.830> overgrowth<00:02:41.490> it's

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
in it feeds off the overgrowth it's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.060 
in it feeds off the overgrowth it's
unpleasant<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.960> helps<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.560> out<00:02:43.590> from

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
unpleasant but it it helps you out from

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
having really ridiculous high blood

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.220 
having really ridiculous high blood
sugar<00:02:46.650> problems<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.930> really

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
sugar problems so this is really

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.900 
sugar problems so this is really
unpleasant<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.860> want<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.160> avoid<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.670> so

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
unpleasant and you want to avoid it so

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.040 
unpleasant and you want to avoid it so
how<00:02:51.180> do<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.360> avoid<00:02:51.690> it

how do you avoid it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.590 
how do you avoid it
the<00:02:52.440> answer<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.130> extremely<00:02:53.760> simple<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.360> that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
the answer is extremely simple and that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.449 
the answer is extremely simple and that
is<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:57.090> get<00:02:57.750> rid<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.200> fast<00:02:58.470> now

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
is that you just get rid of the fast now

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.490 
is that you just get rid of the fast now
if<00:02:59.850> you're<00:03:00.060> having<00:03:00.239> significant<00:03:01.080> Candida

a couple weeks you should be completely

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.660 
a couple weeks you should be completely
over<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.540> no<00:03:21.750> problem<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.709> healthy

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
over this no problem a healthy

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.479 
over this no problem a healthy
individual<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:25.170> really<00:03:25.709> if<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.340> who's

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
individual it really if it who's

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.949 
individual it really if it who's
physically<00:03:26.880> active<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.360> circulating<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
physically active and circulating in the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.620 
physically active and circulating in the
blood<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.319> will<00:03:28.970> generally<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.270> get<00:03:30.390> pad

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
blood it will generally you can get pad

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.309 
blood it will generally you can get pad
of<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.900> bloodstream<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.800> less<00:03:32.220> than<00:03:32.400> 48<00:03:32.819> hours

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
of the bloodstream in less than 48 hours

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.130 
of the bloodstream in less than 48 hours
so<00:03:34.819> it<00:03:35.819> really<00:03:36.060> should<00:03:36.239> not<00:03:36.390> take<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.690> long<00:03:36.810> time

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
so it really should not take a long time

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.870 
so it really should not take a long time
for<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> overcome<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.610> what<00:03:38.790> do

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
for you to overcome this and so what do

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.320 
for you to overcome this and so what do
you<00:03:38.940> do<00:03:39.060> instead<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:40.069> route<00:03:41.069> these<00:03:41.849> keeping

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
you do instead you route these keeping

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.910 
you do instead you route these keeping
in<00:03:42.420> those<00:03:42.569> greens<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.349> can<00:03:43.560> get<00:03:43.739> your

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
in those greens but you can get your

in those greens but you can get your
calories<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:44.550> fruit<00:03:44.940> low<00:03:45.180> fat<00:03:45.480> fruits<00:03:45.750> like
