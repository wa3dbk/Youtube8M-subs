this Bishop Bishop drops back actually
to<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:23.630> free<00:02:24.640> might<00:02:25.640> be<00:02:25.790> safer<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.090> put<00:02:26.270> Bishop

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
to be free might be safer to put Bishop

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.950 
to be free might be safer to put Bishop
on<00:02:26.960> e2<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.580> solid<00:02:28.790> position<00:02:30.280> okay<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.960> b6

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
on e2 with a solid position okay so b6

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.740 
on e2 with a solid position okay so b6
and<00:02:33.490> another<00:02:34.490> side<00:02:35.030> effect<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> bishop

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and another side effect of the bishop

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.110 
and another side effect of the bishop
being<00:02:35.960> here<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.680> actually<00:02:37.010> Bishop<00:02:37.310> a6<00:02:37.790> is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
being here is that actually Bishop a6 is

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.960 
being here is that actually Bishop a6 is
annoying<00:02:38.600> for<00:02:38.900> white<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.320> this<00:02:40.010> leads<00:02:40.190> for<00:02:40.940> a

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
annoying for white and this leads for a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.990 
annoying for white and this leads for a
slight<00:02:41.380> contortion<00:02:42.380> against<00:02:42.710> this<00:02:42.830> mighty<00:02:43.610> to

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
slight contortion against this mighty to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.630 
slight contortion against this mighty to

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
and maybe even play for d5 but it takes

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.750 
and maybe even play for d5 but it takes
a<00:03:14.810> lot<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.020> time<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:16.190> plan<00:03:16.540> night<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.690> c6<00:03:18.760> is
