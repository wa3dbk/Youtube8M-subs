00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello we are on the computer 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 2014 we are now at the asus presentation 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.950
 and they showed a lot of devices one of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.320
 which was okay start with the background 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.410
 if you remember a few days before 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 presentations before the asus exhibition on his 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 youtube channel showed us a small 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.760
 teaser where in the blender they put 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.920
 smartphone tablet and asus zenbook on Mindy 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 and when I tell my friends what they are 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.610
 they did it and it worked out for me 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 everyone asks what kind of blender are they 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.750
 will show so in general, that's what they showed 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.239
 it turned out no blender is not smart 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.739
 Blender is finally a 5v device 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.690
 one all waited five in one 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.469
 and now we saw it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.190
 is this android smartphone this is android 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.420
 the tablet 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.629
 This is a windows tablet and two more is 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.640
 windows laptop and android smartbook all 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.489
 this can be used separately 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.800
 well, except for a laptop, let's 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.030
 now look in turn what of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.220
 represents each of these 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 devices and so let's start with the smartphone 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.200
 This smartphone is based on 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.280
 intel core felt processors 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 quad here we have two 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.689
 gigabytes of ram and probably 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.310
 unfortunately but nevertheless the whole thing 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.610
 should cost me their money therefore 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.799
 here 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 hd resolution by 5 inches placed 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 There is where permissions but nonetheless 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.170
 speaking of such versatility 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.330
 devices you can probably forgive everything 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.100
 also installed on top of android 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 branded shell 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.229
 earth oh let's see which android 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 we have the latest 442 inside android 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.130
 we will not dwell on all this 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.890
 detail now insert the smartphone in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.390
 tablet the word saying tablet can 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 working separately is full 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.890
 tablet on people touch screen even 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.590
 if you will not leave here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.320
 smartphone you can use windows 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.659
 but so here up to 4 gigabytes of operational 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.549
 memory up to 128 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.670
 ssd in general now i'm doing it all from scratch 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.990
 here we have a tablet with a 12-inch 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.840
 HD display here can be up to four 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.700
 GB of RAM and up to 128 ssd 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.670
 and what happens when we insert 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.750
 here the smartphone and the following happens 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.480
 a window is displayed 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.600
 which actually shows the same 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.940
 a smartphone, that is, information from a device 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.680
 and there is something like implemented so far 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750
 what we don't know exactly what works here 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.400
 but the interactions between windows and 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.800
 android you can at least 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.560
 drag photos from here to this 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.970
 the screen also told us from vord to 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.340
 For example, you can also copy text 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.410
 straight from android windows but we still 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.330
 let's see how it works more accurately 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.160
 Metro interface of this window, by the way, no 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.780
 and after we insert it all 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.610
 matter in the keyboard we can change 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.500
 operating system between windows and 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.940
 android and all this takes 2 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.860
 seconds even a little less as we were told 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.340
 after that we see android in this 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.110
 here is the form 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.150
 naturally used your iron 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.489
 smartphone let's see what 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.550
 located sides we have yusbi 30 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.180
 we have usb 2 0 this is on the dokken itself 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.540
 the tablet has a hdmi connector for 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.340
 headset connection there are buttons 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.600
 toggle windows button 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.900
 mechanical there is an adjustment key 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.790
 volume also key lock total 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.920

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.720
 micro usb cover removable bottom connector 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.239

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.950
