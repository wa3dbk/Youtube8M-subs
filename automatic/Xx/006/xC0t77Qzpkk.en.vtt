fairly healthy I did diet again if you

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.690 
fairly healthy I did diet again if you
guys<00:02:20.890> can't<00:02:21.310> really<00:02:21.579> tell<00:02:21.879> to<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.180> kind<00:02:22.329> of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
guys can't really tell to this kind of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.809 
guys can't really tell to this kind of
it<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.360> did<00:02:24.140> diet<00:02:24.410> what<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.800> box<00:02:25.190> colored<00:02:25.700> I

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
it but I did diet what a box colored I

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.550 
it but I did diet what a box colored I
the<00:02:25.879> second<00:02:26.420> time<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.900> lighten<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.410> little

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the second time to lighten it a little

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.460 
the second time to lighten it a little
bit<00:02:27.769> more<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.910> does<00:02:29.390> appear<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.170> be<00:02:30.349> a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
bit more so it does appear to be a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.699 
bit more so it does appear to be a
little<00:02:30.800> lighter<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:32.170> typically<00:02:33.170> wanted<00:02:33.590> it

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
little lighter I typically wanted it

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.650 
little lighter I typically wanted it
really<00:02:33.950> light<00:02:34.250> at<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.459> bottom<00:02:34.550> like<00:02:35.450> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
really light at the bottom like a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.380 
really light at the bottom like a
platinum<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> tips<00:02:37.069> like<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.519> caramel<00:02:37.940> and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
platinum on the tips like a caramel and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.660 
platinum on the tips like a caramel and
then<00:02:38.420> he'll<00:02:39.260> transitions<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.010> like<00:02:40.160> Auburn

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
then he'll transitions to like Auburn

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.089 
then he'll transitions to like Auburn
and<00:02:40.910> then<00:02:41.060> black<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.989> didn't<00:02:42.830> work<00:02:42.860> out

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
and then black but it didn't work out

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.070 
and then black but it didn't work out
and<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.400> didn't<00:02:43.730> want<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:43.910> keep<00:02:44.180> bleaching<00:02:44.930> it
