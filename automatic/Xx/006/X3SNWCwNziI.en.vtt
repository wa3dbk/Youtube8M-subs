let's take a look at the different

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.150 
let's take a look at the different
frames<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.820> head<00:00:26.820> tube<00:00:27.090> inner<00:00:27.359> diameter

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.120 

starting<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> hogrider<00:00:32.579> frame<00:00:34.130> looks

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
starting with a hogrider frame looks

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.690 
starting with a hogrider frame looks
like<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.700> inner<00:00:36.450> diameter<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.399> one<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.540> 5/16

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
like the inner diameter is one in 5/16

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
like the inner diameter is one in 5/16
okay<00:00:41.700> let's<00:00:41.910> take<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> look<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.250> lowrider
