00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.939
 try big infrastructure problems 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 I need big plans to solve 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.620
 projects I often considered utopian to beat these grazing 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.649
 they would be able to solve them 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.620
 here we are in the heart of the Latin appio district 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.560
 billo ball railway that of william and kate was the center of a 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.220
 project for the blues that he thought 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.130
 d cover the railway dance and use the recovered females for 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.130
 do street parking services 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.150
 often the utopia always irons we are the choice must think of something that 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.190
 it probably won't happen 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 in reality, utopia is the engine of future development 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.230
 in 1987 the ninth district appointed a group of architects 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.690
 to elaborate a proposal that solves the problem of the connection between the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.910
 the eastern quadrant of the southern capital city xd was born so the project 1 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.750
 Sisters of the intervention was the Latin appio district near the walls 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.830
 aureliane is intensively organized the beginning of the last century 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.420
 he found himself killed by his second expansion 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.760
 from the presence of the nineteenth-century dance of the earth 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.280
 another 4 meters from street level is almost non-permeable to new ones 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 teaches fabrics 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.320
 pon project urbis et was proposed as a solution the coverage of the wall a 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.670
 lose with the lowering of the iron floor and the underground layout of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.820
 a frontal ring road the parking lots and services in its most recent 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.470
 version has been thought of as a three-phase implementation that includes the first one 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.090
 construction of a dedicated gallery - m from the ostiense station to the new one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.389
 fourth mile station passing through the tuscolana port 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.130
 in the second transfer of the vineyards 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.869
 leather from the announcement to the new gallery 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.329
 and the construction of sediment released 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.409
 dino new arterial road covered garden from the christopher colombo to the 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.179
 new ring road 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:31.689
 in the third occurred the displacement of the Rome-Pisa line on the northern ring 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.469
 hey of the freight lines on the west riser the occupation of the residual foul 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.879
 railway with spa parking lots 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.390
 illuminated by holes in the green equipped walk above 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.680
 over the years these ideas have received much support also for continuity 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.169
 environmental prefigured in the park of the ancient Appia the Aurelian walls el 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.739
 central archaeological area without ever going through an application phase 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.989
 but now a new project proposal has been developed 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.969
 with which urbis et could be connected 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.409
 this is the port of the sea hypothesis of transport reorganization of the 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.479
 corridor of via cristoforo colombo 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.549
 if the project is the door to the sea as a project and if an ambitious program e 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.989
 limits and utopia 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.219
 provides for the construction of a light rail subway service 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:21.219
 neighborhoods 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.739
 that have been accumulating on the Cristoforo Colombo street over the years 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:30.979
 the realization of a node of directional exchange to the connection between the 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:31.209
 years 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.559
 i was colombo 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.010
 and the great lack of furniture 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.569
 the world-class parallel app solution you have 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:45.149
 the elimination of all crossings has stolen or tree of the most important 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:47.539
 of this important after diary 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.169
 ex amaranto 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.559
 the creation of a large party system 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:57.609
 turn neck green corridor and a ostia will join the aurelian walls 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.669
 it is a wide-ranging program 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.599
 fundamental for the solution of the problems of this sector of the site 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.659
 but christopher colombo bass - ledesma 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.569
 ordinary connection between the euro and the residents of the 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.340
 districts arisen in the meantime in its vicinity 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.790
 there is no main access to Rome from the Rome-Fiumicino motorway 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.480
 that is, derived a progressive clogging 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.650
 + older residential and office buildings 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.650
 will sell more and more to accentuate 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.849
 a group of designers are therefore associated under the project initials e 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:41.749
 territory 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.969
 to work out a solution 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.049
 I sell yes of the instrument of the concession is entrusted hours and 

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:50.219
 municipal real estate for the agreed number of years 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.549
 breen organized the mobility system by stimulating vehicle traffic 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.669
 away at the same time 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.729
 in an environmentalist and monumental way you structure the Cristoforo way 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.489
 in detail, the project involves the construction of a light underground railway 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:06.839
 between the hours to host 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.029
 the elimination of flush crossings 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.939
 the overall environmental reorganization through a park system 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.119
 rotation of an exchange node and external services of the very 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:18.830
 filter private traffic 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.740
 before it reaches the most embarrassing areas 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.950
 in this way it was thought to position the latter at the intersection of the 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.669
 multimodal corridor via cristoforo colombo 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.999
 unexpected corridor pr 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.909
 road and rail link road 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.979
 between the northern coastal system 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.400
 and the plain. 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.090
 evoking the aluminum arc of adalbert free symbolic sign 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.389
 of welcome the universal exhibition of 42 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.790
 the node is characterized as on the market 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.960
 through the shape of two triangular crystal towers to build a 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.380
 gigantic portal on closed do not open the door of the sea with the offer of 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.110
 high level services such as a museum of the territory a civic center 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.029
 spaces for catering 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.849
 Hanging green parking areas is the main subway station 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:07.939
 light 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.279
 programs like orobie if the door of the sea 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.329
 and others have been made different over time for this 

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:17.550
 city 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.499
 appear to topics 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:20.900
 what the daredevils 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.339
 considering the average of the achievements in this city 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:28.199
 however they are the only ones to live up to the great vocation of 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.379
 this city has a universal vocation example of a capital 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.249
 European 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:33.220
 utopia 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.909
 sometimes it seems an escape from reality 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.319
 but it is the only way to correspond to the high ambitions that this city has 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.199
 has as capital of Italy as European capital has as universal capital
