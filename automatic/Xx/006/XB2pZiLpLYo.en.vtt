governmental<00:00:28.470> intervention<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.220> sense<00:00:29.730> is

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
governmental intervention my sense is

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.460 
governmental intervention my sense is
it's<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> work<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.140> let<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.320> tell

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's not going to work but let me tell

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.630 
it's not going to work but let me tell
you<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.679> would<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:31.920> work<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> that's<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you what would really work and that's to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.220 
you what would really work and that's to
get<00:00:32.759> our<00:00:32.880> economy<00:00:33.360> turned<00:00:33.540> around<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.020> mean<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
get our economy turned around I mean the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.770 
get our economy turned around I mean the
fundamental<00:00:34.710> reason<00:00:35.070> why<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.850> mortgage<00:00:36.390> or

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
fundamental reason why the mortgage or

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
fundamental reason why the mortgage or
the<00:00:36.899> housing<00:00:37.469> market<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.860> collapses<00:00:38.309> because

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the housing market is collapses because

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
the housing market is collapses because
there's<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.700> enough<00:00:38.910> people<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.300> there

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
there's not enough people out there

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.639 
there's not enough people out there
buying<00:00:39.660> they're<00:00:39.870> not<00:00:39.989> making<00:00:40.260> enough<00:00:40.440> money

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
buying they're not making enough money

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
buying they're not making enough money
and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> reason<00:00:41.550> why<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.090> people<00:00:42.270> are

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and the reason why a lot of people are

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
and the reason why a lot of people are
getting<00:00:42.450> foreclosed<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:44.070> they

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
getting foreclosed is not because they

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.500 
getting foreclosed is not because they
have<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> bad<00:00:44.520> mortgage<00:00:44.969> that's<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.360> they

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
have a bad mortgage that's because they

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
have a bad mortgage that's because they
lost<00:00:45.660> their<00:00:45.899> job<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.440> Florida<00:00:46.620> has<00:00:47.010> been

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
lost their job in Florida has been

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
lost their job in Florida has been
deeply<00:00:47.579> impacted<00:00:48.090> by<00:00:48.629> unemployment<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.469> what

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
deeply impacted by unemployment so what

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
deeply impacted by unemployment so what
we<00:00:49.770> need<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.010> robust<00:00:50.460> economic<00:00:50.610> growth<00:00:51.210> and
