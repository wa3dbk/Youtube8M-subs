 I want a gift for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.250
 Just cut you out on the occasion 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.630
 you before I will have a very 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.400
 important things to say about raw food 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.210
 especially for the people 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 came 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 because that's me completely again 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.579
 important raw food is not just raw food 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.140
 There are so many different types 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.070
 The raw food I make that is one 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.820
 vegan rather low-fat food with lots of fruit 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.949
 a lot of vegetables so less so things 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.770
 like nuts and seeds and these 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.570
 high-fat stories 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.489
 but just because I really have many 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.899
 meet people who say I have ey 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.739
 I'm busy with the raw food 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.430
 and I'm just totally disappointed 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.860
 sales event and I have to totally 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.439
 Buy the expensive super foods and me 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.619
 it's only about the iren and super vip 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 and extract and powder and that the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.009
 people just generally little 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.890
 many disappointed and then again 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.470
 to turn away from it what a pity it is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 that's not the whole field worth it 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.540
 it is also left and right 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 to look to the right 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.119
 but so many are coming through the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.299
 normal raw food the normal raw food 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.320
 raw food where is 60 70 80 of the total 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.430
 calories are sourced from fat 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.740
 combined over this way the raw food 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.290
 to the high k pleister yes to this fruit 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.520
 based carbohydrate based 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.740
 lifestyle and that's easy 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.780
 just when you realize that is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.820
 just 180 degrees if is as 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.439
 if your brain completely free 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 is being rinsed and you really are now 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.560
 think ah you shit human needs 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.540
 not so much super foot actually 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.969
 I do not need really is the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.069
 top horny vegetables actually that is 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.800
 already the super fia I do not need 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.450
 constantly 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.430
 Rusleben races and constantly for many 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.510
 what to order et cetera eternal what 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.260
 dehydrate we have we also have in 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.050
 the hydra de 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.670
 but you do that only now and then yes 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.860
 I always need something there 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.710
 visit these things and visit 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.410
 buy and I can do it one man too 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.060
 Spent a lot of money there and it 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.220
 is similarly simple as grade for the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.530
 everyday you just want it easier 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.150
 have faster at night have always something 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.940
 but especially for everyday life 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.500
 just have it in everyday life and 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.150
 because not such a huge effort 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.980
 need to operate 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.380
 everything else is simply unrealistic 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.250
 otherwise you will be very fast 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.620
 back to the bottom of the facts 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.360
 brought back and actually realizes that 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.880
 the certain circles only your best 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.620
 want which is that here you can see on 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.880
 the revolution as it is now 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.290
 there is the focus in accordingly 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.000
 crazy crazy 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.860
 very short now and that's why we have 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.370
 on this book house as a gift for 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.120
 you julian in front of the anton us 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.730
 Do you know the rock soul food book? 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.340
 everything is vegan and raw 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.820
 Why do we cut the book out ? 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.430
 it's just it's totally got one 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.930
 super cool presentation but I too 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.770
 so cool is just that here too 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.390
 the chapter high k yes and many 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.850
 low fat things already in the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.160
 attention paid well it is so 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.260
 I can do both of these very well 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.850
 tell it was just like us, they 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.120
 also have quasi with the raw food with the 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.820
 gourmet raw food started and are then 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.840
 switched to high court history 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.400
 as soon as man realized it goes 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.590
 much better and there is again 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.420
 clearer difference 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.510
 and yes it is like that for example 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.430
 I knew right times show very briefly 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.489
 here is a complete chapter just the same 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.870
 hype devoted to the hype itself walkway 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.660
 is with all the fruits and vegetables 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.710
 really delicious recipes and I have 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.350
 but also seen 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.010
 Incidentally , by the way, there are 74 in all 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.830
 even in gourmet raw food 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.390
 Department in quotes recipes 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.520
 in there are like this rail to 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.880
 example was the wheel tour here here 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.120
 the wheel or the ship , too 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.660
 they are really trusting and they are 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.820
 really 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.940
 For example, that was what I believed 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.900
 Here's what I'm looking for a short time yes 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.140
 right here these buckwheat dumplings 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.580
 I'm in the black I have it 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.290
 really long to think long considered 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.170
 can be really glad so here 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.850
 everything is red everything raw but so cool 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.870
 So you can really do that 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.160
 at soulfood then already designate 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.000
 it has really astonished me already 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.160
 at this can 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.550
 and yes, we have the house by the way 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.930
 There's still a dedication from the two 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.700
 authors 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.950
 it is so the book goes off like a book 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.760
 rocket and that's just right for it 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.050
 is so horny on and I have to as 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.940
 one of the few books i did 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.030
 really flipped through and 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.510
 really his is not something of 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.210
 The rod I think what would have to 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.550
 Just make that contribution I do 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.630
 share on facebook too 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.640
 will publish 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.330
 to share that everything you do 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.070
 we have to be then by chance 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.270
 let the chance decide and the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.570
 to draw a winner 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.850
 we contact you so 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.520
 just share on facebook and yes 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.740
 is it yes yes people do not forget the 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.330
 message raw food is not the same raw food 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.740
 huge differences i know people 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.870
 they do not eat green food 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.940
 roleber raw meat there are people the 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.950
 eat high dam rest on apples of animal 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.290
 not heated in red, etc 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.030
 There are so many kinds of night lets 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.500
 Do not be crazy 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.050
 make and really look left and 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.330
 Right, what is there and what is there for 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.930
 you are as I said some are 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.350
 very 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:23.330
 I say doggedly and want 100 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.340
 percent remain but then not 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.520
 sometimes from vegans to biological et 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.310
 cetera that is more important to me than 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.590
 vegan is the mass must be low in fat 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.720
 in my opinion still full 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.640
 wholesome food is not that much 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.920
 processed and blended so much 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.170
 but really the good stuff and then 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.750
 he lives again king like a pharaoh 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.210
 then also lived thanks for seeing 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.230
 people are not doing well until then 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.230
 forget to share
