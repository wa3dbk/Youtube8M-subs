five-year-old<00:00:26.070> boy<00:00:26.250> he<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.240> diagnosed<00:00:27.720> with

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
five-year-old boy he was diagnosed with

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.450 
five-year-old boy he was diagnosed with
autism<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:28.949> two-and-a-half

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
autism actually at two-and-a-half

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.500 
autism actually at two-and-a-half
so<00:00:29.910> he<00:00:30.480> had<00:00:30.570> started<00:00:31.430> swim<00:00:32.430> lessons<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.239> an

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so he had started swim lessons as an

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.160 
so he had started swim lessons as an
infant<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.200> fact<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> really<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.840> did<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
infant in fact and really we we did it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.780 
infant in fact and really we we did it
just<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.649> he<00:00:37.680> would<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.890> water<00:00:38.250> safe<00:00:38.610> we

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
just so that he would be water safe we

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.799 
just so that he would be water safe we
just<00:00:38.910> certainly<00:00:39.120> didn't<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.600> autism

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
just certainly didn't know about autism

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.190 
just certainly didn't know about autism
at<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> time<00:00:41.000> but<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> has<00:00:42.829> benefited<00:00:43.829> him

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
at that time but it has benefited him

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.340 
at that time but it has benefited him
dramatically<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.530> max<00:00:47.190> has<00:00:48.020> with<00:00:49.020> his<00:00:49.170> autism

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
dramatically so max has with his autism

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
dramatically so max has with his autism
as<00:00:49.950> many<00:00:50.250> children<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.700> autism<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.180> what's

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
as many children with autism have what's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.299 
as many children with autism have what's
called<00:00:51.570> sensory<00:00:51.960> processing<00:00:52.620> disorder<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
called sensory processing disorder and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.010 
called sensory processing disorder and
essentially<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> his<00:00:54.750> body

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
essentially what that is that his body

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.910 
essentially what that is that his body
he<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.010> craves<00:00:56.780> more<00:00:57.780> input<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.590> more

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
he just craves more input you know more

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.299 
he just craves more input you know more
work<00:00:59.609> more<00:01:00.320> sensory<00:01:01.320> he's<00:01:01.559> very<00:01:01.980> sensory

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
work more sensory he's very sensory

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
work more sensory he's very sensory
seeking<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.059> will<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:04.170> swimming

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
seeking if you will so with swimming

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
seeking if you will so with swimming
that<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.939> provides<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.720> input

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
that just really provides that input

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.200 
that just really provides that input
that<00:01:07.590> his<00:01:07.740> body<00:01:08.010> needs<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.820> he<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
basically um we teach those theories

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.429 
basically um we teach those theories
whether<00:01:32.360> its<00:01:33.360> touch<00:01:33.630> through<00:01:33.840> muscle<00:01:34.170> memory

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
whether its touch through muscle memory

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.789 
whether its touch through muscle memory
a<00:01:34.650> series<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.610> touch<00:01:35.970> water<00:01:36.270> currents<00:01:36.799> stuff

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
a series of touch water currents stuff

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.490 
a series of touch water currents stuff
like<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.430> basically<00:01:38.790> how<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.659> can

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
like that that's basically how we can

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.749 
like that that's basically how we can
get<00:01:40.590> these<00:01:40.710> guys<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.040> perform<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> little

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
get these guys to perform it's a little

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:57.950 
get these guys to perform it's a little
different<00:01:42.119> than<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.390> typical<00:01:42.540> swim<00:01:42.990> lessons

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:08.120 

a<00:02:03.180> lot<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.479> behaviors<00:02:05.439> such<00:02:06.070> as<00:02:06.100> just<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
a lot of the behaviors such as just the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.930 
a lot of the behaviors such as just the
Tantrums<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.459> not<00:02:10.090> being<00:02:10.390> able<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.819> know

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
Tantrums the not being able to you know

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.210 
Tantrums the not being able to you know
not<00:02:13.209> being<00:02:13.630> very<00:02:13.750> rigid<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> schedule<00:02:15.040> not

don't go in a certain routine a certain

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.370 
don't go in a certain routine a certain
way<00:02:20.580> he<00:02:21.580> also<00:02:21.730> had<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> habit<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:23.230> would

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
way he also had a habit of if we would

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.259 
way he also had a habit of if we would
be<00:02:23.500> out<00:02:23.620> somewhere<00:02:24.100> just<00:02:24.370> kind<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.670> taking<00:02:25.150> off

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
be out somewhere just kind of taking off

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.539 
be out somewhere just kind of taking off
we're<00:02:25.630> now<00:02:25.870> he's<00:02:26.140> doing<00:02:26.350> much<00:02:26.500> better<00:02:26.680> staying

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
we're now he's doing much better staying

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.390 
we're now he's doing much better staying
by<00:02:27.790> my<00:02:27.970> side<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:29.260> being<00:02:29.739> able<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.010> remain
