00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello everyone, Katya Maximova or you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.390
 this video will see how heavy go 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:15.120
 games on the smartphone lenovo a7000 first 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:20.369
 game real racing 3 let's run a little 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.500
 near them camera here and now 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.859
 We will evaluate the gameplay in the real rating 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 3 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.529
 on this device I will remind you that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
 The device uses 8 nuclear 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.120
 processor mt mediatek mt6575 ten two 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.649
 operating at a frequency of 1 gigahertz and 5 and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.140
 eight-plus two gigabytes 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.710
 random access memory 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.710
 so we will miss 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.399
 what does the graphics somewhere mean 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.399
 we will watch 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.610
 yes on the chart is the average level 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 but smoothly of course everything is very smooth 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.530
 nothing to slow down 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.290
 even here when the game is a lot of cars 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.710
 absolutely smoothly on the schedule and then 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 middle level so we see that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 there is an effect and dust from the wheels 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.300
 so switch mirroring 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.580
 rear view everything is there but of course you play 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.490
 it is super smooth with this problem there is no real 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.619
 the racing goes very well but for a bit 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.580
 the reduced graphics settings are as follows 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.580
 dead trigger 2 game 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.600
 so the game started and click to play 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.650
 what is the us 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.880
 graphics settings in this trigger and 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.830
 this is most likely maximum or 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.140
 as close as possible to see that 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.840
 there is a mapping in create effect 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.420
 such an important asphalt there is a mapping 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.650
 asphalt mapping of the world around 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.160
 Asphalt has a lot of effects in the form 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.100
 from flying leaves to heat 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.380
 out of the fire it's all great 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 drawing is very very good and also 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.490
 the game goes again super smooth yes it is 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.620
 most likely we maximize the settings 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.810
 graphics because that's what I did not see 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.810
 due background 4s where the game is very good 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:24.130
 optimized seeing sparks without a flashlight in 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.230
 very cool in general of course yes it is 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.960
 probably even the maximum settings and 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:34.350
 the toy goes smoothly cool helicopters 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.350
 fly 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.400
 of course we have no problems 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:55.099
 this healthy zombie is also very 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:59.060
 well traced of course really just 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:04.100
 that the us dead trigger is just perfect 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:08.290
 abruptly close the closed program and 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.290
 We cover the third game asphalt 8 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.340
 and evaluate the gameplay still in this game 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.959
 leave age some there 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.770
 And on 16 we will not decree it is better to specify 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.770
 more 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.690
 and we will close more than 18 it is better to specify 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.370
 because maybe a second 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.090
 connect to my google account 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.090
 play games 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.720
 everything is fine there is no learning to go through 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.139
 we will and immediately begin to drive begin 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.139
 race 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:46.000
 settings immediately and well now we 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:58.960
 try to adjust the maximum 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:58.960
 settings leave the icon because so 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.590
 so-so-so image quality 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.630
 tuned to the very same thing right away 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:28.180
 it seems strange to me that 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:30.880
 it's even for the highest settings 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.270
 immediately stand but why so how then she is not 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.590
 very well traced it was well 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.590
 try have more time do two 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.340
 here we all fly apart in principle, yes 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.240
 Perhaps this is probably the maximum 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.970
 not that we all beat all lying around 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.750
 crashing the game goes smoothly with this problems 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.840
 no see that nothing like all 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:18.090
 eroded at high speed 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:22.009
 maximum graphics settings and so 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.819
 here change seeks raised was not visible 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.400
 Slaps the screen 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:31.490
 as if from the other side everything goes very 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:34.050
 smoothly very cool asphalt 8 works 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:38.340
 also very good at very high 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:40.470
 level go games on this device well 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.150
 Of course, such an eight-core processor 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:51.030
 drags the device a little hot but 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:53.699
 insignificant that, in principle at this 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:57.240
 All thanks for this video is watched 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:59.610
 there was a video like on a lenovo device 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.490
 a7000 go heavy games we see that 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.380
 they go very very cool thanks 

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.969
 what watched this video subscribe 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.039
 put the likes on the maximum channel 

00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:10.039
