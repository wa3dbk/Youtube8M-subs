eight then chain two extra ones then in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.880 
eight then chain two extra ones then in
their<00:00:35.760> eighth<00:00:35.910> hole<00:00:36.270> sorts<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> third<00:00:37.590> chain

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
their eighth hole sorts the third chain

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
their eighth hole sorts the third chain
from<00:00:38.100> hook<00:00:38.129> you're<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.239> double<00:00:39.540> crochet

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
from hook you're going to double crochet

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
from hook you're going to double crochet
so<00:00:40.530> two<00:00:40.590> double<00:00:41.040> crochet<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.850> yarn<00:00:42.180> over

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so two double crochet you yarn over

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.090 
so two double crochet you yarn over
insert<00:00:43.700> into<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> hole<00:00:45.500> yarn<00:00:46.500> over<00:00:46.710> pull

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
insert into the hole yarn over pull

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.840 
insert into the hole yarn over pull
through<00:00:47.600> yarn<00:00:48.600> over<00:00:48.809> pull<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.350> two<00:00:49.559> loops

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
through yarn over pull through two loops

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.990 
through yarn over pull through two loops
and<00:00:50.870> yarn<00:00:51.870> over<00:00:52.170> pull<00:00:52.379> through<00:00:52.410> two<00:00:52.649> loops<00:00:53.000> so

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and yarn over pull through two loops so

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
and yarn over pull through two loops so
that's<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.420> double<00:00:54.629> crochet<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.860> double

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that's one double crochet so you double

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.229 
that's one double crochet so you double
crochet<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> way<00:00:57.120> across

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.450 

once<00:01:05.110> you've<00:01:05.259> double<00:01:05.590> crocheted<00:01:06.009> all<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.340> way

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
once you've double crocheted all the way

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.130 
once you've double crocheted all the way
across<00:01:06.549> you're<00:01:07.240> going<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.479> put<00:01:07.630> four<00:01:07.899> more

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
across you're going to put four more

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:17.039 
across you're going to put four more
double<00:01:08.439> crochets<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.130> this<00:01:09.340> last<00:01:09.610> hole<00:01:16.049> so

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
double crochets in this last hole so

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.960 
double crochets in this last hole so
that's<00:01:17.289> one

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:33.000 

two<00:01:26.190> three<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:28.710> four<00:01:31.440> so<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.650> makes<00:01:32.830> it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
two three and four so that makes it

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.620 
two three and four so that makes it
curve<00:01:33.250> on<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.490> side<00:01:33.700> then<00:01:34.270> you're<00:01:34.450> going<00:01:34.570> to

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
curve on the side then you're going to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.090 
curve on the side then you're going to
double<00:01:34.960> crochet<00:01:35.080> all<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.590> way<00:01:35.680> across<00:01:35.770> on

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
double crochet all the way across on

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.070 
double crochet all the way across on
this<00:01:36.220> side<00:01:36.460> so<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.970> do<00:01:37.210> one<00:01:37.510> more<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.930> net

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
this side so you do one more and net

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.680 
this side so you do one more and net
last<00:01:38.290> hole<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:45.790> one<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.240> each<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.570> the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
last hole and then one and each of the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.030 
last hole and then one and each of the
rest<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.110> holes<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:53.500> once<00:01:53.680> you've<00:01:53.860> gone

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
rest of the holes then once you've gone

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.620 
rest of the holes then once you've gone
all<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.400> way<00:01:54.430> across<00:01:54.610> on<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.090> side<00:01:55.300> you're

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
all the way across on this side you're

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.120 
all the way across on this side you're
going<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.869> put<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.290> more<00:01:56.470> double<00:01:56.770> crochets

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
going to put for more double crochets

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:05.670 
going to put for more double crochets
and<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.580> last<00:01:57.820> hole<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:05.020> after<00:02:05.410> adding

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
and that last hole then after adding

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.469 
and that last hole then after adding
full<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.310> last<00:02:06.520> hole<00:02:06.790> you're<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.390> to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
full in the last hole you're going to

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.910 
full in the last hole you're going to
slip<00:02:07.690> stitch<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.960> join<00:02:08.170> these<00:02:08.530> two<00:02:08.740> ends

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
slip stitch to join these two ends

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.580 
slip stitch to join these two ends
together<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.179> skip<00:02:10.509> two<00:02:10.810> chains<00:02:10.840> because

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
together so you skip two chains because

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.100 
together so you skip two chains because
that's<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.980> side<00:02:12.220> off<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.490> stitch<00:02:13.000> go<00:02:13.870> into

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
that's the side off the stitch go into

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.690 
that's the side off the stitch go into
the<00:02:14.230> top<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.620> stitch<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.250> that's<00:02:15.459> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
the top of the stitch so that's the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.210 
the top of the stitch so that's the
third<00:02:15.970> chain<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.020> insert<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> hook<00:02:17.770> yarn

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
third chain so you insert the hook yarn

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.790 
third chain so you insert the hook yarn
over<00:02:18.370> pull<00:02:18.910> through<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.360> then<00:02:20.320> pull<00:02:20.560> through

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
over pull through and then pull through

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.940 
over pull through and then pull through
this<00:02:20.950> as<00:02:21.220> well<00:02:21.400> then<00:02:22.209> pull<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.600> tail<00:02:22.840> cut<00:02:23.800> this

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
this as well then pull a tail cut this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.220 
this as well then pull a tail cut this
off<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:25.090> end<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.420> still<00:02:25.690> loose<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.200> you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
off and the end is still loose so you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.350 
off and the end is still loose so you
have<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.680> bring<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:27.010> around<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.640> through

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
have to bring this around and through

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.390 
have to bring this around and through
this<00:02:28.570> through<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:35.380> just<00:02:35.530> go<00:02:35.650> into<00:02:36.010> any<00:02:36.190> other

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
this through then just go into any other

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:49.370 
this through then just go into any other
stitch<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.810> secure<00:02:38.230> this

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.710 

so<00:02:50.130> now<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.580> make<00:02:50.790> two<00:02:50.970> brown<00:02:51.210> ones<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
so now you just make two brown ones and
