00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.510 

and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.630> added<00:01:19.470> color<00:01:22.520> say

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and then if I want an added color say

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.870 
and then if I want an added color say
like<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.090> um<00:01:25.040> my<00:01:26.040> food<00:01:26.340> coloring

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
like on this one um my food coloring

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840 
like on this one um my food coloring
solution<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> vinegar<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.579> blue

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
solution with the vinegar was the blue

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.289 
solution with the vinegar was the blue
and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.900> my<00:01:31.200> added<00:01:31.590> accent<00:01:32.100> color<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.939> red

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and then my added accent color was a red

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.679 
and then my added accent color was a red
and<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> how<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:35.280> didn't<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.000> didn't

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and this is how it just didn't I didn't

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.010 
and this is how it just didn't I didn't
mix<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.229> okay<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:39.060> difference<00:01:39.420> between<00:01:39.600> doing

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
mix it okay the difference between doing

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.929 
mix it okay the difference between doing
the<00:01:40.110> solution<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> shake<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the solution is that when you shake it

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.450 
the solution is that when you shake it
it's<00:01:42.090> gonna<00:01:42.479> mix<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> I've<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.340> my

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it's gonna mix in there so I've got my

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.330 
it's gonna mix in there so I've got my
grain<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.030> probably<00:01:45.329> got<00:01:45.450> too<00:01:45.600> much<00:01:45.780> but

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
grain in there probably got too much but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.429 
grain in there probably got too much but
with<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> I've<00:01:47.790> got<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.060> um<00:01:48.329> neon<00:01:49.020> blue

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
with it and I've got this um neon blue

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.850 
with it and I've got this um neon blue
color<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.579> gonna<00:01:51.500> do<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
color I'm just gonna do like that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.480 
color I'm just gonna do like that
squeeze<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.200> would

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
squeeze it in there and then I would

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
squeeze it in there and then I would
keep<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.869> for<00:01:57.869> later<00:01:58.079> time<00:01:58.439> too

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
keep this for later time too

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.490 
keep this for later time too
okay<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.299> I'm<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.570> move<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.990> out<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

you know it's not purple you know what I

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.500 
you know it's not purple you know what I
mean<00:06:35.780> it's<00:06:36.020> like<00:06:36.170> so<00:06:36.440> different<00:06:36.980> of<00:06:37.490> what<00:06:38.390> you

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
mean it's like so different of what you

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.940 
mean it's like so different of what you
think<00:06:38.690> your<00:06:38.960> color<00:06:39.140> would<00:06:39.380> be<00:06:40.120> and<00:06:41.470> I<00:06:42.470> like

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
think your color would be and I like

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.710 
think your color would be and I like
that<00:06:43.130> so<00:06:43.340> no<00:06:43.640> two<00:06:43.700> flowers<00:06:44.180> will<00:06:44.330> be<00:06:44.450> the<00:06:44.540> same

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
that so no two flowers will be the same

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.750 
that so no two flowers will be the same
color<00:06:44.960> if<00:06:45.560> you<00:06:46.100> do<00:06:46.220> at<00:06:46.340> this<00:06:46.430> planet<00:06:47.920> and<00:06:48.920> so

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
color if you do at this planet and so

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.850 
color if you do at this planet and so
when<00:06:49.940> this<00:06:50.090> drive<00:06:50.450> I<00:06:50.780> would<00:06:50.870> probably<00:06:51.470> take<00:06:51.680> my

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
when this drive I would probably take my

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.060 
when this drive I would probably take my
riptide<00:06:52.610> glimmer<00:06:53.210> myth<00:06:53.480> and<00:06:53.720> glimmer<00:06:54.170> it<00:06:54.410> just

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
riptide glimmer myth and glimmer it just

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.830 
riptide glimmer myth and glimmer it just
to<00:06:55.190> give<00:06:55.340> it<00:06:55.370> some<00:06:55.640> glimmer<00:06:55.880> and<00:06:56.420> that'll<00:06:56.690> be<00:06:56.810> a

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
to give it some glimmer and that'll be a

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.750 
to give it some glimmer and that'll be a
