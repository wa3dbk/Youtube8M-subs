00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
it so if you used clickers you can use

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.860 
it so if you used clickers you can use
clickers<00:01:01.040> for<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:01.579> training<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.629> use<00:01:02.840> a

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
clickers for this training we use a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.350 
clickers for this training we use a
marker<00:01:03.379> word<00:01:03.530> which<00:01:04.009> ours<00:01:04.189> is<00:01:04.399> good<00:01:04.850> so

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
marker word which ours is good so

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.209 
marker word which ours is good so
instant<00:01:06.020> your<00:01:06.110> dog<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.710> command<00:01:07.040> that<00:01:07.100> you

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
want so soon as this book backs up one

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.340 
want so soon as this book backs up one
step<00:01:10.310> I'm<00:01:10.759> going<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:11.209> reward<00:01:11.420> her<00:01:11.810> with<00:01:11.840> good

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
and then she's going to get a treat so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.149 
and then she's going to get a treat so
I'll<00:01:14.899> do<00:01:15.079> that<00:01:15.109> again<00:01:15.259> from<00:01:15.679> the<00:01:15.770> side<00:01:15.979> of<00:01:16.009> the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
I'll do that again from the side of the

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'll do that again from the side of the
park<00:01:16.579> stops<00:01:17.049> good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
park stops good

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.670 
park stops good
and<00:01:20.390> if<00:01:20.600> they<00:01:20.719> stick<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.229> start<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.649> over<00:01:21.740> again

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
and if they stick to start it over again

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.160 
and if they stick to start it over again
go<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.549> that's<00:01:25.700> little<00:01:26.240> as<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.570> want<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.930> start

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
go so that's little as you want to start

off good
so<00:01:39.860> now<00:01:40.159> we'll<00:01:40.369> show<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.759> dog<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.479> knows

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
so now we'll show you the dog that knows

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.350 
so now we'll show you the dog that knows
the<00:01:42.140> reverse<00:01:42.500> again<00:01:43.009> do<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.700> stages<00:01:43.969> so

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the reverse again do this in stages so

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.149 
the reverse again do this in stages so
once<00:01:44.750> caught<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> time<00:01:45.409> they<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.979> war

once caught a time they in the war

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.679 
once caught a time they in the war
they're<00:01:46.700> going<00:01:46.819> to<00:01:46.909> start<00:01:47.179> getting<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
they're going to start getting in the

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.990 
they're going to start getting in the
motion<00:01:48.049> of<00:01:48.140> reversing<00:01:48.679> so<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.549> bullet

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
motion of reversing so this is bullet

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.370 
motion of reversing so this is bullet
this<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.420> nine<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:50.929> half<00:01:50.959> month<00:01:51.289> old

as you can see so here he knows the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.380 
as you can see so here he knows the
reverse<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.520> not<00:01:58.549> what<00:01:58.759> I<00:01:58.789> can<00:01:58.909> do<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.179> full

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
reverse is not what I can do the full

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.510 
reverse is not what I can do the full
trick<00:01:59.750> but<00:02:00.289> I'll<00:02:00.380> show<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:00.679> what<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.280> want<00:02:01.459> to

turn it into so I want to start moving

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.679 
turn it into so I want to start moving
it<00:02:03.709> to<00:02:03.860> hand<00:02:04.159> motions<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:04.819> that<00:02:05.030> verbal<00:02:05.420> cues

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
it to hand motions so that verbal cues

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.089 
it to hand motions so that verbal cues
or<00:02:06.020> look<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.319> through<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.590> last<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.039> you

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
or look you through the last and you

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.479 
or look you through the last and you
don't<00:02:07.280> ever<00:02:07.520> understand<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:08.929> first<00:02:09.890> first

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.850 

God<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.330> that's<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.660> solid<00:02:22.050> reverse<00:02:22.350> as<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> can

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
God so that's a solid reverse as you can

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.680 
God so that's a solid reverse as you can
see<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.310> after<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.820> then<00:02:24.390> we're<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.630> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
see so after that then we're going to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.140 
see so after that then we're going to
move<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.230> adding<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.710> level<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.970> we

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
move on to adding a level to it so we

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
move on to adding a level to it so we
use<00:02:27.300> what<00:02:27.510> are<00:02:27.540> called<00:02:27.660> play<00:02:28.230> scores

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
use what are called play scores

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.240 
use what are called play scores

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you can't find something like this just

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.620 
you can't find something like this just
find<00:02:32.460> something<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.940> your<00:02:33.060> house<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.390> could<00:02:33.540> be

find something in your house it could be

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.650 
find something in your house it could be
a<00:02:33.660> stair<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> book<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:36.270> your<00:02:36.480> dogs

a stair it can be a book if your dogs
smaller<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.010> want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> start<00:02:38.550> adding

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
smaller you just want to start adding

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.400 
smaller you just want to start adding
some<00:02:39.150> height<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.600> can't<00:02:39.840> expect<00:02:40.200> them<00:02:40.350> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
some height you can't expect them to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.840 
some height you can't expect them to
reverse<00:02:40.740> out<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> wall

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
reverse out of the wall

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.030 
reverse out of the wall
right<00:02:42.300> from<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> get-go<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.770> wanted<00:02:44.010> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
right from the get-go so it wanted to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.710 
right from the get-go so it wanted to
come<00:02:44.340> God<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.930> Reverse<00:02:46.790> God<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.270> like<00:02:48.450> that

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
come God in Reverse God just like that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.430 
come God in Reverse God just like that
again

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
again

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.199 
again
he<00:02:49.560> knows<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:50.040> trick<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.550> he<00:02:50.700> makes<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.060> look

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
he knows this trick so he makes it look

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.090 
he knows this trick so he makes it look
a<00:02:51.239> little<00:02:51.510> easier<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.440> want<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.680> start<00:02:52.920> off

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
a little easier you want to start off

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.490 
a little easier you want to start off
with<00:02:53.130> layers<00:02:53.520> like<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:56.570> God<00:02:57.570> reward<00:02:58.260> that

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
with layers like that God reward that

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.699 
with layers like that God reward that
then<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.300> down<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.959> another

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
then they have the one down and another

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.460 
then they have the one down and another
layer<00:03:02.040> again<00:03:02.790> come<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.480> play<00:03:03.810> sports<00:03:04.200> you're

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
layer again come on play sports you're

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.290 
layer again come on play sports you're
something<00:03:04.830> else<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.459> only<00:03:05.640> want<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.030> add<00:03:06.270> a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
something else you only want to add a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.810 
something else you only want to add a
couple<00:03:06.630> inches<00:03:06.900> at<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> time<00:03:07.320> don't<00:03:07.950> go<00:03:08.190> for<00:03:08.520> big

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
couple inches at a time don't go for big

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:18.559 
couple inches at a time don't go for big
height<00:03:09.090> recomment<00:03:09.870> go<00:03:10.550> good<00:03:11.550> reverse

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.230 

ah

I'm<00:03:21.780> going<00:03:21.960> to<00:03:22.020> add<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.140> couple<00:03:22.500> few<00:03:22.800> guys<00:03:23.010> get

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
I'm going to add a couple few guys get

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.370 
I'm going to add a couple few guys get
the<00:03:23.400> idea<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.850> like<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.240> said<00:03:24.300> here<00:03:25.020> he<00:03:25.230> knows

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
the idea and like I said here he knows

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:46.730 
the idea and like I said here he knows
this<00:03:25.650> trick<00:03:32.240> god<00:03:33.320> very<00:03:34.320> good

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.220 

God<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:48.030> then<00:03:48.240> I'm<00:03:48.390> gonna<00:03:48.510> start<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.960> scooch

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
God and then I'm gonna start to scooch

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.230 
God and then I'm gonna start to scooch
enough<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.740> that<00:03:50.010> that's<00:03:50.760> where<00:03:51.000> it's<00:03:51.090> going

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
enough like that that's where it's going

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.990 
enough like that that's where it's going
to<00:03:51.300> be<00:03:51.420> easier<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.110> wall<00:03:52.470> or<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> tree<00:03:56.000> and

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
to be easier to do a wall or a tree and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000 
to be easier to do a wall or a tree and
in<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.210> beginning<00:03:57.450> bullet<00:03:58.290> like<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.710> scooch

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
in the beginning bullet like to scooch

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.310 
in the beginning bullet like to scooch
off<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.550> side<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.450> put<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.020> right

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
off to the side so I put this right

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.590 
off to the side so I put this right
against<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.890> wall<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.790> he<00:04:02.970> wasn't<00:04:03.240> able<00:04:03.330> to

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
against the wall so he wasn't able to

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.180 
against the wall so he wasn't able to
finagle<00:04:03.960> his<00:04:04.350> way<00:04:04.620> out

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
finagle his way out

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.920 
finagle his way out
we<00:04:05.550> don't<00:04:05.730> actually<00:04:06.360> might<00:04:06.540> want<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.750> say<00:04:06.900> I

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
we don't actually might want to say I

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.360 
we don't actually might want to say I
don't<00:04:07.170> really<00:04:07.320> want<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.650> do<00:04:07.800> this<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.310> is

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
don't really want to do this this is

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.370 
don't really want to do this this is
unnatural<00:04:09.000> coral<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.380> do<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.430> hallway<00:04:11.730> or

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
unnatural coral so do it in a hallway or

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.500 
unnatural coral so do it in a hallway or
put<00:04:13.380> something<00:04:13.770> on<00:04:13.890> both<00:04:14.070> sides<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.240> just

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
put something on both sides so it's just

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:24.370 
put something on both sides so it's just
a<00:04:15.630> hallway<00:04:16.230> for<00:04:16.440> them<00:04:16.710> to<00:04:16.860> go<00:04:16.980> right<00:04:17.220> to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.250 

tactical<00:04:25.380> ploy<00:04:25.890> let's<00:04:26.400> go<00:04:26.580> play<00:04:26.790> so<00:04:27.780> once<00:04:28.110> they

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
tactical ploy let's go play so once they

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.170 
tactical ploy let's go play so once they
have<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.650> on<00:04:28.710> this<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:29.430> has<00:04:29.700> different

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
have it on this and this has different

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.240 
have it on this and this has different
things<00:04:30.660> for<00:04:30.840> them<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.140> use<00:04:31.380> for<00:04:31.800> their<00:04:31.920> feet

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
things for them to use for their feet

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.190 
things for them to use for their feet
then<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.030> want<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.300> move<00:04:33.420> it<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.780> wall<00:04:34.170> or

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
then you want to move it to a wall or

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.680 
then you want to move it to a wall or
tree<00:04:34.890> so<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.610> would<00:04:35.850> suggest<00:04:35.970> like<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.360> brick

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
tree so I would suggest like a brick

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.900 
tree so I would suggest like a brick
wall<00:04:36.930> or<00:04:37.230> tree<00:04:37.560> because<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.860> has<00:04:38.010> textures<00:04:38.550> for

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
wall or tree because it has textures for

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.210 
wall or tree because it has textures for
them<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.120> still<00:04:39.360> use<00:04:39.510> their<00:04:39.750> paws<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.230> grip<00:04:40.560> you

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
them to still use their paws to grip you

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.550 
them to still use their paws to grip you
go<00:04:41.370> on<00:04:41.580> like<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.910> flat<00:04:42.300> surface<00:04:42.720> it's<00:04:43.350> going<00:04:43.500> to

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
go on like a flat surface it's going to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.660 
go on like a flat surface it's going to
be<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.680> lot<00:04:43.830> harder<00:04:44.040> for<00:04:44.160> them<00:04:44.430> in<00:04:44.550> the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
be a lot harder for them in the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.730 
be a lot harder for them in the
beginning<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.780> I'll<00:04:45.900> show<00:04:46.170> you<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.350> on<00:04:46.710> a

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
beginning so I'll show you that on a

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.950 
beginning so I'll show you that on a
