individual weed so as you can see right

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.009 
individual weed so as you can see right
here<00:00:26.400> I'll<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.760> working<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.599> now

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
here I'll be working on this one now

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.109 
here I'll be working on this one now
many<00:00:28.410> people<00:00:28.710> simply<00:00:28.949> pull<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.939> weed

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
many people simply pull out the weed

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.479 
many people simply pull out the weed
from<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> top<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.369> right

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
from the top but that is not the right

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.819 
from the top but that is not the right
way<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.989> leaves<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.649> weed

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
way to do because that leaves the weed

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.250 
way to do because that leaves the weed
with<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> good<00:00:35.340> chance<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.820> growing<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
with a good chance of growing back so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.720 
with a good chance of growing back so
what<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.040> reach<00:00:38.370> down

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
what I like to do is just reach down

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.750 
what I like to do is just reach down
deep<00:00:39.000> inside<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.930> try<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> root<00:00:41.280> so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
deep inside and try and get the root so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940 
deep inside and try and get the root so
follow<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.750> weed<00:00:42.960> down<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> root<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
follow the weed down to the root and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
follow the weed down to the root and
pull<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.460> from<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> root<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.079> way

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
pull it out from the root and this way

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
pull it out from the root and this way
when<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> root<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
when you get the root out just like that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.500 
when you get the root out just like that
all<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.340> piece<00:00:50.340> underneath<00:00:50.879> my<00:00:51.059> finger

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
all of that piece underneath my finger

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
all of that piece underneath my finger
right<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.800> buried<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
right there was actually buried in the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.029 
right there was actually buried in the
dirt<00:00:53.520> when<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> root<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> weed

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
dirt when you get that root of the weed

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
dirt when you get that root of the weed
out<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.760> gives<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> smallest<00:00:58.020> possible

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
out it gives it the smallest possible

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.099 
out it gives it the smallest possible
chance<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> growing<00:00:59.250> back<00:00:59.690> now<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
chance of growing back now that's what I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.680 
chance of growing back now that's what I
will<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.320> doing<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:02.370> each<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.210> weeds<00:01:03.449> in

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
will be doing for each of the weeds in

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
will be doing for each of the weeds in
this<00:01:03.989> flowerbed<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> place

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
this flowerbed and I'm going to place

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
this flowerbed and I'm going to place
them<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.810> spot<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> grass<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
remember back to the beginning of the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.030 
remember back to the beginning of the
video<00:01:55.160> there<00:01:56.030> were<00:01:56.270> many<00:01:56.750> many<00:01:57.140> many<00:01:57.500> small

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
weeds all throughout the flowerbed and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.840 
weeds all throughout the flowerbed and
now<00:02:00.680> as<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.040> can<00:02:01.220> see<00:02:01.400> there<00:02:02.300> are<00:02:03.010> almost<00:02:04.010> none

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
now as you can see there are almost none

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.969 
now as you can see there are almost none
there<00:02:05.300> are<00:02:05.420> still<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.690> few<00:02:05.780> left<00:02:06.170> tiny<00:02:06.650> ones

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
there are still a few left tiny ones

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.430 
there are still a few left tiny ones
that<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.310> missed<00:02:07.700> but<00:02:08.240> for<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.509> most<00:02:08.660> part<00:02:08.810> they

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.920 
that I missed but for the most part they
are<00:02:09.470> gone<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.150> I<00:02:11.150> know<00:02:11.210> at<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.540> beginning<00:02:11.660> of

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
are gone and I know at the beginning of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.420 
are gone and I know at the beginning of
this<00:02:12.050> video<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.410> only<00:02:12.680> showed<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.250> how<00:02:13.400> to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
this video I only showed you how to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.450 
this video I only showed you how to
remove<00:02:13.820> one<00:02:14.150> type<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.630> weed<00:02:14.870> but<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.980> process

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
remove one type of weed but the process

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.760 
remove one type of weed but the process
is<00:02:16.640> pretty<00:02:17.480> much<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.930> same<00:02:18.110> for<00:02:18.350> any<00:02:18.500> type<00:02:18.740> of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
is pretty much the same for any type of

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.980 
is pretty much the same for any type of
weed<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.400> find<00:02:19.730> you're<00:02:20.300> going<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.750> want

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
weed that you find you're going to want

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.330 
weed that you find you're going to want
to<00:02:21.080> remove<00:02:21.350> as<00:02:21.530> much<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.070> root<00:02:22.190> as

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
to remove as much of the root as

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.000 
to remove as much of the root as
possible<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.660> removing<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.470> root<00:02:24.650> will

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
possible because removing the root will

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.670 
possible because removing the root will
give<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.520> smallest<00:02:26.120> chance<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.840> growing

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
give it the smallest chance of growing

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.010 
give it the smallest chance of growing
back<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.130> just<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.000> show<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.660> weeds<00:02:29.870> that
