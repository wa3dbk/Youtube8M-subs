are there with my soy beans are soy
beans<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.840> my<00:00:27.930> weed<00:00:28.369> alrighty<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.760> we

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
beans in my weed alrighty and what if we

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.479 
beans in my weed alrighty and what if we
go<00:00:29.970> well<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.230> soybeans<00:00:31.740> look<00:00:31.920> exactly<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
go well the soybeans look exactly the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.549 
go well the soybeans look exactly the
same<00:00:32.610> although<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.660> has<00:00:33.870> weeds<00:00:34.140> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
same although this one has weeds this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.049 
same although this one has weeds this
one<00:00:34.710> doesn't<00:00:35.010> there's<00:00:35.400> got<00:00:35.580> to<00:00:35.699> be<00:00:35.730> something

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
one doesn't there's got to be something

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
one doesn't there's got to be something
different<00:00:36.510> between<00:00:36.629> these<00:00:36.960> two<00:00:37.140> plants<00:00:37.620> let's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
different between these two plants let's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
different between these two plants let's
take<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> back<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> lab<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.360> analysis

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
take it back to the lab for analysis

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:55.310 
take it back to the lab for analysis
sounds<00:00:40.530> good<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.950> guys<00:00:41.070> good<00:00:41.219> plan<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:54.320> don't

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
sounds good you guys good plan I don't

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
sounds good you guys good plan I don't
see<00:00:55.530> any<00:00:55.739> difference<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.430> yeah<00:00:57.090> we're<00:00:57.300> gonna

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
see any difference here yeah we're gonna

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
see any difference here yeah we're gonna
have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> look<00:00:57.690> deeper<00:00:58.079> look<00:00:58.260> into<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.710> genes

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have to look deeper look into the genes

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.200 
have to look deeper look into the genes
what's<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.969> gene<00:01:01.039> gene<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.520> first<00:01:02.789> name<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
what's a gene gene is the first name of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.100 
what's a gene gene is the first name of
the<00:01:03.300> former<00:01:03.629> Purdue

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the former Purdue

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:44.420 
the former Purdue
probably<00:01:06.310> too

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.950 

we<00:01:45.430> have<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.670> get<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.910> DNA<00:01:46.150> on<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.750> plan

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
we have to get the DNA on the plan

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:57.220 
we have to get the DNA on the plan
through<00:01:47.290> DNA<00:01:47.620> extraction

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.730 

I'm<00:01:58.230> extracting<00:01:58.680> DNA<00:02:02.420> hey<00:02:03.420> guys<00:02:03.600> come<00:02:04.230> here<00:02:04.260> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I'm extracting DNA hey guys come here I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.210 
I'm extracting DNA hey guys come here I
made<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> Dutch<00:02:05.370> we<00:02:06.330> have<00:02:06.540> transgenes<00:02:07.470> what's<00:02:08.100> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
made a Dutch we have transgenes what's a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:18.630 
made a Dutch we have transgenes what's a
train<00:02:08.520> stream<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.710> transgene<00:02:10.710> oh<00:02:13.370> yeah

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:54.040 

I<00:02:18.730> don't<00:02:19.240> know<00:02:19.300> what<00:02:19.420> students<00:02:19.990> are

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:05.290 

you

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.449 

so<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.420> resistance<00:03:06.959> gene<00:03:07.230> allow<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.709> farmers

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
so the resistance gene allow the farmers

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.940 
so the resistance gene allow the farmers
to<00:03:08.760> them<00:03:09.030> apply<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.870> herbicide<00:03:10.440> over<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
to them apply the herbicide over the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.190 
to them apply the herbicide over the
crop<00:03:11.160> without<00:03:11.280> damaging<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> crop<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.540> still

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
crop without damaging the crop and still

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.140 
crop without damaging the crop and still
kill<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.440> weeds<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:14.610> might<00:03:14.819> need<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> be

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
kill the weeds you might need to be

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.509 
kill the weeds you might need to be

day I see Mary coming through this cuz
you<00:03:32.130> genetic<00:03:32.489> material<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.060> everyone<00:03:33.540> we

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
you genetic material and everyone we

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.320 
you genetic material and everyone we
should<00:03:34.470> test<00:03:34.739> your<00:03:34.920> tofu<00:03:35.400> see<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.090> case

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
should test your tofu see if it in case

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.890 
should test your tofu see if it in case
round<00:03:36.780> up<00:03:36.959> gee<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.860> really<00:03:38.130> do<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.690> is

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
round up gee you really do that this is

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.220 
round up gee you really do that this is
very<00:03:40.049> nice<00:03:40.440> pcr<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.819> takes<00:03:42.120> one<00:03:42.660> copy<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.170> a

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
very nice pcr it takes one copy of a

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.160 
very nice pcr it takes one copy of a
gene<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.799> makes<00:03:44.160> multiple<00:03:44.790> copies

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:57.559 

I<00:03:54.110> see<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.500> see<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.920> team<00:03:56.190> yeah<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.360> team

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
I see it I see the team yeah the team

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.780 
I see it I see the team yeah the team
there<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.830> can<00:03:58.980> only<00:03:59.010> see<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.459> once<00:03:59.610> you

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
there but you can only see it once you

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:21.640 
there but you can only see it once you
run<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.060> through<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.270> gel<00:04:11.630> i'm<00:04:12.630> making<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:13.110> gel

first name acts like a DNA ruler it

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.790 
first name acts like a DNA ruler it
helps<00:04:27.660> us<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.930> measure<00:04:28.080> up<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.380> size<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.740> our

one<00:04:40.889> is<00:04:41.130> from<00:04:41.370> your<00:04:41.550> tofu<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.630> can<00:04:42.810> see<00:04:42.990> the

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
one is from your tofu you can see the

00:04:43.139 --> 00:05:35.570 
one is from your tofu you can see the
gold<00:04:43.410> contains<00:04:43.860> around<00:04:44.130> FG

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.820 

so<00:05:36.580> we<00:05:36.700> solved<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.150> case<00:05:37.390> this<00:05:38.050> soy<00:05:38.320> be<00:05:38.560> passed

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
so we solved the case this soy be passed

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.520 
so we solved the case this soy be passed
around<00:05:39.040> up<00:05:39.310> gene<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.760> this<00:05:40.030> one<00:05:40.240> doesn't

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
around up gene and this one doesn't

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.500 
around up gene and this one doesn't
