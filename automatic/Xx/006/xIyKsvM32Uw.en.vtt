00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.790
 why 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.530
 a fan 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.530
 but we did not have city like 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.730
 after we are more in peace 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.140
 at the moment we drill 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.100
 It is a preparation before welding 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.140
 We did the tests and realized 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.280
 that the engine was shaking a lot 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.980
 we made a 244 small perforations 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.980
 and we tighten with wire 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.610
 this what you can see here is a 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.550
 resistance this is the one that is going to 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.550
 offer to heat the water when it is in 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.820
 movement also did the drilling 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.360
 here if I reach it once 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.830
 for 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.110
 to put 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.770
 the temperature with what is 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.510
 undercover is a thin thermos and carries a 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.510
 decreased power 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.120
 some small 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.300
 paper squares 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.420
 because the movement is not yet 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.610
 having after this the movement 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.610
 was lower here at the beginning 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.580
 I have already explained all this company 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.260
 Anglo training 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.260
 how does my line work 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.310
 to 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.940
 here we will put the liquid 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.310
 and this is here it's not going to be taking 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.090
 temperature 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.090
 this is copper 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.080
 here we will introduce the thermometer 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.580
 we have to 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.580
 make him 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.290
 this beautiful is already well attached to 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.360
 that has no contact with the resistance 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.500
 because if you have contact with the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.500
 resistances are going to take them 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.120
 here is the sampling 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:00.610
 that you also take them with 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.420
 a little this putter taking the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.500
 measure of this resistance for what 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.630
 does not filter the water 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.630
 I'll show you how it moves thank you
