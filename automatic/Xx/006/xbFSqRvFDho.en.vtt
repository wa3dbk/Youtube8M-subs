00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.589
 the boys really came 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.280
 very strange video this video has so 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:11.890
 with one hand because I don't have the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.150
 camcorder that stand for now for 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.919
 but now that you know I have it but 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.419
 I ca n't but now because there were gods 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:23.769
 problems 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.740
 this world premiere boxing ie 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.890
 not worldwide because it will become ubisoft 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.160
 who did that can duero and other others 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.520
 people coupled to their box took 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.840
 unboxing them and I made him see myself 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.490
 not through the fact however also of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.720
 flight with the unboxing of this pair of 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.160
 always compaq opens a list of speakers 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.270
 this copy cannot be sold 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.800
 certainly it cannot be sold but but they give 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.810

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.900

 I had his friend and a big one 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:21.249

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.259
 be world wide but at least it's preview 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:30.759
