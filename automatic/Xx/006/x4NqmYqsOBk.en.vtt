00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
at all it does come with a Depot larry's

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.209 
at all it does come with a Depot larry's
lot<00:00:55.030> but<00:00:55.270> for<00:00:55.450> me<00:00:55.539> that's<00:00:55.719> fine<00:00:56.020> I'm<00:00:56.920> able<00:00:57.070> to

work<00:00:57.430> it<00:00:57.610> into<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.910> build<00:00:58.149> no<00:00:58.329> problem<00:00:58.750> and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
work it into the build no problem and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.529 
work it into the build no problem and
you'll<00:00:59.800> show<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.219> T<00:01:00.399> in<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.579> minute<00:01:00.850> we're

you'll show that T in a minute we're

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.150 
you'll show that T in a minute we're
talking<00:01:01.809> a<00:01:01.870> sinking<00:01:02.199> talent<00:01:02.620> as<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.860> stance

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
talking a sinking talent as the stance

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.419 
talking a sinking talent as the stance
it's<00:01:04.030> an<00:01:04.299> uncommon<00:01:04.839> stance<00:01:05.259> it's<00:01:05.530> not<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.159> rare

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:06.429 
it's an uncommon stance it's not a rare

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:09.739 
it's an uncommon stance it's not a rare
stance<00:01:06.759> but<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:08.200> an<00:01:08.319> uncommon<00:01:08.619> stance<00:01:09.039> and

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 
stance but it's an uncommon stance and

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.029 
stance but it's an uncommon stance and
you<00:01:10.749> can<00:01:10.959> get<00:01:11.109> it<00:01:11.259> through<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.560> corpus<00:01:12.009> of

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
you can get it through the corpus of

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.719 
you can get it through the corpus of
g-tron<00:01:12.609> crewmen<00:01:13.179> or<00:01:14.109> through<00:01:14.729> transmutation

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
g-tron crewmen or through transmutation

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.440 
g-tron crewmen or through transmutation
of<00:01:15.880> course<00:01:16.289> it<00:01:17.289> is<00:01:17.529> I<00:01:18.130> guess<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.270> could<00:01:19.420> say

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
of course it is I guess you could say

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.120 
of course it is I guess you could say
fairly<00:01:19.990> rare<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:20.349> kind<00:01:20.560> of<00:01:20.619> hard<00:01:20.829> to<00:01:20.920> get

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
fairly rare it's kind of hard to get

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.620 
fairly rare it's kind of hard to get
even<00:01:21.310> though<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.759> an<00:01:21.880> uncommon<00:01:22.270> which

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
even though it's an uncommon which

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.260 
even though it's an uncommon which
doesn't<00:01:23.079> make<00:01:23.170> any<00:01:23.349> sense<00:01:23.529> to<00:01:23.770> me<00:01:23.799> but<00:01:24.130> all<00:01:25.060> in

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
doesn't make any sense to me but all in

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.699 
doesn't make any sense to me but all in
all<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.590> really<00:01:26.979> nice<00:01:27.369> stance<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.590> know

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
all it's really nice stance and you know

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.249 
all it's really nice stance and you know
I<00:01:30.389> can't<00:01:31.389> say<00:01:31.569> that<00:01:31.779> there's<00:01:31.959> too<00:01:32.139> many

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
I can't say that there's too many

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.409 
I can't say that there's too many
disadvantages<00:01:33.069> to<00:01:33.279> it<00:01:33.429> I<00:01:33.520> mean<00:01:33.669> it's<00:01:34.060> not

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:34.419 
disadvantages to it I mean it's not

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:36.749 
disadvantages to it I mean it's not
puncture<00:01:34.929> it's<00:01:35.049> not<00:01:35.200> impact<00:01:35.679> its<00:01:35.919> slash<00:01:36.340> so

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
puncture it's not impact its slash so

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.059 
puncture it's not impact its slash so
that's<00:01:36.939> what<00:01:37.090> you're<00:01:37.240> gonna<00:01:37.329> build<00:01:37.599> for<00:01:38.069> you

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
that's what you're gonna build for you

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.010 
that's what you're gonna build for you
can<00:01:39.219> say<00:01:39.459> every<00:01:39.939> which<00:01:40.090> way<00:01:40.119> about<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.719> weapon

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
can say every which way about the weapon

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.679 
can say every which way about the weapon
but<00:01:41.319> I<00:01:41.799> am<00:01:42.189> enjoying<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.669> I<00:01:42.849> have<00:01:42.969> now<00:01:43.179> taken<00:01:43.240> it
