that I like to see 25% of carbohydrate
taking<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.430> still<00:02:29.760> gives<00:02:29.970> me<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:30.660> least

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959

too and that's the beauty of it I can

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.270 
too and that's the beauty of it I can
actually<00:03:19.170> test<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:19.620> through<00:03:19.799> people<00:03:20.130> who

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
actually test this through people who

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.740 
actually test this through people who
are<00:03:20.400> on<00:03:21.290> controlled<00:03:22.290> programs<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:24.540> kind

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
are on controlled programs and it kind

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
are on controlled programs and it kind
of<00:03:24.810> sucks<00:03:25.079> doing<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.739> because<00:03:25.920> I've<00:03:26.100> gone<00:03:26.310> on

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
of sucks doing this because I've gone on

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
recovery and that's all up here it could

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.530 
recovery and that's all up here it could
be<00:03:52.380> mental<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.950> could<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.340> placebo<00:03:53.910> but<00:03:54.090> right

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540

you<00:04:25.220> can<00:04:25.400> even<00:04:25.550> do<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:26.000> intra<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.570> post

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
you can even do that just intra and post

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.170 
you can even do that just intra and post
I<00:04:27.350> really<00:04:28.010> like<00:04:28.160> having<00:04:28.370> carbs<00:04:28.790> intra<00:04:29.150> workout

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
I really like having carbs intra workout

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.670 
I really like having carbs intra workout
because<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.810> feel<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.200> keeps<00:04:30.440> me<00:04:30.650> going

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
because I feel that keeps me going

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.920 
because I feel that keeps me going
through<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.310> workout<00:04:31.700> I<00:04:31.940> tend<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.510> flatten

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
through the workout I tend to flatten

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.300 
through the workout I tend to flatten
out<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.350> when<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.530> have<00:04:33.680> carbs<00:04:34.010> intra<00:04:34.280> workout

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
out but when I have carbs intra workout

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.860 
out but when I have carbs intra workout
at<00:04:34.760> least<00:04:34.910> 25<00:04:35.330> grams

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
at least 25 grams

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.170 
at least 25 grams
I<00:04:35.960> find<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.680> my<00:04:36.830> pump<00:04:37.130> stays<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.700> like

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
I find that my pump stays I like

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.360 
I find that my pump stays I like
pre-workout<00:04:38.810> -<00:04:39.050> I<00:04:39.260> would<00:04:39.620> say<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.130> time

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
pre-workout - I would say that the time

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.280 
pre-workout - I would say that the time
if<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:40.790> need<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.180> pick<00:04:41.480> two<00:04:41.510> periods<00:04:42.140> if<00:04:42.200> you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
if you need to pick two periods if you

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.840 
if you need to pick two periods if you
only<00:04:42.410> have<00:04:42.560> let's<00:04:42.740> say<00:04:42.860> 50<00:04:43.190> grams<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.520> carbs<00:04:43.790> to

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
only have let's say 50 grams of carbs to

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.600 
only have let's say 50 grams of carbs to
work<00:04:44.090> with<00:04:44.300> I'd<00:04:44.870> go<00:04:45.110> pre<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.770> during<00:04:46.190> workout

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
work with I'd go pre and during workout

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.820 
work with I'd go pre and during workout
and<00:04:46.820> post-workout<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:47.810> have<00:04:48.470> your<00:04:48.650> next

and post-workout I just have your next

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.830 
and post-workout I just have your next
scheduled<00:04:49.340> meal<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.420> already<00:04:50.570> have

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
scheduled meal and you already have

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.270 
scheduled meal and you already have
carbs<00:04:51.170> floating<00:04:51.530> around<00:04:51.590> there<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:51.980> branched

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
carbs floating around there and branched

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.250 
carbs floating around there and branched
chains<00:04:52.550> from<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.820> freedom<00:04:53.270> machine<00:04:53.720> fuel<00:04:54.170> or

whatever your choice of branched chain
product<00:04:55.760> is<00:04:55.910> or<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.360> think<00:04:56.510> you'll<00:04:56.780> be<00:04:56.900> good<00:04:57.050> but

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
product is or I think you'll be good but

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.540 
product is or I think you'll be good but
I<00:04:57.320> think<00:04:57.380> pre<00:04:57.770> enduring<00:04:58.190> are<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.400> two

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
I think pre enduring are the two

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.310 
I think pre enduring are the two
critical<00:04:58.730> parts<00:04:59.300> but<00:04:59.720> I'll<00:04:59.840> tell<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.110> what

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
critical parts but I'll tell you what
