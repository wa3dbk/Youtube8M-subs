00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.620
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.110
 edition of games lawyer and one 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.509
 Judgment that just now the fresh of the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.460
 bgh has decided and that very much 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.289
 concise at the moment also in the press 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 However, it is sometimes muddled 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.949
 not with all the consequences 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.359
 So it makes it worthwhile 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.859
 to watch this sequence 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 even if one hears it is about 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.140
 ebay and poll what's happening 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.939
 if I cancel my auction in the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 case the bgh had to decide 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.010
 it was now like there had been someone 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.690
 car purely set to start price 1 EUR 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.090
 the euro has always been offered but 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160
 a few hours later, the auction became 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 then canceled by the seller because 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.989
 He said I have the car now 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 otherwise the buyer sells 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.070
 However, that is now the one euro 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 had not wanted to bid on it 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.329
 Satisfied and is up to court 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.350
 is drawn more instances and now 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.539
 just to the bgh 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.930
 and he actually decided yes 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.000
 you bidder must now be compensated 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 the car can not get more so 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 get money in the value of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.770
 author's less a euros to you yes 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.320
 have bid yes how can it happen 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.540
 that just has to do with that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.490
 there is the civil code and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.619
 this rules as contracts are closed 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.780
 are usually by and also 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.830
 not usually by offer and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.360
 adoption 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 that means the one makes an offer of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.979
 others say loock like and then know 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 contract closed and both owe 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.860
 It was the handover in the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.930
 that the true example of the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.939
 cars and the other of the payment 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 how does it work on ebay? 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.250
 Therefore, the offer now by the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.770
 option to insert eg a computer game 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.140
 that we offer there now and on the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.049
 other side now someone has indeed 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.850
 of course a bit complicated at the time 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.200
 what are we going to do now if we do 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.939
 Anyone else can offer it, I can not 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 sell for every price now 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.590
 then the scholars are still arguing 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.700
 is that now conditional or suspect 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.189
 dissolve or whatever 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.439
 long talk short sense already by the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.360
 renting an euros is indeed a 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.520
 purchase agreement came about 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.590
 but it will be back if necessary 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.870
 dissolved and replaced by new ones 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.120
 someone else over offers so 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.340
 nothing has happened so speak in 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.560
 usually the option has expired or 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.510
 I just cancel the action 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.640
 that means also in the moment then has 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.170
 the purchase agreement at the time 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.379
 was closed and if it is only about 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.970
 a euro is then and that existed 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.230
 was here now the problem then could 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.090
 you still discuss it because it 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.280
 namely also already judging before 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.110
 Was it perhaps immoral? 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.120
 if you now a Euro only for as 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.010
 a very big car should pay 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.629
 because as I said because there was judgment which the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.420
 have already seen that has now 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.190
 but the bgh said he said no 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.640
 With this excuse you will not come anymore 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.319
 Out 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.720
 that is because you have now 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.609
 myself prefer sellers here a euro 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.069
 given as start price so you have to 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.269
 stick to it and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.010
 Bargain hunters are everywhere 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.480
 he thinks of both sides of the seller 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.190
 Maybe I'm lucky enough to have more money 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.359
 to get than it's worth for it must 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.519
 the other then on a bargain 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.590
 so hope now a higher one 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.420
 can take start price therefore no 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.609
 Immorality also for one euro 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 can it be that my car then 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.239
 now it has to pay 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.560
 sometimes the corresponding one 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.599
 Descriptions then no longer 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.120
 the whole thing is actually described 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.620
 is so new is not surprising therefore 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.200
 almost that the whole thing is looking up 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.970
 now it was already produced 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.579
 judgments or 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.230
 you can start for a reason 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.209
 contracts come out again 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.950
 namely then usually with such 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.410
 That's why ebay stories sometimes go 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.049
 also stop namely stop and listen 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.440
 namely, if I stop I know it 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.349
 exactly 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.269
 if I've heard myself for 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.370
 for example, because I have prescribed myself 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.709
 I did not want to give it that way 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.669
 this offer speaks that way on ebay 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.250
 to adjust 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:55.230
 and maybe me too 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.519
 Subject myself wrong I thought that 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.889
 ding of it was healing in reality 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.889
 broken that can be reasons 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.629
 to challenge the whole and then he has 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.160
 others also do not need us 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.019
 maybe still on compensation but 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.480
 not at the height of throughout the car 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.370
 but only what he has saved 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.349
 by or what they now 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.910
 additional costs have arisen because he is now 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.680
 offered my thing and nothing 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.079
 usually had nothing 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.489
 So he gets that cool then you have to 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.030
 much argue yet 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.400
 rauszuholen 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.740
 So with this excuse if they are 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.370
 Of course always said that you agree 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.860
 out there again 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.479
 but and that became another dealer 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.820
 that's how it happens when it's the hall 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.720
 and be wasted namely EUR 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.150
 wanted to start price but had a euro 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.220
 instantly price then set up 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.710
 he has the problem now 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.810
 a small second franc thing 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.449
 must then immediately without culpable 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.030
 trains hesitate so the law says that 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.610
 so it must be said hello 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.840
 I was wrong me and me 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.250
 I was really honored because I have 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.630
 that and did it and why would 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.699
 I do that 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.710
 yes, that did not happen then 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.000
 made in the other case one but 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.590
 has it at some point afterwards 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.360
 and then there is that 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.990
 judge said only to fencing networks though 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.789
 can 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.490
 but you did not do it in time 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.840
 now in court so months later has 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.300
 was no longer without culpability 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.550
 Do not hesitate too late 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.410
 So suddenly then for the euro 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.090
 nice big object sold yes 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.699
 what do we now remember from the story 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.250
 two things first, when you cancel one 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.810
 auction on ebay caution it is in the 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.789
 region purchase agreement emerged 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.760
 and it does not get that easy 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.710
 out again, which also means if I am 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.570
 do that now and usually an ebay 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.280
 of course, quite right 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.599
 concisely then there are downright 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.280
 I will then write the text 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.169
 maybe you can read and then read 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.210
 to remember maybe should be careful 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.860
 be so if that is the case then 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.440
 Can one place in such a way 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.940
 put history in it unless one man 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.410
 really has a good reason and that 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.360
 Not only is that better now 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.639
 found more lucrative offer has 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.050
 does not count but then you have to 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.870
 really have really messed up 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.760
 have defeated a team and then 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.449
 you could come out again 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.289
 otherwise it was just stupid 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.970
 it is so easy it can be, among others, and so 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.070
 fast you can also great times 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.320
 are objects and the games on forest 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.280
 maybe a great game by eur 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.750
 have gotten rid of 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.360
 that's not nice , we all want it 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.070
 not so good that you and she have this 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.080
 succession of games lawyer on gamers global 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.520
 I saw it until next time 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.520
 and bye
