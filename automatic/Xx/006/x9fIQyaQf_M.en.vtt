thought<00:01:13.500> might<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> weak<00:01:14.159> link<00:01:14.189> picks<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
thought might be the weak link picks the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
thought might be the weak link picks the
ball<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.299> left-hand<00:01:15.750> side<00:01:15.810> there

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
ball up on the left-hand side there

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.899 
ball up on the left-hand side there
isn't<00:01:16.470> many<00:01:16.560> options<00:01:17.040> crosses<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> ball<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
isn't many options crosses the ball in

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
isn't many options crosses the ball in
and<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.600> take<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> header<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.470> Suarez<00:01:19.830> hits<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and we take a header and Suarez hits the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
and we take a header and Suarez hits the
crossbar<00:01:20.460> oh<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.689> days<00:01:21.960> where<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
crossbar oh my days where is it you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.840 
crossbar oh my days where is it you
should<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.799> doing<00:01:22.950> better<00:01:23.250> than<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.670> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
should be doing better than that you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.789 
should be doing better than that you
know<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.750> you're<00:01:24.900> very<00:01:25.140> close<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
know what you know you're very close and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
know what you know you're very close and
then<00:01:25.890> Palacia<00:01:26.220> again<00:01:26.820> gets<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.540> behind

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
then Palacia again gets in behind

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
then Palacia again gets in behind
crosses<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> boil<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> repeat<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> what

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
crosses to boil in and repeat of what

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
crosses to boil in and repeat of what
just<00:01:29.909> happened<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.360> Suarez<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.840> time<00:01:31.049> does

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
just happened and Suarez this time does

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
just happened and Suarez this time does
the<00:01:31.530> right<00:01:31.710> thing<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.820> hard<00:01:33.000> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the right thing you know it was hard I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.390 
the right thing you know it was hard I
didn't<00:01:33.689> really<00:01:34.170> play<00:01:34.409> much<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.100> squad

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
didn't really play much with this squad

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
didn't really play much with this squad
so<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.610> hard<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:35.939> used<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.840> then

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so it's hard to get used to it but then

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
so it's hard to get used to it but then
Marco<00:01:37.320> Royce<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> lot<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.130> time<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.610> space

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
Marco Royce has a lot of time and space

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120 
Marco Royce has a lot of time and space
and<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.240> first-time<00:01:39.900> finish<00:01:40.320> their<00:01:40.560> finessed

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and a first-time finish their finessed

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.830 
and a first-time finish their finessed
into<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> bottom<00:01:41.820> corner<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.450> gives<00:01:42.659> us

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
into the bottom corner and that gives us

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
into the bottom corner and that gives us
a<00:01:42.930> free<00:01:43.409> nil<00:01:43.740> win<00:01:44.070> over<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.939> was<00:01:45.119> pretty

know<00:02:30.360> works<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.140> game<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.890> gets<00:02:32.040> in

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
know works in the game and it gets in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.580 
know works in the game and it gets in
behind<00:02:32.430> our<00:02:32.879> neue<00:02:33.420> makes<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.750> fantastic<00:02:33.900> save

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
behind our neue makes a fantastic save

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.979 
behind our neue makes a fantastic save
but<00:02:35.250> look<00:02:35.549> at<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.909> he<00:02:36.030> gets<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.390> rebound<00:02:36.569> I

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
but look at that he gets the rebound I

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.720 
but look at that he gets the rebound I
thought<00:02:37.260> I'd<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:37.709> won't<00:02:38.129> concede<00:02:38.459> from<00:02:38.610> that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
thought I'd like won't concede from that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.880 
thought I'd like won't concede from that
point<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.629> do<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:40.110> go<00:02:40.260> down<00:02:40.560> to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
point but what can I do we go down to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.100 
point but what can I do we go down to
one<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.060> Grail<00:02:42.299> picks<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.629> ball<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.810> plays

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110

into the game at all it's absolutely
decent<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.430> well<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:56.730> NAT<00:02:56.849> fellatio<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.510> like

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959

going<00:02:58.349> through<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.829> defense<00:02:59.159> either<00:02:59.310> they're

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
going through the defense either they're

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.309 
going through the defense either they're
not<00:02:59.640> challenging<00:03:00.060> him<00:03:00.209> he<00:03:00.480> takes<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.840> shot<00:03:01.079> and

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
not challenging him he takes a shot and

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.500 
not challenging him he takes a shot and
the<00:03:01.680> keeper<00:03:01.950> smothers<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:03.269> should<00:03:03.420> have

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the keeper smothers it we should have

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.640 
the keeper smothers it we should have
done<00:03:03.659> better<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:04.079> because<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.409> was<00:03:04.530> in

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
done better there because that was in

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.530 
done better there because that was in
the<00:03:04.739> last<00:03:04.950> minute<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.489> get<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.879> draw<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the last minute we get the draw in the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.059 
the last minute we get the draw in the
group<00:03:06.750> stage<00:03:06.989> which<00:03:07.500> wasn't<00:03:07.709> what<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> was

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
group stage which wasn't what I was

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.860 
group stage which wasn't what I was
looking<00:03:08.159> for<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.670> he<00:03:08.760> had<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:08.879> decent<00:03:09.209> team<00:03:09.599> and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
looking for but he had a decent team and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.330 
looking for but he had a decent team and
I<00:03:09.900> think<00:03:10.109> longer<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.829> play<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.129> game

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
I think longer that you play this game

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.130 
I think longer that you play this game
the<00:03:11.940> more<00:03:12.060> you're<00:03:12.209> gonna<00:03:12.269> cop<00:03:12.599> against<00:03:12.930> these

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
the more you're gonna cop against these

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.869 
the more you're gonna cop against these
decent<00:03:13.620> teams<00:03:13.859> because<00:03:14.250> I've<00:03:14.400> already<00:03:14.579> built

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
decent teams because I've already built

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.190 
decent teams because I've already built
a<00:03:14.940> decent<00:03:15.239> team<00:03:15.329> doesn't<00:03:15.720> take<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.019> many

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
a decent team doesn't take that many

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080 
a decent team doesn't take that many
coins<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.680> know<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.890> invest<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.790> build<00:03:18.000> a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
fairly decent squad that you can utilize

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.589 
fairly decent squad that you can utilize
