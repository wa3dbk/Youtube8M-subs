00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello everyone on gulli I hope 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.400
 that you're fine 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.589
 so at the moment I'm filming the video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.200
 is not yet the 1st of May at the moment when 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 I will post it will be the first 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.170
 I made the video a little bit 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.010
 advance because I was not sure of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.500
 to be able to film the first one actually 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.340
 today comes so I you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 wish a happy new year good health 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.189
 that happiness everything you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.279
 want the fulfillment of everything 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.179
 blush so I have full resolution 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 etc. 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.120
 we'll see if I'll manage to hold them 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.820
 that I do not hope if the year on the sudden 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.390
 and be regular I hope I hope 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.440
 I hope 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.899
 and that's why I made you a little 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 review on a hair product that I have 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.350
 discovered not so long ago and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.840
 I wanted to talk to you about it because 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.320
 that I really liked 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 so it's about the heart the lana of the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.829
 Mark 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.300
 at jaggi hong kong defining curl that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.300
 stargirl la 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.310
 So here it is a kind of pudding 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.440
 so there is almost more like you 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.120
 can see I devour them so I have 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.860
 a little bit I'll try to 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:31.130
 show you a little texture 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:40.890
 so it's a pretty texture like angie 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:42.780
 a little thick but a lot to do 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.100
 quite watery he confesses that there is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.270
 the water in there is a lot of water in it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.170
 and his route defined super well 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.140
 curls 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.070
 besides, I do not know how long you 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.150
 if you remember my video on the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.730
 the collaboration of the parties, that's when 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.960
 I'm doing my hairstyle I've undone 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.960
 did even but three little mats in 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.760
 makes the three wide portions and 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.230
 facts and I do not know if you have 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.520
 noticed but soft that are still 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.270
 pretty well defined and so the Belgian had 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.030
 used this product there so always in 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.489
 doing my method to define but 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.220
 natural if you do not know how 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.440
 I'm doing my video in info bar 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.090
 about how I'm doing to define the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.170
 natural curls without making tristam 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.890
 so here is instead of having used 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.470
 cartridge and scorer as usual 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.690
 I used this one and I find 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.610
 that the e-book are super well defined 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.620
 so unlike the affected camp 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.319
 butter it does not make white residue 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.830
 so that's what's great that's what 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.550
 makes me look for this project rather 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.739
 that the camp hitters now 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.620
 then at the level of the smell against 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.090
 it's an odor that I find bloomy and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.819
 who is really very present 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.730
 so if you do not like smells 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.319
 present I do not know if it's okay 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.690
 suit 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:19.310
 the engine studies crying so it's 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.799
 of color in so little the sale of fronts 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.140
 two very clear I do not know if we see 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.819
 this is a lavender color is very 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.180
 clear texture is a texture a 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.069
 little bit like a conditioner 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.069
 classic and we must go back in your 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.319
 hair and above all it defines you super 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.970
 well loops so at the level of 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.590
 ingredients left less looked at then 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.650
 the first ingredient cvo so that's 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.190
 great inside we have chic scorer 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.769
 so shea butter from the glycine 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.260
 soybean of life series of oil 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.870
 of olive of which there is no sulphate 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.629
 there is no paraben there is no life 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.700
 mineral there is no metro the atom and 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.099
 it's a product that's made for 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:14.150
 natural hair curls and school 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:16.220

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.889

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.260

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.160

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.650

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.660
 superb hotel site it costs 7 euros and 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.639

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.840
 I ordered two that I have that 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.389

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:57.639
 and here it is, I start my year 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:03.500
 with the heart of the a21 Jaqee 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:06.229
 glad that li bin to define my 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.870
 loops naturally this is then to 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:13.610
 hair are super well hydrated you 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.460
 do not need to iron the product 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.880
 every night once in two it can 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.099
 be well 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.530
 it depends on the definition of ghouls 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.680
 that you want there as you can 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.680
 see 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.950
 yesterday game last night finally I do not have 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.500
 ironing the product I just had 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.100
 attached my hair as usual and 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:40.460
 you see what it gives 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:45.080
 always good I show you the little 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.350
 these are the facts and still not bad 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.389
 so 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.950
 after tonight I do not think I 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.060
 finally I have no choice I do not 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.060
 could not bring it back because 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.400
 I have more but here tonight I'm going 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.020
 to attach me but I simply want and the 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.760
 next morning I think it will be 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.400
 always as well 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.850
 I find that contrary to any 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.200
 hit better he tends to deny more 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.160
 hair so your hair 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.640
 dryer - so this actually makes me a little 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.910
 I apply the product I do my three 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.370
 small portions and I leave a small 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.920
 little dried up all through the 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.700
 evening I let it dry and just before 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.250
 to go to bed 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.140
 that's where I apply my elastic 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.450
 you know for a little bit pulled them 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.520
 because if I will count this from the 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.900
 start the hair after the next day 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.110
 morning it's not going to wait to dry 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.780
 because the hair dries well and 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.850
 so here I recommend you to leave 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.140
 a little dried the product looks 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.880
 is then applied to the elastics if 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.860
 you do the same thing as me and 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.120
 cover your hair just right 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.240
 last minute before you go 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.460
 bedtime and the next day it is that he 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.680
 there is no problem here I think that 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.440
 I said everything about this product 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.980
 so I really like you 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.320
 recommended 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.350
 if you want to try do not hesitate 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.420
 I do not make you big kisses the video 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.790
 is over I hope you have more 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.660
 that it would have helped us and give us 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.520
 ideas 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.970
