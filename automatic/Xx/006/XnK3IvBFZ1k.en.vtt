00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello I hope you are very well today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.810
 I bring two things the first is how 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.700
 Make your nails caviar type or with balls 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 as you see in these two designs and the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.900
 second is an extra tip of how to do 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.630
 that your nail polish presents you cenote for 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.779
 make this look that you see at this moment 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 for this we need a base brightness 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.830
 and a protective shine and also 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 we need the phosphorescent nail polish 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 that we are going to use 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.170
 I have this mabel yellow and I know 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.580
 forgot to mention that a white nail polish 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 It is also very important and the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.600
 stars of this tutorial are these 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.760
 these balls I got them in 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 salisbury are super tiny balls and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.290
 They cost me around 40 pesos 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.239
 then I went to the United States and I 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 I found these little bottles that are 8 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.500
 little bottles are full as 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.500
 half and these 8 of 8 colors cost me 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.010
 one dollar a dollar so to those who 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.930
 you have south access these you can use 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 let's start by telling you how to do 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 that your painted in your presents is noticeable 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.570
 the trick here is to paint the base of your 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 white nails 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.670
 I gave myself two layers of white nail polish and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.750
 since it dried I painted my nails with the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 nail polish phosphor 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.280
 as you can see here only one layer and one 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010
 layer with necessary painted on the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.680
 present so that the design would continue 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.780
 super bright like that and it highlights a lot 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.000
 a lot a lot because if you do it without the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.890
 white base looks like transparent but 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.900
 already with the white base the year pinto 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.520
 like that stands out then that 's the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.490
 trick so that I have painted on these 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.800
 present is more noticeable and lasts a lot 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.710
 give yourself a part of this tutorial is how 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.110
 apply the balls we are going to apply a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.690
 coat of nail polish and before I know 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.060
 we're going to dip it in the little balls 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.009
 this way we're going to have a goop of 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.440
 balls in the nail when we take it out like that 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 that we are going to press lightly so that 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.090
 the balls are set we are going to try 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.460
 of arranging it with the nails without moving the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.860
 directly just pressing and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.259
 then removing the excess around 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.729
 if you feel that you will be stuck many 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.170
 White spaces re-insert the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.330
 finger to the little balls that you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.090
 will blame the blur truth but in the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.530
 camera no and that's how I 've stayed with me 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.110
 to remove the balls from around 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.510
 then to fill the holes I 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.140
 submerge itchy tooth in a little bit of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.760
 enamel 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.590
 transparent to catch the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.480
 balls and I'm already placing 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.520
 directly in the gaps that I 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.680
 they were left since I was satisfied 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.170
 finish placing balls and I stayed 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.990
 so with the complete nail among more 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.940
 tricks you see better so I stayed 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.350
 mine and in the end I just added a 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.270
 protective shine so that I do not get 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.060
 it falls so that you do not fall 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.400
 is to let it dry completely 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.100
 that you have to be a little patient and 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.810
 wait for it to dry if you liked this 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.310

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.650
 in truth that makes me the most 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.890
 happy of the universe pass it to your 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.630
