00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.340
 so santa cruz 6 at the start with 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.980
 Consulting and yes today I'll show you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.420
 how to improve his a few of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.100
 he has you in the last video like that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
 if it is not so good 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.930
 but as I said matchmaking all that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.029
 was the first and you can not 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.120
 really say good things in the truest sense 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.530
 not good because it is conditional on them 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 and I did not have that much time around 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.800
 to play everything very much to somehow the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.430
 most blatant of the classic clips 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.410
 daily 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.210
 Today I show how simple you are 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.219
 Its improved one goes to everyone 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.219
 fall of view workshop then you go in 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.780
 eps a training mcs co2 if i'm accurate 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.289
 I know how the economy works 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.649
 have that in the last video with the big ones 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.300
 The self- explains how to explain the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.920
 use workshop I think that should 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.609
 be clear, just download the lab 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.949
 subscribe to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.860
 In the workshop enter training then 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.810
 Anyway, this map will come because of it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.840
 just a really cool until the e 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.740
 Mail love and reaction time in addition 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.180
 What do I mean by that ? 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:25.750
 there the kik should actually be 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:29.590
 make perfect on the moon 50 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.770
 Here delay zero doubt because I think 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.400
 this is the best for drinking spree remains 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.229
 which is either the second third grade for 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.080
 level goes up you pick the higher 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:50.430
 the heavier and the whitehole instead and 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:56.740
 that's all about concentration 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.750
 and one thing that's really mine 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.910
 first time and I use it in front of everyone 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.399
 matchmaking not everybody but most 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:09.550
 many times that a bit too 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:13.690
 and you can do it all yourself 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.989
 Try and that helps everyone 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.989
 case 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.150
 I have 46 55 now 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.060
 met that it raises okay okay 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.700
 you guys that's about 550 46 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.320
 makes my first time when I am now couple 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.989
 would train the best would be 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.280
 perhaps even 49 are 50 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.810
 you can already rave about it 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.110
 make but it is compulsorily around or 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.000
 something like that is soon to daume 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.860
 to practice reaction time and with whom I 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.080
 find this mode the best 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.640
 and i can definitely go to anyone 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.019
 recommend from the matchmaking or 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.450
 generally a bit of exercise on the day 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.500
 to improve his and me 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.280
 would say now I'll show you the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.989
 next map as the lifts map we 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.940
 download us from the workshop as I said 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.480
 just join the workshop 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.030
 right honored bots type 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.430
 subscribe and play the whole thing again 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.620
 they used a lot of people around 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.600
 to play in and around here 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 improve 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.380
 Personally, I think that's right 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.510
 really nice the map I like 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.210
 personally really good and I 'll do it 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 before every match making so do that 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.690
 I really powerful before any match 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.270
 because it is actually quite simple and 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.560
 horny and really well done on everyone 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.900
 case what i do here we go as 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.650
 The first thing was that she was not walking 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.440
 check off 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:47.770
 So pick and have bots here 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.810
 they stand here and they can 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.930
 Finally you can stop the way 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.050
 if you are so nice with 49 1 and 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.610
 or so and then you can start yourself 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:05.710
 a bit einzuspielen is because it 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:08.800
 bad and then you stop then 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.510
 continue and you can train the whole one 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.920
 you can train the stray control one 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.350
 people can also run a bit 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.799
 but that's a bit harder 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:22.180
 shows the whole right performance would like 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.680
 also with a little bit here are 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.700
 but urgently a few spots quandt 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.210
 still a bit over ten 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:39.390
 just come in and it was 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.390
 really good because that steer 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.740
 I use this mode 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.670
 In any case, you can be very 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.770
 maybe if you can go here for that 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.560
 Example of any trade to drive 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:08.800
 if it is a bit heavier 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:12.250
 to do the opponents you just do it 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.780
 Here you can be tightly controlled 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.160
 but how to be riekel control am 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.260
 best on which maps and so on 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.100
 I will definitely improve too 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.450
 show everything 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.850
 I hope that they here I could 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.820
 help plays the whole day is on 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.130
 best such maps because the new m 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.300
 I can improve that much for everyone 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.710
 we do not necessarily recommend 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.340
 just run around 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.940
 get free 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.320
 That is a bit of the end of the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:42.009
 dance halt heavy rushing to give 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:44.810
 try something else 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.889
 a little bit better in you too 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.360
 you should not do such a high one 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.539
 I can have and be peaceful 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.590
 recommend to anyone what I like 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.240
 I do not say that because I have one 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.250
 weird must be on and all so funny 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.050
 have found out from it 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.460
 does not make too high and I hope you 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.009
 can learn something 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.180
 freezes or aion yes then the case 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.800
 not always better either 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.419
 that's just enough for the video and music 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.190
 Out of the back seat, what's next ? 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.050
 want to see what we trick a tick and 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.599
 so on, maybe yours 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.319
 suggestion as a video form i hope i 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:20.419
 I would first trained by the maps 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:27.550
 because that is especially clear in any case 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:31.030
 important everything you have here so you 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.030
 can also be here
