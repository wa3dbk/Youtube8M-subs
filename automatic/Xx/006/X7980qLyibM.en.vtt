just kind of giving my opinions on what

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.280 
just kind of giving my opinions on what
I've<00:00:10.440> seen<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.740> far<00:00:11.599> and<00:00:12.599> I'll<00:00:12.840> start<00:00:13.019> off<00:00:13.139> by

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
I've seen so far and I'll start off by

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.470 
I've seen so far and I'll start off by
saying<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.889> EA<00:00:14.190> has<00:00:14.309> had<00:00:14.940> problems<00:00:15.179> with

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
saying that EA has had problems with

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.640 
saying that EA has had problems with
their<00:00:15.690> servers<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.350> don't<00:00:16.470> think

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
their servers and I don't think

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.230 
their servers and I don't think
anybody's<00:00:17.039> surprise<00:00:17.250> there<00:00:17.760> although<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.210> are

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
anybody's surprise there although we are

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390 
anybody's surprise there although we are
all<00:00:18.420> hoping<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.990> smooth<00:00:19.410> launch<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
all hoping for a smooth launch the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.970 
all hoping for a smooth launch the
consoles<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:20.939> had<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> lot<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> problems<00:00:21.980> not

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
consoles have had a lot of problems not

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519 
consoles have had a lot of problems not
enough<00:00:23.220> servers<00:00:23.640> server<00:00:24.060> downtime<00:00:24.390> etc<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.470> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
enough servers server downtime etc but I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
enough servers server downtime etc but I
mean<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> games<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.130> launched<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.910> EA<00:00:27.300> does

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
mean the games just launched and EA does

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.439 
mean the games just launched and EA does
not<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.260> best<00:00:28.410> track<00:00:28.619> record<00:00:29.119> with<00:00:30.119> that

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
not have the best track record with that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
not have the best track record with that
kind<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.779> stuff<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.550> were<00:00:32.669> all

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
kind of stuff so I think we were all

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.130 
kind of stuff so I think we were all
kind<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.030> expecting<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.570> although<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> were

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
kind of expecting that although we were

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.180 
kind of expecting that although we were
hoping<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.739> better<00:00:36.530> but<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.590> mean<00:00:37.739> games<00:00:37.980> these

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
hoping for better but I mean games these

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220 
hoping for better but I mean games these
days<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:39.180> always<00:00:39.420> having<00:00:39.629> problems<00:00:40.110> at

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
days are always having problems at

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.100 
days are always having problems at
launch<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.550> we'll<00:00:41.940> forget<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> not

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
launch but you know we'll forget it not

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
launch but you know we'll forget it not
going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> judge<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> game<00:00:43.950> based<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
going to judge the game based on the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
going to judge the game based on the
servers<00:00:45.270> at<00:00:45.450> launch<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
servers at launch I'm just going to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
servers at launch I'm just going to
focus<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> game<00:00:47.100> play<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.940> break

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
focus on the game play here so break

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
focus on the game play here so break
down<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.899> game<00:00:49.110> types<00:00:49.440> now<00:00:49.850> playing<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> little

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
down the game types now playing a little

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.610 
down the game types now playing a little
team<00:00:51.329> deathmatch<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
team deathmatch here and this is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
team deathmatch here and this is
definitely<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.340> quickest<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> game

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
definitely the quickest of the game

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
definitely the quickest of the game
types<00:00:54.780> there's<00:00:55.020> only<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.230> hundred<00:00:55.440> kills<00:00:56.030> it's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
types there's only a hundred kills it's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.250 
types there's only a hundred kills it's
usually<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.329> pretty<00:00:57.480> big<00:00:57.750> game<00:00:57.989> type

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
usually a pretty big game type

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.170 
usually a pretty big game type
especially<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> PC<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.670> get<00:01:00.000> some

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
especially on the PC you can get some

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
especially on the PC you can get some
thirty<00:01:00.480> two<00:01:00.629> player<00:01:00.870> games<00:01:01.170> even<00:01:01.379> 64<00:01:02.039> player

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
thirty two player games even 64 player

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.479 
thirty two player games even 64 player
team<00:01:03.059> deathmatch<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.719> occasion<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:05.369> goes

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
team deathmatch on occasion and it goes

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
team deathmatch on occasion and it goes
pretty<00:01:05.640> quick<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.119> should<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.510> five<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
pretty quick you should about five to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.920 
pretty quick you should about five to
seven<00:01:07.170> minutes<00:01:07.320> per<00:01:07.799> game<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> don't

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
seven minutes per game so if you don't

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.539 
seven minutes per game so if you don't
need<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> hop<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> few<00:01:10.920> games<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.430> two

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
need to hop on for a few games to two

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.280 
need to hop on for a few games to two
the<00:01:11.580> game<00:01:11.790> type<00:01:12.060> I'll<00:01:12.270> play<00:01:12.540> although<00:01:13.140> it's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the game type I'll play although it's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.050 
the game type I'll play although it's
not<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.590> favorite<00:01:13.740> game<00:01:14.070> type<00:01:14.310> by<00:01:14.549> any<00:01:14.790> means

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
not my favorite game type by any means

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
not my favorite game type by any means
it<00:01:15.659> plays<00:01:15.990> pretty<00:01:16.259> similar<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> call<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> duty

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it plays pretty similar to call a duty

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.710 
it plays pretty similar to call a duty
really<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.840> first<00:01:19.680> team<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> 100<00:01:20.189> wins

really you know first team to 100 wins
pretty<00:01:21.720> straightforward<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:23.460> next<00:01:23.880> moving

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
pretty straightforward and next moving

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
pretty straightforward and next moving
on<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.390> conquest<00:01:24.960> game<00:01:25.229> types<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.860> have

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
on to the conquest game types we have

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.929 
on to the conquest game types we have
regular<00:01:26.790> conquest<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.600> conquest<00:01:28.200> large<00:01:28.939> and

regular conquest and conquest large and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.050 
regular conquest and conquest large and
conquest<00:01:30.600> large<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:32.040> domination<00:01:32.759> but

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
conquest large is like domination but

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
conquest large is like domination but
there's<00:01:33.270> five<00:01:33.630> points<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> capture

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
there's five points you have to capture

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
there's five points you have to capture
and<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.060> usually<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.570> crazy<00:01:36.840> game

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
and this is usually a really crazy game
type<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.799> larger<00:01:38.220> maps<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> lot<00:01:38.939> of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
conquest large is that you really don't

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.539 
conquest large is that you really don't
feel<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.220> control

feel like you have that much control

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
feel like you have that much control
over<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.270> outcome<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> game<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.140> an

an impact on you know winning the games
there's<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.799> much<00:01:58.950> space<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> cover<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.969> for

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
there's so much space to cover this for

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.720 
there's so much space to cover this for
people<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.170> definitely

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
people can be definitely

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.820 
people can be definitely
not<00:02:01.880> cover<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.930> much<00:02:03.170> space<00:02:03.470> there's

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
not cover that much space there's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.280 
not cover that much space there's
absolutely<00:02:04.370> no<00:02:04.550> way<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:05.090> mean<00:02:06.080> if<00:02:06.170> you're

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
absolutely no way I mean if you're

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.900 
absolutely no way I mean if you're
looking<00:02:06.500> for<00:02:06.530> some<00:02:06.830> crazy<00:02:07.190> intense<00:02:07.580> fun

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
looking for some crazy intense fun

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.750 
looking for some crazy intense fun
that's<00:02:08.450> definitely<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.960> game<00:02:09.080> type<00:02:09.320> for<00:02:09.590> you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
that's definitely the game type for you

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.730 
that's definitely the game type for you
and<00:02:10.760> for<00:02:11.510> regular<00:02:11.930> conquests<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.530> think<00:02:12.680> this

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
and for regular conquests I think this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.310 
and for regular conquests I think this
is<00:02:12.800> my<00:02:13.010> favorite<00:02:13.280> game<00:02:13.580> type<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.210> far<00:02:14.510> just

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
is my favorite game type so far just

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.290 
is my favorite game type so far just
because<00:02:15.680> it's<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.370> little<00:02:16.760> bit<00:02:16.850> more<00:02:17.030> what<00:02:17.180> I'm

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
because it's a little bit more what I'm

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.910 
because it's a little bit more what I'm
you<00:02:17.660> know<00:02:17.780> I'm<00:02:17.900> used<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.230> playing<00:02:18.530> call<00:02:18.890> of

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
you know I'm used to playing call of

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.560 
you know I'm used to playing call of
duty<00:02:19.010> it's<00:02:19.340> like<00:02:19.430> domination<00:02:20.180> there's<00:02:20.360> just

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
duty it's like domination there's just

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.000 
duty it's like domination there's just
three<00:02:20.750> points<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.350> have<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.530> run<00:02:21.680> around<00:02:21.800> and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
three points you have to run around and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.520 
three points you have to run around and
capture<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.330> don't<00:02:23.510> hold<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.140> win

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.900 

unlike<00:02:27.530> ecology<00:02:27.920> out<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.280> three<00:02:28.460> capping

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
unlike ecology out like three capping

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.670 
unlike ecology out like three capping
and<00:02:29.060> conquests<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:29.900> not<00:02:30.050> really<00:02:30.260> beneficial

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and conquests it's not really beneficial

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.130 
and conquests it's not really beneficial
the<00:02:31.190> spawns<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.030> battlefield<00:02:32.510> works<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:32.930> much

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
the spawns and battlefield works so much

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.130 
the spawns and battlefield works so much
different<00:02:33.590> than<00:02:33.880> call<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.910> duty<00:02:35.330> any<00:02:35.780> call<00:02:36.050> of

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
different than call of duty any call of

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.200 
different than call of duty any call of
duty<00:02:36.380> game<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.460> really<00:02:37.700> beneficial<00:02:37.850> to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
duty game that it's really beneficial to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.180 
duty game that it's really beneficial to
hold<00:02:38.630> down<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> point<00:02:39.140> which<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.530> guess<00:02:39.710> is<00:02:39.740> more

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
hold down a point which I guess is more

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.670 
hold down a point which I guess is more
realistic<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:42.020> sense<00:02:42.260> but<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.560> can

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
realistic in a sense but you can

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.450 
realistic in a sense but you can
definitely<00:02:42.860> rack<00:02:43.190> up<00:02:43.460> some<00:02:43.490> really<00:02:44.360> big<00:02:44.570> games

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
definitely rack up some really big games

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.680 
definitely rack up some really big games
the<00:02:46.460> thing<00:02:46.580> with<00:02:46.730> conquest<00:02:47.120> though<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.510> they

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
the thing with conquest though is they

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.270 
the thing with conquest though is they
are<00:02:47.720> longer<00:02:48.170> game<00:02:48.500> types<00:02:48.800> you're<00:02:48.980> looking<00:02:49.160> at

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
are longer game types you're looking at

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.920 
are longer game types you're looking at
12<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.700> 15<00:02:50.060> minutes<00:02:50.240> sometimes<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:50.840> even

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
12 to 15 minutes sometimes you can even

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.620 
12 to 15 minutes sometimes you can even
have<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.260> 20-minute<00:02:52.100> game<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:53.000> know<00:02:53.060> depending

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
have a 20-minute game you know depending

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.650 
have a 20-minute game you know depending
on<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.900> map<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.290> how<00:02:55.000> how<00:02:56.000> many<00:02:56.180> flags<00:02:56.420> are

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
on the map and how how many flags are

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.080 
on the map and how how many flags are
being<00:02:56.840> exchanged<00:02:57.820> when<00:02:58.820> you're<00:02:58.940> playing

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
being exchanged when you're playing

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.060 
being exchanged when you're playing
conquests<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.720> flags<00:02:59.960> have<00:03:00.230> two<00:03:00.530> points<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
conquests the flags have two points the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.470 
conquests the flags have two points the
initial<00:03:01.430> capture<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.090> then<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.270> have<00:03:02.450> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
initial capture and then you have to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.080 
initial capture and then you have to
deactivate<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.650> point<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.100> then<00:03:04.310> recapture

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
deactivate the point and then recapture

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.550 
deactivate the point and then recapture
it<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.420> actually<00:03:05.600> go<00:03:05.840> through<00:03:05.870> two<00:03:06.260> phases

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
it so you actually go through two phases

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.490 
it so you actually go through two phases
to<00:03:06.920> capture<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> flag<00:03:07.670> which<00:03:08.630> takes<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.350> lot<00:03:09.470> of

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
to capture a flag which takes a lot of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.550 
to capture a flag which takes a lot of
time<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.040> lot<00:03:10.070> of<00:03:10.220> teamwork<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.990> now<00:03:12.440> we're

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
time and a lot of teamwork and now we're

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.160 
time and a lot of teamwork and now we're
moving<00:03:12.680> on<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:12.980> rush<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.820> haven't<00:03:14.660> played<00:03:14.810> too

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
the objective it's pretty much an

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.280 
the objective it's pretty much an
automatic<00:03:29.060> loss<00:03:29.300> for<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.900> mean<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> way

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
if you can plant every single one and

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.430 
if you can plant every single one and
hold<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.890> down<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.310> win<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.610> game<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.440> for

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
hold it down you win the game and for

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.940 
hold it down you win the game and for
each<00:03:45.530> set<00:03:45.830> your<00:03:46.100> team<00:03:46.370> gets<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.640> hundred<00:03:46.940> lives

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
each set your team gets a hundred lives

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.280

so<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.370> know<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.820> like<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.630> game<00:03:50.750> type<00:03:51.020> it's

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
so you know I like that game type it's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.110 
so you know I like that game type it's
definitely<00:03:51.470> better<00:03:51.830> played<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.489> squad<00:03:52.820> we

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
definitely better played in a squad we

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.640 
definitely better played in a squad we
can<00:03:53.300> have<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.450> little<00:03:53.540> communication<00:03:54.020> and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
can have a little communication and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.320 
can have a little communication and
teamwork<00:03:55.280> working<00:03:55.940> towards<00:03:56.239> those

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
teamwork working towards those

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.750 
teamwork working towards those
objectives<00:03:56.870> but<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.410> very<00:03:57.500> hard<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.340> win<00:03:58.730> a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
objectives but it is very hard to win a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.510 
objectives but it is very hard to win a
game<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:59.120> rush<00:03:59.300> as<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.720> attackers<00:04:00.520> definitely

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
game of rush as the attackers definitely

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.460 
game of rush as the attackers definitely
takes<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.970> lot<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.180> teamwork<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.140> that's<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.320> game

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
takes a lot of teamwork so that's a game

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.570 
takes a lot of teamwork so that's a game
he'll<00:04:03.620> be<00:04:03.739> getting<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:03.950> little<00:04:04.070> more<00:04:04.310> when<00:04:04.489> I'm

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580

playing<00:04:04.760> more<00:04:05.300> with<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.450> squad<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.170> think<00:04:07.100> I'll

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
playing more with a squad I think I'll

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.810 
playing more with a squad I think I'll
stick<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.430> conquest<00:04:07.880> until

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
