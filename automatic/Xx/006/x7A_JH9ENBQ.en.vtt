00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:05.299
 the well-known buildings on the edge of saints may even be curious 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.390
 for tourists but for those who live there is an inconvenience now residents of a 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.089
 building can already breathe relieved and you will see why 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.480
 The 17-story building was erected with the help of a hydraulic jack 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.119
 the height of 50 centimeters was filled with cement. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.980
 In addition to modern technology, the engineers also 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.390
 confidence of the residents of the building 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.160
 is that the work was accepted without the 34 families in the sentence taking the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.499
 apartments feeling live living living normal life 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.420
 I only asked 3d being flat with this brand that year 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.580
 because of several items they can do in the apartment that we think 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.290
 which in the building in recent months 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.110
 in the 60s that happened 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.670
 we want to arrive 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.060
 the building was already with a slope of the comma eight degrees 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.110
 this is a pioneering project to realign the crooked buildings of saints 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.610
 in every border are almost 60 the geologist explains why they occur the structure 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.400
 was placed 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.040
 leaning on the sand 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.870
 I stopped presenting 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.170
 intercourse with her buddy diet and that decision is extremely 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230
 molin 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.050
 and she can not stand the thought of the buildings for a long time exists 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.430
 even the fear that these buildings will fall on each other 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.400
 causing a domino effect but the engineers explain that this does not 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.880
 could occur because in case one of them has a bar the building would fall 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.940
 on the vertical axis itself without reaching the others the structure in a 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.060
 pretty much slope and it falls vertically 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.520
 the residents who for years have led a prosperous life 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.759
 celebrate the success of the work the residents are all happy does not bring much 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.160
 primordial action 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.880
 besides what the brazilian pejene is a very important landmark elisabete 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.719
 said if the property that bought for 250 thousand reais 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:14.899
 now it's worth 600 and it was not only the landscape 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.399
 also changed that it was already wonderful and even better
