00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.190
 why 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:13.700
 rejected pieces if redeem it science a 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:45.260
 bolzoni certainly was a match 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:47.510
 auto more conditions of the embankment than us 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.560
 tell some of this beauty in 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.330
 time that is also vice-first time 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.750
 seemed a bit like accessing transport 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.660
 you do not find against the right ones and of 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.400
 nox to enter to make you month puts 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.670
 in school, according to what it is 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.470
 changed there collected positively 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 It appeared in the the game we had 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.230
 always the ball of the game we are 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.230
 also 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.820
 for sanitary wares that are something 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.750
 They are fundamental to rings for 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.119
 team 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.710
 then the first half despite 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.100
 we attacked them they managed to do 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.970
 a restart immediately I have to suffer a 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.250
 penalty 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.670
 they have gone ahead when it goes yes 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.550
 disadvantage in this league but I have it 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.480
 defended as even the teams close 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.540
 trying to take the loot home 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:53.500
 then second time we entered more 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.500
 convinced also because it was visible 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.110
 we managed to blog how to stay there 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.650
 on other various Etna games we are there 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.650
 taken to advantage 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:19.520
 this attack quote that anticipates 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:22.520
 of manuela fabbri for himself is wrong 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:29.120
 then I managed to cross on Friday i 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:33.310
 their colors are the building they are 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.830
 in short, he speaks right behind 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.519
 the referee's attitude that field 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:46.069
 we usually have scope available 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:49.480
 surely these referees are 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.480
 I'm a beginner 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:09.480
 the right experience and skills 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.480
 end is not one 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.500
 our part and with great conviction 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.920
 they paid the coach with last 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.780
 in the interval what he told you that 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.959
 of course 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.760
 the mister among the first serving from you 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.340
 he said we were going well too 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.709
 because in fact he alone turns 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.890
 on the restart I immediately got the kick 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.890
 of rigor 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.950
 these were the words of the coach 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.050
 even more convinced that indeed 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:47.400
 we could take home here is you 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.900
 young at times sins of inexperience 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.250
 then we need to understand what to play 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.060
 the dry type flatbed machine 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.900
 intercontinental and one of 34 of this 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.820
 championship and to them other things and the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.290
 vice champion of the fund after lap because 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.780
 he has passed the door and he has them 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.540
 bypassed a person the brand does not 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.130
 can never because with the friend allows 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.900
 why the Italians this four 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.310
 leave when it reveals April 6 another 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.740
 position of take the fourth and i 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.360
 pay kato because it can happen that 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.280
 touching the ten you have to be a fullback 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.110
 to be there no more to do a little 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.060
 an admonition takes the second yellow card 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:27.430
 leaves us a few spaces to separate works a 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:38.970
 double cut especially you make one made 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:38.970
 sought do not know that do 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.729
 so concrete coccia under the net can 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:09.130
 be tomorrow you avail yourself therefore 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:13.980
 I believe there may be more cynical English 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.450
 both respect that is as 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.580
 left cig was to attack the 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.140
 spaces then a match too 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.660
 from the changing edition we always create 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.200
 from five six goal balls 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.510
 please sharp and then we can consume 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.950
 goal to make advice can do with 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.950
 palace under constitutional rule 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:48.060
 surely according to life 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.040
 express myself to the fullest 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.360
 thanks to him I'm getting better 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.710
 growing I am precisely rowling 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:07.340
 deepening motels and not sciences al 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:10.340
 from there voted with the first match in 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.340
 game 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.740
 let's say he also had others 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:20.550
 opportunities a little luck a little missed 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.370
 of malice for today we say that he was 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.380
 my day 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.890
 after a really very pop start 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.890
 the sun 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:41.800
 at least so we say from the outside heart 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:44.260
 compared to the beginning but that is not the 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.490
 way exchange of worth is not an alibi 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:53.110
 it has nothing to do also because the role 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:55.120
 4 very expensive but because it happens to you 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.330
 that the ball that comes after it 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.580
 done five six times the field is 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.580
 remained lucid revenged capital
