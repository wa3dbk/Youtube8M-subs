take this screwdriver again because now
this<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.799> slightly<00:01:49.799> raised<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.530> you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this thing is slightly raised up and you

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.420 
this thing is slightly raised up and you
slide<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.220> screwdriver<00:01:54.350> under<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.740> just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
slide this screwdriver under there just

slide this screwdriver under there just
like<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.409> then<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> give<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> little

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
like that and then you give it a little

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
like that and then you give it a little
twist<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.899> then<00:02:01.399> Bing<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:03.450> pop<00:02:03.689> right

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
twist and then Bing that will pop right

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.950 
twist and then Bing that will pop right
out<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.729> easy<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.479> took<00:02:06.750> me

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
out and it's really easy that took me

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.350 
out and it's really easy that took me
about<00:02:07.619> five<00:02:08.039> minutes<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:08.610> first<00:02:08.879> time<00:02:09.119> doing

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
about five minutes my first time doing

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.300 
about five minutes my first time doing
it<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.590> there's<00:02:10.770> one<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> bottom

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it and then there's one on the bottom

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.360 
it and then there's one on the bottom
here

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
here

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
here
this<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.640> you'll<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.690> same<00:02:15.870> thing<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.410> as

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
this one you'll do the same thing so as

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.850 
this one you'll do the same thing so as
a<00:02:16.560> matter<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.770> fact<00:02:16.980> let's<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.820> now
