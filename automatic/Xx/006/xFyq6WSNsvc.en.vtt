00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.780
 Hello everyone, I am a dragon coach. 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.940
 Shenlong aerobics 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.880
 Is a comprehensive aerobic exercise 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.000
 Very helpful for health and slimming 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.880
 Then please relax and follow me. 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.800
 5, 6, 7, go! 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.600
 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, very good 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.000
 Follow it 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.880
 Come to us to implement the first action, shoulder press 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.960
 Come, 5, 6, 7, Go! 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.240
 Because I am very poor since I was a child. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 That exercise can not only make you healthier 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.840
 Then I used to have a congenital problem... 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.980
 The nose is often allergic 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.160
 Perhaps one in three people in Taiwan are the same 

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.145
 I started to like sports. 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.360
 After getting started with professional sports 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.540
 Then I found that this problem has slowly decreased. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.900
 Your own self-confidence, your own body... 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.080
 Own health... 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.960
 And people will get better. 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.400
 Because I was very interested in sports since I was young, then... 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.420
 Look a lot... some foreign videos 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.120
 Some foreign countries are very good physique 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.860
 After I was initially attracted, I decided to... 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.680
 Take good exercise of your body 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.460
 Hey... It’s just because of... 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.380
 Want a good posture 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.860
 So contact fitness 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.700
 Of course, it’s quite unsatisfactory at first, then... 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.240
 After slowly getting results, it continues until now. 

00:01:21.274 --> 00:01:23.274
 Being engaged in fitness is my own... 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.740
 a person who likes sports 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.980
 Then the more intensive movement was for... 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420
 To participate in the bodybuilding competition and start working... 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.760
 More intensive training 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.800
 Continuous training every day at the beginning 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.440
 Slowly after a month, two months, three months... 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.400
 Seeing constant changes in the body 

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:40.536
 At this time, I slowly feel that... 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.540
 Fitness is very interesting 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.860
 Because I am very interested in sports. 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.500
 Because of the introduction through the dragon dragon coach 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 Then slowly start to get in touch with fitness 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.820
 Actually the first month 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.240
 There is already a clear improvement in physical fitness. 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.720
 That three months 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.300
 Will slowly put your own body... 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.980
 Or your own physical fitness can be better 

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.014
 Um... It’s just like the beginning... 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.860
 One thing is to practice, practice yourself... 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.440
 I’m groping like this 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.820
 Then after a professional coach guided me 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.680
 Probably... around half a year 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 I feel that I feel better and better. 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 Fully long before the groping period 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.020
 About a year, that... 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.060
 Later, there are really coaches who are doing guidance. 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140
 After learning some correct postures 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.580
 About three months 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.940
 There is a clear improvement 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.220
 In fact, at the beginning of fitness time 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.020
 Usually one after three months... 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.640
 Intensive training and planning 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.660
 You will pay more attention to your diet, your work and rest. 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.160
 So the opposite is for you... 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.600
 Some of the benefits of life are to say... 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.960
 You may have a regular sleep every day. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.700
 Eat very healthy things 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.480
 That is very helpful for your health. 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.120
 What impressed me the most was the first two weeks. 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.720
 The whole body will be very sore 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.560
 Then behind, to the back... 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.240
 After almost three months 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.920
 Plus diet control 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.780
 The biggest change in the body is the part of the abdomen. 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 Obviously there will be a vest line 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.300
 I used to be sick when I was a child. 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.540
 Then after fitness 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.200
 I don't think it will be so easy to get tired. 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.940
 Then I will go to bed early and get up early. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.620
 It’s also healthy for the body. 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.780
 Change for life... 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.560
 The first and most important thing is of course... 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860
 There is a big difference in heterosexuality 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.260
 If you come again, it is self-confidence for yourself. 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.460
 Just walking is wearing clothes 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.020
 There are also differences for elders. 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.480
 Because the elders will feel that... 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.620
 Wow, it’s hard work... 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.840
 Then the body is well trained, right! 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.680
 Great improvement in life 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.080
 After three months of training every day 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.980
 Look! My arms are getting stronger 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.620
 In addition to getting better 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.220
 Then again, people are healthier and more confident. 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.840
 Shenlong aerobics is a systemic exercise 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.560
 core muscles, 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.220
 Very many compound actions 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.000
 There is simple weight training 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.860
 Then he embraced the upper body, 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.020
 Then the torso, abdomen and your lower body 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.840

 I believe that you can achieve this effect. 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.400
 I believe that 35 minutes 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.080
 Allows you to consume more than a thousand calories 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.260
