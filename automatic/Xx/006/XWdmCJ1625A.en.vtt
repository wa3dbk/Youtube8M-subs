00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
at least now I'm pretty sure this will

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.350 
at least now I'm pretty sure this will
block<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.280> signal<00:00:38.670> I'm<00:00:38.820> they're<00:00:39.120> they're

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
block the signal I'm they're they're

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
block the signal I'm they're they're
very<00:00:39.390> thin<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.500> cards<00:00:40.739> let<00:00:41.040> me<00:00:41.100> show

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
very thin these little cards let me show

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
very thin these little cards let me show
you<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:42.180> sure<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:42.780> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you I'm sure they have some kind of a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590 
you I'm sure they have some kind of a
metal<00:00:43.890> material<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.789> them<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.180> really

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
metal material in them which is really

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420 
metal material in them which is really
all<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.079> need<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
all that you need just a little bit of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.389 
all that you need just a little bit of
metal<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.930> mesh<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:49.800> thinly<00:00:50.129> spread

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
metal in a mesh or very thinly spread

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.850 
metal in a mesh or very thinly spread
out<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.000> will<00:00:51.180> block<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.960> energy

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
out and that will block the energy

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
out and that will block the energy
signal<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.640> needed<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> activate<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
signal that's needed to activate the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.840 
signal that's needed to activate the
RFID<00:00:55.140> chip<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> thin<00:00:56.640> little

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
RFID chip so it's just the thin little

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.950 
RFID chip so it's just the thin little
card<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.239> there's<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> them

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
card and there's two of them

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.939 
card and there's two of them
they're<00:00:59.480> $19.95<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.809> these<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.440> these<00:01:01.590> two

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
they're $19.95 for these for these two

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.429 
they're $19.95 for these for these two
little<00:01:02.280> metal<00:01:02.550> embedded<00:01:02.969> cards<00:01:03.480> anyhow<00:01:04.290> I'm

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
little metal embedded cards anyhow I'm

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620 
little metal embedded cards anyhow I'm
sure<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:06.150> sure<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.510> they

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
sure they I'm I'm very sure that they

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.140 
sure they I'm I'm very sure that they
work<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.920> block<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> signal<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
work and they will block the signal the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.420 
work and they will block the signal the
question<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.740> need<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> worry<00:01:11.340> about

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
question is do you need to worry about

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.060 
question is do you need to worry about
what's<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.900> information<00:01:13.470> could<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.770> gleaned

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
what's what information could be gleaned

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
what's what information could be gleaned
from<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.700> credit<00:01:15.000> cards<00:01:15.299> by<00:01:15.450> somebody<00:01:15.810> with

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
an RFID scanner well let me explain

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
an RFID scanner well let me explain
briefly<00:01:18.540> how<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> works<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.439> credit<00:01:19.770> cards

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
briefly how it works with credit cards

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.570 
briefly how it works with credit cards
the<00:01:20.610> credit<00:01:21.240> cards<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.530> an<00:01:22.680> rfid<00:01:23.340> tag

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the credit cards that have an rfid tag

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
the credit cards that have an rfid tag
of<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.330> look<00:01:24.540> through<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:24.780> wallet<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.380> have

card nearby and it goes into the system
the<00:01:49.740> RFID<00:01:50.189> tag<00:01:50.340> sends<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> code<00:01:51.299> over<00:01:51.570> that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
have to do I don't know what the RFID

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.850 
have to do I don't know what the RFID
credit<00:02:36.900> cards<00:02:37.140> again<00:02:37.320> since<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.650> don't<00:02:37.709> have

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
credit cards again since I don't have

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.340 
credit cards again since I don't have
one<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.760> that's<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.360> included<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> chip

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
one but that's not included in the chip

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.160 
one but that's not included in the chip
so<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.250> chip<00:02:41.459> gives<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> dummy<00:02:42.450> number<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so the chip gives you a dummy number and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.170 
so the chip gives you a dummy number and
that's<00:02:43.650> about<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.340> needs<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that's about it it needs to go with the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.820 
that's about it it needs to go with the
other<00:02:45.330> pieces<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.780> information<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.560> order<00:02:46.680> to

other pieces of information in order to

other pieces of information in order to
complete<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.280> transaction<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.390> I'm<00:02:49.260> not

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
complete the transaction so I'm not

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.400

when I do get some RFID enables credit

all<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> information<00:03:22.980> off<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.760> magnetic

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
all the information off of the magnetic

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.100 
all the information off of the magnetic
stripe<00:03:24.480> or<00:03:24.959> they<00:03:25.670> made<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> actual<00:03:27.510> duplicate

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
stripe or they made a actual duplicate

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.080 
stripe or they made a actual duplicate
of<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.680> mean<00:03:29.160> they<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.340> copied<00:03:29.820> all<00:03:29.940> your

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
of it I mean they just copied all your

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.330 
of it I mean they just copied all your
information<00:03:30.570> your<00:03:30.750> credit<00:03:30.840> card<00:03:31.200> number<00:03:32.160> your

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
information your credit card number your

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.800 
information your credit card number your
name<00:03:32.459> expiration<00:03:33.180> date<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.450> they<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.690> all

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
name expiration date so they have all

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.080 
name expiration date so they have all
that<00:03:33.840> including<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> security<00:03:35.190> code<00:03:35.430> from<00:03:35.730> it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
that including the security code from it

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.020 
that including the security code from it
or<00:03:36.510> what<00:03:36.930> has<00:03:37.110> happened<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.530> me<00:03:37.680> they<00:03:38.040> actually

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
or what has happened to me they actually

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.690 
or what has happened to me they actually
made<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.570> second<00:03:40.080> purchase<00:03:40.410> with<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.160> card<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
made a second purchase with the card and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.910 
made a second purchase with the card and
so<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.480> end<00:03:42.870> up<00:03:43.019> paying<00:03:43.200> for<00:03:43.350> somebody<00:03:43.530> else's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
so you end up paying for somebody else's

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830 
so you end up paying for somebody else's
meal<00:03:44.160> either<00:03:44.810> accidentally<00:03:45.810> or

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
meal either accidentally or

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.650 
meal either accidentally or
intentionally<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:48.150> sort<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.510> thing

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
intentionally so that sort of thing

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.539 
intentionally so that sort of thing
happens<00:03:48.780> all<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.290> time<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.980> kind<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.250> credit

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
happens all the time that kind of credit

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.289 
happens all the time that kind of credit
card<00:03:50.760> fraud<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.709> RFID<00:03:53.220> will<00:03:53.760> actually

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
card fraud and the RFID will actually

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.180 
card fraud and the RFID will actually
probably<00:03:54.570> reduce<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.290> because<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:56.010> go<00:03:56.160> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
probably reduce that because you go to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.340 
probably reduce that because you go to
pay<00:03:56.459> for<00:03:56.850> your<00:03:57.030> meal<00:03:57.239> if<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.750> go<00:03:57.959> up<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.110> the

pay for your meal if you go up to the

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.470 
pay for your meal if you go up to the
front<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.739> just<00:03:58.769> sort<00:03:59.130> of<00:03:59.220> slide<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.299> card

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
front you just sort of slide the card

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.820 
front you just sort of slide the card
around<00:04:00.600> there<00:04:00.870> no<00:04:01.140> no<00:04:01.320> you're<00:04:01.500> gonna<00:04:01.620> get<00:04:01.709> that

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
around there no no you're gonna get that

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.440 
around there no no you're gonna get that
that's<00:04:01.980> my<00:04:02.130> card<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.700> information<00:04:03.360> is

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
that's my card that information is

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.270 
that's my card that information is
already<00:04:03.600> transmitted<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:05.010> enter

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
already transmitted and you enter

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.979 
already transmitted and you enter
whatever<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.790> new<00:04:05.910> transactions<00:04:06.600> complete

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
whatever the new transactions complete

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.430 
whatever the new transactions complete
so<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.560> card<00:04:07.829> never<00:04:08.190> leaves<00:04:08.519> your<00:04:08.880> hand<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:10.200> if

thinnest<00:04:36.150> wallet<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:37.610> they<00:04:38.610> don't<00:04:38.820> make<00:04:39.030> this

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
thinnest wallet and they don't make this

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
exact one with RFID protection I guess

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.210 
exact one with RFID protection I guess
because<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:42.870> material<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:43.620> thin<00:04:44.040> they

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
because this material is so thin they

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.910 
because this material is so thin they
can't<00:04:44.460> get<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:45.420> metal<00:04:45.690> fibers<00:04:46.080> in<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:46.860> I
