00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
think is a must on every single class

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.539 
think is a must on every single class
who<00:01:34.320> use<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.680> game<00:01:34.950> no<00:01:35.159> matter<00:01:35.280> what

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
who use in this game no matter what

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.899 
who use in this game no matter what
that's<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.390> personal<00:01:36.720> opinion<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.290> um

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
that's just my personal opinion but um

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.520 
that's just my personal opinion but um
yeah<00:01:38.909> every<00:01:39.450> single<00:01:39.720> class<00:01:39.869> you'll<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.350> me

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
yeah every single class you'll see me

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.990 
yeah every single class you'll see me
use<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.130> toughness<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.610> dexterity

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
use will have toughness or dexterity

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.679 
use will have toughness or dexterity
that's<00:01:42.270> almost<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.689> guarantee<00:01:43.909> one<00:01:44.909> important

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that's almost a guarantee one important

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.969 
that's almost a guarantee one important
thing<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.869> notice<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.320> well<00:01:46.500> about<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.799> class

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
thing to notice as well about this class

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.399 
thing to notice as well about this class
I<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.310> c4<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.880> EMP<00:01:48.090> grenade<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
I have c4 and EMP grenade on it what is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.850 
I have c4 and EMP grenade on it what is
most<00:01:49.530> important<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:52.500> I've

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
most important about this is that I've

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460 
most important about this is that I've
scavenger<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.320> mistake

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
scavenger and one thing that one mistake

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
scavenger and one thing that one mistake
I<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:55.740> people<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.399> never<00:01:56.729> really

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I see people make that I never really

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.749 
I see people make that I never really
understood<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.570> running<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.759> equipment

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
understood is running a equipment

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.179 
understood is running a equipment
without<00:02:00.060> scavenger<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:00.990> about<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.860> can

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
without scavenger think about it you can

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
without scavenger think about it you can
and<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:03.149> previous<00:02:03.630> games<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.020> black<00:02:04.170> ops<00:02:04.350> 1

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and in previous games like black ops 1

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.840 
and in previous games like black ops 1
for<00:02:04.649> example<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> cannot<00:02:05.340> replenish<00:02:05.820> that

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
for example you cannot replenish that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.059 
for example you cannot replenish that
equipment<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.540> scavenger<00:02:06.990> however<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.890> this

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
equipment with scavenger however in this

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.710 
equipment with scavenger however in this
game<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.879> long<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.479> kill

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
game you can as long as you get the kill

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.119 
game you can as long as you get the kill
you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.020> pick<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.410> scavenger<00:02:10.649> Peck<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you can pick up that scavenger Peck and

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.610 
you can pick up that scavenger Peck and
replenish<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.000> seafoam<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.599> EMP

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
replenish that seafoam the EMP

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
replenish that seafoam the EMP
what<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.799> do<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.670> Chuck<00:02:15.120> EMPs<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
what I do is I just Chuck EMPs and I

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.809 
what I do is I just Chuck EMPs and I
just<00:02:16.349> get<00:02:16.530> hit<00:02:16.680> markers<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> you're<00:02:17.430> not

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
just get hit markers and you're not

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.490 
just get hit markers and you're not
really<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> actual<00:02:19.049> purpose<00:02:19.409> of

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
really going for the actual purpose of

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500 
really going for the actual purpose of
the<00:02:19.560> EMP<00:02:19.890> which<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.190> quite<00:02:20.370> minimal<00:02:20.549> I'm<00:02:21.150> going

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the EMP which is quite minimal I'm going

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.390 
the EMP which is quite minimal I'm going
for<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:21.690> EMP<00:02:22.080> assists<00:02:22.590> because<00:02:22.980> when<00:02:23.159> you<00:02:23.250> saw

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
for the EMP assists because when you saw

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.630 
for the EMP assists because when you saw
an<00:02:23.549> EMP<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.750> pretty<00:02:25.019> much<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.640> large

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
an EMP you can pretty much a large

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.280 
an EMP you can pretty much a large
portion<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.239> map<00:02:27.390> will<00:02:27.659> be<00:02:27.870> covered<00:02:28.260> by

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
portion of the map will be covered by

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.559 
portion of the map will be covered by
the<00:02:28.440> EMP<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.580> lasts<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.909> 15<00:02:30.180> seconds

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the EMP and that lasts for 15 seconds

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.000 
the EMP and that lasts for 15 seconds
and<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.810> being<00:02:30.989> said<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.440> easily<00:02:31.709> get

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and that being said you can easily get

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030 
and that being said you can easily get
EMP<00:02:32.370> assists<00:02:32.849> which<00:02:33.000> are<00:02:33.180> 50<00:02:33.540> score<00:02:33.870> each<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
EMP assists which are 50 score each and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.110 
EMP assists which are 50 score each and
that<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.310> quite<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.549> bit<00:02:35.700> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.879> think<00:02:36.060> about

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that is quite a bit if you think about

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.690 
that is quite a bit if you think about
it<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.500> keep<00:02:37.650> chucking<00:02:37.860> c4s<00:02:38.430> because

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
it and I just keep chucking c4s because

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.250 
it and I just keep chucking c4s because
every<00:02:39.030> time<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.239> get<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> kill<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:39.989> over<00:02:40.140> that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
every time I get a kill I go over that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.649 
every time I get a kill I go over that
scavenger<00:02:40.500> peck<00:02:40.829> and<00:02:41.010> get<00:02:41.489> more<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.060> one<00:02:42.420> out

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
scavenger peck and get more so one out

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.380 
scavenger peck and get more so one out
of<00:02:42.690> your<00:02:42.959> 10<00:02:43.170> allocated<00:02:43.709> points41<00:02:44.390> EMP

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
of your 10 allocated points41 EMP

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.180 
of your 10 allocated points41 EMP
grenade<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:46.049> worth<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.739> not<00:02:46.980> worth

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
grenade is not worth it it's not worth

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.849 
grenade is not worth it it's not worth
it<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.900> can<00:02:49.079> get<00:02:49.260> pretty<00:02:49.500> much<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.799> a

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
it but if you can get pretty much in a

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.229 
it but if you can get pretty much in a
limited<00:02:50.160> amount<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.730> will<00:02:50.819> last<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
limited amount that will last you the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.330 
limited amount that will last you the
whole<00:02:51.629> game<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:51.989> long<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.220> know

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
running scavenger and staying active

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.930 
running scavenger and staying active
around<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> map<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:56.129> definitely<00:02:56.400> worth<00:02:56.790> in

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
around the map it is definitely worth in

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.729 
around the map it is definitely worth in
my<00:02:57.060> opinion<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.510> guys<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.379> what<00:02:58.560> my
