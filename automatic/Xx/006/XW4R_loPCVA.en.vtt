kind<00:00:40.300> of<00:00:40.890> music<00:00:41.890> that<00:00:42.160> no<00:00:42.700> one<00:00:42.880> could<00:00:43.059> possibly

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
kind of music that no one could possibly

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.170 
kind of music that no one could possibly
enjoy<00:00:43.840> but<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:45.190> take<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.550> very<00:00:45.820> symbolic

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180

approach<00:00:46.450> to<00:00:46.870> this<00:00:47.020> piece<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.770> think<00:00:48.010> it

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
approach to this piece and I think it

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.280 
approach to this piece and I think it
would<00:00:48.190> sound<00:00:48.370> really<00:00:48.790> well<00:00:49.000> on<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:50.110> Longwood

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
would sound really well on the Longwood

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.799 
would sound really well on the Longwood
Gardens<00:00:50.470> organ<00:00:51.160> plus<00:00:51.520> it's<00:00:52.360> a<00:00:52.420> really<00:00:52.629> great

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
Gardens organ plus it's a really great

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.290 
Gardens organ plus it's a really great
piece<00:00:52.989> people<00:00:53.800> should<00:00:54.070> know<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.580> it's<00:00:55.150> not

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
piece people should know it and it's not

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
piece people should know it and it's not
performed<00:00:55.720> nearly<00:00:56.050> enough

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.410 

I<00:01:06.080> thought<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.410> would<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:08.130> work<00:01:09.090> well

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I thought that it would really work well

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.170 
I thought that it would really work well
on<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.080> Longwood<00:01:10.380> Gardens<00:01:10.790> Oregon<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.970> I've

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
on the Longwood Gardens Oregon and I've

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.730 
on the Longwood Gardens Oregon and I've
actually<00:01:12.360> been<00:01:12.630> wanting<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:12.990> play<00:01:13.230> it<00:01:13.410> on<00:01:13.650> an

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
actually been wanting to play it on an

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.030 
actually been wanting to play it on an
organ<00:01:14.160> like<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.150> while<00:01:15.710> because<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
organ like that for a while because I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.680 
organ like that for a while because I
think<00:01:17.160> that<00:01:17.750> there's<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> many<00:01:20.690> opportunities

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
think that there's so many opportunities

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
think that there's so many opportunities
to<00:01:21.720> bring<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.550> layers<00:01:23.550> of<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.120> counterpoint

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
to bring out layers of the counterpoint

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.730 
to bring out layers of the counterpoint
lots<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> solos<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.930> lots<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.080> orchestral

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
lots of solos and lots of orchestral

00:01:28.740 --> 00:02:05.300 
lots of solos and lots of orchestral
effects<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> work<00:01:29.760> itself

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.620 

I<00:02:07.489> chose<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.729> come<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> Houston<00:02:09.750> because<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
I chose to come to Houston because the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.780 
I chose to come to Houston because the
professor<00:02:12.630> I'd<00:02:12.810> wanted<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.410> study<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:13.950> moved

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.970 
professor I'd wanted to study with moved
here<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.930> was<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> professor<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.860> then

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.660 
here so it was the professor and then
also<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.610> incredible<00:02:18.330> worgen<00:02:19.280> said<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> get

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
also this incredible worgen said I get

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.449 
also this incredible worgen said I get

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
to practice on all the time the space

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.780 
to practice on all the time the space
itself<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.989> also<00:02:25.830> really<00:02:26.280> incredible<00:02:26.730> because

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
itself is also really incredible because

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.009 
itself is also really incredible because
they<00:02:27.510> create<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.680> huge<00:02:29.040> sonic<00:02:29.760> space<00:02:30.569> and

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
they create this huge sonic space and

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.670 
they create this huge sonic space and
such<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> small<00:02:32.310> physical<00:02:32.760> space<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.840> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
such a small physical space and it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.920 
such a small physical space and it
really<00:02:35.190> feels<00:02:35.489> like<00:02:35.790> when<00:02:36.030> you're<00:02:36.209> when<00:02:36.840> you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000
