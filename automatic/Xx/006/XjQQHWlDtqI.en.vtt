occasionally<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.769> seems<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.160> me<00:02:42.250> that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
occasionally it just seems to me that

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.729 
occasionally it just seems to me that
I'm<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.700> only<00:02:42.820> person<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.450> miles<00:02:43.630> around<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
I'm the only person for miles around and

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.710 
I'm the only person for miles around and
that's<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.340> special<00:02:45.519> feeling<00:02:45.910> especially<00:02:46.510> in

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that's a special feeling especially in

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.300 
that's a special feeling especially in
the<00:02:46.870> early<00:02:47.410> 21st<00:02:47.890> century<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:49.980> know<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.220> my

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the early 21st century I know that my

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.620 
the early 21st century I know that my
parents<00:02:51.340> first<00:02:51.850> brought<00:02:52.090> me<00:02:52.120> here<00:02:52.360> when<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.600> was

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
parents first brought me here when I was

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.229 
parents first brought me here when I was
six<00:02:52.900> months<00:02:53.049> old<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:54.280> essentially<00:02:55.150> I've

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
six months old and essentially I've

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.820 
six months old and essentially I've
spent<00:02:55.480> my<00:02:55.600> entire<00:02:55.630> adult<00:02:56.200> life<00:02:56.380> here<00:02:56.709> in

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
spent my entire adult life here in

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.030 
spent my entire adult life here in
Yellowstone<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.610> don't<00:02:58.420> know<00:02:58.480> if<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.630> believe<00:02:58.900> in

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
Yellowstone I don't know if I believe in

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.500 
Yellowstone I don't know if I believe in
destiny<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.549> general<00:03:00.850> sense<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> do

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
destiny in a general sense but I do

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.030 
destiny in a general sense but I do
believe<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.049> was<00:03:02.140> my<00:03:02.260> destiny<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.739> come

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
believe that it was my destiny to come

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.280 
believe that it was my destiny to come
here<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.459> spend<00:03:03.730> most<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.030> my<00:03:04.090> life<00:03:04.329> here

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
here and to spend most of my life here

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.080 
here and to spend most of my life here
because<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.129> work<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.430> do<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.849> winter

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
because of the work I do in the winter

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.240 
because of the work I do in the winter
here<00:03:07.269> I've<00:03:07.480> had<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> special<00:03:08.650> opportunity<00:03:08.920> I

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
here I've had a special opportunity I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.490 
here I've had a special opportunity I
think<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.640> make<00:03:09.849> empirical<00:03:10.500> observations

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
think to make empirical observations

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.190 
think to make empirical observations
about<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.819> way<00:03:12.940> things<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.269> gone<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:13.870> terms

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
about the way things have gone in terms

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.830 
about the way things have gone in terms
of<00:03:14.409> winter<00:03:14.620> weather<00:03:14.830> in<00:03:15.010> Yellowstone<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:16.269> don't

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
of winter weather in Yellowstone I don't

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.210 
of winter weather in Yellowstone I don't
think<00:03:16.959> there<00:03:17.049> was<00:03:17.140> any<00:03:17.260> question<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:18.010> things

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
think there was any question that things

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.009 
think there was any question that things
are<00:03:18.370> warmer<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.760> drier<00:03:19.180> overall<00:03:19.690> than<00:03:19.900> they

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
are warmer and drier overall than they

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.220 
are warmer and drier overall than they
were<00:03:20.080> when<00:03:20.349> I<00:03:20.409> first<00:03:20.590> got<00:03:20.830> here

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
were when I first got here

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.650 
were when I first got here
I've<00:03:23.230> always<00:03:23.410> been<00:03:24.060> dreading<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.269> day<00:03:25.420> when<00:03:25.629> I

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
I've always been dreading the day when I

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.289 
I've always been dreading the day when I
got<00:03:25.840> too<00:03:26.049> old<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.379> do<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.879> but<00:03:27.879> over<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> last

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
got too old to do this but over the last

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.869 
got too old to do this but over the last
10<00:03:28.569> years<00:03:28.599> or<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.260> seemed<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.879> maybe

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
10 years or so it seemed that maybe

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.670 
10 years or so it seemed that maybe
Yellowstone<00:03:31.750> would<00:03:31.870> run<00:03:31.989> out<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.230> snow<00:03:32.470> before

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
Yellowstone would run out of snow before

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.979 
Yellowstone would run out of snow before
I<00:03:32.860> got<00:03:33.040> too<00:03:33.250> old<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.549> move<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.849> there's<00:03:34.750> good

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
I got too old to move it there's good

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.869 
I got too old to move it there's good
snow<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.409> year<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.950> certainly<00:03:36.519> hope<00:03:36.760> it

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
snow this year so I certainly hope it

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.270 
snow this year so I certainly hope it
continues<00:03:37.680> certainly<00:03:38.680> hope<00:03:38.829> there's<00:03:39.040> snow<00:03:39.220> to

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
continues certainly hope there's snow to

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.920 
continues certainly hope there's snow to
move<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.730> Yellowstone<00:03:40.030> long<00:03:40.299> after<00:03:40.629> I'm<00:03:40.780> not

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
move and Yellowstone long after I'm not

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.220 
move and Yellowstone long after I'm not
able<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.200> do<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:41.379> anymore<00:03:42.720> we'll<00:03:43.720> see<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:43.930> guess

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
able to do it anymore we'll see I guess

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.039 
able to do it anymore we'll see I guess
I<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.340> challenge<00:03:48.730> when<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:48.879> first<00:03:49.180> climb

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
I like the challenge when I first climb

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.420 
I like the challenge when I first climb
up<00:03:50.230> onto<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.560> roof<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.859> take<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.190> first

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
up onto the roof and take that first

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.009 
up onto the roof and take that first
block<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.760> snow<00:03:52.000> off<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.660> then<00:03:52.810> when<00:03:52.930> they

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
block of snow off and then when they

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.720 
block of snow off and then when they
take<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.290> last<00:03:53.500> block<00:03:53.829> off<00:03:54.129> a<00:03:54.160> roof<00:03:54.489> I

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
take the last block off a roof I

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.180 
take the last block off a roof I
certainly<00:03:55.359> feel<00:03:55.569> a<00:03:55.629> sense<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.260> satisfaction<00:03:56.440> I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
certainly feel a sense of satisfaction I

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.460 
certainly feel a sense of satisfaction I
also<00:03:57.910> immediately<00:03:58.629> start<00:03:58.959> thinking<00:03:58.989> about

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
also immediately start thinking about

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.080 
also immediately start thinking about
next<00:03:59.650> season<00:03:59.890> when<00:04:00.340> I'll<00:04:00.549> be<00:04:00.640> able<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.819> do<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
next season when I'll be able to do the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.580 
next season when I'll be able to do the
same<00:04:01.239> building<00:04:01.599> again<00:04:03.989> you'll<00:04:04.989> still<00:04:05.319> always

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
same building again you'll still always

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:32.710 
same building again you'll still always
be<00:04:05.739> my<00:04:06.370> special<00:04:06.790> place

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.780 

you
