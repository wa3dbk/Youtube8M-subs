fan<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.340> red<00:02:52.580> shoes<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.840> these<00:02:54.140> words<00:02:54.920> were<00:02:55.010> a

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
fan of red shoes so these words were a

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.670 
fan of red shoes so these words were a
no-brainer<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.850> guess<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:56.960> similar<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.380> this

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
no-brainer I guess it's similar to this

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.600 
no-brainer I guess it's similar to this
one<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.930> official<00:02:59.930> name<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.350> one<00:03:00.650> it's

challenge to this what's called the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.900 
challenge to this what's called the
hybrid<00:03:07.730> um<00:03:08.740> I'll<00:03:09.740> know<00:03:09.950> too<00:03:10.130> much<00:03:10.250> about<00:03:10.460> bone

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
hybrid um I'll know too much about bone

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.140 
hybrid um I'll know too much about bone
but<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:12.350> see<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:12.830> resemblance<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.790> only<00:03:13.970> thing

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
but I see the resemblance the only thing

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.300 
but I see the resemblance the only thing
i<00:03:14.240> could<00:03:14.300> see<00:03:14.660> different<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:16.040> swoosh

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
i could see different is that the swoosh

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.940 
i could see different is that the swoosh
is<00:03:16.610> missing<00:03:17.330> on<00:03:17.390> this<00:03:17.570> one<00:03:17.810> instead<00:03:18.740> of<00:03:18.800> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
is missing on this one instead of the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.890 
is missing on this one instead of the
swash<00:03:19.190> detection<00:03:19.610> just<00:03:19.790> put<00:03:19.940> nike<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.480> they

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
swash detection just put nike and they

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.440 
swash detection just put nike and they
put<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.110> little<00:03:21.290> mini<00:03:21.560> swoosh<00:03:21.860> on<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> side<00:03:22.450> but

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
put a little mini swoosh on the side but

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.790 
put a little mini swoosh on the side but
other<00:03:23.630> than<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.350> pretty<00:03:24.530> much<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
other than that this is pretty much the

other than that this is pretty much the
same<00:03:25.220> for<00:03:26.060> when<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.210> could<00:03:26.390> tell<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.750> same<00:03:26.960> type

same type of material when i'ma terribly
same<00:03:30.260> style<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.510> just<00:03:32.510> they<00:03:33.020> switch<00:03:33.260> the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
same style to it just they switch the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.450 
same style to it just they switch the
nike<00:03:33.740> swoosh<00:03:33.980> with<00:03:34.190> actual<00:03:34.490> nike<00:03:34.790> leg<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:36.460> I

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
nike swoosh with actual nike leg and I

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.390 
nike swoosh with actual nike leg and I
guess<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.300> back<00:03:38.510> piece<00:03:38.810> right<00:03:39.110> here<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:40.340> a

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
guess the back piece right here it's a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.220 
guess the back piece right here it's a
little<00:03:40.490> different<00:03:40.760> but<00:03:41.750> other<00:03:41.900> than<00:03:42.020> then

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
little different but other than then

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.360 
little different but other than then
it's<00:03:42.380> pretty<00:03:42.560> much<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.740> same<00:03:43.010> show

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.480 

on<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.520> tongue<00:03:47.780> also<00:03:48.780> different<00:03:49.140> tongues<00:03:49.490> one

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
on the tongue also different tongues one

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.000 
on the tongue also different tongues one
says<00:03:50.760> nike<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.750> says<00:03:51.960> like<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.590> fireball

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
says nike one just says like a fireball

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.500 
says nike one just says like a fireball
I<00:03:53.370> guess<00:03:53.550> it's<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:53.850> one<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.090> Mario's

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
I guess it's like one of Mario's

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.380 
I guess it's like one of Mario's
fireballs<00:03:55.430> but<00:03:56.430> pretty<00:03:56.850> much<00:03:56.940> there's<00:03:57.240> not

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
fireballs but pretty much there's not

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.460 
fireballs but pretty much there's not
much<00:03:57.600> difference<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:58.230> one<00:03:59.000> but<00:04:00.200> back<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.350> the

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
much difference to one but back to the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.650 
much difference to one but back to the
