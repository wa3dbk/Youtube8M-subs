00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
some classes of course we'll be able to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.149 
some classes of course we'll be able to
remove<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.120> slow<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:04.080> fief<00:01:04.379> however<00:01:04.769> can't

amount considering you know the level of
this<00:01:28.500> farming<00:01:28.920> location<00:01:29.400> obviously<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
this farming location obviously this

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
this farming location obviously this
won't<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> good<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.990> level<00:01:31.200> 80<00:01:31.409> players

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
won't be that good for level 80 players

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.609 
won't be that good for level 80 players
but<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.549> people<00:01:32.850> below<00:01:33.329> level<00:01:34.110> 80<00:01:34.290> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
but for people below level 80 it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
but for people below level 80 it's
definitely<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> best<00:01:35.700> farming

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
definitely one of the best farming

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.990
