so<00:01:32.040> yeah<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:33.290> sensor<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.500> bank<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so yeah that's sensor one bank one is

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.890 
so yeah that's sensor one bank one is
defective<00:01:36.470> do<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> code<00:01:38.659> sensor<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
defective do you have a code sensor to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
defective do you have a code sensor to
bank<00:01:40.259> 2<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> post<00:01:41.100> cat<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
bank 2 that's the post cat that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.380 
bank 2 that's the post cat that
basically<00:01:42.180> monitors<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:44.390> catalytic

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
basically monitors the catalytic

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.010 
basically monitors the catalytic
converter<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.200> bank<00:01:46.860> 1<00:01:47.159> sensor<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:48.180> bank<00:01:48.750> two

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
converter so bank 1 sensor one bank two

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
converter so bank 1 sensor one bank two
sensor<00:01:49.439> 2<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.740> both<00:01:49.770> bad<00:01:50.250> those<00:01:51.030> need<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> be

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
sensor 2 are both bad those need to be

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.050 
sensor 2 are both bad those need to be
replaced<00:01:51.869> now<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:52.979> news<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:54.530> oil<00:01:55.530> boy

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
replaced now the good news is oil boy

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.709 
replaced now the good news is oil boy
this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.710> sensor<00:01:58.710> 2<00:01:58.920> bank<00:01:59.250> 2<00:01:59.549> my<00:02:00.030> motto<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.509> save

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
this is sensor 2 bank 2 my motto is save

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.929 
this is sensor 2 bank 2 my motto is save
your<00:02:00.899> doe<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.040> kicking<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> code<00:02:02.729> yet

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
your doe it's not kicking out a code yet

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.800 
your doe it's not kicking out a code yet
it<00:02:03.060> still<00:02:03.240> works<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.820> pre<00:02:06.450> cat

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it still works and you have the pre cat

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.059 
it still works and you have the pre cat
which<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.160> sensor<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.479> bank<00:02:09.479> two<00:02:09.979> kind<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
which is sensor one bank two kind of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.380 
which is sensor one bank two kind of
tough<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.849> probably<00:02:12.120> good<00:02:12.239> thing

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
tough to get to it's probably good thing

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.990 
tough to get to it's probably good thing
whatever

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
whatever

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.960 
whatever
that<00:02:13.180> guy<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:14.640> here<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.260> way<00:02:17.260> up<00:02:17.530> there<00:02:17.970> I'm

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
that guy so here it is way up there I'm

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.190 
that guy so here it is way up there I'm
not<00:02:19.150> going<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.390> get<00:02:19.510> my<00:02:19.600> laser<00:02:19.870> pointer<00:02:19.900> out

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
not going to get my laser pointer out

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720 
not going to get my laser pointer out
because<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.500> barely<00:02:20.770> hold<00:02:21.010> my<00:02:21.130> head<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.310> there

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
because I barely hold my head up there

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.080 
because I barely hold my head up there
so<00:02:22.210> that's<00:02:22.390> sensor<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.110> Bank<00:02:26.130> sensor<00:02:27.130> one<00:02:27.370> bank

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
so that's sensor to Bank sensor one bank

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.910 
so that's sensor to Bank sensor one bank
-<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.220> sensor<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.840> bank<00:02:31.840> -<00:02:32.290> so

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
- and this is sensor to bank - so

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.120 
- and this is sensor to bank - so
basically<00:02:33.880> both<00:02:34.690> OH<00:02:34.990> two<00:02:35.200> sensors<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
basically both OH two sensors on the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.250 
basically both OH two sensors on the
right<00:02:36.280> hand<00:02:36.490> side<00:02:36.610> need<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.570> be<00:02:37.660> replaced

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
right hand side need to be replaced

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.410 
right hand side need to be replaced
so<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.709> would<00:02:39.040> get<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.400> an<00:02:39.490> estimate<00:02:39.850> soon<00:02:40.120> and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
so I would get you an estimate soon and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.930 
so I would get you an estimate soon and
for<00:02:41.200> now<00:02:41.410> race<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.010> rob<00:02:42.160> out<00:02:42.340> because<00:02:42.550> my<00:02:42.730> next

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
for now race to rob out because my next

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.920 
for now race to rob out because my next
killing<00:02:43.360> me<00:02:43.570> later<00:02:44.290> by
