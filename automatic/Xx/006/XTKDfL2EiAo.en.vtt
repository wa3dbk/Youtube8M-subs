out but um i wrote some on this app but

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.509 
out but um i wrote some on this app but
there<00:00:23.699> will<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> sidebar<00:00:24.619> now<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
there will be in the sidebar now if you

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.310 
there will be in the sidebar now if you
notice<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> side<00:00:27.570> bulb<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.289> i

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
notice on the side bulb is going to be i

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.720 
notice on the side bulb is going to be i
think<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.859> three<00:00:29.310> more<00:00:29.550> sources<00:00:30.920> then<00:00:31.920> um<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
think of three more sources then um the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.750 
think of three more sources then um the
ones<00:00:32.940> right<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.730> actually<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
ones right here it's because actually I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
ones right here it's because actually I
think<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.210> two<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> sources<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.890> don't

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
think on two of the sources they don't

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.030 
think on two of the sources they don't
work<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> um<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.930> ones<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> didn't<00:00:43.680> put<00:00:43.860> on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
work so um the ones that I didn't put on

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.180 
work so um the ones that I didn't put on
my<00:00:44.100> best<00:00:44.430> bet<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.360> work<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> if

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
my best bet that they don't work so if

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
my best bet that they don't work so if
you<00:00:47.340> figure<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.020> them<00:00:49.140> don't

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you figure out that on one of them don't

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.549 
you figure out that on one of them don't
work<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.670> delete<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.559> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
work or two of them just delete it so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
work or two of them just delete it so
first<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> rib<00:00:53.489> dead<00:00:53.730> souls<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
first one is the rib dead souls that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.560 
first one is the rib dead souls that
comes<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> installer<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.120> big<00:00:57.329> boss
