00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 ahoy of performer that's cabin 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.010
 12.200 3 and that's the biggest cabin 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 on board 54 square meters and that is it 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 a panorama deluxe suite and has 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.860
 It's really something we look at ourselves 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.630
 now exactly 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.460
 From the outside, that's what I see 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.810
 relatively inconspicuous because you still suspect 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 Not at all what this one special 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.850
 Incidentally, the cabin is always new 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.580
 here also inscription in braille 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 outside of it since the manufacturer so here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.500
 weird in the living area that is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.350
 then a real time, there is now 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.280
 here, too, space for an otherwise 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.800
 the place is not really that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.800
 available for such a real sofa here 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.530
 just with this table you too 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 misuse as can as a stool the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 here will want to do sports can 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.700
 I use this power plate here now 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 have done that somewhere 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.000
 is getting used to that vibrates 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.070
 then there but okay okay then we look 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.739
 Let's go further, there is one 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.140
 tv if i say a tv 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 then there is another here 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 I now have all the possibilities 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.530
 I only have a view for example 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 games console game I have this here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.710
 the atv can retrieve e-mails and so on 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.049
 I also have a dock for this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.759
 smartphone 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.830
 and I have that's the normal 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.720
 cabins are not the case 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
 a minibar but that is not here 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.759
 obviously close here is first 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.439
 still the stereo system so who cds with 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.890
 Who would like to take her on vacation? 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.030
 has more storage space and is here 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.200
 maybe I have to have the minibar myself 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.340
 First of all, I think because I search 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.070
 here are the glasses 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.700
 Here is also the card which costs 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.930
 the minibar is 43 eur 10 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.350
 bionade 240 apple juice 190 you can 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.219
 recently also order wine 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.469
 bottle by the will then on the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.619
 Cabin delivered or lifted in this 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.409
 deluxe suite or just pizza 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.099
 so here we look there you can 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.410
 to finish him even feel 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.410
 this place with mirror and now 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.410
 lookouts 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.130
 this is this panoramic view that is 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.230
 really the hammer 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.940
 So I think that's the most beautiful 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.630
 view is the one here from a cabin 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.130
 may have 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.280
 it's going even further because we now yes 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.500
 go now we see it again 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.180
 Let's take a look again so that's it 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.130
 Here almost the look of the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.440
 captain only had a little bit of one 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.250
 of course, now we are 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.940
 here in the sleeping area yes up here can 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.860
 then you omit the blackout 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.630
 that 's once the whole here is that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 the rollo and here is not only 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.870
 somehow any art but you 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.990
 cognition maybe already in style 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.480
 this is a picture of rizzi and over there 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.990
 on the other side of the bed 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.880
 there is a second bed 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.020
 Again , they are quite similar to those 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.150
 on the normal cabins 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.400
 here is a second one 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.920
 Watch TV as you watch TV 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 because he does not want to action 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.290
 on the ship that is right here 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.120
 so now we look in the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.830
 wet area where you can even here 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.790
 say that's not just a bathroom 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.340
 rear neck area 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.500
 that's bigger than me at home 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.860
 With a bathtub I can completely 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.980
 Relaxed taking a bath is so and here 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.890
 now even a fresh flower so 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.990
 really really pretty and here 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.320
 I even get a choice 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.810
 care products shampoo and so on 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.750
 So better products than that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.170
 this very simple shower gel was up 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.660
 somehow in the other cabins purchase 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.700
 the shower in the shower is like that and 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.870
 this is no ordinary shower 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.060
 but that is a wellness shower yes 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.959
 that is, who has done something like that is 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.630
 really very pleasant so now 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.860
 the whole thing still a back exit 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.989
 yes So first here's the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.450
 Toilet and the advantage is I can 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.920
 here is this this partition wall then too 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.549
 that means one can relax in peace 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.319
 the rest of the toilet can go 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.239
 lying in the bathtub is not a problem 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:22.610
 that's why there are the two here 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.319
 doors so now again the view 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.919
 here on the cabinets being here too 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:31.120
 is still a game and yes in these 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:34.220
 There is really a lot of space for a cupboard 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.620
 so who here for two for two on itself 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.389
 field or so I can believe that here 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.020
 also a world trip with 86 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.180
 make days 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.159
 and of course that's crucial 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.889
 We were with the balcony and look 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:50.479
 Of course this is really huge here 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.610
 we have really right times 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.530
 which of course otherwise in the normal 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.009
 balcony cabins is not possible but 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.770
 here we have two lie and there still 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:05.150
 22 chairs really really right 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.979
 a lot of space and yes you have a great 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.469
 look from here so i would say in 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.729
 this height so it's not better yes 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.620
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.090
 look at the others 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.110
 videos I made of the 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.729
 I have aida stella now 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.379
 linked and otherwise subscribed to the 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.379
 canal until next time bye
