00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.890
 good first some notions of security 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.360
 when you go to work under the 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 car 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.270
 fit the wheel that gives more weight to 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.920
 endure as is the front of the 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.920
 co-pilot in this case that raised 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.930
 wood and you give yourself a hammer blow 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:29.740
 to mint first before putting him 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:37.739
 the looking weight came out earlier in the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.739
 patios the problem we have after a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.140
 work to take away the burden and to 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 what 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.930
 just in case the cat fails you can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.730
 put an easel these are from those of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.860
 two easels twelve euros that does not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.050
 missing more puÃ±eta nor more history 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.880
 and distribute the weight between the two and what 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.320
 you are carefully placing the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.980
 problem we have had this time good 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.580
 then car 35 years must and so many years 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.140
 29 years with the same tube escape 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.540
 have these problems 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.930
 here is a reinforcement you see the cut that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.590
 goes up and down and you see here below 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.900
 is a bit black where gas comes out 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.210
 weld has been opened this was welded 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.110
 I went up with acetylene, I'm going to 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.800
 welding with him and this has happened to me weighs 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.450
 much 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.200
 vibrates 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.549
 already the vibrations of the engine has 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.280
 cracked like tin coal 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:53.450
 coca-cola there was a small crack here 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:55.789
 has rotated above this is stress 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.240
 of the material if it were rotten 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.179
 the hole appears and a hole is made 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.539
 and it rots and kashkari is not 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:09.520
 rotten what is is stress to the 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.520
 material endeavored by 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.959
 this rubber is pretty decent is not 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.959
 very inhabited 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.720
 the rubber is past has been stretched more 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.349
 of what touches and has become longer and 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.079
 the to escape picks up from the side 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.329
 It takes off from medium to be firm like this 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.980
 pick up from the side and when picking up 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:52.560
 the pipe escape from medium to stand firm 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.299
 what happens the tube twists and as not 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.220
 you can twist where the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.760
 welds began making a grid 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.540
 the good shout you have to do is take out 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.400
 open here is there 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.280
 the tube when I will have it more advanced and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.920
 out is to record another video of how 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.370
 let's solve 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.439
 I have a plate of this, this is a plate 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.890
 but mine is a pretty enough 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.890
 more radio 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.970
 because it would put here below is not convenient 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.070
 put on the plates for the clouds and if 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.350
 poke some tip or something by 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.620
 below and I saw it on tv we would be forced to 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.450
 change the exhaust pipe and is not flat 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.640
 this is convenient to fix it because 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.640
 if not or distract problems in the rest 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.870
 of pipes well I'll start to 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.870
 work that if we do not do nothing
