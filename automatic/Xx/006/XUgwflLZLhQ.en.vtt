 I will tell you how to recover the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.870
 option to share data in our 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.360
 iphone commonly this problem is given 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.840
 every time we update the system 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.430
 operative and some of the cases 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.420
 it turns out that we must communicate with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.910

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.850
 as we can see here in settings 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.390
 the option to share appears 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:39.060
 internet or share data this we're going 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.380
 to perform on an iphone 5 s 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.690
 good 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.220

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.000
 Mobile data 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.490

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.410
 observe mobile data is active 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.840
 at this time 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.390
 but we do not see the option of 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.200
 share in what we're going to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.520
 network configurations and as we see 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.420
