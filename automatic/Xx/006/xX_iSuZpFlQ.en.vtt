00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
actual top of the crafting grid it's

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.049 
actual top of the crafting grid it's
just<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.109> GUI<00:00:31.740> inside<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> box<00:00:32.640> which

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
just like this GUI inside the box which

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.580 
just like this GUI inside the box which
is<00:00:33.239> pretty<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
is pretty much what it is and then you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.860 
is pretty much what it is and then you
craft<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.430> item<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.120> functional<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> bit

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
craft the item it's functional but a bit

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
craft the item it's functional but a bit
boring<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.980> while<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.190> mod<00:00:38.399> does<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
boring and so while this mod does is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
boring and so while this mod does is
adds<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.910> new<00:00:39.030> item<00:00:39.210> which<00:00:39.480> makes<00:00:39.690> Dee<00:00:39.899> crafting

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
adds a new item which makes Dee crafting

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.410 
adds a new item which makes Dee crafting
more<00:00:40.500> realistic<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.129> visually<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> it's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
more realistic and visually and it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.940 
more realistic and visually and it's
also<00:00:42.540> more<00:00:42.840> useful<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.620> I'll<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
also more useful but I'll get into that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250 
also more useful but I'll get into that
later<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.760> first<00:00:45.000> off<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.420> actually<00:00:45.690> craft<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
later so first off to actually craft the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
later so first off to actually craft the
crafting<00:00:46.710> pillar<00:00:46.920> you're<00:00:47.430> gonna<00:00:47.520> need<00:00:47.670> six

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
grid so if I wanted to put to cobble

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.240 
grid so if I wanted to put to cobble
there<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.530> cobble<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.070> just

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
there to cobble there you just

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.310 
there to cobble there you just
right-click<00:01:59.430> twice<00:01:59.850> until<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.110> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
right-click twice until you can see it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440 
right-click twice until you can see it
renders<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> stack<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.670> items<00:02:03.090> wood<00:02:03.329> on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
renders like a stack of items wood on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
renders like a stack of items wood on
the<00:02:03.630> ground<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> could<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.740> keep<00:02:04.890> adding

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the ground so I could just keep adding

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
the ground so I could just keep adding
items<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.700> looks<00:02:06.119> exactly<00:02:06.600> identical<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
items and looks exactly identical to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.600 
items and looks exactly identical to
what<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.500> look<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.250> drop<00:02:08.520> them

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
what it would look like if I drop them

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.520 
what it would look like if I drop them
on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.759> ground<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.450> pretty<00:02:10.020> much<00:02:10.140> if

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
on the ground like that pretty much if

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.119 
on the ground like that pretty much if
you<00:02:10.649> get<00:02:10.830> what<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.950> mean

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you get what I mean

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.130 
you get what I mean
yep<00:02:11.340> looks<00:02:11.640> exactly<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.090> same<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:12.900> tiny

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
yep looks exactly the same just as tiny

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.940 
yep looks exactly the same just as tiny
little<00:02:13.379> bit

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
little bit

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
little bit
version<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.640> yeah<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.989> that's<00:02:16.260> pretty<00:02:16.349> much

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
version and yeah so that's pretty much

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.020 
version and yeah so that's pretty much
how<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.709> works<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.280> actually<00:02:17.370> take<00:02:17.670> items

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

in this and it would a crafting grid
it's<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.860> better<00:02:56.459> looking<00:02:56.819> mod<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.269> to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
it's just a better looking mod really to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.420 
it's just a better looking mod really to

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
it more immersive pretty much and then I

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.170 
it more immersive pretty much and then I
could<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:01.530> left-click<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.640> get<00:03:02.849> my<00:03:02.970> pick

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
loads of cobble and there and I could

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.400 
loads of cobble and there and I could
come<00:04:06.299> back<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.750> if<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.900> didn't<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.200> all<00:04:07.290> the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
come back to it if I didn't have all the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.690 
come back to it if I didn't have all the
ingredients<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.950> could<00:04:08.099> just<00:04:08.250> take<00:04:08.370> these<00:04:08.549> off

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
ingredients I could just take these off

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.589 
ingredients I could just take these off
for<00:04:08.880> example<00:04:10.010> like<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.370> now<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:12.180> could<00:04:12.450> go

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
for example like that and now I could go

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.349 
for example like that and now I could go
and<00:04:12.840> get<00:04:13.049> more<00:04:13.410> cobble<00:04:13.739> come<00:04:14.040> back<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.669> then

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
and get more cobble come back and then

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.270 
and get more cobble come back and then
place<00:04:15.540> what<00:04:15.720> cobble<00:04:15.959> on<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.289> I<00:04:16.919> wouldn't<00:04:17.190> have

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
place what cobble on and I wouldn't have

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.469 
place what cobble on and I wouldn't have
to<00:04:17.400> worry<00:04:17.639> about<00:04:17.760> putting<00:04:18.060> all<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.329> other
