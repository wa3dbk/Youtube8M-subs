I think it was one of the nicest one to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.410 
I think it was one of the nicest one to
do<00:03:10.970> because<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:13.190> choreography<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
do because the choreography and the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.540 
do because the choreography and the
whole<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.990> whole<00:03:15.230> build-up<00:03:15.890> for<00:03:16.190> for

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
whole the whole build-up for for

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.520
