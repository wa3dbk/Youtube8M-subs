going<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.480> be<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.749> only<00:03:04.049> wrinkly<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.099> makes

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
going to be that only wrinkly it makes

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.979 
going to be that only wrinkly it makes
me<00:03:05.430> feel<00:03:05.579> bad<00:03:06.469> okay<00:03:07.469> um<00:03:07.829> nerd<00:03:08.669> Sheeran<00:03:09.209> well<00:03:09.750> he

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
me feel bad okay um nerd Sheeran well he

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.970 
me feel bad okay um nerd Sheeran well he
had<00:03:10.459> bright<00:03:11.459> eyes<00:03:11.780> pale<00:03:12.780> face<00:03:13.319> his

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
had bright eyes pale face his

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.490 
had bright eyes pale face his
performance<00:03:14.579> like<00:03:14.819> snowflakes<00:03:15.689> and<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.349> guess

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
performance like snowflakes and I guess

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.569 
performance like snowflakes and I guess
that's<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.739> good<00:03:16.859> thing<00:03:16.919> because<00:03:17.159> if<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.459> had

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
that's a good thing because if it had

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.949 
that's a good thing because if it had
snowflakes<00:03:17.819> here<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.299> might<00:03:18.419> have<00:03:18.510> digested

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
snowflakes here you might have digested

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.300 
snowflakes here you might have digested
them<00:03:19.079> if<00:03:19.290> he<00:03:19.349> digested<00:03:19.769> then<00:03:19.889> they<00:03:19.980> go<00:03:20.069> into<00:03:20.219> a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
them if he digested then they go into a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.979 
them if he digested then they go into a
star<00:03:20.489> justice<00:03:20.790> system<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:21.299> they<00:03:21.510> go<00:03:21.629> to<00:03:21.659> bed

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
star justice system if they go to bed

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.270 
star justice system if they go to bed
they<00:03:22.439> might<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:22.650> attached<00:03:22.919> to<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.129> good

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
they might have attached to the good

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.979 
they might have attached to the good
bacteria<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.909> one<00:03:24.150> good<00:03:24.359> bacteria<00:03:24.540> rather

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
bacteria and one good bacteria rather

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.809 
bacteria and one good bacteria rather
than<00:03:25.139> bad<00:03:25.290> bacteria<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.099> guess<00:03:26.250> yes<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:26.760> a

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
than bad bacteria so I guess yes it's a

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.629 
than bad bacteria so I guess yes it's a
good<00:03:26.969> thing<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.469> know<00:03:28.469> that's<00:03:28.680> enough<00:03:29.069> these

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
good thing I know that's enough these
