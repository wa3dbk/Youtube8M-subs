00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.840 

all<00:00:01.650> right<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.159> time<00:00:02.810> well<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.840> got<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.850> main

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
all right this time well I got the main

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.100 
all right this time well I got the main
portions<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.600> rust<00:00:08.090> usually<00:00:09.090> where<00:00:09.960> you're

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
portions of rust usually where you're

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.480 
portions of rust usually where you're
gonna<00:00:11.450> have<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.259> your<00:00:13.500> corners<00:00:14.309> or

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
gonna have this is on your corners or

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.700 
gonna have this is on your corners or
where<00:00:14.639> weld<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.800> but<00:00:16.800> when<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> hit<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.699> them

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
where weld is but when I hit all them

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.110 
where weld is but when I hit all them
with<00:00:19.710> my<00:00:20.010> wire<00:00:20.279> wheel

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.120 

this<00:00:25.720> one<00:00:25.930> works<00:00:26.140> really<00:00:26.260> well<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:26.890> tighter

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
this one works really well and tighter

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.800 
this one works really well and tighter
is<00:00:27.490> that<00:00:27.670> nylon<00:00:28.090> when<00:00:28.300> I<00:00:28.390> was<00:00:28.510> telling<00:00:28.660> you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
is that nylon when I was telling you

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.420 
is that nylon when I was telling you
about<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:30.160> then<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.900> not<00:00:32.110> it's<00:00:32.650> not<00:00:32.890> nearly

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
about but then it's not it's not nearly

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.590 
about but then it's not it's not nearly
as<00:00:33.610> a<00:00:33.730> breakfast<00:00:34.240> abrasive<00:00:35.140> as<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.380> steel<00:00:35.890> wheel

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
as a breakfast abrasive as a steel wheel

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.180 
as a breakfast abrasive as a steel wheel
so<00:00:37.600> this<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.990> a<00:00:40.110> standard<00:00:41.110> steel<00:00:41.620> wheel<00:00:41.920> that's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
so this is a standard steel wheel that's

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.150 
so this is a standard steel wheel that's
what<00:00:42.989> that's<00:00:43.989> what<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.170> use<00:00:44.440> most<00:00:44.680> time<00:00:44.950> was

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
what that's what I use most time was

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.110 
what that's what I use most time was
really<00:00:45.660> knock<00:00:46.660> it<00:00:46.809> on<00:00:46.930> off<00:00:47.110> pretty<00:00:47.410> good

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
really knock it on off pretty good

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.240 
really knock it on off pretty good
basically<00:00:49.120> what<00:00:49.270> I<00:00:49.300> did<00:00:49.390> was<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:50.250> really

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
basically what I did was a really

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.240 
basically what I did was a really
embedded<00:00:51.670> shaped<00:00:51.880> in<00:00:52.059> it<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.380> appeared<00:00:53.739> I

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
embedded shaped in it and it appeared I

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.360 
embedded shaped in it and it appeared I
just<00:00:54.520> hit<00:00:54.910> all<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.300> areas<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:55.690> were<00:00:56.370> rusty

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
just hit all the areas that were rusty

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.700 
just hit all the areas that were rusty
on<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.550> corners<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.690> you<00:00:58.750> know<00:00:59.320> just<00:00:59.530> fit

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
on the corners and you know just fit

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.710 
on the corners and you know just fit
with<00:00:59.920> my<00:01:00.040> hand<00:01:00.309> till<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:01.000> got<00:01:01.150> down<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.330> smooth

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
with my hand till I got down to smooth

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.560 
with my hand till I got down to smooth
metal<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:03.190> know<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.580> course<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.970> got<00:01:04.089> shining

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
metal you know of course it got shining

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.350 
metal you know of course it got shining
off<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.230> then<00:01:06.190> I<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:09.010> go<00:01:09.190> ahead<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.760> just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
off and then I just go ahead and just

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.690 
off and then I just go ahead and just
kind<00:01:10.540> of<00:01:10.659> knock<00:01:10.870> up<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.290> rest<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.400> find<00:01:12.640> a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
kind of knock up the rest to find a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.360 
kind of knock up the rest to find a
little<00:01:12.909> bit<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.750> I<00:01:13.810> got<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.080> primered

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
little bit so I got it primered

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.630 
little bit so I got it primered
just<00:01:17.120> make<00:01:17.270> sure<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.570> get<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.750> good<00:01:17.900> stick<00:01:18.640> you

one side I just kind of dying to see
what<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:48.500> going<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.650> look<00:01:48.740> like<00:01:48.910> that's<00:01:49.910> with

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
what it's going to look like that's with

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.480 
what it's going to look like that's with
no<00:01:50.210> lift<00:01:50.630> or<00:01:50.870> anything

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
no lift or anything

no lift or anything
let<00:01:53.270> me<00:01:53.420> step<00:01:53.690> back<00:01:53.900> might<00:01:54.230> look<00:01:54.410> like<00:01:54.470> it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
let me step back might look like it

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.109 
let me step back might look like it
should<00:01:56.300> look<00:01:56.420> like<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:56.810> leaning

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
on the ECU that's what my shifting

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.979 
on the ECU that's what my shifting
problems<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.170> was<00:02:16.030> as<00:02:17.030> your<00:02:17.330> culprit<00:02:17.599> right
