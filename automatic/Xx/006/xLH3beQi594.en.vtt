 and this is the current climate 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.740
 let's start 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.580
 the first thing is that we have to go 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.580
 in cydia 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.770
 A program 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.120
 and I'll let the bass of the description 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.750

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.909

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.010

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.990
 spring utility 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.810
 and it will appear like that but for that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.680
 we need something else 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.680
 let's notice that 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.119
 The localization 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.110
 this asset 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.230

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.710

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.180
