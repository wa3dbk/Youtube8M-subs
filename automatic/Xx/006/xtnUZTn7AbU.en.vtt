00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.660
 hi how are you today we are going to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.460
 make a homemade tip he had already 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.770
 promised in a past program we're going to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.869
 create this necklace with fabric strips 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.869
 let's see the step by step 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.400
 the material we need to do 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.080
 these fabric collars is first that 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.310
 nothing a chain can be plated 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.650
 golden and find him in any 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.550
 where they sell material to make 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.710
 bracelets and necklaces fabric of preference 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.559
 that is fabric either lycra or the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.420
 typical of t-shirts scissors for 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.480
 cut strips and a tape measure 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.780
 to measure these strips first 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.690
 What I'm going to do is hook the chain 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.450
 to make it easier to make the necklace and 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.969
 I start by cutting the bandages 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.850
 20 strips since each knot will have 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.950
 two strips the strips that I am using are 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.990
 of 60 centimeters but you could 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.660
 use as they want even 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.940
 make it asymmetric some short and 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.750
 some long ones that must very father I'm 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.700
 using 1010 it looks like 20 strips 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.820
 They are 10 knots around the collar 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.159
 he passed it over the chain and I do 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.280
 a very simple knot and I squeeze the joke 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.380
 that is quite tight and just at 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.920
 side let's make another knot and another 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.780
 up to 10 and in a short time 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.939
 ready a spectacular necklace to use 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.420
 with your shirts with your hue tereso 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.420
 sweatshirts 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.330
 and they were left with a necklace 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.220

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.900
 they can use it with many things from 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.570
 stamped they have chosen the color 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.970
