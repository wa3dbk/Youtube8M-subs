00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.230
 to me 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.639
 very good good very good afternoon very 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
 good night youtube people in this 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.090
 video let's see what to do when the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.450
 computer without hostiles and it would turn us off 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.810
 in either the case and we will 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.880
 treat a problem 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.510
 the problem of overheating of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.860
 processor 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.320
 first and main you must or have 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.120
 make sure that this is the problem 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.610
 to follow the steps that I'm going to 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.559
 mention how you notice good download 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.530
 the program that is a free program 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.350
 it's called monitor hardware look it up in 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.060
 google where are you going to continue in the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.450
 monitoring of 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.490
 in the temperature of your processor 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.140
 followed by a certain time 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.890
 until the moment that is marked and if 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.530
 you consider that the value it gives you is a 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.470
 it is a very high value is a temperature 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.090
 very high what you should do is what 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.929
 following 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.299
 and the computer being a long time 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:18.429
 working or not giving much 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.859
 maintenance what it does is accumulate 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.149
 earth inside this earth what is going to 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:28.060
 do is accumulate in the heatsink of 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.250
 that refrigerates our processor and what 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.020
 what you are going to do is prevent the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.670
 heatsink obviously do your homework that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.600
 is to dissipate the heat of the processor 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.680
 cool the processor 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.009
 so what we should do is open 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.560
 all the computer clean it with some 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.520
 blowtorch something I have a video of how 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 do it if you want to go I'll leave it here what 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.580
 what we are going to do is clean the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.490
 computer since we open it for 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.179
 take out all the earth and disarm remove 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.359
 the processor cooler remove 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:06.270
 sink and all that is pasta 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:09.060
 thermal that is something that is the pasta is 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 white that is between the processor and the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.930
 dissipator that surely must be 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.180
 dry what you are going to do with alcohol 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.410
 isopropyl and cotton you will clean it 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.489
 you clean it well, everything went that way 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.799
 white pasta and what you are going to do is 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.030
 clean the processor take all the 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.190
 land that must surely have 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.650
 clean also the cooler that is the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.940
 fan and place it in new paste 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.940
 thermal that you can get it in 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.920
 any computer store clean 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 the thermal paste and this you put new 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.329
 with what you can place the processor 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.610
 correctly you replace the 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.590
 dissipator and the culÃ© weapons all the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.079
 computer again and you notice and now 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.680
 the problem was solved if it was not 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.540
 solves the problem probably the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.879
 problem is in the full in the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.500
 voltages that the source gives you 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.940
 power source I recommend you 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.120
 try another source of power that 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.019
 have if you do not have another 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.940
 I should take it to a technical brush or 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:17.030
 If I do not buy, I think that if it is not 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.740
 something to which you are going to dedicate 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.560
 do not do it but what you can do 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.770
 is to buy on a device that is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.200
 obviously plug in the in the connector 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.849
 of the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.180
 strong of power and what it does is 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.580
 tell us the voltages of the source of 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.750
 can they be right or not good people 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.790
 that was it 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.800
 then I will make a video if they want 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.849
 If the video is already there, I'll leave it 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.380
 here how how to clean the 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.380
 computer in the case of be a 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.970
 notebook if your computer is a 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.450
 new game your laptop is called good 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.239
 people 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.299
 if it worked for you, like it and subscribe to me
