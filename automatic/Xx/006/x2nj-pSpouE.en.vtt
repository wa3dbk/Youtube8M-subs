00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
maddening it really is because this was

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.280 
maddening it really is because this was
something<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.120> was<00:02:31.270> actually<00:02:31.540> announced

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
officially canceled though so some

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.400 
officially canceled though so some
people<00:02:36.580> still<00:02:36.910> believe<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.600> may<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.840> in

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
people still believe that it may be in

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.020 
people still believe that it may be in
development<00:02:38.830> before<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.460> different<00:02:39.850> system

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
development before a different system

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.180 
development before a different system
most<00:02:40.330> likely<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.050> three<00:02:41.350> dias<00:02:41.590> or<00:02:41.770> indeed<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
most likely the three dias or indeed the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.520 
most likely the three dias or indeed the
new<00:02:42.370> 3ds<00:02:42.640> maybe<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.150> wii<00:02:43.300> u<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.900> just<00:02:44.200> don't

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
new 3ds maybe the wii u we just don't

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.560 
new 3ds maybe the wii u we just don't
know<00:02:44.860> personally<00:02:45.730> i<00:02:45.760> think<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.360> project

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
know personally i think that the project

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.810 
know personally i think that the project
was<00:02:46.930> either<00:02:47.140> scrapped<00:02:47.680> or<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.310> assets<00:02:48.670> were

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
was either scrapped or the assets were

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.490 
was either scrapped or the assets were
taken<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.420> are<00:02:49.540> being<00:02:49.720> used<00:02:49.990> on<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> new

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
taken and are being used on a new

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.560 
taken and are being used on a new
metroid<00:02:50.920> but<00:02:51.370> frankly<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> think<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.120> Metroid

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
metroid but frankly I think the Metroid

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.800 
metroid but frankly I think the Metroid
read<00:02:52.900> as<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.290> was<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.800> no<00:02:54.580> more<00:02:54.970> however<00:02:55.660> I'm

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
read as it was is no more however I'm

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.870 
read as it was is no more however I'm
just<00:02:55.990> excited<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.410> any<00:02:56.650> new<00:02:57.160> metroid<00:02:57.670> game
