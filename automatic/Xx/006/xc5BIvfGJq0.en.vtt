00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the staff are welcome another video 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.180
 here on my channel and today I will answer 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.529
 a question as it was launched in the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.019
 following video I recorded this 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 When I meet Maria Dina, I found the product 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.040
 interesting so I'll share the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.460
 The answer is that it's as difficult as 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.410
 the brand is machine is frame butt the video 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.210
 how marketing in this holy moment 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.980
 combination of carbohydrates with creatine 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.480
 to improve absorption 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.160
 I would like your opinion on 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 some jokes that aim to finish 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.679
 our action as a PiauÃ­ house was the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.590
 Question ronaldo we read 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.780
 What is the origin of this question is 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.360
 christina alkaline create hill has 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.960
 ph high hence the name created by ina 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 alkaline creatine and supposedly 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.809
 theoretically how it can be more 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.840
 was in a law function that removes the body 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 can make better use of creatine 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 if we look at the study here in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.960
 france and one was sponsored by the brand 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 this time only america fx 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.949
 this study compared to creating what 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 with creatine cheaper in terms of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 absorption of the body makes 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.080
 within creatine in Olympic athletes 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.540
 and fact the study the Olympic athletes 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 consumed alkaline acre will increase 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.799
 about forms in the Olympic movements 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.930
 net full 8-bit boat and also 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.400
 they managed to gain more mass magick in 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.009
 comparison with those who consumed the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 crime was not given, however, as the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.900
 The study was sponsored by a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.520
 nutrition that happens to be a product 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 create what you read 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 so we can not rely not only on this 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.939
 I 'm studying to study French now. 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 and two here in the video description 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.030
 this was also sponsored by a 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.890
 company that has business in the area of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.229
 nutrition and in this study there were no 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.880
 found benefit of that in relation to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.299
 a mano hydrate this was the conclusion 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.280
 let us read neither the doses recommended by 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.619
 manufacturer in equivalent doses 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
 hill by summer major changes in the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.329
 false content assaulted muscle 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.579
 body composition strength or ability 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.540
 anaerobic compared with bitch 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.729
 cheaper 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.649
 these results in the opinion of actions that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.090
 create at least one more effective way 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.670
 of creatine 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.009
 but as I said this study was also 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.250
 pressed a company with business in the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.110
 area of nutrition and has in 3 in the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.330
 conclusion of the study because 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.910
 cristina was bought with the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.819
 ina is a product is a criticism of the brand 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.700
 dell your clip so there are no studies 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.790
 who have evaluated this 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.950
 It is also a question of how the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.840
 external crystal cristina external is more 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.760
 I have to train absorbs cheaper 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.629
 however we look at the products here 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.160
 france 3 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.950
 we also see that there is no confirmation 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.110
 about this I will read when 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.030
 compared to criticism andrade believes 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.040
 in the atmosphere was not more efficient in 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.200
 increase the levels of musician education nor 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.599
 muscle mass and strength 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.849
 So what can I say to what? 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.980
 spend more money in the form of small 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.739
 which do not appear to be superior available 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.269
 the monohydrate creatine is personal 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.069
 have any further questions about this 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.170
 leaving the comments 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.519
