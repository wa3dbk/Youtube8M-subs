 stunning accuracy is a must 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 Immediately infection do the same 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
 tasks get the ingredients for it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.609
 then spend it on buying trinkets 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
 as prizes for monotonous work 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.900
 various cars and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.670
 spare parts for them but the desire to collect their

 car fleets the opportunity to ride on 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.489
 huge world 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.700

 this massive multiplayer race 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.809

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 when the lady from in offered the hero freedom 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.960
 in exchange for cooperation he agreed 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.940
 without thinking, Alex is working on 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.039
 criminals are becoming more 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 influential circles and gradually

 vicissitudes amenable to speaking 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.100
 any crane heads is equal to negotiation and 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.950
 There are very few transient scenes of clips. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 the action in them is even less for the final 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.850
 what is happening reminds formless 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.369
 a bunch of stamps on jerky from movies 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.020
 a series of afterburner after the liberation of the hero 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.450

 of the world amaze alex participates in street 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.430
 racing learn from one end of town to

 another gets away from the police 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.460
 compete with the timer during the race 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.140
 control points 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.259
 or trying to catch up and smash the car 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.560
 the opponent is diluted with a minor game 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.479
 task which 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.790
 perform while exploring the world 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.500

 marks jump on the springboard third-party 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.350
 task abound 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.570
 Of course this must be activated 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.119
 flashes to test marked on 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.310
 map than the best results show 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.250
 Alex in the main and side missions 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.440
 better parts give him control 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.750
 car obscenely simple car 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.120
 rockets and flies along the road and easily enters 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.489
 in turn and shut down provided 5 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.019
 modifications of street car cars and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.760
 and racing is great for 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.799
 urban conditions and rally and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.959
 off-road cars will pass without any problems 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.030
 through the thick woods the truth of other differences 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.260
 there is no effect between modifications 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.040
 from the variety of spare parts also passes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 of paramount importance here 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.660
 level car that folds 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.250
 of all its characteristics 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.810
 it is important not so much the availability of quality 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.480
 brake pads or other specific 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.260
 details how many general numbers are simplicity 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.940
 of management 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.040
 no tangible process difference 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.930
 driving over rough terrain and ordinary 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.760
 roads as well as raw england system 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.410
 opportunities to raise the level of the car barely 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.120
 whether not indefinitely in fact 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.400
 kill any sense of expansion 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.900
 car park and in fact bought cars and their 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.260
 modifications need to be pumped 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.430
 separately performing a familiar task 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.470
 artificial intelligence is a big part and 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.840
 unable to impose a serious struggle 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.730
 opponents keep up with the hero quickly 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.040
 close the gap make mistakes but 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.540
 outrun their business a couple of seconds to the same 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.940
 opponents seem to react to the level 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.130
 Alex's cars and the higher he is the less 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.049
 resistance they have in the final 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.900
 the adventures of arrival are stretched but 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.910
 excitement it does not give them the majority 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.680
 missions in the company do not spoil interesting 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.590
 scripts in do not fit into one 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.480
 errands in the game have the ability to quickly 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.220
 navigate through intelligence and places 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.350
 also travel between cities on 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.790
 train and plane but from long and 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.690
 tedious trips completely 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.989
 can not get rid 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.480
 monotonous trial bored by 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.340
 other players drive around the world with them 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.500
 you can team up and go through 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.980
 story missions compete along the way 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.420
 but finding a satellite is not easy 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.850
 since everyone is busy with his business 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.769
 the hero can also join one 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.760
 of the five groups that offer 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.860
 separate task 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.540
 this activity comes down to friends 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.220
 races and chase 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.780
 down to a few hours this 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.330
 exhausting but not feeling 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.860
 meet the gang lead the war 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.019
 for control in the United States 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.849
 but with the exception of not very important prizes 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.980
 this is expressed only as numbers in 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.140
 appropriate menu users can 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.269
 arrange the usual race format each 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.310
 for myself or team to command with 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.079
 given the ease of driving and lack of 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.090
 drive in races like that is perceived 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.950
 how mockery is added to this 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.320
 long waiting for other users 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.780
 before the start of the race no act 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.120
 Hero does not pass without a trace for merit 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.570
 he is given money for team credits and 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.360
 experience 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.979
 the growth of the protagonist promises new perks though 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.750
 most of them are aimed at 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.300
 cheaper cars and other 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.560
 imperceptible bonuses currency goes to 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.229
 particular on the purchase of new cars 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.640
 There was a built-in store where 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.820
 for real money sold 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.590
 in-game credits closed upset in 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.969
 first priority taste and multiplayer 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.890
 part and not very bright 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.930
 prospects for normal 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.760
 functioning online game need 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.920
 stable audience is desirable 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.230
 ever growing otherwise confusing 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.630
 at the same time there are exactly two reasons 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.400
 stay longer a large number 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.590
 cars and great decoration 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.540
 driving is not a pleasure 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.580
 missions in the company are repeated and 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:18.660
 stretch and additional tests 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.660
 with time tones in monotony you know
