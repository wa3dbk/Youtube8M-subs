00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
need to know about there are no second

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.330 
need to know about there are no second
chances<00:00:20.150> there's<00:00:21.150> only<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.630> moment<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.340> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
chances there's only this moment and the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.170 
chances there's only this moment and the
next<00:00:23.369> one

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
next one

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.720 
next one
every<00:00:26.020> one<00:00:26.230> of<00:00:26.500> those<00:00:26.740> moments<00:00:27.130> is<00:00:27.670> a<00:00:27.970> test

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
every one of those moments is a test

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.420 
every one of those moments is a test
then<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.850> get<00:00:31.030> to<00:00:31.060> take<00:00:31.330> one<00:00:31.360> time<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:33.070> only

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
then you get to take one time and only

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.610 
then you get to take one time and only
one<00:00:34.060> time

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.439
