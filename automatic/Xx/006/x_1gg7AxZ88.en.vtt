00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
downwards if you have a large bust I

will suggest hooking it up from the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:07.270 
will suggest hooking it up from the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.529 

now<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> back<00:02:08.580> should<00:02:08.879> fall<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.360> above

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
now the back should fall right above

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.140 
now the back should fall right above
your<00:02:09.660> waistline<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.259> shouldn't<00:02:10.590> flip<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.670> bend

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
if it's flipping or bending that means

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.699 
if it's flipping or bending that means
it's<00:02:15.330> too<00:02:15.480> small<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.319> need<00:02:16.470> another
