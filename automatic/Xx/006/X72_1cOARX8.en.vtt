look as if you have one continuous roll
going<00:01:59.550> around<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.060> head<00:02:00.650> just<00:02:01.650> be<00:02:01.830> careful

going around your head just be careful

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.680 
going around your head just be careful
when<00:02:02.340> you're<00:02:02.460> inserting<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:03.060> bobby<00:02:03.210> pins<00:02:03.480> not

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
when you're inserting the bobby pins not

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.660 
when you're inserting the bobby pins not
to<00:02:03.840> squash<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> tubes<00:02:04.590> down<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.160> want<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to squash the tubes down you want to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.890 
to squash the tubes down you want to
just<00:02:06.600> pin<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.290> tubes<00:02:07.680> along<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.090> head<00:02:09.330> don't

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
just pin the tubes along the head don't

00:02:09.900 --> 00:03:04.850 
just pin the tubes along the head don't
squash<00:02:10.260> them

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.559 

so<00:03:05.860> I'm<00:03:05.950> just<00:03:06.159> now<00:03:06.370> rolling<00:03:06.969> the<00:03:07.090> very<00:03:07.329> last

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
so I'm just now rolling the very last

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.300 
so I'm just now rolling the very last
section<00:03:07.870> at<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.260> back<00:03:08.379> of<00:03:08.439> my<00:03:08.650> head<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:09.069> is<00:03:09.280> a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
section at the back of my head it is a

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.429 
section at the back of my head it is a
little<00:03:09.579> bit<00:03:09.760> tricky<00:03:10.209> in<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.569> persevere<00:03:11.140> keep

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
little bit tricky in a persevere keep

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.599 
little bit tricky in a persevere keep
trying<00:03:11.799> if<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.909> do<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.299> can<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:15.370> keep

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
trying if I can do it you can just keep

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.009 
trying if I can do it you can just keep
rolling<00:03:15.969> back<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.390> checking<00:03:16.689> in<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.810> mirror

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
rolling back and checking in the mirror

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.179 
rolling back and checking in the mirror
this<00:03:17.140> was<00:03:17.319> pretty<00:03:17.530> tricky<00:03:17.709> for<00:03:17.890> me<00:03:17.980> cuz<00:03:18.159> I

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
this was pretty tricky for me cuz I

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.530 
this was pretty tricky for me cuz I
didn't<00:03:18.400> actually<00:03:18.519> have<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.819> mirror<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.180> was<00:03:19.269> just

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
didn't actually have a mirror I was just

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.929 
didn't actually have a mirror I was just
going<00:03:20.349> by<00:03:20.590> feel<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:24.099> might<00:03:24.280> want<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.579> pay

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
going by feel and you might want to pay

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.460 
going by feel and you might want to pay
a<00:03:24.970> little<00:03:25.150> bit<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.420> attention<00:03:25.689> to<00:03:25.959> your<00:03:26.230> role

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
a little bit of attention to your role

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.699 
a little bit of attention to your role
once<00:03:26.859> you<00:03:27.220> finish<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.299> last<00:03:28.540> section<00:03:29.290> you

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
once you finish the last section you

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.470 
once you finish the last section you
want<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.129> look<00:03:30.250> like<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.459> continuous<00:03:31.239> roll

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
want it to look like a continuous roll

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.179 
want it to look like a continuous roll
of<00:03:31.689> hair<00:03:31.900> rather<00:03:32.200> than<00:03:32.470> lots<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.799> different

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
of hair rather than lots of different

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.860 
of hair rather than lots of different
sections<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:33.879> you<00:03:33.939> may<00:03:34.120> need<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.450> some<00:03:34.719> more

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
sections so you may need to some more

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.160 
sections so you may need to some more
bobby<00:03:35.109> pins<00:03:35.439> and<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:37.180> look<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.540> really<00:03:37.840> soft

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
bobby pins and this look is really soft

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.720 
bobby pins and this look is really soft
and<00:03:38.439> there's<00:03:38.620> lots<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.920> hair<00:03:39.129> falling<00:03:39.609> around

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
and there's lots of hair falling around

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.910 
and there's lots of hair falling around
the<00:03:40.030> face<00:03:40.299> but<00:03:40.599> I<00:03:40.629> feel<00:03:40.959> for<00:03:41.139> my<00:03:41.290> face<00:03:41.620> shape

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
the face but I feel for my face shape

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.460 
the face but I feel for my face shape
that<00:03:42.159> I<00:03:42.189> need<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:43.060> get<00:03:43.180> rid<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.569> my<00:03:43.720> fringe<00:03:44.079> and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that I need to get rid of my fringe and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.729 
that I need to get rid of my fringe and
so<00:03:45.400> I'm<00:03:45.519> just<00:03:45.549> lightly<00:03:46.209> pinning<00:03:47.079> that<00:03:47.260> over

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
so I'm just lightly pinning that over

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.699 
so I'm just lightly pinning that over
the<00:03:47.889> top<00:03:48.099> of<00:03:48.129> my<00:03:48.459> first<00:03:49.269> roll<00:03:49.659> just<00:03:50.230> very

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
the top of my first roll just very

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.259 
the top of my first roll just very
lightly<00:03:51.010> pushing<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.609> over<00:03:51.669> so<00:03:52.060> it's<00:03:52.180> not

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
lightly pushing it over so it's not

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.670 
lightly pushing it over so it's not
squashing<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.870> style<00:03:53.139> at<00:03:53.290> all

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
squashing the style at all

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.199 
squashing the style at all
and<00:03:53.980> then<00:03:54.099> just<00:03:54.250> bringing<00:03:54.579> down<00:03:54.730> some<00:03:55.000> hair<00:03:55.180> in
