basketball hoops spider webs of football

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.839 
basketball hoops spider webs of football
nets<00:04:13.129> actually<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.159> would<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.489> be<00:04:14.549> better<00:04:14.729> to

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
nets actually I would it be better to

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.460 
nets actually I would it be better to
just<00:04:17.090> like<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.389> yeah<00:04:19.019> it's<00:04:19.109> pretty<00:04:19.229> better

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
just like that yeah it's pretty better

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.310 
just like that yeah it's pretty better
than<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:21.139> storage<00:04:22.139> room<00:04:22.320> in<00:04:22.469> here
