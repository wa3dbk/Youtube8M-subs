00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
the game well I think probably the best

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.350 
the game well I think probably the best
thing<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:12.439> do<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:12.769> sort<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.099> forget<00:03:13.970> about<00:03:14.090> it

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
thing to do is sort of forget about it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.960 
thing to do is sort of forget about it
really<00:03:14.659> and<00:03:14.840> just<00:03:15.290> get<00:03:15.799> behind<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.400> guys<00:03:16.579> now

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
and look on to the next match yeah so

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.830

the<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.939> next<00:03:20.150> fixture<00:03:20.329> games<00:03:20.629> in<00:03:20.780> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the the next fixture games in the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.680 
the the next fixture games in the
Premier<00:03:21.110> League<00:03:21.140> obviously<00:03:21.470> very<00:03:21.620> tough<00:03:22.690> but

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
Premier League obviously very tough but

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.180 
Premier League obviously very tough but
Fulham<00:03:24.140> have<00:03:24.260> pulled<00:03:24.530> stuff<00:03:24.739> out<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.010> bag

Fulham have pulled stuff out the bag
before<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.720> know<00:03:26.840> there<00:03:27.170> are<00:03:27.200> some<00:03:27.470> positive

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.690 
before you know there are some positive
state<00:03:27.890> from<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.069> performance<00:03:28.430> but<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.579> think

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
state from the performance but I think

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.949 
state from the performance but I think
the<00:03:28.760> best<00:03:28.879> thing<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.060> do<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.299> forget<00:03:29.659> about<00:03:29.750> it

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959
