by<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.420> accounts<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.350> white<00:00:34.680> dial

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
by all accounts it's just a white dial

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
by all accounts it's just a white dial
everything<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.920> black<00:00:38.219> plastic

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
everything on this is black plastic

everything on this is black plastic
black<00:00:40.129> rubber<00:00:41.129> band<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.809> would

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
black rubber band on it and I would

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
black rubber band on it and I would
actually<00:00:43.110> say<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:43.950> rubber<00:00:44.219> as

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
actually say it's not really rubber as

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720 
actually say it's not really rubber as
much<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.030> plastic<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:47.010> little

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
much as this plastic it it's a little

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.440 
much as this plastic it it's a little
bit<00:00:47.850> stiff

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
bit stiff

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 
bit stiff
feels<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:50.129> brittle<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
feels a little bit brittle like if I

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
feels a little bit brittle like if I
were<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> pinch<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.870> together<00:00:52.110> would

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
were really to pinch this together would

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
were really to pinch this together would
I<00:00:52.890> feel<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> would<00:00:53.699> wouldn't<00:00:54.300> snap<00:00:54.660> but

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
I feel like it would wouldn't snap but

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.090 
I feel like it would wouldn't snap but
it<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.230> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
it would be kind of more of that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.299 
it would be kind of more of that
material<00:00:56.520> than<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> kind<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.620> real<00:00:58.949> soft

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
material than a kind of that a real soft

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
material than a kind of that a real soft
rubber<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.359> might<00:01:00.510> assume<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
rubber that you might assume that it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.470 
rubber that you might assume that it
would<00:01:01.829> feel<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.789> measure<00:01:03.120> the
