00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
forward and they snuff out the problem

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.699 
forward and they snuff out the problem
to<00:03:05.550> be<00:03:05.760> fairness<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.600> Montpellier<00:03:07.380> there

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
to be fairness to Montpellier there

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.620 
to be fairness to Montpellier there
there<00:03:08.069> was<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> massive<00:03:08.790> overlap<00:03:09.239> on<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
there was a massive overlap on the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.240 
there was a massive overlap on the
outside<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:10.739> why<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.069> were<00:03:11.160> trying

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
outside so that's why they were trying

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.130 
outside so that's why they were trying
to<00:03:11.400> prevent<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.630> coaches<00:03:13.019> will

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
to prevent it but the coaches will

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.530 
to prevent it but the coaches will
always<00:03:13.440> say<00:03:13.620> make<00:03:14.130> them<00:03:14.370> go<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.730> extra<00:03:15.300> pass

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
always say make them go that extra pass

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.270
