00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
think when they discover them the amount

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.110 
think when they discover them the amount
of<00:03:25.870> research<00:03:26.230> into<00:03:26.560> these<00:03:26.739> disorders<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.549> very

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
of research into these disorders is very

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.270 
of research into these disorders is very
small<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.840> right<00:03:29.170> now<00:03:29.350> there<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.769> no<00:03:30.040> known

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
small and right now there is no known

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.400 
small and right now there is no known
cure<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:31.269> we<00:03:31.390> just<00:03:31.540> have<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.780> keep<00:03:32.019> fighting

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
cure so we just have to keep fighting

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.430 
cure so we just have to keep fighting
and<00:03:32.950> battling<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.820> words<00:03:34.120> whilst<00:03:35.110> it's
