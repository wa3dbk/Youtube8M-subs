already build you those as I have
there's<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:42.000> simple<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.079> take<00:00:43.530> which

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
there's a simple way you can take which

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.889 
there's a simple way you can take which
side<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> put<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.329> torch<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.980> by

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
side to put the torch on and that is by

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.880 
side to put the torch on and that is by
placing<00:00:48.899> some<00:00:50.300> redstone<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.260> each<00:00:52.530> side<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
placing some redstone on on each side of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.790 
placing some redstone on on each side of
the<00:00:53.309> double<00:00:53.969> dolls<00:00:54.500> like<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.829> oh<00:00:56.930> by<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> way

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.330 

you<00:01:01.800> should<00:01:01.910> make<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.149> whole<00:01:04.040> five<00:01:05.750> square<00:01:07.340> by

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you should make the whole five square by

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.120 
you should make the whole five square by
six<00:01:09.150> squares<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> six<00:01:10.350> squares<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
six squares so the six squares on the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.179 
six squares so the six squares on the
side<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.180> doors<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:14.330> check<00:01:15.330> which<00:01:16.189> side

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
side of the doors to check which side

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.120 
side of the doors to check which side
the<00:01:17.490> torch<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.530> simply<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
the torch should be on you simply put a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.300 
the torch should be on you simply put a
some<00:01:23.130> redstone<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.970> each<00:01:24.299> side<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> site

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
some redstone on each side and the site

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.410 
some redstone on each side and the site
that<00:01:26.840> where<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> dose<00:01:28.320> door<00:01:29.159> opens<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.180> need

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that where the dose door opens you need

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.490 
that where the dose door opens you need
to<00:01:30.600> put<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> torch<00:01:32.240> right<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
to put the torch right there so it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.390 
to put the torch right there so it
closes<00:01:35.009> again<00:01:37.100> now<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.509> other<00:01:39.540> end<00:01:40.400> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
closes again now on the other end you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.060 
closes again now on the other end you
need<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:43.549> take<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.270> at<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.470> side<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
need to take down one at this side and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.760 
need to take down one at this side and
take<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.450> each<00:01:48.720> side<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:51.680> so

it should be on each side of the door so

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:12.650 
it should be on each side of the door so
now<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.930> looks<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.380> this

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
have to check if the pressure plates

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.650 
have to check if the pressure plates
work<00:03:21.610> on<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.780> door<00:03:23.080> just<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.770> be<00:03:23.920> sure<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:25.060> and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
side they can't be this there should be

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.020 
side they can't be this there should be
at<00:03:39.880> least<00:03:39.910> two<00:03:40.480> squares<00:03:40.900> once<00:03:41.740> yeah<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:42.700> the

second square from the door or the door
might<00:03:46.420> jam<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:47.920> can't<00:03:48.280> get<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.700> mobile

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
might jam so you can't get the mobile

might jam so you can't get the mobile
but<00:03:51.210> they<00:03:52.210> can<00:03:52.780> be<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:53.200> fast<00:03:53.500> three<00:03:54.100> squares

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
but they can be as fast three squares

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.980 
but they can be as fast three squares
but<00:03:55.090> then<00:03:55.300> you<00:03:55.480> would<00:03:55.690> have<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:57.120> make<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.780> hole

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
but then you would have to make the hole

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.880 
but then you would have to make the hole
bigger<00:03:59.100> and<00:04:00.510> add<00:04:01.510> some<00:04:01.900> more<00:04:01.960> wet<00:04:02.530> stones

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
bigger and add some more wet stones

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.630 
bigger and add some more wet stones
underneath<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:08.260> pressure<00:04:08.620> plates<00:04:09.040> on<00:04:09.460> each

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
underneath so to pressure plates on each

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:19.370 
underneath so to pressure plates on each
side<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:15.570> then<00:04:16.890> when<00:04:17.890> you<00:04:18.070> know<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.430> works<00:04:18.700> you

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
out the West you can place you probably

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.129 
out the West you can place you probably
have<00:05:32.409> a<00:05:32.439> wall<00:05:32.799> here<00:05:33.189> already<00:05:33.610> but<00:05:34.029> then<00:05:34.989> you

have a wall here already but then you

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.289 
have a wall here already but then you
can<00:05:35.409> place<00:05:37.919> building<00:05:38.919> materials<00:05:39.610> right<00:05:39.969> above
