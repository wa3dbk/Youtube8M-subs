kind of showing some of our applications

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560 
kind of showing some of our applications
for<00:01:19.560> knowledge<00:01:20.220> transfer<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.939> education

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
for knowledge transfer for education

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
for knowledge transfer for education
here<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.350> their<00:01:22.619> mo<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.009> Oh<00:01:23.130> smart<00:01:23.520> glasses

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
here with their mo very Oh smart glasses

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.749 
here with their mo very Oh smart glasses
and<00:01:24.409> it's<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.680> exciting<00:01:25.830> opportunity

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and it's a really exciting opportunity

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.249 
and it's a really exciting opportunity
for<00:01:26.790> us<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.540> glasses<00:01:27.780> are<00:01:28.049> pretty

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
for us because the glasses are pretty

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
for us because the glasses are pretty
pretty<00:01:28.590> incredible<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> dual<00:01:30.240> view

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
pretty incredible they have a dual view

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.170 
pretty incredible they have a dual view
so<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.259> 3d<00:01:31.770> rather<00:01:32.759> than<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.090> like

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
so you can get 3d rather than just like

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.060 
so you can get 3d rather than just like
the<00:01:33.329> single<00:01:33.630> heads-up<00:01:34.140> display<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.710> some<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the single heads-up display that some of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.920 
the single heads-up display that some of
the<00:01:35.189> smart<00:01:35.460> glasses<00:01:35.670> better<00:01:36.390> showcase<00:01:36.780> your

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the smart glasses better showcase your

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
the smart glasses better showcase your
deal<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.530> basically<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.130> reality<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.909> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
deal so basically on reality is kind of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
deal so basically on reality is kind of
creating<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.960> augmented<00:01:40.560> reality<00:01:40.619> inside

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
creating that augmented reality inside

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
creating that augmented reality inside
the<00:01:41.430> classes<00:01:41.880> absolutely<00:01:42.570> were<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.899> creating

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the classes absolutely were you creating

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.230 
the classes absolutely were you creating
the<00:01:43.470> apps<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> software<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> power<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the apps and the software that power the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.850 
the apps and the software that power the
augmented<00:01:45.689> reality<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:46.290> episome<00:01:46.619> oh<00:01:46.710> very

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
augmented reality for an episome oh very

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.830 
augmented reality for an episome oh very
smart<00:01:47.100> glasses<00:01:47.340> no<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
smart glasses no is this like a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
smart glasses no is this like a
prototype<00:01:49.560> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.829> technology<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.880> gonna

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
prototype kind of technology or we gonna

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.960 
prototype kind of technology or we gonna
actually<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.450> people<00:01:51.479> use<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.350> 2015<00:01:53.009> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
actually see people use this in 2015 you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.550 
actually see people use this in 2015 you
know<00:01:54.060> III<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.049> you're<00:01:55.229> gonna<00:01:55.320> see

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
know III think that you're gonna see

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.440 
know III think that you're gonna see
enthusiasts<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.549> very<00:01:56.850> specific

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
enthusiasts in very specific

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600 
enthusiasts in very specific
applications<00:01:58.170> being<00:01:58.409> using<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.579> I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
applications being using it you know I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.429 
applications being using it you know I
think<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.000> hard<00:02:00.060> hard<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.020> some<00:02:01.229> people

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
think it's hard hard to see some people

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
my opinion the malaria smart glasses are

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.550 
my opinion the malaria smart glasses are
the<00:02:14.560> best<00:02:14.800> smart<00:02:15.370> glasses<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:16.000> I've<00:02:16.120> seen

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
