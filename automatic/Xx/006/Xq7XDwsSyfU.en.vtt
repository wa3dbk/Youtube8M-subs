orchestral<00:02:47.870> scores<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.830> which<00:02:49.610> which<00:02:50.240> are

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
orchestral scores and which which are

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.080 
orchestral scores and which which are
are<00:02:51.020> somewhat<00:02:51.620> close<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.220> two<00:02:52.490> film<00:02:52.760> scores

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
are somewhat close to two film scores

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.330 
are somewhat close to two film scores
but<00:02:53.300> not<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.290> same<00:02:54.530> way<00:02:54.740> as<00:02:54.950> more

but not in the same way as more

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.570 
but not in the same way as more
variation<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.470> think<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.800> think<00:02:57.830> also<00:02:58.220> the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
variation I think it I think also the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.080 
variation I think it I think also the
fact<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.330> music<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.490> taking<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.700> space

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
fact that the music is taking the space

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.420 
fact that the music is taking the space
