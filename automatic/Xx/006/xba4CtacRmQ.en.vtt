00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.100 

all<00:00:00.750> right<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:01.140> am<00:00:01.800> trying<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.730> do<00:00:03.110> the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
all right I am trying to do the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.559 
all right I am trying to do the
chocolate<00:00:04.410> bar<00:00:04.859> mystery<00:00:05.460> thing<00:00:05.790> where<00:00:06.180> cuts

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
chocolate bar mystery thing where cuts

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.419 
chocolate bar mystery thing where cuts
and<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.140> like<00:00:07.379> one<00:00:07.680> bar<00:00:07.950> left<00:00:07.980> and

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
and you have like one bar left and

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.259 
and you have like one bar left and
that's<00:00:08.519> ridiculous

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
that's ridiculous

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.680 
that's ridiculous
so<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:10.050> time<00:00:10.200> XL<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:11.269> made<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.450> little

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
so I one time XL I made this little

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.880 
so I one time XL I made this little
spreadsheet<00:00:13.049> thing<00:00:13.670> I<00:00:14.670> figured<00:00:15.540> out<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
spreadsheet thing I figured out that the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.920 
spreadsheet thing I figured out that the
first<00:00:17.190> cut<00:00:17.550> which<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:17.940> at<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.390> angle<00:00:18.630> right

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
first cut which is at this angle right

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.859 
first cut which is at this angle right
there<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.760> figured<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> beat<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
there I figured that at the beat at the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.279 
there I figured that at the beat at the
bottom<00:00:22.199> part<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:23.070> 3/8<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:24.000> an<00:00:24.269> inch<00:00:24.359> or

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
bottom part it's about 3/8 of an inch or

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.009 
bottom part it's about 3/8 of an inch or
3/8<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> bar<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.340> then<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> top<00:00:27.750> it's

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
3/8 of the bar and then at the top it's

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.919 
3/8 of the bar and then at the top it's
about<00:00:28.199> 3/8<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> middle<00:00:30.240> right

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
about 3/8 so then in the middle right

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
about 3/8 so then in the middle right
about<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.710> gonna<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.340> about

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
about there it's gonna have to be about

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
about there it's gonna have to be about
3/8<00:00:33.950> all<00:00:34.950> right<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> did<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.790> I'm<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:37.110> to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
3/8 all right so I did that I'm going to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.209 
3/8 all right so I did that I'm going to
cut<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:39.829> um<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.710> it's<00:00:43.710> actually<00:00:44.010> supposed

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
cut it now um and it's actually supposed

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
cut it now um and it's actually supposed
to<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.550> way<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.120> oh<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.960> hope<00:00:55.649> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to be this way but so oh I hope this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.590 
to be this way but so oh I hope this
works<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.370> spent<00:00:56.699> 10<00:00:56.940> minutes<00:00:57.210> trying<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
works I just spent 10 minutes trying to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:17.450 
works I just spent 10 minutes trying to
figure<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> out<00:01:15.200> now<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.740> works<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
figure this out now if this works you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
figure this out now if this works you
should<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.270> exact<00:01:18.659> same<00:01:18.869> thing<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:25.229> worked

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
should be the exact same thing it worked

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
should be the exact same thing it worked
they're<00:01:26.280> basically<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.850> exact<00:01:27.150> same<00:01:27.330> things

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
they're basically the exact same things

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.770 
they're basically the exact same things
all<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.130> gonna<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.780> this

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
all right so now what I'm gonna do this

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.109 
all right so now what I'm gonna do this
is<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.500> okay<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.360> first<00:01:33.630> cut<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
is how it is okay so the first cut is

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
is how it is okay so the first cut is
cutting<00:01:36.119> off<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:36.720> bars<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.439> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
cutting off the two bars right there so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.460 
cutting off the two bars right there so
I<00:01:38.670> drew<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.390> thick<00:01:39.750> line<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I drew a really thick line just so that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.420 
I drew a really thick line just so that
I<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.710> make<00:01:40.860> sure<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.400> where<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:43.430> all

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
I can make sure that's where it is all

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.670 
I can make sure that's where it is all
right<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.020> BAM

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.420 

cut<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
cut that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.380 
cut that
next<00:01:50.760> part<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.150> take<00:01:51.870> off<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.230> top<00:01:52.530> three<00:01:53.390> for

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
next part is take off the top three for

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:06.620 
next part is take off the top three for
right<00:01:54.570> thing<00:01:56.780> so<00:02:04.940> I'm<00:02:05.940> just<00:02:06.150> trying<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.480> be

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
right thing so I'm just trying to be

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.630 
right thing so I'm just trying to be
very<00:02:06.780> precise<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.130> last<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:11.610> is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
very precise and then the last one is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.140 
very precise and then the last one is
cutting<00:02:12.120> off<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.560> edge<00:02:13.740> square<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:20.150> all

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
cutting off the edge square for this all

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.980 
cutting off the edge square for this all
right<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:24.510> cut<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> into

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
right so you can see that to cut it into

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.230 
right so you can see that to cut it into
the<00:02:25.230> pieces<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.610> all

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the pieces so you can see that now all

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.170 
the pieces so you can see that now all
right<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.570> next<00:02:30.780> up<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.850> rearranging<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:32.970> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
right so next up is rearranging it so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.730 
right so next up is rearranging it so
move<00:02:33.420> these<00:02:33.540> off<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.930> side<00:02:34.280> put<00:02:35.280> this

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
move these off to the side put this

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.570 
move these off to the side put this
right<00:02:37.740> there<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:42.230> right<00:02:43.230> there

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.840 

but<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> doesn't<00:02:48.000> line<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:49.370> that's<00:02:50.370> probably

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
but it doesn't line up that's probably

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.770 
but it doesn't line up that's probably
why<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.120> doesn't<00:02:51.510> work<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:53.730> doesn't<00:02:54.120> line<00:02:54.750> up

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
why it doesn't work it doesn't line up

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.770 
why it doesn't work it doesn't line up
no<00:02:55.080> matter<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:57.209> won't<00:02:57.480> line<00:02:57.750> up

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
no matter what you do it won't line up

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.240 
no matter what you do it won't line up
and<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.860> makes<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.459> illusion<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
and that makes the illusion that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.310 
and that makes the illusion that
actually<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.370> one<00:03:02.640> two<00:03:03.000> three<00:03:03.420> four<00:03:03.720> five<00:03:03.959> by

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
actually is one two three four five by

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.120 
actually is one two three four five by
one<00:03:05.220> two<00:03:05.430> three<00:03:05.640> four<00:03:05.850> five<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
one two three four five so it really is

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.600 
one two three four five so it really is
just<00:03:08.160> an<00:03:08.580> illusion<00:03:09.620> doesn't<00:03:10.620> work<00:03:10.739> at<00:03:10.890> all<00:03:11.070> if

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
just an illusion doesn't work at all if

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.979 
just an illusion doesn't work at all if
you<00:03:11.760> see<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.209> cut<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:13.050> perfect<00:03:14.989> did

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
you see I cut it be perfect did

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.360 
you see I cut it be perfect did
everything<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.410> could<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.620> make<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.860> pretty

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
everything I could to make it pretty

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.410 
everything I could to make it pretty
much<00:03:17.489> exact<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.239> nothing<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.350> going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.739> work

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
much exact and nothing is going to work

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.500 
much exact and nothing is going to work
with<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:23.840> see<00:03:24.840> how<00:03:24.989> it's<00:03:25.260> uneven<00:03:25.860> they're

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
with this see how it's uneven they're

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.330 
with this see how it's uneven they're
uneven<00:03:27.510> they're<00:03:27.840> not<00:03:28.620> even<00:03:28.890> there

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
uneven they're not even there

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.570 
uneven they're not even there
but<00:03:29.550> then<00:03:31.070> good<00:03:32.070> they're<00:03:32.570> good<00:03:33.570> enough<00:03:33.660> there

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
but then good they're good enough there

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.610 
but then good they're good enough there
then<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.910> one<00:03:36.090> bar<00:03:36.330> left<00:03:36.570> but<00:03:36.930> if

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
then you have the one bar left but if

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.940 
then you have the one bar left but if
you<00:03:37.739> saw<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:37.980> original<00:03:38.220> video<00:03:39.799> like<00:03:40.799> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
you saw the original video like the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.420 
you saw the original video like the
animation<00:03:41.340> video<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.000> gif<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:43.560> must<00:03:44.220> change

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
animation video the gif it must change

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.699 
animation video the gif it must change
the<00:03:45.060> pieces<00:03:45.480> as<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.900> goes<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.320> because<00:03:46.590> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
the pieces as it goes in because the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.620 
the pieces as it goes in because the
angles<00:03:47.100> there's<00:03:47.459> no<00:03:47.670> way<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.209> could<00:03:48.480> be

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
angles there's no way that this could be

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.650 
angles there's no way that this could be
exact<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:50.900> yeah<00:03:51.900> see
