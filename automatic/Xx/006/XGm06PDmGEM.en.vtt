00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.310 
colleges but we have an IED which is
pretty<00:00:32.759> much<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> exact<00:00:33.719> same<00:00:33.930> thing<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
pretty much the exact same thing as a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.160 
pretty much the exact same thing as a
bouncing<00:00:34.829> betty<00:00:35.120> but<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.480> doesn't<00:00:36.780> bounce<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
bouncing betty but it doesn't bounce it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380 
bouncing betty but it doesn't bounce it
just<00:00:37.350> beeps<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.770> blows<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:39.180> pretty

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
just beeps and blows up so that's pretty

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.670 
just beeps and blows up so that's pretty
cool<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.809> killed<00:00:40.020> me<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.170> few<00:00:40.350> times<00:00:40.469> in

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
cool it's killed me a few times in

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.810 
cool it's killed me a few times in
multiplayer<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.309> catching<00:00:41.579> me<00:00:41.670> off<00:00:41.700> guard

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
multiplayer just catching me off guard

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.750 
multiplayer just catching me off guard
and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> canister<00:00:43.980> bomb<00:00:44.160> which

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and then we have the canister bomb which

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.130 
and then we have the canister bomb which
is<00:00:44.879> an<00:00:44.969> explosive<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.690> thought<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> would<00:00:46.050> be

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
is an explosive I thought it would be

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
is an explosive I thought it would be
like<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> gas<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> name<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
like a gas just from the name and the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
like a gas just from the name and the
description<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> detonates<00:00:49.950> very

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
description but it detonates very

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.760 
description but it detonates very
shortly<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> don't<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> wait<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
shortly so you don't have to wait like a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.430 
shortly so you don't have to wait like a
son<00:00:53.039> tags<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> frag<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.600> blows<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:54.989> very

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
son tags or a frag it blows up very

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
son tags or a frag it blows up very
quickly<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.460> useful<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.969> you're<00:00:57.120> like

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
quickly which is useful if you're like

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.479 
quickly which is useful if you're like
in<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.809> emergency<00:00:58.079> situation<00:00:58.440> where<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.370> need

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
in an emergency situation where you need

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
in an emergency situation where you need
to<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.699> throw<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> room<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> clear<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> or

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
to like throw into a room to clear it or

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.889 
to like throw into a room to clear it or
something<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.730> those<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> lethal

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
something so that those are the lethal

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.500 
something so that those are the lethal
is<00:01:04.019> pretty<00:01:04.860> exciting<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
is pretty exciting then we have the

is pretty exciting then we have the
tactical<00:01:07.200> side<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.650> things<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
tactical side of things so we have the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.120 
tactical side of things so we have the
concussion<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.810> smoke<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.439> trophy

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
different things that it can do the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390 
different things that it can do the
first<00:01:21.090> three<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.770> increase<00:01:22.979> its

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
first three will just increase its

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.210 
first three will just increase its
effect<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.570> stun<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.040> into

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
effect of the stun but when you get into

up to like the max charge and like hold
it<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.310> long<00:01:29.579> it'll<00:01:30.150> actually<00:01:30.390> act<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.840> an

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it really long it'll actually act as an

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
it really long it'll actually act as an
EMP<00:01:31.619> grenade<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.070> made<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> whole<00:01:32.430> video<00:01:32.579> about

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
EMP grenade I made a whole video about

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.749 
EMP grenade I made a whole video about
it<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.360> thought<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.960> cool<00:01:34.759> yeah

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
it because I thought it was so cool yeah

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.210 
it because I thought it was so cool yeah
so<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.390> useful<00:01:36.600> pretty<00:01:37.200> awesome<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so it's pretty useful pretty awesome and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.429 
so it's pretty useful pretty awesome and
we<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> motion<00:01:39.090> sensor<00:01:39.509> which<00:01:39.720> when<00:01:40.200> an

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
we have the motion sensor which when an

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.590 
we have the motion sensor which when an
enemy<00:01:40.799> gets<00:01:41.340> into<00:01:41.610> its<00:01:41.729> range<00:01:42.060> it'll<00:01:42.360> actually

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
enemy gets into its range it'll actually

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.590 
enemy gets into its range it'll actually
mark<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.380> enemy<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.680> tagging<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.420> what<00:01:45.420> that

buildings<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.360> everything<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.320> shadow<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
buildings and everything the shadow of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
buildings and everything the shadow of
him<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.030> pretty<00:01:54.299> awesome<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:55.079> useful<00:01:55.439> if

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
him it's pretty awesome really useful if

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.929 
him it's pretty awesome really useful if
you're<00:01:55.649> trying<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> support

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
you're trying to be like a support

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.600 
you're trying to be like a support
player<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> thermobaric

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
player and then we have the thermobaric

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.120 
player and then we have the thermobaric
i<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.899> how<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.469> perhaps<00:02:01.680> i'm<00:02:02.009> not

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
i think is how you perhaps i'm not

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.899 
i think is how you perhaps i'm not
really<00:02:02.310> good<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.950> grenade

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
really good at this and it's a grenade

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.169 
really good at this and it's a grenade
that<00:02:06.270> creates<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.659> large<00:02:07.190> blast<00:02:08.190> radius<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that creates a large blast radius and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.950 
that creates a large blast radius and
this<00:02:09.810> pretty<00:02:10.140> much<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.649> weaken<00:02:11.280> armor

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
this pretty much to weaken armor

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.740 
this pretty much to weaken armor
the<00:02:12.650> easy<00:02:13.520> way<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.910> say<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.330> if<00:02:14.630> you're

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the easy way to say it so if you're

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.380 
the easy way to say it so if you're
about<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.050> go<00:02:15.200> inside<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.100> friend<00:02:16.700> into<00:02:17.360> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
about to go inside with a friend into a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.510 
about to go inside with a friend into a
room<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> they're<00:02:18.260> all<00:02:18.350> camping<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.400> can

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
room that they're all camping in you can

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.400 
room that they're all camping in you can
throw<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.760> couple<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.240> these<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.450> then<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.230> can

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
throw a couple of these and then you can

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.900 
throw a couple of these and then you can
rush<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.890> there<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.220> they<00:02:22.310> will<00:02:22.460> have<00:02:22.640> low

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
rush in there and they will have low

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.960 
rush in there and they will have low
armor<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.080> you'll<00:02:24.920> have<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.430> better<00:02:25.610> chance<00:02:25.730> of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
armor so you'll have a better chance of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.550 
armor so you'll have a better chance of
winning<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.270> gunfight<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.810> mean<00:02:27.290> it's<00:02:27.410> pretty

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
winning the gunfight I mean it's pretty

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.370 
winning the gunfight I mean it's pretty
awesome<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:29.090> actually<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> think

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
awesome and I actually like that I think

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.630 
awesome and I actually like that I think
it's<00:02:30.680> really<00:02:30.920> cool<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.130> they're<00:02:31.280> making<00:02:31.370> you

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
it's really cool that they're making you

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.130 
it's really cool that they're making you
think<00:02:31.910> about<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.420> you're<00:02:32.600> doing<00:02:32.630> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
think about what you're doing and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.900 
think about what you're doing and
actually<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.890> know<00:02:34.160> have<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.490> plan

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
actually like you know have a plan

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.660 
actually like you know have a plan
before<00:02:35.750> running<00:02:36.200> into<00:02:36.350> somewhere<00:02:36.980> which<00:02:37.430> is

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
before running into somewhere which is

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.000 
before running into somewhere which is
which<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.480> know<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.840> good<00:02:39.140> change<00:02:39.560> from

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
which is you know a good change from

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.980 
which is you know a good change from
what<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.030> usually<00:02:41.060> do<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.660> call<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.870> duty
