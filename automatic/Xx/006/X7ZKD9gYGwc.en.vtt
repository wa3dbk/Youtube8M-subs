00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.970
 big problem the whole business man 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.110
 store rooms 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 for gardeners and summer residents make up 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:17.039
 all kinds of predators and parasites wasps they in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:22.529
 In general, they do not pollinate, they interfere with life 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.410
 bee families need to fight them we 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.630
 big opponents of all chemical from 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.520
 wounds no chemistry we do not welcome 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.370
 either left to rely on the will of god 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.219
 as they say that's how people are in mean 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 It is supposed to be like this , and so will we 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 welcome need to intervene because 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 wasps can fly into 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 hive kill uterus family disappear big 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.399
 devastation 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.890
 big trouble with them need 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.829
 fight mechanically 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.590
 finding their nests is generally not that difficult 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.950
 find you will need to see where they fly 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:13.799
 wasps and then if a small nest 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:17.250
 it will be possible dichlorvos diesel 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.829
 you can wrap it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.320
 cellophane there tie the calculation do 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.350
 it will be possible just mechanically 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.159
 destroy well if you say so not 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.320
 are afraid 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.920
 fasting a little down below is okay 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 if it is here are you 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:44.170
 and keep in mind that the elk nest 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.140
 there will be no exit that is clearly 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.420
 see there are additional vents 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.459
 so on if you decide that with such 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.880
 nest can just fallen like there 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.979
 either a gas burner from yours only you 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.860
 I assure resuscitation do not end 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.990
 such cookies will fly out and if you are without 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.530
 heavily clothes it very much can be 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.039
 ovens 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.000
 this nest empty weighs somewhere around 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.230
 kilogram 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.660
 and how many of these wasps lived there 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.299
 Well, of course, there is also a way 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.840
 leave with caution take a big 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.019
 bag 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.769
 there on the prow there diesel or 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.459
 dichlorvos 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:31.239
 bring it up and slaughter it tight here 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.030
 but one bag is not enough because they 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.069
 his prediction 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.220
 need tight maybe double maybe 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.790
 be triple and it won't be easy anymore 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.590
 so shake out somewhere in the thickets 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.910
 there will not just crawl, they will 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.540
 attack you so in a good way 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.250
 It is such a thing as a just built 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:02.430
 one and a half trap she is good aviation 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:06.810
 dare she well pour sugar in there 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.359
 but maybe 3 4 tablespoons 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.690
 there we add some water to 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:18.790
 turned out thick syrup and add there 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.459
 some cooking they love the smell 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.650
 fermented apples all kinds of fruit so 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.659
 if there is a fresh beer which 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.959
 not turned with fruit can go there 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.870
 a little pour the jam will stand warm and 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.620
 will be just the smell they are 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.599
 adore 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:48.349
 and here are the results were the cake 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:52.579
 ossuse pour well you can and you are here 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.569
 and the procession here is hair possible 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.870
 arrange 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.810
 you can put near each hive 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.590
 dozens and as soon as they get wet 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.870
 paws get wet little wings she already 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.909
 bring him well, not who climbs it 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.319
 meteor again you can always even 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:17.000
 make a hole and for example some 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.769
 a thin wire or a needle 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.010
 then put something like that not 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.530
 will fly out exactly she tries to fly out or 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.039
 shoots and this delay will not be 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:33.979
 give them the opportunity to go out and regularly 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:36.710
 these traps you change she refresh there 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:40.729
 there will be a lot and put up to 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.289
 late pores and set traps need 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.330
 as early as possible in April 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.060
 appeared warm field flew first 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.510
 after that you can immediately set traps 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:57.289
 the bees in these traps do not climb here 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.139
 single bee that there is no single 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:05.330
 obtain and because the bees never 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:07.400
 climb on these all sorts of bottles need 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.280
 work they need to collect pollen and need 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.500
 collect honey and it's engaged and wasps 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.050
 therefore, it acts selectively and 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.630
 effectively assure you can now 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.260
 Pour to see there well and why and 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.320
 you will not die but such a mechanical 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.529
 the way it is at your discretion is very 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.449
 could be dangerous 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.449
 bye for now
