 good afternoon we see that we are going and 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.960

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:25.690
 but I want to thank justino compean 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.700
 Hector González a Cappella is the support 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.010
 unconditional and the trust that they have 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.830
 fact that they have had in my person and by 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.820
 course in my technical staff- thank 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.280
 to each of them 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.379
 roffé baths diego torrico doctor us 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.190
 missing here and see that it's still going to 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.910
 join this unconditional support because 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.030
 as he said this was not easy 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.089
 we have very little time we have the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.170
 expectation of a great inclusion of 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.470
 make a big list some great 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.100
 debate between us everyone had 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.970
 an idea suddenly different but at 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.729
 finally we come to a conclusion 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 which is we think the best for everyone and 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.990
 with what we are going to give bus 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.690
 we hear something that is already close to 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.659
 six years in the Spanish national team 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.250
 saying that it is very difficult for him 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.430
 I'd like to take 30 players but that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.570
 that phrase has to be coupled to 23 and a 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.900
 type who are 6 years old 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.880
 in the same selection 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.250
 and good for us with four months 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.970
 it has also been very very difficult and more 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.400
 for all that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.190
 what happened what has come 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.250
 happening 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.750
 but well we come to our conclusion 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.350
 we have here our our list 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.640
