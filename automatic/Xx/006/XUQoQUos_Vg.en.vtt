00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:23.960
 an is and is not in the vegetarian 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.240
 bible vegetarianism was practiced until 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.050
 the flood 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.390
 If you look in the garden, what 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.410
 so is the divine instruction for Adam and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.100
 Eve 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.140
 everything that grows all the trees - the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.000
 open the fruit of the knowledge of good and 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:47.150
 of evil are your dreams your friends 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.809
 is everything that is born until all good fruits 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.089
 Finally, all the fruits and vegetables 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:58.820
 all suitable for consumption in any 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:00.920
 Moment, God, your Adam and Eve, animals to 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.869
 eat 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.909
 the first time a slaughter was 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.909
 precisely to cover the two 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.110
 for his nudity god gave him skins 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.560
 to cover 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:19.160
 but not instruction on the consumption of 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:23.290
 even flesh is gone from the ark 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:28.400
 then god gave noah and his seed 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.990
 also the animals for consumption 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.570
 then vegetarianism the early years 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.780
 centuries and there we do not know how long 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.300
 between adão is not the disk disk that this 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.050
 is debatable to no-vegetarianism for 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.280
 here 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.400
 God gave us the right of right 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:57.350
 consuming meat is part of 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.549
 now whoever says otherwise is not going to 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.150
 find a biblical basis for it will not 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.599
 so much that Paul said everything is lawful and 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.060
 he paulo's discussion was whether he could 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.909
 eating meat offered to idols but in 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.510
 no time paulo discusses whether you can or 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:21.019
 not eating meat that was practically 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.779
 can obviously consume meat but can not 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.079
 In case of paulo he is discussing the 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:28.069
 the origin of this meat if it came is 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.140
 someone who 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.549
 first made the offer and blues to 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.420
 then and that has to happen right is 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.400
 let 's say acarajé 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.409
 if you are going to buy a face already in the bay 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.760
 probably if the load is already 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.299
 solved is not 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.780
 or was offered is this discussion 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.670
 What does paulo treat but in no time? 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.889
 Paulo discusses whether or not it is legitimate to eat 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.840
 then argue that the 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.980
 vegetarianism is a Christian who eats meat 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.150
 It's a sin, I'm sorry, but you are. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.150
 reading a bible that is not mine
