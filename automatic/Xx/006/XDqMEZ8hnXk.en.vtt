00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.159
 reasons why the sums include 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.069
 I then certainly get no nice cameras 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:47.890

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:50.540
 you have to be 15 years old and who they are 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.700

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.430

 on Sunday they are sold and that goes 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.760
 in itself very well 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.620

 at the same time crisis or is it that we 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.980
 Spend less money for I think 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.280
