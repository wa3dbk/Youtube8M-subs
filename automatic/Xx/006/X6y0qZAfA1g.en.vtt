00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
however I'm so used to it now when I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.280 
however I'm so used to it now when I
cook<00:02:43.889> here<00:02:44.889> you<00:02:45.790> know<00:02:45.909> I<00:02:45.939> do<00:02:46.030> my<00:02:46.209> dishes<00:02:46.389> but

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
cook here you know I do my dishes but

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.009 
cook here you know I do my dishes but
when<00:02:48.280> my<00:02:48.400> daughter<00:02:48.639> comes<00:02:48.879> over<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.450> she

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
when my daughter comes over here she

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.990 
when my daughter comes over here she
doesn't<00:02:50.379> do<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:50.590> dishes<00:02:50.769> over<00:02:51.099> here<00:02:51.250> cuz<00:02:51.489> she

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
doesn't do the dishes over here cuz she

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.129 
doesn't do the dishes over here cuz she
gets<00:02:52.150> really<00:02:52.299> really<00:02:52.599> frustrated<00:02:53.079> because

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
gets really really frustrated because

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.140 
gets really really frustrated because
she's<00:02:53.439> used<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.889> two<00:02:54.099> sinks<00:02:54.489> over<00:02:54.639> there

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
she's used to the two sinks over there

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.080 
she's used to the two sinks over there
so<00:02:57.090> she<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.620> trade-off<00:02:59.889> if<00:03:00.400> we<00:03:00.939> eat

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
so she that's the trade-off if we eat

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.349 
so she that's the trade-off if we eat
over<00:03:01.359> here<00:03:01.389> and<00:03:02.760> she<00:03:03.760> likes<00:03:03.939> that<00:03:04.150> because

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
over here and she likes that because

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.869 
over here and she likes that because
then<00:03:04.510> she<00:03:04.599> doesn't<00:03:04.840> do<00:03:05.079> dishes<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:06.220> that's

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
then she doesn't do dishes so that's

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.960 
then she doesn't do dishes so that's
kind<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.150> annoying<00:03:08.849> let's<00:03:09.849> see<00:03:10.150> my<00:03:10.930> oven<00:03:11.970> well

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970

that I that I have will draw ants if

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.150 
that I that I have will draw ants if
it's<00:04:52.910> like<00:04:53.750> sugar<00:04:54.380> or<00:04:54.880> syrup<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:57.160> sometimes

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
it's like sugar or syrup and sometimes

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.040 
it's like sugar or syrup and sometimes
I've<00:04:58.280> had<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.550> issues<00:04:58.820> sometimes<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.389> don't

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
I've had the issues sometimes I don't

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.250 
I've had the issues sometimes I don't
lately<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:02.169> like<00:05:03.169> had<00:05:04.100> syrup<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.930> bottle

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
lately I like had syrup and the bottle

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.290 
lately I like had syrup and the bottle
was<00:05:06.380> all<00:05:06.500> tight<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:06.800> everything<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:07.940> for

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
was all tight and everything but for

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.000 
was all tight and everything but for
some<00:05:08.449> reason<00:05:08.690> I<00:05:08.750> guess<00:05:08.930> there<00:05:09.500> was<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.650> little

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
some reason I guess there was a little

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.290 
some reason I guess there was a little
bit<00:05:10.130> of<00:05:10.310> syrup<00:05:10.850> on<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.240> little<00:05:11.539> lip<00:05:12.500> part<00:05:12.740> and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
bit of syrup on the little lip part and

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.469 
bit of syrup on the little lip part and
hands<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.990> I<00:05:15.620> think<00:05:15.949> I<00:05:16.610> finally<00:05:16.940> got<00:05:17.120> rid<00:05:17.419> of

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
hands and I think I finally got rid of

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.029 
hands and I think I finally got rid of
most<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.930> my<00:05:18.020> ants

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039
