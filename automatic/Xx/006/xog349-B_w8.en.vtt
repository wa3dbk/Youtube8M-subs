entire movie anything all the way up to
an<00:00:17.380> entire<00:00:17.590> gig<00:00:17.920> you<00:00:18.130> can<00:00:18.250> even<00:00:18.369> go<00:00:18.580> you<00:00:19.060> know<00:00:19.180> I

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
an entire gig you can even go you know I

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.609 
an entire gig you can even go you know I
think<00:00:19.390> I<00:00:19.570> did<00:00:19.689> a<00:00:19.720> movie<00:00:19.930> about<00:00:20.019> a<00:00:20.140> gig<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:20.560> a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
think I did a movie about a gig and a

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.920 
think I did a movie about a gig and a
half<00:00:20.800> um<00:00:21.340> um<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:22.090> this<00:00:22.360> is<00:00:22.420> the<00:00:22.570> easiest<00:00:22.750> way

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
half um um and this is the easiest way

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.990 
half um um and this is the easiest way
so<00:00:22.990> you<00:00:23.200> can<00:00:23.380> do<00:00:23.530> SVM<00:00:23.920> if<00:00:24.010> you<00:00:24.100> want<00:00:24.310> to<00:00:24.490> but<00:00:24.850> the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
so you can do SVM if you want to but the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.840 
so you can do SVM if you want to but the
main<00:00:25.300> setting<00:00:26.260> that<00:00:26.770> is<00:00:26.950> behind<00:00:27.160> us<00:00:27.490> beam<00:00:27.670> is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
main setting that is behind us beam is

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.910 
main setting that is behind us beam is
actually<00:00:27.970> Wi-Fi<00:00:28.510> direct<00:00:28.810> Wi-Fi<00:00:29.320> direct<00:00:29.650> is

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
actually Wi-Fi direct Wi-Fi direct is

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.769 
actually Wi-Fi direct Wi-Fi direct is
actually<00:00:30.250> what<00:00:30.430> sends<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.000> file<00:00:31.240> when<00:00:31.750> you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
actually what sends the file when you

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.979 
actually what sends the file when you
when<00:00:32.289> you<00:00:32.379> use<00:00:32.529> s<00:00:32.739> beam<00:00:33.010> so<00:00:33.550> what<00:00:34.480> Wi-Fi<00:00:34.780> direct

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
when you use s beam so what Wi-Fi direct

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.990 
when you use s beam so what Wi-Fi direct
is<00:00:35.170> is<00:00:35.350> basically<00:00:35.559> kind<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.309> like<00:00:36.489> bluetooth

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
is is basically kind of like bluetooth

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.520 
is is basically kind of like bluetooth
on<00:00:37.180> steroids<00:00:37.630> so<00:00:37.750> let<00:00:37.960> me<00:00:38.020> show<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:38.230> guys<00:00:38.320> how
