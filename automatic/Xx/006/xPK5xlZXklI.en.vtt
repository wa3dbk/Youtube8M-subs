00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.080
 hello in the course of online decoration of 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.880
 today I am between plants and I am going to 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.830
 teach so much for those who have a hand 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.560
 as for those who do not a few tricks for 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.140
 watering them very simple we start with the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.630
 water you have to throw them always pour it 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.400
 on the earth you have to avoid touching 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.720
 the leaves are worth 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.430
 You must know what are the 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.890
 needs of plant varieties 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.800
 that you have to give them the level of 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.140
 water needed here now we must water 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.030
 it is best to do it at the last minute 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.510
 in the afternoon when the sun is already 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.519
 short that there is not a radiant sun that 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.350
 what you can do is one that our 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.929
 water will evaporate much faster with what 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.969
 which plants are drying and two are going to 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.890
 avoid the magnifying effect of those droplets 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.539
 that can stay on the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.179
 leaves of our plants and that with the 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.429
 sun can burn them for 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.890
 refresh the part of the leaves what 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:06.030
 we are going to do is to pulverize we are going to 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 pour water with a spray 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.670
 we already know then water on earth 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.990
 sprayer for the leaves and the best 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.560
 time to water at the last minute of the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.210
 late 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.250
 if you have an automatic watering program 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.990
 the best in the morning in the early morning 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.750
 as at four or five o'clock 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 dawn if we're going to go a few days what 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 it's better to group all the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.850
 plants in a corner that way what 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.800
 what we are going to achieve is that a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.409
 kind of microclimate and that between them 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.569
 humidity is maintained 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.520
 what do we do if we go on vacation 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.069
 we go a weekend we have to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 leave them with water homemade trick a 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.840
 We put the cap on the bottle 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.950
 of water and we make a hole in the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.890
 stopper face down we're going to nail it in 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.569
 soil from our pots that way 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 the plant will go sucking will go 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.609
 drinking as needed the water another 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.099
 home trick we take a container a 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.140
 We fill it with water and a wick 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.520
 of cotton that you will not find in 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.679
 hardware stores and also in centers of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.929
 specialized gardening we cut a 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.509
 wick that wick what we do is that the 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.269
 let's sink into the bowl of water that goes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.310
 to always be located to a topic at a 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.440
 measured a little bit higher than the one 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.239
 have our pot and that wick that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.549
 is united in the water we also go to 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.920
 bury in the earth of our flowerpot 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.079
 so the cotton wick is going to make us 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.840
 of water conductor that the plant 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.579
 sucking as needed also and in the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.500
 case of indoor plants because 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.079
 not all can be left out what 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.940
 can do is gather the grouping 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.150
 all together equal for example in the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.939
 bath 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.129
 in the sink we can leave them either 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.470
 with a water finger at the base so that 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.720
 also go catching we can soak 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.819
 some towels and place them around 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.409
 between the pots so that it is created 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.379
 also humidity and that in a certain way 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.500
 they can be fed when 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.390
 leave them all inside not 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.310
 you can leave closed because if not 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.260
 no ventilation can even be more 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.150
 negative so remember that where 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.560
 you are leaving the door open like this 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.569
 you can leave a window 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.579
 open much better are a few 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.280
 tricks that sure your plants 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.440
 thank you so I say goodbye and I'm going to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.590
 be given a little water until 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.590
 then
