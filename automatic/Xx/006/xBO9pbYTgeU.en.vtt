way they'll be like oh well one of my

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740

flock members ate it it must be edible

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.410 
flock members ate it it must be edible
and<00:00:52.020> therefore<00:00:52.500> wanted<00:00:53.039> sometimes<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and therefore wanted sometimes just the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
and therefore wanted sometimes just the
fact<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> observing<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.410> eat<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> makes<00:00:55.980> them

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
fact of observing you eat it makes them

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
fact of observing you eat it makes them
think<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.520> oh<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> want<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
think that oh well I want what you have

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
think that oh well I want what you have
and<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.379> will<00:00:58.530> also<00:00:58.710> motivate<00:00:59.250> them<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> have

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and that will also motivate them to have

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
and that will also motivate them to have
some<00:00:59.879> interest<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> another<00:01:01.410> thing<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
some interest in it another thing is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
some interest in it another thing is
that<00:01:01.800> grades<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.579> constantly<00:01:03.030> keep

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that grades are constantly keep

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.410 
that grades are constantly keep
competing<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.049> attention<00:01:04.280> or<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.970> parents

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
competing for attention or other parents

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
competing for attention or other parents
are<00:01:06.510> constantly<00:01:07.290> competing<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.799> attention

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
are constantly competing for attention

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
are constantly competing for attention
so<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.250> you're<00:01:08.369> paying<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.060> no<00:01:09.180> attention<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
so if you're paying you no attention to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.149 
so if you're paying you no attention to
another<00:01:10.049> person<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.710> house<00:01:10.890> you've<00:01:11.100> ever

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
another person in your house you've ever

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
another person in your house you've ever
been<00:01:11.369> having<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.729> conversation<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.750> birds

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
been having a conversation and the birds

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.570 
been having a conversation and the birds
just<00:01:13.170> escalating<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.860> noise<00:01:14.040> higher<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
just escalating the noise higher and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.649 
just escalating the noise higher and
higher<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.420> paying

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
higher it's because you're not paying

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
higher it's because you're not paying
attention<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.170> them<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.950> they're<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.490> trying

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
attention to them so they're just trying

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.030 
attention to them so they're just trying
to<00:01:17.790> find<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> compete<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to find a way to compete so one of the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
to find a way to compete so one of the
ways<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.880> Ronan<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.360> getting<00:01:21.689> a

ways if they see that Ronan is getting a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.480 
ways if they see that Ronan is getting a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
paper bag and semple it up and you can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
paper bag and semple it up and you can
see<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.140> watching<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:43.860> doing<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:45.090> then

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
lot of times will cause that same

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.570 
lot of times will cause that same
behavior<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.560> their<00:02:20.709> bird<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.099> imitation

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
behavior in their bird in imitation

again normally Ronan would happily Bob
with<00:02:24.730> me<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.300> think<00:02:25.390> again<00:02:25.900> he's<00:02:26.110> very

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349
