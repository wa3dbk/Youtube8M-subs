00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
shared with me which I had no knowledge

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.890 
shared with me which I had no knowledge
of<00:00:23.250> which<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.970> often<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> case<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.570> JJ<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900

that is that did you guys know that the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.740 
that is that did you guys know that the
new<00:00:27.449> vchera<00:00:27.930> CPUs<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:29.130> AMD<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:30.300> PCI

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
new vchera CPUs from AMD have PCI

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.720 
new vchera CPUs from AMD have PCI
Express<00:00:30.990> gen3<00:00:31.199> support<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:32.189> correct<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
Express gen3 support that's correct I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.810 
Express gen3 support that's correct I
had<00:00:33.420> no<00:00:33.540> idea<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.110> JJ<00:00:34.350> knew<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.670> he's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
had no idea but JJ knew and now he's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
had no idea but JJ knew and now he's
going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> tell<00:00:36.210> us<00:00:36.239> exactly<00:00:36.680> why<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.040> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
going to tell us exactly why it is that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.560 
going to tell us exactly why it is that
Asus<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.879> able<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.329> pull<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.379> performance

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
Asus was able to pull that performance

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.569 
Asus was able to pull that performance
from<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.750> architecture<00:00:43.350> today<00:00:43.620> uh<00:00:44.100> yeah<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
from the architecture today uh yeah the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
from the architecture today uh yeah the
only<00:00:44.700> sense<00:00:45.030> yeah<00:00:45.360> no<00:00:45.570> definitely<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.960> mean<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
only sense yeah no definitely I mean the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.630 
only sense yeah no definitely I mean the
big<00:00:46.320> thing<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.649> always<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.460> guys<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
big thing like always for you guys that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.950 
big thing like always for you guys that
probably<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> world's<00:00:48.809> largest

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
probably know we are the world's largest

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
probably know we are the world's largest
motherboard<00:00:49.500> manufacturer<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.640> an

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
motherboard manufacturer and we have an

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.150 
motherboard manufacturer and we have an
outstanding<00:00:50.969> rd<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.110> engineering<00:00:52.860> team<00:00:53.010> when

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
outstanding rd and engineering team when

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
outstanding rd and engineering team when
it<00:00:53.250> comes<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> motherboard<00:00:53.670> design<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.420> we

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it comes to motherboard design so we

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.270 
it comes to motherboard design so we
were<00:00:54.960> able<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.350> ahead<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.620> analyze<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
were able to go ahead and analyze that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.830 
were able to go ahead and analyze that
and<00:00:56.340> verify<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.690> support

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and verify that we have that support

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.750 
and verify that we have that support
there<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.250> essentially<00:00:59.550> just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
there so you know we essentially just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
there so you know we essentially just
wanted<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> put<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.390> play<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:01.079> be

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
wanted to put it in play and actually be

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.930 
wanted to put it in play and actually be
able<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> market<00:01:02.129> actually<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> gen<00:01:02.730> 3

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
able to put to market actually a gen 3

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.149 
able to put to market actually a gen 3
enabled<00:01:03.300> AMD<00:01:03.629> motherboard<00:01:03.830> now<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> reality

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
enabled AMD motherboard now the reality

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.380 
enabled AMD motherboard now the reality
is<00:01:05.400> we're<00:01:05.549> definitely<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> person<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
is we're definitely the person was to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
is we're definitely the person was to
say<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.869> performance<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> reality

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
say that you know performance in reality

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.980 
say that you know performance in reality
is<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.330> impacted<00:01:09.840> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
is not going to be really impacted so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.270 
is not going to be really impacted so
you're<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.380> Sun<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.189> know

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you're not all Sun going to get you know

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609 
you're not all Sun going to get you know
twenty<00:01:11.580> percent<00:01:11.850> increase<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.240> fps<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:13.409> you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
twenty percent increase in fps but you

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
twenty percent increase in fps but you
know<00:01:13.740> we've<00:01:14.430> worked<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> lot<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> other

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
of the feature set it's going to be

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.359 
of the feature set it's going to be
pretty<00:01:55.110> similar<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:55.979> some<00:01:56.159> other

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
pretty similar but there are some other

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.980 
pretty similar but there are some other
additional<00:01:56.850> differences<00:01:57.600> between<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.960> two

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
additional differences between the two

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.160 
additional differences between the two
ports<00:01:58.290> ok<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.610> let's<00:01:59.850> take<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> look<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:01.020> have

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
ports ok so let's take a look we have

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.569 
ports ok so let's take a look we have
two<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:01.860> actually<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.340> got<00:02:02.460> this

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
two of them here actually we got this

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.980 
two of them here actually we got this
one<00:02:02.790> right<00:02:02.969> here<00:02:03.030> which<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.509> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> set

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
one right here which is just kind of set

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
one right here which is just kind of set
up<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> demo<00:02:04.530> let<00:02:04.920> me<00:02:05.009> also<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.549> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
up for a demo let me also have one that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300 
up for a demo let me also have one that
is<00:02:05.850> running<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.689> good<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:07.619> over<00:02:07.799> there<00:02:07.979> on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
is running and good to go over there on

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.490 
is running and good to go over there on
the<00:02:08.459> left<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.720> far<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:09.959> some<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.289> just

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the left and as far as some of the just

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.750 
the left and as far as some of the just
difference<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.129> course<00:02:11.250> we've<00:02:11.489> gone<00:02:11.640> ahead

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
difference is of course we've gone ahead

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.300 
difference is of course we've gone ahead
and<00:02:11.879> actual

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
and actual

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.130 
and actual
with<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.640> new<00:02:12.910> thermal<00:02:13.360> solution<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:13.989> have

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
with a new thermal solution that we have

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.140 
with a new thermal solution that we have
in<00:02:14.260> place<00:02:14.470> we've<00:02:15.160> reintroduced<00:02:15.700> actually<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
in place we've reintroduced actually the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360 
in place we've reintroduced actually the
ceramics<00:02:16.690> coating<00:02:17.080> technology<00:02:17.650> which<00:02:18.190> hasn't

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
ceramics coating technology which hasn't

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.010 
ceramics coating technology which hasn't
always<00:02:18.640> been<00:02:18.790> consistent<00:02:19.390> on<00:02:19.450> all<00:02:19.599> TV<00:02:19.810> to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
always been consistent on all TV to

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.990 
always been consistent on all TV to
sports<00:02:20.319> but<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.830> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.310> hallmark<00:02:21.880> of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
sports but it is kind of a hallmark of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.120 
sports but it is kind of a hallmark of
potential<00:02:22.630> saber-tooth<00:02:23.020> product<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.980> we've

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
potential saber-tooth product so we've

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.500 
potential saber-tooth product so we've
gone<00:02:24.250> ahead<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.520> brought<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.940> back<00:02:25.150> here

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
gone ahead and brought that back here

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.360 
gone ahead and brought that back here
and<00:02:25.630> we've<00:02:26.170> also<00:02:26.349> gone<00:02:26.560> ahead<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.830> create

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
and we've also gone ahead and create

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520 
and we've also gone ahead and create
increased<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.420> hits<00:02:28.599> heat<00:02:29.080> dissipation

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
increased the hits heat dissipation

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.559 
increased the hits heat dissipation
abilities<00:02:30.010> for<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.880> actual<00:02:31.090> southbridge

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
abilities for the actual southbridge

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.780 
abilities for the actual southbridge
area<00:02:31.930> as<00:02:32.080> well<00:02:32.530> as<00:02:32.590> added<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.280> additional

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
area as well as added this additional

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.820 
area as well as added this additional
heat<00:02:33.940> dissipation<00:02:34.360> plate<00:02:34.840> which<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.680> also

we<00:04:02.139> have<00:04:02.170> one<00:04:02.620> other<00:04:02.859> piece<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.280> hardware

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
we have one other piece of hardware

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.030 
we have one other piece of hardware
we're<00:04:03.850> going<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.030> sort<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.530> stride<00:04:05.530> along<00:04:05.709> over

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
we're going to sort of stride along over

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.430 
we're going to sort of stride along over
this<00:04:06.160> way<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.489> is<00:04:06.639> another<00:04:07.260> AMD<00:04:08.260> based

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
this way this is another AMD based

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.770

details and this is the UK and this is
sort<00:04:13.630> of<00:04:13.660> an<00:04:13.780> all-in-one<00:04:14.049> it's<00:04:14.319> got<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.680> CPU

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
sort of an all-in-one it's got the CPU

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.009 
sort of an all-in-one it's got the CPU
GPU<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.209> motherboard<00:04:16.600> all<00:04:16.720> integrated

GPU and motherboard all integrated

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.229 
GPU and motherboard all integrated
correct<00:04:17.530> them<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:18.430> we're<00:04:19.000> looking<00:04:19.090> at

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
correct them so we're looking at

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.089 
correct them so we're looking at
mini-itx<00:04:19.690> form<00:04:20.200> factor<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.830> is<00:04:20.979> an

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
mini-itx form factor so this is an

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.380 
mini-itx form factor so this is an
update<00:04:21.340> for<00:04:21.430> anybody<00:04:21.760> that's<00:04:21.789> familiar<00:04:22.090> with

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
45 based mini-itx motherboards that were

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.659 
45 based mini-itx motherboards that were
based<00:04:26.210> off<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.630> e<00:04:26.870> or<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.710> APU<00:04:28.280> that's
