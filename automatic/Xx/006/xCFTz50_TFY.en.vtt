one here doesn't come with the intake
bowl<00:00:58.949> ring<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.969> guessing<00:01:00.300> these<00:01:00.629> ones

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
bowl ring or are you guessing these ones

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.150 
bowl ring or are you guessing these ones
are<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.109> oil<00:01:01.289> pump<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.890> don't<00:01:02.070> know

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
are for oil pump because I don't know

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.560 
are for oil pump because I don't know
where<00:01:02.280> else<00:01:03.290> it<00:01:04.290> would<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:05.000> seals<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.360> ol

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
where else it would have seals or ol

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.109 
where else it would have seals or ol
rings<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.930> mean<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.729> guessing<00:01:08.729> those<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:09.000> put

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
rings I mean so guessing those are put

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.289 
rings I mean so guessing those are put
oil<00:01:09.299> pump<00:01:09.630> which<00:01:10.040> goes<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.340> into<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
oil pump which goes right into there so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.120 
oil pump which goes right into there so
which<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.229> somewhere<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.040> these

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
which I got somewhere in one of these

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.719 
which I got somewhere in one of these
boxes<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.689> box<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
boxes here so box right there with the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
completely toast you can actually
physically<00:01:45.930> feel<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> play<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:46.920> they're

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
before had no o-rings on it so I'm sure

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
before had no o-rings on it so I'm sure
of<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.100> door<00:01:56.250> rings<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.909> place<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.540> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of it door rings just going place here I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.499 
of it door rings just going place here I
still<00:01:57.930> got<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> look<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> parts<00:01:58.710> diagram

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
still got to look at the parts diagram

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.289 
still got to look at the parts diagram
just<00:02:00.619> check<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.799> old<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.240> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
just check that old but it's kind of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
just check that old but it's kind of
funny<00:02:03.509> how<00:02:04.439> much<00:02:04.590> oil<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.009> leaking<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.399> an<00:02:05.549> oil

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
funny how much oil is leaking out an oil

funny how much oil is leaking out an oil
pump<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.329> also<00:02:07.229> burnt<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> line<00:02:07.950> off<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
pump but it also burnt a line off on it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.740 
pump but it also burnt a line off on it
so<00:02:08.929> most<00:02:09.929> likely<00:02:10.140> put<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.160> back<00:02:11.370> together

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
so most likely put this back together

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.720 
so most likely put this back together
later<00:02:13.750> on<00:02:13.960> today<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.530> was<00:02:14.830> going<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.160> port<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
later on today I was going to port it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.000 
later on today I was going to port it
out<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.180> kind<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> little<00:02:17.590> bit<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.890> fancy

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
out and kind of do a little bit of fancy

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.730 
out and kind of do a little bit of fancy
stuff<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.030> head<00:02:19.240> but<00:02:19.480> then<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.960> never<00:02:20.530> had

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
stuff to the head but then I never had

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.590 
stuff to the head but then I never had
time<00:02:21.240> also<00:02:22.240> my<00:02:22.540> great<00:02:22.990> angle<00:02:23.380> porting<00:02:23.890> uh<00:02:24.600> tip

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
time also my great angle porting uh tip

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.810 
time also my great angle porting uh tip
I<00:02:25.870> guess<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.410> could<00:02:26.590> call<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.920> never<00:02:27.430> ended<00:02:27.760> up

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
I guess I could call it never ended up

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.060 
I guess I could call it never ended up
coming<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.420> time<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.140> only<00:02:29.410> got<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.650> standard

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
coming in time I only got a standard

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.410 
coming in time I only got a standard

chances are that won't be till later on
in<00:03:16.360> winter<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.700> yeah

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
in winter so yeah

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.630 
in winter so yeah
let's<00:03:19.299> weigh<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.780> going<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:19.989> sit<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.640> just

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
let's weigh this is going to sit I just

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.400 
let's weigh this is going to sit I just
clean<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.090> up<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:22.450> pretty<00:03:22.720> much<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:23.019> all<00:03:23.170> the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
clean it up in pretty much just all the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.430 
clean it up in pretty much just all the
gaskets<00:03:23.860> okay
