walk<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> on

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.979 

first<00:00:28.590> remove<00:00:30.590> Yamaha<00:00:31.590> coil<00:00:34.250> two<00:00:35.250> bolts

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
first remove Yamaha coil two bolts

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.340 
first remove Yamaha coil two bolts
holding<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> frame<00:00:41.870> just<00:00:42.870> connect<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
holding it to the frame just connect the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
holding it to the frame just connect the
wires<00:00:44.809> disconnect<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> spark<00:00:46.379> plug

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.990 

and<00:00:52.690> then<00:00:52.840> we're<00:00:53.020> gonna<00:00:53.110> reuse<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:54.190> spark<00:00:54.790> plug

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
and then we're gonna reuse a spark plug

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.180 
and then we're gonna reuse a spark plug
boot<00:00:55.270> so<00:00:56.050> you<00:00:56.080> grip<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.410> wire<00:00:56.680> right<00:00:56.860> down<00:00:57.100> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
boot so you grip the wire right down the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
boot so you grip the wire right down the
boot

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
boot

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:08.040 
boot
then<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.350> unthread<00:01:01.950> spark<00:01:02.950> plug<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.960> you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
then you unthread spark plug there you

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.460 
then you unthread spark plug there you
go

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
go

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
go
you're<00:01:09.280> gonna<00:01:09.370> reuse<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.690> spark<00:01:10.960> plug<00:01:11.140> boot

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you're gonna reuse the spark plug boot

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.680
