00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.609 
as a 2000 Dodge Dakota v6 mega minute
lately<00:00:22.539> I've<00:00:22.630> been<00:00:22.720> having<00:00:23.020> some<00:00:23.169> starting

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
lately I've been having some starting

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.630 
lately I've been having some starting
issues<00:00:24.039> with<00:00:24.929> when<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.019> truck<00:00:26.230> started<00:00:26.590> up<00:00:26.769> it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
issues with when the truck started up it

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.749 
issues with when the truck started up it
would<00:00:27.880> just<00:00:28.119> immediately<00:00:28.390> sputter<00:00:29.109> to<00:00:29.380> about

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
would just immediately sputter to about

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.919 
would just immediately sputter to about
yeah<00:00:30.759> well<00:00:31.000> first<00:00:31.240> year<00:00:31.420> right<00:00:31.599> up<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.900> a

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
yeah well first year right up to a

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.140 
yeah well first year right up to a
thousand<00:00:32.470> rpms<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.160> would<00:00:33.309> sputter<00:00:33.670> down<00:00:33.879> to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
thousand rpms and would sputter down to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.479 
thousand rpms and would sputter down to
about<00:00:34.390> yeah<00:00:36.330> two<00:00:37.330> hundred<00:00:37.720> three<00:00:38.170> hundred<00:00:38.489> and

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
about yeah two hundred three hundred and

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.070 
about yeah two hundred three hundred and
it<00:00:39.670> would<00:00:39.760> shut<00:00:39.940> off<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.360> keep<00:00:40.690> doing<00:00:40.839> that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
it would shut off and keep doing that

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.080 
it would shut off and keep doing that
you'd<00:00:41.230> have<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.500> continuously<00:00:42.430> keep<00:00:42.550> revving

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
you'd have to continuously keep revving

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.529 
you'd have to continuously keep revving
it<00:00:43.210> up<00:00:43.300> revving<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:43.809> up<00:00:43.899> revving<00:00:44.289> it<00:00:44.410> up<00:00:44.530> for<00:00:45.539> 10

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
it up revving it up revving it up for 10

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.450 
it up revving it up revving it up for 10
minutes<00:00:46.989> or<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.140> before<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.250> even<00:00:48.750> stay<00:00:49.750> going

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
minutes or so before it even stay going

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.340 
minutes or so before it even stay going
but<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:53.230> had<00:00:53.320> found<00:00:53.649> a<00:00:54.329> possible<00:00:55.329> fix<00:00:55.870> for<00:00:56.230> it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
but we had found a possible fix for it

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.319 
but we had found a possible fix for it
and<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.989> seems<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.440> work<00:00:59.590> so<00:01:00.070> far<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:01.120> is

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
and it seems to work so far that is

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.190 
and it seems to work so far that is
cleaning<00:01:02.109> off<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:03.059> idle<00:01:04.059> air<00:01:04.269> control<00:01:07.200> pretty

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
cleaning off the idle air control pretty

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320 
cleaning off the idle air control pretty
much<00:01:08.410> you'll<00:01:09.250> take<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:09.610> part<00:01:09.910> off

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
much you'll take this part off

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.300 
much you'll take this part off
I<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:13.740> luckily<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:14.770> was<00:01:15.210> anti<00:01:16.210> right<00:01:16.509> there

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I can luckily I was anti right there

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
I can luckily I was anti right there
quick<00:01:18.310> get<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.330> off<00:01:19.450> just<00:01:19.689> now<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.049> you<00:01:20.320> can<00:01:20.500> see

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.120 

right<00:01:26.350> back<00:01:26.680> here<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.810> got<00:01:29.020> your<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.979> know

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
right back here and got your you know

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.370 
right back here and got your you know
throttle<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:31.720> here<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> sensor<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
throttle right here is a sensor and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380 
throttle right here is a sensor and
here's<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.070> plug<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.340> goes<00:01:36.670> into<00:01:36.909> but<00:01:37.299> if

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
here's the plug that goes into but if

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.800 
here's the plug that goes into but if
you<00:01:37.479> take<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.780> sensor<00:01:38.200> off<00:01:38.350> ah<00:01:39.720> there's<00:01:40.720> a

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
you take the sensor off ah there's a

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.350 
you take the sensor off ah there's a
little<00:01:41.110> rod<00:01:41.290> about<00:01:41.590> this<00:01:41.799> big<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.970> sticks

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
little rod about this big that sticks

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.440 
little rod about this big that sticks
off<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.720> it<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:45.009> that<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.759> supposed<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.299> be

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
off of it and that is supposed to be

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.690 
off of it and that is supposed to be
kind<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.869> shiny<00:01:47.340> gold<00:01:48.340> color<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:48.909> uh<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:51.310> it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
throttle positioning sensor that was a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.060 
throttle positioning sensor that was a
culprit<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.250> our<00:02:12.549> problems<00:02:13.000> but

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
drafting their opposition sensors are

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.750 
drafting their opposition sensors are
not<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> darling<00:02:34.240> sensor<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.670> after<00:02:36.670> you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
not the darling sensor but the after you

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.790 
not the darling sensor but the after you
clean<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.450> or<00:02:37.660> replace<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:40.650> idle<00:02:41.650> air
