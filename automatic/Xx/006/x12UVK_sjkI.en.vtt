say file new and you can do maybe like

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.750 
say file new and you can do maybe like
2000<00:02:10.050> by<00:02:10.470> 2000<00:02:11.220> which<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> very<00:02:11.910> good<00:02:12.180> size

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
2000 by 2000 which is a very good size

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.080 
2000 by 2000 which is a very good size
but<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.920> know<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.489> gives<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.849> very<00:02:15.939> good

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
210 by 297 remember this is millimeters

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.759 
210 by 297 remember this is millimeters
you<00:02:30.879> want<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.209> go<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.420> pixels<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.500> it'll<00:02:32.739> show

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
you want to go to pixels and it'll show

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.539 
you want to go to pixels and it'll show
you<00:02:32.980> 2000<00:02:33.849> by<00:02:33.940> 4000<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.620> it's<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.950> very<00:02:36.190> big

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
you 2000 by 4000 so it's a very big

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.309

canvas<00:02:37.180> I'm<00:02:37.510> going<00:02:37.659> to<00:02:37.720> put<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.930> back<00:02:38.019> on

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
canvas I'm going to put this back on

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.080 
canvas I'm going to put this back on
millimeters<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.459> shaped<00:02:42.849> like

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
millimeters and it just it's shaped like

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.839 
millimeters and it just it's shaped like
a<00:02:43.239> normal<00:02:43.750> sheet<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.319> paper<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.859> if<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.609> look

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
a normal sheet of paper and if you look

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.330 
a normal sheet of paper and if you look
back<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.450> presets<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.650> change<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.220> to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
back on the presets and you change it to

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
back on the presets and you change it to
inches<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.970> will<00:02:49.150> say<00:02:49.450> 8<00:02:49.659> by<00:02:49.870> 11<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.470> that's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
inches it will say 8 by 11 and that's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.309 
inches it will say 8 by 11 and that's
the<00:02:50.769> normal<00:02:51.099> size<00:02:51.340> for<00:02:51.629> printer<00:02:52.629> paper<00:02:52.810> but

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
the normal size for printer paper but

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.660 
the normal size for printer paper but
anyway<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:55.530> can't<00:02:56.530> if<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:56.950> put<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.340> up<00:02:57.549> to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
anyway so I can't if I put this up to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.930 
anyway so I can't if I put this up to
500<00:02:58.450> which<00:02:59.079> was<00:02:59.349> how<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.859> was<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.340> tiny

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
500 which was how it was in the tiny

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.059 
500 which was how it was in the tiny
little<00:03:01.150> square<00:03:01.659> it<00:03:01.989> was<00:03:02.200> gigantic<00:03:02.709> it

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
little square it was gigantic it

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.000 
little square it was gigantic it
basically<00:03:03.819> took<00:03:04.000> up<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.389> whole<00:03:04.750> thing<00:03:05.260> but

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
basically took up this whole thing but

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.080 
basically took up this whole thing but
now<00:03:06.639> since<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.359> have<00:03:07.389> a<00:03:07.510> bigger<00:03:07.780> she<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:09.040> 500<00:03:09.909> is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
now since I have a bigger she the 500 is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.839 
now since I have a bigger she the 500 is
smaller<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.470> notice<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.069> quality<00:03:12.609> of<00:03:12.730> the

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
smaller but notice the quality of the

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.240 
smaller but notice the quality of the
line<00:03:13.090> now<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:13.720> very<00:03:14.139> smooth<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.950> when<00:03:15.129> you

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
line now it's very smooth and when you

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.509 
line now it's very smooth and when you
you<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.549> zoom<00:03:15.879> in<00:03:16.090> all<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.389> way<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.530> it'll

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
you can zoom in all the way and it'll

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.580 
you can zoom in all the way and it'll
take<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> very<00:03:19.060> long<00:03:19.359> time<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:19.690> before<00:03:20.199> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
take a very long time just before you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.309 
take a very long time just before you
start<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.010> see<00:03:21.220> those<00:03:21.400> little<00:03:21.639> itty-bitty

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
start to see those little itty-bitty

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.270 
start to see those little itty-bitty
squares<00:03:23.319> so<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:25.139> tend<00:03:26.139> to<00:03:27.239> use<00:03:28.239> bigger<00:03:29.280> canvases

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
squares so I tend to use bigger canvases

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.640 
squares so I tend to use bigger canvases
so<00:03:30.549> really<00:03:30.970> when<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.599> comes<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.989> siping<00:03:32.440> tool

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
so really when it comes to siping tool

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.720 
so really when it comes to siping tool
bigger<00:03:32.949> is<00:03:33.280> better

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
bigger is better

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.789 
bigger is better
alright<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.720> I'm<00:03:34.840> not<00:03:35.049> joking<00:03:35.319> about<00:03:35.620> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
alright and I'm not joking about that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.220 
alright and I'm not joking about that
unless<00:03:36.760> you're<00:03:37.120> making<00:03:37.480> something<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:37.930> has

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
unless you're making something that has

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.020 
unless you're making something that has
to<00:03:38.470> be<00:03:38.500> tiny<00:03:38.919> and<00:03:39.280> you're<00:03:39.519> working<00:03:39.910> with

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
to be tiny and you're working with

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.539 
to be tiny and you're working with
pixels<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.660> all<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.650> can<00:03:41.680> do<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:42.340> if

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
pixels and all that you can do it but if

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.180 
pixels and all that you can do it but if
you<00:03:43.239> want<00:03:43.510> better<00:03:43.780> quality<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.709> want<00:03:44.949> a

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
you want better quality and you want a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.430 
you want better quality and you want a
better<00:03:45.699> picture<00:03:46.030> without<00:03:46.389> being<00:03:46.750> annoyed<00:03:47.109> by

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
better picture without being annoyed by

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.710 
better picture without being annoyed by
all<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.709> Pixley<00:03:48.220> little<00:03:48.459> lines<00:03:48.699> the<00:03:49.480> best

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
all the Pixley little lines the best

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.490 
all the Pixley little lines the best
thing<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:49.959> do<00:03:50.199> is<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.560> make<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.889> canvas<00:03:51.160> larger

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
thing to do is to make the canvas larger

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.289 
thing to do is to make the canvas larger
so<00:03:53.500> that's<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.340> answer<00:03:54.639> to<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:54.970> question

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
so that's the answer to that question

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.720

to go to pixels and it'll show you 2000
by<00:05:56.490> 4000<00:05:56.940> so<00:05:57.330> it's<00:05:57.480> a<00:05:57.510> very<00:05:57.630> big<00:05:57.810> canvas<00:05:58.140> some

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
by 4000 so it's a very big canvas some

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.680 
by 4000 so it's a very big canvas some
of<00:05:58.350> its<00:05:58.470> back<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.650> millimeters<00:05:59.010> and<00:05:59.480> it<00:06:00.480> just

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
of its back on millimeters and it just

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.790 
of its back on millimeters and it just
it's<00:06:00.780> shapes<00:06:00.960> like<00:06:01.140> a<00:06:01.170> normal<00:06:01.410> sheet<00:06:01.590> of<00:06:01.710> paper

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
it's shapes like a normal sheet of paper

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.200 
it's shapes like a normal sheet of paper
and<00:06:02.040> if<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:02.340> look<00:06:02.460> back<00:06:02.610> on<00:06:02.730> the<00:06:02.790> presets<00:06:03.060> and

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
and if you look back on the presets and

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.430 
and if you look back on the presets and
you<00:06:03.330> change<00:06:03.570> it<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.720> inches<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:04.020> will<00:06:04.110> say<00:06:04.230> a<00:06:04.260> by

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
you change it to inches it will say a by

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.840 
you change it to inches it will say a by
11<00:06:04.680> that's<00:06:04.860> a<00:06:04.890> normal<00:06:05.100> size<00:06:05.220> for<00:06:05.460> printer

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
11 that's a normal size for printer

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.180 
11 that's a normal size for printer
paper<00:06:05.940> but<00:06:06.180> anyway<00:06:06.390> so<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:07.050> can<00:06:07.770> if<00:06:07.950> I<00:06:07.980> put<00:06:08.130> this

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
paper but anyway so I can if I put this

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.680 
paper but anyway so I can if I put this
up<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.340> 500<00:06:08.790> which<00:06:09.060> was<00:06:09.210> how<00:06:09.360> it<00:06:09.450> was<00:06:09.570> in<00:06:09.630> the

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
up to 500 which was how it was in the

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.060 
up to 500 which was how it was in the
tiny<00:06:09.990> ones<00:06:10.230> where<00:06:10.410> it<00:06:10.530> was<00:06:10.620> gigantic<00:06:10.920> it

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
tiny ones where it was gigantic it

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.140 
tiny ones where it was gigantic it
basically<00:06:11.370> talked<00:06:11.520> about<00:06:11.550> this<00:06:11.730> whole<00:06:11.910> thing

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
basically talked about this whole thing

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.570 
basically talked about this whole thing
but<00:06:12.540> now<00:06:12.840> since<00:06:12.900> I<00:06:13.200> go<00:06:13.290> bigger<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:14.040> 500<00:06:14.490> is

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
but now since I go bigger the 500 is

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.890 
but now since I go bigger the 500 is
smaller<00:06:14.820> but<00:06:15.210> notice<00:06:15.450> the<00:06:15.540> quality<00:06:15.660> is

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
smaller but notice the quality is

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.120 
smaller but notice the quality is
aligned<00:06:16.080> now<00:06:16.230> it's<00:06:16.410> very<00:06:16.620> smooth<00:06:16.890> when<00:06:17.070> you

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
aligned now it's very smooth when you

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.920 
aligned now it's very smooth when you
can<00:06:17.340> zoom<00:06:17.460> in<00:06:17.610> all<00:06:17.730> the<00:06:17.790> way<00:06:18.060> and<00:06:18.330> it'll<00:06:18.780> take<00:06:18.900> a

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
can zoom in all the way and it'll take a

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.030 
can zoom in all the way and it'll take a
very<00:06:19.080> long<00:06:19.170> time<00:06:19.350> just<00:06:19.380> before<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:19.800> start<00:06:19.950> to

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
very long time just before you start to

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.920 
very long time just before you start to
see<00:06:20.100> those<00:06:20.190> little<00:06:20.340> anybody<00:06:20.700> squares<00:06:21.180> so<00:06:21.600> I

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
see those little anybody squares so I

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.980 
see those little anybody squares so I
tend<00:06:22.590> to<00:06:22.800> use<00:06:23.610> bigger<00:06:23.820> canvases<00:06:24.660> so<00:06:24.780> really

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
tend to use bigger canvases so really

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.060 
tend to use bigger canvases so really
when<00:06:25.230> it<00:06:25.320> comes<00:06:25.440> to<00:06:25.500> size<00:06:25.620> paint<00:06:25.770> well<00:06:25.890> bigger

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
when it comes to size paint well bigger

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.390 
when it comes to size paint well bigger
is<00:06:26.190> better

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
is better

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.560 
is better
alright<00:06:26.760> and<00:06:26.880> I'm<00:06:26.940> not<00:06:27.060> joking<00:06:27.150> about<00:06:27.360> that

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
alright and I'm not joking about that

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.640 
alright and I'm not joking about that
unless<00:06:27.750> you're<00:06:28.080> making<00:06:28.260> something<00:06:28.410> that<00:06:28.560> has

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
unless you're making something that has

to be tiny and you're working with

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.010 
to be tiny and you're working with

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
pixels and all that you can do it but if

you want better quality and you want a
better<00:06:32.370> picture<00:06:32.520> without<00:06:32.730> being<00:06:32.910> annoyed<00:06:33.090> by

all the picky little lines the best
