this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.659> Hawaii<00:00:03.899> chapter<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.500> SEC<00:00:05.069> solo

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
this is the Hawaii chapter of SEC solo

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.480 
this is the Hawaii chapter of SEC solo
too<00:00:05.640> we<00:00:05.940> average<00:00:06.450> somewhere<00:00:06.990> between<00:00:07.460> 70<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
too we average somewhere between 70 to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.110 
too we average somewhere between 70 to
100<00:00:09.030> drivers<00:00:09.690> every<00:00:10.200> month<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:11.120> typically

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
100 drivers every month we typically

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.530 
100 drivers every month we typically
draw<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.660> run<00:00:13.469> all<00:00:13.710> year<00:00:13.830> round<00:00:14.179> all<00:00:15.179> months<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
draw a run all year round all months a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.000 
draw a run all year round all months a
year<00:00:15.770> well<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> at<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.250> start<00:00:18.770> you<00:00:19.770> told

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
year well at the at the start you told

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.640 
year well at the at the start you told
one<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.310> start<00:00:20.660> you<00:00:21.660> take<00:00:21.869> off<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.289> usually

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
one to start you take off and usually

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
one to start you take off and usually
you're<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.460> through<00:00:23.609> these<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.000> going

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
you're going through these you going

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.200 
you're going through these you going
through<00:00:24.420> gates<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.400> set<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.730> by<00:00:26.760> cones

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
through gates that are set up by cones

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.429 
through gates that are set up by cones
and<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> idea<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.050> between<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
and the idea is to go in between the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
and the idea is to go in between the
gates<00:00:28.650> without<00:00:28.800> hitting<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> cones<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.939> stay

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
gates without hitting the cones and stay

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.749 
gates without hitting the cones and stay
in<00:00:30.359> between<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.320> cones<00:00:31.500> stay<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> course

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
in between the cones stay on the course

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.450 
in between the cones stay on the course
i<00:00:33.020> have<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.520> 2003<00:00:35.520> mini<00:00:35.910> cooper<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.870> i<00:00:37.680> was

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
i have a 2003 mini cooper and i was

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
i have a 2003 mini cooper and i was
encouraged<00:00:38.910> by<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> other<00:00:39.600> mini<00:00:40.079> enthusiasts

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
encouraged by the other mini enthusiasts

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.150 
encouraged by the other mini enthusiasts
to<00:00:40.860> come<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.930> up<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.260> first<00:00:43.500> run<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> was

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to come out and up to my first run I was

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.790 
to come out and up to my first run I was
loved<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.629> course<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.500> initial

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
loved in this course here at the initial

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
loved in this course here at the initial
start<00:00:47.129> there's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> jog<00:00:47.670> left<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> jog

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
start there's a jog left and then a jog

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
start there's a jog left and then a jog
right<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.010> through<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.309> starting

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
right then you go through the starting

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
right then you go through the starting
time<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.629> that's<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> try<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.230> start

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
time and that's when you try them start

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130 
time and that's when you try them start
then<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.309> jog<00:00:53.610> left<00:00:53.850> again<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.809> reason

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
then you jog left again and the reason

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.529 
then you jog left again and the reason
for<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.320> stupid<00:00:55.800> speeds<00:00:56.039> down<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:57.210> try<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
for these stupid speeds down we try and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
for these stupid speeds down we try and
keep<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:57.840> safe<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.109> possible<00:00:58.460> we<00:00:59.460> want<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
keep it as safe as possible we want it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.389 
keep it as safe as possible we want it
to<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.149> no<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:01.050> than<00:01:01.289> 60<00:01:01.620> miles<00:01:01.800> an<00:01:01.949> hour<00:01:02.100> for

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to be no more than 60 miles an hour for

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
to be no more than 60 miles an hour for
a<00:01:02.460> very<00:01:02.670> short<00:01:02.730> period<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.890> most

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
a very short period of time if that most

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.929 
a very short period of time if that most
of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.580> course<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.909> only

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
of the time I want of course you only

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.679 
of the time I want of course you only
doing<00:01:06.210> 25<00:01:06.659> 30<00:01:06.990> 35<00:01:07.229> miles<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.890> hour<00:01:08.689> yeah

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
doing 25 30 35 miles an hour yeah

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.480 
doing 25 30 35 miles an hour yeah
smoothness<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> key<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.250> actually

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
smoothness is the key that's actually

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480 
smoothness is the key that's actually
the<00:01:11.850> key<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> whole<00:01:12.950> speed<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.280> if

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the key to the whole speed thing if

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
the key to the whole speed thing if
you're<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.760> smooth<00:01:15.090> you're<00:01:15.330> not<00:01:15.479> fast<00:01:15.810> if

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you're not smooth you're not fast if

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.980 
you're not smooth you're not fast if
you're<00:01:16.890> spinning<00:01:17.220> sliding<00:01:18.090> drifting

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you're spinning sliding drifting

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.499 
you're spinning sliding drifting
sideways<00:01:19.259> your

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
sideways your

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.649 
sideways your
as<00:01:22.509> most<00:01:22.689> of<00:01:22.840> solo<00:01:23.079> 2<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:23.759> zigzagging<00:01:24.759> and<00:01:25.450> then

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
as most of solo 2 is zigzagging and then

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.910 
as most of solo 2 is zigzagging and then
high-speed<00:01:26.619> transitions<00:01:27.359> so<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.500> otters<00:01:29.770> do

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
high-speed transitions so the otters do

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.200 
high-speed transitions so the otters do
that<00:01:30.100> very<00:01:30.280> well<00:01:30.460> they're<00:01:30.729> very<00:01:30.759> short

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
that very well they're very short

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.840 
that very well they're very short
wheelbase<00:01:31.619> they're<00:01:32.619> also<00:01:32.829> very<00:01:33.009> light<00:01:33.490> so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
wheelbase they're also very light so

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.300 
wheelbase they're also very light so
they<00:01:34.000> transition<00:01:34.719> well<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.979> fact<00:01:36.219> that

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
they transition well and the fact that

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.580 
they transition well and the fact that
the<00:01:36.520> car<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:36.939> pretty<00:01:37.179> close<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.479> 50<00:01:37.990> 50<00:01:38.350> weight

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
the car is pretty close to 50 50 weight

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.219 
the car is pretty close to 50 50 weight
means<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:40.030> driver<00:01:40.299> can<00:01:40.569> feel<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.020> car

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
means that the driver can feel the car

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.429 
means that the driver can feel the car
really<00:01:41.439> well<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:43.149> course<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:43.630> goes<00:01:43.899> up

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
really well the course then goes up

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.279 
really well the course then goes up
around<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.399> off-camber<00:01:45.939> turn<00:01:46.569> go<00:01:46.929> into<00:01:47.170> the

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
around the off-camber turn go into the

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.130 
around the off-camber turn go into the
right<00:01:47.500> then<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.490> went<00:01:48.700> through<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.450> couple<00:01:49.780> of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
right then you went through a couple of

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.839 
right then you went through a couple of
gates<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.740> left<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.069> right<00:01:51.250> gate<00:01:51.549> then<00:01:51.789> you

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
gates a left and right gate then you

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.100 
gates a left and right gate then you
went<00:01:52.000> through<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.179> slalom<00:01:52.479> which<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:52.959> just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
went through a slalom which is just

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.589 
went through a slalom which is just
individual<00:01:53.799> cones<00:01:54.009> spaced<00:01:54.549> out<00:01:54.729> about<00:01:55.030> 20

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
individual cones spaced out about 20

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.300 
individual cones spaced out about 20
feet<00:01:55.750> from<00:01:55.810> each<00:01:56.020> other<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.469> you<00:01:57.009> wind<00:01:57.219> your
