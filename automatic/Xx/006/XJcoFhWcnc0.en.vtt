00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
in place now let's see how to have a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.539 
in place now let's see how to have a
sound<00:03:04.400> open<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:04.970> door<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.860> notice<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.340> you

now<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.230> blinds<00:03:09.620> are<00:03:09.860> hitting<00:03:10.100> against<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
now the blinds are hitting against the

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.390 
now the blinds are hitting against the
the<00:03:11.959> rubber<00:03:12.170> ah<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> quiet<00:03:14.239> door<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:16.370> I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
the rubber ah you have a quiet door so I

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.680 
the rubber ah you have a quiet door so I
hope<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.700> helps<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.090> as<00:03:17.209> simple<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.570> that

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
hope that helps is as simple as that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.910 
hope that helps is as simple as that
it's<00:03:17.989> just<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.200> matter<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.440> putting<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.739> rubber

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
it's just a matter of putting the rubber

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.440 
it's just a matter of putting the rubber
stripping<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.430> there<00:03:19.579> so<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.880> blinds<00:03:20.120> hit<00:03:20.329> the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
stripping on there so the blinds hit the

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.980 
stripping on there so the blinds hit the
rubber<00:03:20.600> not<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.560> hardwood
