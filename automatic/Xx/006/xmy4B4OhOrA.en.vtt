00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
from the 3g service that I have right

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.609 
from the 3g service that I have right
now<00:01:45.610> because<00:01:46.539> I'm<00:01:46.690> not<00:01:46.810> going<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.020> be<00:01:47.110> using<00:01:47.320> it

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
now because I'm not going to be using it

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.550
