shadows of any kind whether they're
minerals<00:00:39.850> or<00:00:40.330> not<00:00:40.660> just<00:00:41.559> because<00:00:42.600> they

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
minerals or not just because they

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.439 
minerals or not just because they
usually<00:00:43.809> need<00:00:44.230> something<00:00:44.739> good<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.699> stick<00:00:46.150> to

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449

very<00:00:48.870> defined<00:00:49.870> line<00:00:50.260> as<00:00:50.470> you<00:00:50.559> can<00:00:50.589> see<00:00:50.860> on<00:00:50.949> this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
very defined line as you can see on this

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.430 
very defined line as you can see on this
side<00:00:51.339> I'm<00:00:52.120> gonna<00:00:52.269> take<00:00:52.510> some<00:00:52.690> tape<00:00:52.870> stick<00:00:53.320> it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
side I'm gonna take some tape stick it

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.930 
side I'm gonna take some tape stick it
on<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.620> back<00:00:53.769> of<00:00:53.800> my<00:00:54.040> hand<00:00:54.250> just<00:00:54.400> so<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:54.670> loses

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
on the back of my hand just so it loses

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.770 
on the back of my hand just so it loses
a<00:00:54.970> bit<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:56.440> extra<00:00:57.399> stickiness<00:00:58.390> just<00:00:58.660> so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
a bit of that extra stickiness just so

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.270 
a bit of that extra stickiness just so
it<00:00:58.899> could<00:00:59.079> not<00:01:00.030> remove<00:01:01.030> my<00:01:01.210> makeup<00:01:01.420> later<00:01:02.280> just

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
it could not remove my makeup later just

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.029 
it could not remove my makeup later just
thinking<00:01:03.640> enough<00:01:03.850> for<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:05.080> stick<00:01:05.560> on<00:01:05.740> and

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039
