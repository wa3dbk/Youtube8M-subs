hairspray or air spritz

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.500 
hairspray or air spritz
so<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.890> can<00:04:57.010> harden<00:04:57.430> up<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.910> toe<00:04:58.060> box<00:04:58.300> area

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
so it can harden up to the toe box area

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.170 
so it can harden up to the toe box area
that<00:04:59.290> that's<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.890> great<00:05:00.250> way<00:05:00.460> like<00:05:00.700> a<00:05:00.729> hardened

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
that that's a great way like a hardened
