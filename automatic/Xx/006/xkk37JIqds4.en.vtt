I'm here with Sylvan from relish guitars

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.229 
I'm here with Sylvan from relish guitars
from<00:00:24.970> Lucerne<00:00:25.329> Switzerland<00:00:26.759> tell<00:00:27.759> us<00:00:27.910> tell<00:00:28.210> us

from Lucerne Switzerland tell us tell us
what<00:00:28.419> you<00:00:28.509> brought<00:00:28.660> here<00:00:28.900> because<00:00:29.020> it's

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
what you brought here because it's

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.810 
what you brought here because it's
really<00:00:29.410> one<00:00:29.680> of<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.800> most<00:00:29.859> unique<00:00:30.160> guitars<00:00:30.609> on

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
really one of the most unique guitars on

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.369 
really one of the most unique guitars on
the<00:00:30.880> whole<00:00:31.029> floor<00:00:31.239> here<00:00:31.930> at<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.079> old<00:00:32.199> show

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
the whole floor here at the old show

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.979 
the whole floor here at the old show
thank<00:00:32.920> you<00:00:33.070> very<00:00:33.220> much<00:00:33.489> so<00:00:34.150> we<00:00:34.360> launched<00:00:34.750> for<00:00:34.960> a

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
thank you very much so we launched for a

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.500 
thank you very much so we launched for a
really<00:00:35.320> new<00:00:35.500> concept<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.670> manufacturing

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
really new concept of the manufacturing

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.350 
really new concept of the manufacturing
of<00:00:37.720> body<00:00:38.710> construction<00:00:39.100> in<00:00:39.550> electric<00:00:40.000> guitar

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
of body construction in electric guitar

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.509 
of body construction in electric guitar
so<00:00:40.930> you<00:00:40.989> easily<00:00:41.379> can<00:00:41.530> switch<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.040> pickups

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
so you easily can switch the pickups

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.119 
so you easily can switch the pickups
just<00:00:42.940> turning<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.390> on<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.570> off<00:00:43.930> or<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.920> just

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
just turning it on and off or you just

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.399 
just turning it on and off or you just
switch<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:45.519> like<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.089> so<00:00:46.690> it's<00:00:46.900> really<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.199> new

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
switch it like that so it's really a new

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.229 
switch it like that so it's really a new
approach<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:48.070> don't<00:00:48.280> need<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.579> volume<00:00:49.030> down

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
approach you don't need to volume down

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.479 
approach you don't need to volume down
you<00:00:49.510> just<00:00:49.750> turn<00:00:50.229> it<00:00:50.379> off<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.799> no<00:00:50.949> signal<00:00:51.369> is

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
you just turn it off and no signal is

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.820 
you just turn it off and no signal is
going<00:00:51.670> out<00:00:51.940> so<00:00:52.750> that's<00:00:52.869> one<00:00:53.170> thing<00:00:53.470> then<00:00:53.710> the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
going out so that's one thing then the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.950 
going out so that's one thing then the
other<00:00:53.979> thing<00:00:54.309> is<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.699> background<00:00:55.239> the

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
other thing is the background the

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.840 
other thing is the background the
Buckley<00:00:56.409> do<00:00:56.589> you<00:00:56.680> open<00:00:57.070> with<00:00:57.220> a<00:00:57.280> black<00:00:57.610> John

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
Buckley do you open with a black John

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.119 
Buckley do you open with a black John
really<00:00:58.239> easily<00:00:58.570> because<00:00:59.199> there<00:00:59.589> are<00:00:59.710> magnets

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
really easily because there are magnets

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.000 
really easily because there are magnets
underneath<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.540> leather<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.140> then<00:01:02.680> we<00:01:02.830> have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
underneath the leather and then we have

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.189 
underneath the leather and then we have
these<00:01:03.189> connectors<00:01:03.879> that<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.629> easily<00:01:04.839> can

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
these connectors that you easily can

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.010 
these connectors that you easily can
switch<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.770> pickups<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.549> your<00:01:06.850> own<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.479> the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
switch the pickups on your own and the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.410 
switch the pickups on your own and the
bridge<00:01:08.259> is<00:01:08.560> directly<00:01:09.189> on<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.490> frame<00:01:09.729> so<00:01:10.090> this

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
bridge is directly on the frame so this

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.170 
bridge is directly on the frame so this
one<00:01:10.720> piece<00:01:11.049> is<00:01:11.290> a<00:01:11.500> one<00:01:11.740> aluminium<00:01:12.040> plate<00:01:12.820> and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
one piece is a one aluminium plate and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.270 
one piece is a one aluminium plate and
we<00:01:13.299> cut<00:01:13.509> it<00:01:13.630> out<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:14.080> this<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:15.040> whole

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
we cut it out like this so the whole

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.179 
we cut it out like this so the whole
vibration<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.240> strings<00:01:16.860> distributes<00:01:17.860> and

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
vibration of the strings distributes and

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.640 
vibration of the strings distributes and
yeah<00:01:19.150> it<00:01:19.270> gives<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.600> lot<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.810> sustain<00:01:20.320> on<00:01:20.530> the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
yeah it gives a lot of sustain on the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.980 
yeah it gives a lot of sustain on the
whole<00:01:20.799> frame<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:22.030> battery<00:01:22.329> is<00:01:22.450> only<00:01:22.659> for

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
whole frame and the battery is only for

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.929 
whole frame and the battery is only for
the<00:01:23.109> relay<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.829> LED<00:01:24.280> light<00:01:24.549> and<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
the relay and the LED light and the

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.179 
the relay and the LED light and the
capacitive<00:01:25.630> sensors<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.469> have<00:01:26.619> seen<00:01:26.859> in

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
capacitive sensors that you have seen in

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.219 
capacitive sensors that you have seen in
the<00:01:27.280> front<00:01:27.579> that<00:01:27.939> you<00:01:28.060> can<00:01:28.240> switch<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
the front that you can switch the

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.849 
the front that you can switch the
pickups<00:01:29.619> so<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.869> real<00:01:32.439> approach

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
pickups so this is the real approach

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.349 
pickups so this is the real approach
that<00:01:33.189> we<00:01:33.310> launched<00:01:33.549> for<00:01:33.939> getting<00:01:34.210> more

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
that we launched for getting more

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.749 
that we launched for getting more
sustained<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.200> warm<00:01:35.439> vibrant<00:01:35.979> sound<00:01:36.249> on

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
sustained and the warm vibrant sound on

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.109 
sustained and the warm vibrant sound on
our<00:01:37.240> guitar<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:39.219> side<00:01:39.429> is<00:01:39.460> aluminum<00:01:39.999> as

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
our guitar so the side is aluminum as

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.749 
our guitar so the side is aluminum as
well<00:01:40.259> exactly<00:01:41.259> it's<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.409> one<00:01:41.799> piece<00:01:42.039> you

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
well exactly it's like one piece you

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.649 
well exactly it's like one piece you
have<00:01:42.969> seat<00:01:43.299> here<00:01:43.689> it's<00:01:44.079> really<00:01:44.439> one<00:01:44.679> plate<00:01:44.979> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
have seat here it's really one plate and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.989 
have seat here it's really one plate and
we<00:01:46.659> have<00:01:47.139> kind<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.770> sandwich<00:01:48.130> construction

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
we have kind of a sandwich construction

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.629 
we have kind of a sandwich construction
that<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.479> have<00:01:49.749> this<00:01:50.020> bottom<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:50.950> top<00:01:51.100> veneer

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:51.639 
that you have this bottom and top veneer

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:54.480 
that you have this bottom and top veneer
it's<00:01:52.119> like<00:01:52.329> five<00:01:52.659> layers<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.079> veneers<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.009> we

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
it's like five layers of veneers that we

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's like five layers of veneers that we
press<00:01:54.759> together<00:01:54.999> and<00:01:55.479> then<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.139> just<00:01:56.409> glue<00:01:57.130> it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
press together and then we just glue it

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.129 
press together and then we just glue it
on<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.520> frame<00:01:57.789> it's<00:01:58.329> kind<00:01:58.539> of<00:01:58.630> wood<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.960> use

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
on the frame it's kind of wood to use

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.649 
on the frame it's kind of wood to use
for<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.439> veneer<00:01:59.709> this<00:02:00.069> is<00:02:00.249> the<00:02:00.490> walnut<00:02:00.819> then

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
for the veneer this is the walnut then

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.690 
for the veneer this is the walnut then
we<00:02:01.780> have<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.139> cherry<00:02:02.499> and<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.889> as<00:02:03.280> she<00:02:03.549> would

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
we have the cherry and the as she would

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.139 
we have the cherry and the as she would
and<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.929> use<00:02:05.139> also<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.829> bamboo<00:02:06.249> fretboard<00:02:06.880> so

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
and we use also the bamboo fretboard so
