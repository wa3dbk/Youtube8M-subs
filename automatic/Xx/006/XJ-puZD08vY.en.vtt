a clippers and clipped them off on the
bottom<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:29.220> decided<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.939> wasn't<00:00:30.210> originally

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
bottom I've decided I wasn't originally

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.799 
bottom I've decided I wasn't originally
gonna<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.969> gonna<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.480> bridge

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
gonna have the gonna have the bridge

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
gonna have the gonna have the bridge
right<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.430> finally

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
right here but then I just finally

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.479 
right here but then I just finally
decided<00:00:35.940> looking<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.260> many<00:00:37.290> bridges<00:00:38.160> on

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
decided looking at so many bridges on

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.180 
decided looking at so many bridges on
cigar<00:00:38.969> box<00:00:39.239> guitars<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:41.040> they

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
cigar box guitars that I see that they

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.069 
cigar box guitars that I see that they
mount<00:00:41.460> them<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> body<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
mount them on the body I think the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.860 
mount them on the body I think the
vibration<00:00:43.620> must<00:00:44.090> be<00:00:45.090> better<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.719> it's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
vibration must be better if it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.430 
vibration must be better if it's
actually<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.440> soundboard<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.610> also

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
actually on the soundboard there also

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.749 
each notch and drew a lawn off so now I
have<00:01:41.390> my<00:01:42.390> frets<00:01:43.070> drawing<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> don't

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
have my frets drawing out here I don't

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.899 
have my frets drawing out here I don't
know<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> camera

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
know if you can see that on the camera

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.060 
know if you can see that on the camera
measured<00:01:47.909> perfectly<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.720> least<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> think

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
measured perfectly at least what I think

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.219 
measured perfectly at least what I think
is<00:01:50.189> gonna<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.520> perfect<00:01:50.810> we'll<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
is gonna be perfect we'll see how it

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.450 
is gonna be perfect we'll see how it
plays<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> try<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> cut

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
plays so now I'm going to try to cut

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.539 
plays so now I'm going to try to cut
some<00:01:53.640> notches<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.380> stick<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:58.549> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
some notches out so I can stick the the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.510 
some notches out so I can stick the the
nails<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.270> frets<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> we'll<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.369> how

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
nails as frets there and we'll see how

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.380 
nails as frets there and we'll see how
that<00:02:02.759> works<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:05.939> gonna<00:02:06.119> be

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that works and if that's gonna be
