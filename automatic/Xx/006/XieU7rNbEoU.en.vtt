feature<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.259> seed<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.830> does<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.219> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
feature of this seed but it does have a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.810 
feature of this seed but it does have a

disappointing<00:00:25.350> part<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
disappointing part about this is the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.310 
disappointing part about this is the
fact<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.880> there's<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.779> two<00:00:28.019> different

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
fact that there's that not two different

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.259 
fact that there's that not two different
types<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.619> trees<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.070> kind<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> makes

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
types of trees which kind of makes

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.209 
types of trees which kind of makes
little<00:00:30.510> annoying<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.560> my<00:00:31.679> opinion<00:00:32.239> but<00:00:34.219> that

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
little annoying in my opinion but that

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.330 
little annoying in my opinion but that
is<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.910> worst<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> worst<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:38.160> main

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
is not the worst not the worst the main

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.760 
is not the worst not the worst the main
feature<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.000> seeds<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.360> seed<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
feature of the seeds that seed that

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.750 

there<00:01:01.150> we<00:01:01.240> go<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:02.410> you<00:01:02.650> can<00:01:02.740> see<00:01:03.010> we're<00:01:03.250> on<00:01:03.400> land

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
there we go as you can see we're on land

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.870 
there we go as you can see we're on land
a<00:01:04.000> much<00:01:04.180> bigger<00:01:04.600> land<00:01:05.199> but<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:06.400> is<00:01:06.640> still

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
a much bigger land but this is still

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.880 
a much bigger land but this is still
part<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.540> chain<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:07.930> islands<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:08.500> makes<00:01:08.770> it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
part of a chain of islands that makes it

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.880 
part of a chain of islands that makes it
really<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:10.540> good<00:01:11.230> I'm<00:01:11.440> not<00:01:11.500> sure<00:01:11.770> what

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
really really good I'm not sure what

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.020 
really really good I'm not sure what
that<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.130> over<00:01:12.280> there<00:01:12.430> I<00:01:12.490> think<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:12.880> might

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
that is over there I think that might

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.610 
that is over there I think that might
actually<00:01:13.060> be<00:01:13.420> where<00:01:13.540> we<00:01:13.690> spawn<00:01:14.050> so<00:01:14.320> it's<00:01:14.440> not

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
actually be where we spawn so it's not

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.890 
actually be where we spawn so it's not
too<00:01:14.890> far<00:01:15.130> away<00:01:15.220> from<00:01:15.340> spawn<00:01:15.820> yeah<00:01:16.720> that's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
too far away from spawn yeah that's

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.030 
too far away from spawn yeah that's
definitely<00:01:17.080> where<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.410> spawned<00:01:17.770> one<00:01:17.950> was

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
definitely where we spawned one was

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.060 
definitely where we spawned one was
hunter<00:01:18.250> sent<00:01:18.430> positive<00:01:18.820> on<00:01:18.910> that<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.950> right

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
hunter sent positive on that all right

look at this it's like probably like 10
15<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.759> sometimes<00:01:58.420> even<00:01:58.690> more<00:01:58.840> depending<00:01:59.259> on

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
15 and sometimes even more depending on

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
15 and sometimes even more depending on
what<00:01:59.530> part<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.890> island<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.250> are<00:02:00.460> on

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
what part of the island you are on

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.190 
what part of the island you are on
blocks<00:02:01.840> above<00:02:02.200> sea<00:02:02.590> level<00:02:03.780> got<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> nice<00:02:05.020> little

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
blocks above sea level got a nice little

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.290 
blocks above sea level got a nice little
area<00:02:05.770> over<00:02:05.800> here<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.610> kind<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:06.910> reminds<00:02:07.240> me

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
area over here this kind of reminds me

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.800 
area over here this kind of reminds me
of<00:02:07.390> one<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.630> those<00:02:08.220> Islands<00:02:09.479> was<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.660> caught

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
of one of those Islands was it caught

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.780 
of one of those Islands was it caught
you<00:02:11.319> know<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.530> Swiss<00:02:11.830> Family<00:02:12.069> Robinson<00:02:12.280> is

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you know that Swiss Family Robinson is

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.710 
you know that Swiss Family Robinson is
like<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.270> old<00:02:13.300> movie<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.920> really<00:02:15.310> uh

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
like a really old movie really really uh

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.620 
like a really old movie really really uh
kind<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.810> reminds<00:02:17.110> me<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.380> type<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.010> place

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
kind of reminds me of that type of place

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.090 
kind of reminds me of that type of place
now<00:02:19.630> as<00:02:19.930> you're<00:02:20.050> going<00:02:20.230> around<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.560> island

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
now as you're going around the island

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.449 
now as you're going around the island
you<00:02:21.370> should<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:21.850> coming<00:02:22.209> across<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:23.459> ravine

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
you should be coming across a ravine

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.699 
you should be coming across a ravine
somewhere<00:02:25.209> trying<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.020> remember<00:02:26.200> exactly

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
somewhere trying to remember exactly

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.160 
somewhere trying to remember exactly
where<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.300> outskirts<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:29.050> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
where it's on the outskirts of the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.850 
where it's on the outskirts of the
islands<00:02:31.440> said<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.620> no<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:34.270> yeah<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.480> was<00:02:34.860> right

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
islands said it no but yeah it was right

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.910 
islands said it no but yeah it was right
over<00:02:36.010> here<00:02:36.310> got<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.330> nice<00:02:37.690> ravine<00:02:38.260> right<00:02:38.290> over

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
over here got a nice ravine right over

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.660 
over here got a nice ravine right over
here<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> really<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.740> top<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.040> I'm

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
here I really like it top of that I'm

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.860 
here I really like it top of that I'm
not<00:02:42.880> sure<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.270> just<00:02:43.390> cuz<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.690> shader

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
not sure if it's just cuz of the shader

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.380 
not sure if it's just cuz of the shader
pack<00:02:44.080> or<00:02:44.349> whatever<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.700> water<00:02:45.940> does<00:02:46.209> not

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
pack or whatever but this water does not

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.240 
pack or whatever but this water does not
want<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.780> down<00:02:46.959> unless<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.470> destroy<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.920> block

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
want to go down unless I destroy a block

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.850 
want to go down unless I destroy a block
in<00:02:48.520> which<00:02:48.610> case<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:49.030> probably<00:02:49.620> caused<00:02:50.620> me<00:02:50.770> to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
in which case it probably caused me to

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.320 
in which case it probably caused me to
have<00:02:50.950> some<00:02:51.160> framerate<00:02:51.430> problems<00:02:52.030> I'm<00:02:52.180> not

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
have some framerate problems I'm not

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.870 
have some framerate problems I'm not
sure<00:02:52.510> though<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.020> then<00:02:53.920> over<00:02:54.280> here<00:02:54.310> you've

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
sure though and then over here you've

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.120 
sure though and then over here you've
got<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:56.430> some<00:02:57.430> sugarcane<00:02:58.890> there's<00:02:59.890> other

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
got a some sugarcane there's other

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.860 
got a some sugarcane there's other
places<00:03:00.459> where<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.849> has<00:03:00.880> sugarcane<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.660> this

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
places where it has sugarcane on this

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.740 
places where it has sugarcane on this
island<00:03:02.349> but<00:03:02.920> that's<00:03:03.099> pretty<00:03:03.459> much<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:04.030> overall

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
island but that's pretty much it overall

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.710 
island but that's pretty much it overall
this<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.110> really<00:03:05.470> good<00:03:05.620> map<00:03:06.010> for<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:07.690> I

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
this is a really good map for or I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.860 
this is a really good map for or I
should<00:03:07.930> say<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.080> really<00:03:08.290> good<00:03:08.440> island<00:03:09.870> decent

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
should say a really good island decent

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.240 
should say a really good island decent
size<00:03:11.050> it's<00:03:11.350> oddly<00:03:11.590> shaped<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.810> has<00:03:14.710> a<00:03:15.040> lot

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
size it's oddly shaped and it has a lot

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.520 
size it's oddly shaped and it has a lot
of<00:03:15.280> high<00:03:15.910> peak<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:16.540> ever<00:03:16.690> for<00:03:17.590> your<00:03:19.200> for<00:03:20.200> pretty

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
of high peak so ever for your for pretty

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.990 
of high peak so ever for your for pretty
good<00:03:20.710> for<00:03:20.890> building<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.520> then<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:21.640> got<00:03:21.820> this

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
good for building and then you got this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.310 
good for building and then you got this
you<00:03:22.180> can<00:03:22.210> turn<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.720> like<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.870> pool<00:03:23.140> or

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
you can turn this in like a pool or

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.910 
you can turn this in like a pool or
something<00:03:24.810> yeah<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.020> pool<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.500> some<00:03:26.680> sort

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
something yeah a pool of some sort

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.310 
something yeah a pool of some sort
anyways<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:27.940> pretty<00:03:28.270> much<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.720> for<00:03:28.780> this

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
anyways that is pretty much it for this

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.180 
anyways that is pretty much it for this
seed<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:31.050> personally<00:03:32.050> really<00:03:32.440> love<00:03:32.710> to<00:03:32.860> see<00:03:33.100> it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
seed I personally really love to see it

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.820 
seed I personally really love to see it
if<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.790> ever<00:03:33.850> get<00:03:34.030> back<00:03:34.090> into<00:03:34.480> survival<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.470> tried

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
if I ever get back into survival I tried

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.630 
if I ever get back into survival I tried
doing<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.220> survival<00:03:36.490> stream<00:03:37.710> vanilla<00:03:38.710> but<00:03:39.490> it

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
doing a survival stream vanilla but it

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.360 
doing a survival stream vanilla but it
just<00:03:39.790> seems<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.210> boring<00:03:40.750> at<00:03:41.560> least<00:03:41.830> by<00:03:41.950> myself

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
just seems so boring at least by myself

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.660 
just seems so boring at least by myself
so<00:03:42.730> I'm<00:03:43.270> either<00:03:43.390> gonna<00:03:43.600> try<00:03:43.840> modpacks<00:03:44.590> or<00:03:44.950> I'm

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
so I'm either gonna try modpacks or I'm

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.730 
so I'm either gonna try modpacks or I'm
going<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.570> wait<00:03:46.720> until<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.260> can<00:03:47.440> play<00:03:47.620> it

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
going to just wait until I can play it

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.640 
going to just wait until I can play it
with<00:03:47.890> someone<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.430> know<00:03:48.550> um<00:03:49.500> other<00:03:50.500> than
