00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.090
 Historical background of biology 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.430
 for a better understanding it is divided into 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:28.410
 three great stages ancient biology 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.070
 modern biology and molecular biology 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.489
 ancient biology this stage comprises 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.580
 from prehistory to the middle ages 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.840
 in this first period of humanity 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.610
 the man was nomadic and did not know the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.040
 writing and for that reason is not known 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.040
 any document you tell us about 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.699
 biology so everything that is known 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.590
 of this era is based on studies of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.600
 human remains utensil paintings 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.990
 etc 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.890
 when the man discovered how he 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.440
 they reproduced plants and animals 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.130
 He devoted himself to agriculture and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.030
 livestock leaving the nomadic life and 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.149
 moving to a sedentary life stage 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.299
 the man began to observe the 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:30.590
 phenomena of nature such as 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:35.450
 rain the changes of seasons 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.719
 tides and so on to justify it 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.159
 attributed to the action of different 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.860
 gods and diseases attributed to him 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.610
 evil spirits 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.840
 this lasts until the fourteenth century before 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.910
 Christ here in this period appeared 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.490
 several philosophers called naturalist 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.490
 they observed the phenomena with 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.670
 precision and then interpreted the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.170
 origin of the world and of life from 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.800
 of the association of certain substances 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.520
 primordial such as the earth the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.840
 water the air and fire 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:28.280
 the best-known naturalist philosophers 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.930
 they were such of mileto anaxmenes and anna 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.219
 trivandrum 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.890
 in the 4th and 5th centuries before Christ it was 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:40.400
 that the first documents appeared 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.629
 about biology a lot of this are 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.340
 Hippocrates attributed thereto are 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:51.790
 remember by the Hippocratic Oath 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.629
 then another great philosopher with 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:01.530
 naturalistic inclinations Aristotle 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:05.980
 for the years 384 322 before Christ 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.250
 he wrote numerous treatises such as 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.610
 animal kingdom I perform the first 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.069
 attempt to classify animals by 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.030
 what is considered father of the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.579
 zoology one of its main 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.510
 contributions of Aristotle is his 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.760
 scientific research methods 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.940
 based on the observation method 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.959
 inductive which allows to take 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.299
 conclusions of the observed facts 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.079
 but not all affirmations of 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:44.110
 aristÃ³teles were accurate since he did 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.840
 misleading descriptions like that the 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.920
 brain was the organ that sent the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.920
 blood 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.450
 also that animals were born from the mud 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.460
 like frogs and fish however you will 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:03.200
 consider the propeller of the theory 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.200
 of spontaneous generation 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:15.250
 for the century Galeno years 131 201 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:18.639
 after christ was the last great 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.810
 doctor of antiquity in his time 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:26.199
 they banned decisions in human and 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.860
 they could only be practiced on corpses 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:34.620
 shipwrecked for this reason used 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:38.530
 animals mainly monkeys 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.930
 systematized the anatomy developed the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.280
 scientific method 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:49.860
 his original name is claudio galeno 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.860
 better known as a physician 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.900
 his christ gave him a fame 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.410
 extraordinary that last until the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.370
 date and for over a thousand years is 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.100
 considered the father of anatomy 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:12.190
 sometimes we hear that the 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.190
 doctors name him as a doctor
