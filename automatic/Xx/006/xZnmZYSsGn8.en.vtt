like<00:01:41.579> Messi<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:43.979> see

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
like Messi and I think you can now see

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.940 
like Messi and I think you can now see
what<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.610> mean<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.390> underrated<00:01:45.930> he<00:01:46.170> 481<00:01:46.770> pay

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
what I mean he is underrated he 481 pay

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
what I mean he is underrated he 481 pay
so<00:01:47.189> he's<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.549> quick<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.030> well<00:01:48.210> his

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so he's really quick as well his

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
so he's really quick as well his
dribbling<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.220> world

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
dribbling is out of this world

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
dribbling is out of this world
especially<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> silver<00:01:51.689> player<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.649> he

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
especially for a silver player and he

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
especially for a silver player and he
actually<00:01:52.950> feels<00:01:53.280> better<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.880> game<00:01:54.329> than<00:01:54.810> Messi

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
actually feels better in game than Messi

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
actually feels better in game than Messi
