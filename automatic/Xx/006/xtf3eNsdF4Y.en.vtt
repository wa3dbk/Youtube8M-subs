00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.120
 when the fury is 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.930
 how fire will consume everything that is 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.930
 on their way 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.230
 here among the monks 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.800
 I became something much bigger than 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.800
 myself 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.189
 I have conquered better 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.780
 I have assimilated the four spirits 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 eternal ones that once protected this 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.230
 temple 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.790
 through my being the spirits still 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.790
 protect this place 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 and is that they seek to reclaim the power of 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.620
 this temple 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.369
 fast 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.369
 but yes sir of all the beasts 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.510
 if this temple fell a terrible 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.980
 darkness would be awakened and would cover 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.980
 a whole earth 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.969
 that's why it will protect you at all costs 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.520
 a little matter how many 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.040
 I am the turtle the wise protector and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.040
 guardian of life 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.340
 and I am much more than a simple man 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.110
 I am the bear the avatar of unstoppable force 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.200
 I'm happy 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.160
 the ancient redeemer and purifier 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.230
 I do not fear anything with his strength 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.940
 together is against me 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.480
 I'm never alone
