00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
don't worry soon enough you can because

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.850 
don't worry soon enough you can because
they're<00:02:07.300> currently<00:02:07.599> working<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.229> at<00:02:08.379> least

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
they're currently working on it at least

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.490 
they're currently working on it at least
it's<00:02:09.459> not<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.789> to-do<00:02:10.090> list<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.929> likely

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
it's not in the to-do list it's likely

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.350 
it's not in the to-do list it's likely
that<00:02:11.530> name<00:02:11.890> changing<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.520> going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.030> free

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
that name changing is going to be free

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.270 
that name changing is going to be free
so<00:02:13.690> that's<00:02:13.840> pretty<00:02:14.050> cool<00:02:14.260> but<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.190> only

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
so that's pretty cool but you can only

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.580 
so that's pretty cool but you can only
have<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.730> done<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.090> maximal<00:02:16.690> amount<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.989> time<00:02:17.230> so

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
have it done a maximal amount of time so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.900 
have it done a maximal amount of time so
maybe<00:02:17.769> only<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.250> twice

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910
