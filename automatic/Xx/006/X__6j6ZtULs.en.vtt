00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.500 
all I have to do don't add the radius
and<00:03:18.769> roll<00:03:19.430> them<00:03:19.610> back<00:03:19.760> from<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.090> whole<00:03:20.239> world

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
and roll them back from the whole world

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.750 
and roll them back from the whole world
but<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.470> don't<00:03:21.799> recommend<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:23.230> but<00:03:24.230> if<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.579> mean

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
if it's really bad you could do that and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.310 
if it's really bad you could do that and
ban<00:03:27.920> them<00:03:28.450> but<00:03:29.450> yeah<00:03:29.980> that's<00:03:30.980> it
