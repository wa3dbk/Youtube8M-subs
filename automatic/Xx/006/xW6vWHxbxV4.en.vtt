the whole lot into the pot add enough
water<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.770> cover<00:01:10.920> boil<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.119> what

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.109 
water to cover boil it and then what
you've<00:01:12.510> got<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.619> juice<00:01:13.979> you'll<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.909> more

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you've got is this juice you'll get more

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
you've got is this juice you'll get more
yield<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.130> should

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
yield out of it that way but this should

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
yield out of it that way but this should
get<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> bit<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.850> flavor<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.170> way

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
get a bit of flavor if you do it my way

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
get a bit of flavor if you do it my way
so<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:20.009> we're<00:01:20.159> doing<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.759> we're

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
so what we're doing now is we're

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.330 
so what we're doing now is we're
measuring<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.750> juice<00:01:21.930> very<00:01:22.560> important<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
measuring the juice very important to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
measuring the juice very important to
measure<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> juice<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.689> going

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
measure the juice because this is going

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
measure the juice because this is going
to<00:01:24.900> tell<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> how<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.560> sugar<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> put<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to tell you how much sugar to put in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800 
to tell you how much sugar to put in
later<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.180> we're<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> measure<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
later so we're going to measure the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.670 
later so we're going to measure the
juice<00:01:28.080> we're<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> acquit<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> pot

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
juice we're going to acquit in a pot

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.990 
juice we're going to acquit in a pot
from<00:01:31.680> South<00:01:31.890> African<00:01:32.310> don't<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.759> quite

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
from South African don't know it's quite

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
from South African don't know it's quite
you're<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> Donal<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.380> into<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> pot<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you're going to Donal it into a pot and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.630 
you're going to Donal it into a pot and
then<00:01:35.759> we're<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> add<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:37.380> zest<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.369> we

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
then we're going to add the zest that we

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
then we're going to add the zest that we
took<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.780> earlier<00:01:40.020> back<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.840> okay<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:42.899> there's

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
the zest from the French we're gonna put
this<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.079> gonna<00:01:46.200> bring<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.799> back<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> the

so<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.899> gain<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> reduce<00:01:49.680> its<00:01:49.890> our<00:01:50.070> one-third

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so then gain to reduce its our one-third

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.840 
so then gain to reduce its our one-third
okay<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.200> we're<00:01:52.380> gonna<00:01:52.470> stir<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.009> notice

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
okay so we're gonna stir it in notice

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.310 
okay so we're gonna stir it in notice
the<00:01:54.030> level<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> patia<00:01:55.049> very<00:01:55.470> important<00:01:57.320> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the level of the patia very important to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.580 
the level of the patia very important to
boil<00:01:58.560> now

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.990 

see<00:02:04.590> how<00:02:04.710> much<00:02:04.860> water<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> pot<00:02:05.760> now

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
see how much water is in the pot now

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050 
see how much water is in the pot now
we've<00:02:06.240> cooked<00:02:06.510> away<00:02:06.750> about<00:02:07.550> 1/3<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
we've cooked away about 1/3 of the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.810 
we've cooked away about 1/3 of the
volume<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.380> every<00:02:10.800> liter<00:02:11.040> remember<00:02:11.700> we

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
volume so for every liter remember we

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.750 
volume so for every liter remember we
added<00:02:11.970> three<00:02:12.330> dishes<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.960> add<00:02:13.140> 600<00:02:13.890> grams

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
added three dishes we can add 600 grams

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.360 
added three dishes we can add 600 grams
of<00:02:15.150> sugar<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.260> want<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.590> make<00:02:16.740> more<00:02:17.040> Jam

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
of sugar if you want to make more Jam

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.330 
of sugar if you want to make more Jam
you<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.330> up<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.570> 1<00:02:19.410> liter<00:02:19.710> for<00:02:20.070> energy<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
you can do up to 1 liter for energy the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.060 
you can do up to 1 liter for energy the
sweet<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.300> we're<00:02:24.450> using<00:02:24.630> 600<00:02:25.320> grams<00:02:25.530> hence

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
sweet so we're using 600 grams hence

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.540 
sweet so we're using 600 grams hence
we're<00:02:26.550> doing<00:02:26.760> 1.8<00:02:27.600> kilos<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.500> sugar<00:02:28.530> into<00:02:29.400> this

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
we're doing 1.8 kilos of sugar into this

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.780 
we're doing 1.8 kilos of sugar into this
pot<00:02:29.850> now<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> use<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.690> light<00:02:31.080> brown<00:02:31.380> sugar

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
pot now I use a light brown sugar

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.250 
pot now I use a light brown sugar
because<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.970> gives<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.450> far<00:02:34.050> superior

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
because it gives it a far superior

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.700 
because it gives it a far superior
flavor<00:02:35.510> we're<00:02:36.510> stirring<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.020> just<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> make

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
flavor we're stirring it in just to make

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.100 
flavor we're stirring it in just to make
sure<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.340> sugar<00:02:38.700> dissolves<00:02:39.540> thoroughly

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
sure that the sugar dissolves thoroughly

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.750 
sure that the sugar dissolves thoroughly
we're<00:02:40.500> bringing<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.920> back<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> boil<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
we're bringing it back to the boil and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.700 
we're bringing it back to the boil and
we're<00:02:42.360> gonna<00:02:42.450> turn<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> down<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.350> we're<00:02:43.500> going

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
we're gonna turn it down and we're going

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.040 
we're gonna turn it down and we're going
to<00:02:43.800> leave<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.370> simmer<00:02:44.850> we<00:02:45.300> need<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.630> get<00:02:45.930> it

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
to leave it to simmer we need to get it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.250 
to leave it to simmer we need to get it
to<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.470> right<00:02:46.800> temperature<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:49.230> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
to the right temperature I have a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.290 
to the right temperature I have a
special<00:02:49.800> drill<00:02:49.980> thermometer<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.610> use<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.180> this

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
special drill thermometer I use for this

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.170 
special drill thermometer I use for this
now<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.320> see<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:53.160> bubble<00:02:53.580> pattern<00:02:53.790> has

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
now you can see the bubble pattern has

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.970 
now you can see the bubble pattern has
changed<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.960> you've<00:02:55.230> got<00:02:55.350> all<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> sticky

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
changed and you've got all the sticky

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.370 
changed and you've got all the sticky
foamy<00:02:56.250> stuff<00:02:56.460> on<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.940> top<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.780> what<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.320> is

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
foamy stuff on the top so what you do is

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.250 
foamy stuff on the top so what you do is
you're<00:02:58.500> gonna<00:02:58.560> skim<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.510> impurities

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
you're gonna skim all the the impurities

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.010 
you're gonna skim all the the impurities
off<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.250> top<00:03:02.460> that's<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.120> foamy<00:03:03.570> stuff<00:03:03.630> over

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
off the top that's that foamy stuff over

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.080 
off the top that's that foamy stuff over
there<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.590> we're<00:03:04.680> gonna<00:03:04.770> throw<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.100> away<00:03:05.160> now

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
there and we're gonna throw it away now

you want to make sure that you don't get

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.690 
you want to make sure that you don't get
any<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:09.660> zest<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:11.070> little<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.520> the

liquid itself as possible when you skim
this<00:03:15.000> we're<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.110> check<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
this we're going to check that the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.320 
this we're going to check that the
temperature<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.280> at<00:03:18.440> 104<00:03:19.440> degrees<00:03:20.330> centigrade

don't<00:03:22.110> ask<00:03:22.260> me<00:03:22.380> what<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.650> fair<00:03:22.950> enough<00:03:22.980> then

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
don't ask me what it is fair enough then

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.090 
don't ask me what it is fair enough then
Everclear<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.350> could<00:03:25.350> look<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> up<00:03:25.680> for<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:25.950> if
