00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.389 

okay<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:00.960> one<00:00:01.350> last<00:00:01.500> example<00:00:01.740> here<00:00:02.370> of

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay so one last example here of

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay so one last example here of
converting<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.360> complex<00:00:04.140> number<00:00:04.560> into<00:00:04.710> polar

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
converting a complex number into polar

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.210 
converting a complex number into polar
form<00:00:05.460> so<00:00:05.779> here<00:00:06.779> we've<00:00:06.930> got<00:00:07.080> three<00:00:07.529> minus<00:00:08.010> I

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
form so here we've got three minus I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.879 
form so here we've got three minus I
squared<00:00:09.179> sorry<00:00:09.630> had<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.900> little<00:00:10.110> little<00:00:10.650> ink

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
squared sorry had a little little ink

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.400 
squared sorry had a little little ink
run<00:00:11.160> up<00:00:11.280> there<00:00:11.519> little<00:00:11.730> dot<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.360> three<00:00:12.929> minus<00:00:13.049> I

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
run up there little dot so three minus I

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530 
run up there little dot so three minus I
squared<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.910> thing<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.420> do

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
squared the first thing I'm going to do

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
squared the first thing I'm going to do
here<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.960> rewrite<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.980> something<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
here is rewrite this is something a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.460 
here is rewrite this is something a
little<00:00:17.580> more<00:00:17.609> familiar<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.289> actually

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
little more familiar so I'm actually

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.500 
little more familiar so I'm actually
going<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:19.920> distribute<00:00:20.760> everything<00:00:21.330> out

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
going to just distribute everything out

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.410 
going to just distribute everything out
so<00:00:23.960> 3<00:00:24.960> times<00:00:25.109> 3<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:25.529> 9<00:00:26.090> we<00:00:27.090> would<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so 3 times 3 that's 9 we would get a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.169 
so 3 times 3 that's 9 we would get a
negative<00:00:27.660> 3i<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.830> negative<00:00:29.220> 3i<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.060> would

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
negative 3i and a negative 3i that would

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.049 
negative 3i and a negative 3i that would
give<00:00:30.330> us<00:00:30.449> negative<00:00:30.480> 6i<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.910> negative<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
give us negative 6i a negative and a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.930 
give us negative 6i a negative and a
negative<00:00:33.090> makes<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.809> positive<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.620> times<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.370> will

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
negative makes a positive I times I will

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.930 
negative makes a positive I times I will
be<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.170> squared

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
be I squared

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
be I squared
well<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.180> squared<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> same<00:00:40.530> thing<00:00:40.590> as

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
well I squared is the same thing as

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.340 
well I squared is the same thing as
negative<00:00:41.700> 1<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.290> 9<00:00:43.620> minus<00:00:44.100> 1<00:00:45.350> 9

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
negative 1 so really we have 9 minus 1 9

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.000 
negative 1 so really we have 9 minus 1 9
minus<00:00:46.829> 1<00:00:47.010> would<00:00:47.219> give<00:00:47.399> us<00:00:47.489> 8<00:00:47.850> minus<00:00:48.780> 6i<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
minus 1 would give us 8 minus 6i so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.150 
minus 1 would give us 8 minus 6i so
these<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.399> our<00:00:51.469> complex<00:00:52.469> number<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.070> I'm

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
these are our complex number that I'm

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.470 
these are our complex number that I'm
going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> graph<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> think<00:00:54.090> about

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.300 

so<00:00:59.050> again<00:00:59.290> it<00:00:59.410> says<00:00:59.590> you<00:00:59.710> basically<00:01:00.040> go<00:01:00.280> over

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
so again it says you basically go over

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.210 
so again it says you basically go over
to<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.240> real<00:01:01.420> part<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:02.050> go<00:01:02.320> over<00:01:02.500> eight<00:01:02.770> units

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
to the real part you go over eight units

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.130 
to the real part you go over eight units
we<00:01:04.030> would<00:01:04.210> go<00:01:04.330> down<00:01:04.540> six<00:01:05.290> units

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.200 

and<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.890> there<00:01:10.100> would<00:01:10.250> be<00:01:10.310> our<00:01:10.490> complex<00:01:11.000> number

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
and so there would be our complex number

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.430 
and so there would be our complex number
8<00:01:12.050> minus<00:01:12.710> 6i<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.840> we'll<00:01:14.930> have<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.110> do<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.230> couple

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
8 minus 6i so we'll have to do a couple

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.800 
8 minus 6i so we'll have to do a couple
things<00:01:15.620> again<00:01:16.160> we<00:01:16.850> have<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.090> figure<00:01:17.450> out<00:01:17.480> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
things again we have to figure out the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.590 
things again we have to figure out the
modulus<00:01:18.410> which<00:01:19.220> will<00:01:19.370> be<00:01:19.460> our<00:01:19.580> r-value

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
modulus which will be our r-value

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.050 
modulus which will be our r-value
so<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.650> modulus<00:01:21.860> in<00:01:22.310> this<00:01:22.460> case<00:01:22.700> we'll<00:01:23.030> just

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
so the modulus in this case we'll just

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.969 
so the modulus in this case we'll just
be<00:01:23.390> 8<00:01:24.200> squared<00:01:25.000> plus<00:01:26.000> negative<00:01:26.570> 6<00:01:27.229> squared

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
be 8 squared plus negative 6 squared

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.640 
be 8 squared plus negative 6 squared
well<00:01:30.979> that'll<00:01:31.370> be<00:01:31.400> 64<00:01:32.270> plus<00:01:33.010> 36<00:01:34.600> 64<00:01:35.600> plus<00:01:35.840> 36<00:01:36.470> is

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
well that'll be 64 plus 36 64 plus 36 is

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.870 
well that'll be 64 plus 36 64 plus 36 is
100<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.580> square<00:01:37.880> root<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.150> 100<00:01:38.660> is<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:38.810> 10

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
100 the square root of 100 is just 10

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.219 
100 the square root of 100 is just 10
okay<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.420> other<00:01:41.570> thing<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:41.869> we'll<00:01:42.110> have

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
okay so the other thing that we'll have

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.140 
okay so the other thing that we'll have
to<00:01:42.380> do<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.860> we're<00:01:43.400> going<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.550> have<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:43.940> figure

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
to do is we're going to have to figure

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.999 
to do is we're going to have to figure
out<00:01:44.450> our<00:01:44.860> our<00:01:45.860> angle<00:01:46.280> theta<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.860> we're

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
out our our angle theta so we're

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.910 
out our our angle theta so we're
interested<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.000> angle<00:01:50.680> but<00:01:51.680> what<00:01:51.800> I'm

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
interested in the angle but what I'm

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.740 
interested in the angle but what I'm
going<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.160> do<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.550> maybe<00:01:53.300> I'll<00:01:53.479> call<00:01:53.690> this

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
going to do is maybe I'll call this

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.370 
going to do is maybe I'll call this
alpha<00:01:54.410> we'll<00:01:54.979> figure<00:01:55.190> out<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:55.759> angle<00:01:56.060> first

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.810 

so<00:02:00.380> let's<00:02:00.590> see<00:02:00.770> here

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so let's see here

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.469 
so let's see here
you

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.559 

so<00:02:06.020> there's<00:02:06.200> our<00:02:06.350> angle<00:02:06.770> alpha<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:08.360> side

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
so there's our angle alpha this side

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.749 
so there's our angle alpha this side
would<00:02:08.780> have<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.989> length<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.440> eight<00:02:09.739> this<00:02:10.489> side

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
would have a length of eight this side

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.250 
would have a length of eight this side
of<00:02:10.910> our<00:02:11.000> triangle<00:02:11.450> would<00:02:11.599> have<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> length<00:02:12.050> of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
of our triangle would have a length of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.660 
of our triangle would have a length of
six<00:02:12.790> well<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.209> get<00:02:14.440> alpha<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.769> by<00:02:16.489> using

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
six well we can get alpha so by using

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.940 
six well we can get alpha so by using
tangent<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.019> tangent<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.560> going<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.739> be<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
tangent so tangent is going to be the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.210 
tangent so tangent is going to be the
opposite<00:02:19.459> over<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.819> adjacent<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.900> 6<00:02:21.590> over<00:02:21.739> 8

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
opposite over the adjacent so 6 over 8

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.640 
opposite over the adjacent so 6 over 8
or<00:02:23.170> 3<00:02:24.170> over<00:02:24.349> 4<00:02:25.000> or<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.030> guess<00:02:26.510> point<00:02:26.900> seven<00:02:27.440> five

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
or 3 over 4 or I guess point seven five

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.130 
or 3 over 4 or I guess point seven five
so<00:02:28.640> I'm<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> take<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.330> inverse<00:02:29.750> tangent

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
so I'm going to take the inverse tangent

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.199 
so I'm going to take the inverse tangent
of<00:02:30.530> both<00:02:30.590> sides<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.430> get<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> angle<00:02:35.090> in

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
of both sides just to get the angle in

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.890 
of both sides just to get the angle in
this<00:02:35.330> case<00:02:35.390> for<00:02:36.290> alpha<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:38.209> let's<00:02:38.390> see<00:02:38.569> point

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
this case for alpha so let's see point

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.630 
this case for alpha so let's see point
seven<00:02:39.530> five<00:02:39.739> inverse<00:02:40.519> tangent<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:42.640> I'm

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
seven five inverse tangent of that I'm

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.940 
seven five inverse tangent of that I'm
getting<00:02:43.970> alpha<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.569> roughly<00:02:44.900> thirty<00:02:45.500> six

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
getting alpha to be roughly thirty six

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.140 
getting alpha to be roughly thirty six
point<00:02:46.400> eight<00:02:47.150> seven<00:02:48.049> degrees<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:50.060> could

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
point eight seven degrees we could

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.240 
point eight seven degrees we could
always<00:02:50.480> round<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:50.989> off<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.650> guess<00:02:52.069> we'll

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
always round this off I guess we'll

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.949 
always round this off I guess we'll
round<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.640> off<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.030> case<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:54.130> 37<00:02:55.130> degrees

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
round it off in this case to 37 degrees

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.520 
round it off in this case to 37 degrees
well<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.440> true<00:02:57.680> angle<00:02:58.160> here<00:02:58.400> for<00:02:58.610> theta

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
well so the true angle here for theta

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.479 
well so the true angle here for theta
would<00:03:00.530> be<00:03:01.239> 360<00:03:02.239> degrees<00:03:02.660> minus<00:03:04.450> 37<00:03:05.450> degrees<00:03:05.840> I

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
would be 360 degrees minus 37 degrees I

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.210 
would be 360 degrees minus 37 degrees I
believe<00:03:07.489> that's<00:03:07.700> going<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:07.910> give<00:03:08.090> us<00:03:09.220> 323

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
believe that's going to give us 323

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.270 
believe that's going to give us 323
degrees<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.109> says<00:03:12.350> again<00:03:12.650> our<00:03:12.799> complex

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
degrees so it says again our complex

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.309 
degrees so it says again our complex
number<00:03:13.660> we<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.810> write<00:03:14.959> our<00:03:15.079> complex<00:03:15.500> number

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.140 

where<00:03:18.860> we<00:03:19.010> go<00:03:19.159> as<00:03:20.349> R<00:03:21.349> times<00:03:21.829> cosine<00:03:22.159> theta<00:03:22.459> plus

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
where we go as R times cosine theta plus

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.399 
where we go as R times cosine theta plus
I<00:03:23.329> sine<00:03:23.989> theta<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:26.390> we<00:03:26.510> figured<00:03:26.870> out<00:03:26.989> our<00:03:27.019> theta

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
I sine theta so we figured out our theta

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.449 
I sine theta so we figured out our theta
values<00:03:28.159> 323<00:03:29.150> we<00:03:29.719> set<00:03:29.930> our<00:03:30.049> R<00:03:30.260> value<00:03:30.290> was<00:03:31.069> equal

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
values 323 we set our R value was equal

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.289 
values 323 we set our R value was equal
to<00:03:31.489> 10<00:03:31.969> so<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:34.040> just<00:03:34.340> filling<00:03:34.849> in<00:03:34.970> again<00:03:35.180> this

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
to 10 so now just filling in again this

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.229 
to 10 so now just filling in again this
formula<00:03:35.870> one<00:03:36.170> more<00:03:36.379> time<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.849> can<00:03:38.030> get<00:03:38.150> it

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
formula one more time so you can get it

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.410 
formula one more time so you can get it
all<00:03:38.390> in<00:03:38.569> here<00:03:38.599> I<00:03:39.049> don't<00:03:39.590> think<00:03:39.799> so<00:03:40.239> how<00:03:41.239> about

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
all in here I don't think so how about

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.940 
all in here I don't think so how about
that<00:03:41.659> so<00:03:42.349> it's<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.220> z1<00:03:43.790> equal<00:03:44.299> R<00:03:45.139> which<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.530> 10

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
that so it's a z1 equal R which is 10

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.940 
that so it's a z1 equal R which is 10
and<00:03:46.340> then<00:03:47.329> we'll<00:03:47.480> have<00:03:47.599> cosine<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:50.950> 323

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
and then we'll have cosine of 323

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:02.530 
and then we'll have cosine of 323
degrees<00:03:54.129> plus<00:03:55.129> I<00:03:55.430> times<00:03:56.120> sine<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:58.659> 323<00:03:59.659> degrees

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.690 

okay<00:04:03.080> so<00:04:03.140> some<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.950> these<00:04:04.040> can<00:04:04.250> be<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.430> little

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
okay so some of these can be a little

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.460 
okay so some of these can be a little
more<00:04:04.819> tedious<00:04:05.060> simply<00:04:05.720> because<00:04:06.019> you've<00:04:06.290> got

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
more tedious simply because you've got

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.649 
more tedious simply because you've got
to<00:04:06.709> actually<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.819> know<00:04:07.849> rewrite<00:04:08.450> your

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
to actually you know rewrite your

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.289 
to actually you know rewrite your
complex<00:04:09.140> number<00:04:09.500> in<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.709> first<00:04:09.950> place<00:04:10.299> but

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
complex number in the first place but

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.420 
complex number in the first place but
after<00:04:11.420> that<00:04:11.689> the<00:04:12.079> modulus<00:04:12.560> isn't<00:04:12.890> bad<00:04:13.069> it's

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
after that the modulus isn't bad it's

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.500 
after that the modulus isn't bad it's
just<00:04:13.549> you<00:04:13.879> know<00:04:14.000> really<00:04:14.180> Pythagorean<00:04:14.959> theorem

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
just you know really Pythagorean theorem

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.719 
just you know really Pythagorean theorem
set<00:04:17.510> up<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.690> little<00:04:17.930> right<00:04:18.109> triangle<00:04:18.729> using

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
set up a little right triangle using

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.510 
set up a little right triangle using
tangent<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.870> know<00:04:21.019> eventually<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.280> may<00:04:22.400> have

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
tangent you know eventually you may have

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.670 
tangent you know eventually you may have
to<00:04:22.610> use<00:04:22.760> inverse<00:04:23.090> tangent<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:24.169> then<00:04:24.440> again

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
to use inverse tangent and then again

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.439 
to use inverse tangent and then again
just<00:04:24.710> based<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.310> what<00:04:25.520> quadrant<00:04:26.120> you're<00:04:26.270> in

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
just based on what quadrant you're in

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.409 
just based on what quadrant you're in
you<00:04:26.690> may<00:04:26.840> have<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.199> add<00:04:27.350> 180<00:04:27.949> subtract<00:04:28.610> 180<00:04:28.880> or

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
you may have to add 180 subtract 180 or

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.950 
you may have to add 180 subtract 180 or
do<00:04:29.750> whatever<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.800> get<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> correct<00:04:31.729> angle<00:04:32.000> but

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
do whatever to get the correct angle but

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.390 
do whatever to get the correct angle but
then<00:04:33.169> it's<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.560> matter<00:04:33.770> of<00:04:33.860> just<00:04:34.070> throwing

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
then it's just a matter of just throwing

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.310 
then it's just a matter of just throwing
everything<00:04:34.580> into<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.060> formula<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.780> you're

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
everything into the formula and you're

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.560 
everything into the formula and you're
finished
