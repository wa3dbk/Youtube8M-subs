00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello missal staff are continuing to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.730
 his series play electrostatic nation already 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.470
 talked about contact electrification 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.240
 the basic idea of upgrading to the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.650
 contact is as follows 1 as we say 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 that we take a body here for 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 example a people and these people have a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.700
 certain electrical charge for example 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 positive whatever be may be 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.410
 positive may be negative 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.270
 what happens is that equal loads 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.829
 repel such loads for example 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.660
 positive people do not want to stay 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.720
 Much to God in this body. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.390
 if I take another body, for example 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.149
 a potato that something else and I 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 here in this people who are going to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.870
 the following happens 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.360
 these positive charges are attracting 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.570
 negative charges for example some 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.910
 electrons that this potato finally not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.309
 be stolen by the people what will 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.710
 happen is that now this potato month 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.259
 car also positive the guys do not want 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.969
 to be mounted on a very sloping body 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.130
 and 11 of the opportunity opportunities pass 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.899
 the two glasses are not distributed 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 between the two 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.619
 so what happens then the basic idea 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.649
 of production for contact is precisely 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.389
 this to have a body loaded slope 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.950
 in him another body that at first was 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:21.240
 in another now the two bodies do not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.340
 be loaded 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.259
 they will always end up with loads of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:34.259
 same sign ta loads ends with a 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.840
 always ends with the same sign not 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.429
 necessarily the same value is not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 crime in the legislation by friction 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.909
 counter signs and even value 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.349
 here is the sign and not 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.549
 necessarily the same value 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.799
 the only thing I can tell 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.359
 principle of use by contact with 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.549
 the two bodies will end up with the same 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.409
 Sign you have to be much more details 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.969
 some situations to mainly 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.399
 When we talk about spheres 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.679
 have two cases you have to 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.270
 know the first most common case when 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.829
 we talk ball with all the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.450
 same size is what's going to happen here 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.940
 is the following if you liked the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.220
 spheres of the same size then as 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.260
 they are the same they do not have because the load 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.310
 prefer one port than the other is 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.410
 the total load is distributed equally 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.550
 so here they will end with 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.060
 load of the same value also divides 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.800
 also then say say that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.720
 I have a ball when I'm here to 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.690
 has a certain load for example but 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.489
 four settlers and this one was neutral 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.019
 that is, they have charge 0 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.970
 When I do not like it, it goes. 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.840
 that the total load is divided 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.760
 between them 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.140
 in this case the total load is 4 of this 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.540
 0 of this 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.850
 the total load is four more if more 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.980
 four times divide part for this 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.120
 part ball seems to split equally 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.160
 stay two more here both of us here then 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.799
 each sphere has a 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.720
 the total load on two that's because I 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.580
 I pressed two at the same time I had 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.680
 a coast of the 3 at the same time would have 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.269
 one third in each and so it goes 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.830
 the total load is divided equally 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.459
 Note that I told you that I had to 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.870
 touch three at the same time do not 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.610
 Here's another example here. 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.650
 may be that they start in two with 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.950
 tsee electric charge for example had 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:31.320
 one here with a load of money I do not know 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:37.440
 - 2 asses and another here a load of your 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.269
 one more thing when I touch them 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.709
 the total load and divides equally 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.350
 any total charge in this case I have 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.359
 two in one and one in the other to 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.680
 total charge is - 1 - 1 is half to 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.060
 each one 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.819
 then it will be minus 0.5 at that minus 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:06.420
 0.5 lance note that both ends 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:08.310
 with the same signal load is on and if they 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.280
 not of the same judicial size 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.430
 different sizes 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.859
 What happens is that for example let's 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.620
 suppose I started here with this 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.180
 sphere with negative charge and this one 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.460
 it was neutral 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.139
 when I touched aoas these electrons here 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.030
 They do not want to be mounted on this body. 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.490
 them ounces 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.260
 looks at both spheres but the question is 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.810
 that these electrons and repellents that he 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.639
 stayed as far away as they can from the other 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.169
 they will be further apart in the body 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.210
 greater than in the smaller body 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.650
 then these loads prefer to stay in that 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.660
 body than in that ranking 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.300
 in this case the total load does not 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:52.820
 whether video also gets more 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:56.060
 most're then the larger body gets the 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.240
 larger wheel face 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.520
 then in this case the 15 here will stay with 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.590
 a burden which is here with a load 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.050
 that two I can say with certainty that 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.360
 that two is greater in kim mode than one 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.260
 load does not divide even more 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.290
 load on the larger base body the more the 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.090
 will be proportional to the radius of the 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.370
 people will hardly appear questions 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.140
 accounts per exercise because I want to 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.979
 say ko raya distance from the center to the 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.770
 border right 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.870
 if for example this sphere has double 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.479
 the size of this one means that this 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.030
 final load on this sphere will be double 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:36.020
 of cargo in this one but always they 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.490
 end with same-signal loads 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.130
 emphasizing that this is a 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.110
 for further observation is in the 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.000
 use by contacts with some 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.680
 end with different value loads as 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.390
 we saw their different sizes 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.820
 final values will be different 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.810
 but it always ends with the same 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.760
 signal and with the same electrical potential the 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.160
 which is the electric power had more to 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.289
 People but for the moment only left this 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.789
 Finally this annotation information that okay 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.830
 even if the load values are 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.320
 different the electrical potential of each 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.169
 year attracts more people that will be 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.539
 Like your worthy comment 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.370
 to do is what happens for 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.260
 example does an update to the 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.050
 contact with the earth as well as 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:23.030
 Let's say that I have here in a 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.310
 little ball has a positive charge 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.400
 one thing i can do is 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.890
 next to say that here is the show 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.110
 then here is the earth the earth 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.210
 planet earth is a sun at last one 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.880
 picture of dirt in the mall 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:42.110
 I 'm going to connect this planet in the 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.940
 earth through a conducting wire, which 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.430
 I wish this is just a movie made of some 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.180
 material that lets electrons rise 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.550
 scene 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.409
 this thread here I'm actually 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.030
 touching this body on the ground and 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.770
 update for the contact, I am 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.190
 making contact through the film and not 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.020
 directly but the idea is the same 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.729
 As I said when I have coast. 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.070
 bodies of different sizes 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:06.400
 loads will spread through the 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.990
 two but prefer to stay in the larger body 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.510
 when he found the body on earth to 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.520
 people are even so much bigger than they really are 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.710
 all guys will prefer to stay in 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.180
 what will happen is that this 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.640
 body will end up being practically 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.349
 neutral charges go to land 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.320
 in this case these positive charges 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:26.090
 would be attracting negative electrons that 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.970
 going up the film allows movement 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:32.990
 do not leave the earth until this guy here 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.880
 in the end stay neutral from nothing is not it 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.590
 In a way, what you're doing is just 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.320
 one to electrification by contact 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.000
 athlete is so much bigger that he can practically 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.490
 say that all final charge is right 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.560
 then the original body neutral cable 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.390
 if you were negative the reasoning 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.550
 is the same solectron had descended to the 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.740
 instead of climbing again touching a 

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.940
 body loaded up to this body is k there 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.789
 inside 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.320
 then're right for this time is very 

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:59.720
 thanks for listening 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.280
 the contact organization tried to coast 

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.970
 of bodies the charges spread through 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.800
 they 

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.720
 always ends the same signal if you have the 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.909
 same size for the same value and 

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.789
 Different sizes at different time from 

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:13.390
 bigger became more expensive and until the next 

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:13.390
 thank you very much
