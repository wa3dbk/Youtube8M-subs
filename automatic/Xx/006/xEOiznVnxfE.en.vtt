00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 so welcome to this tutorial for 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.069
 azf users break bar 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.320
 I assume that you already have 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.049
 looked at the beginning of the other tutorial that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.439
 explains how to create a texture 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.760
 targa integrate it into the game there I'm going 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.140
 just take care 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.370
 of appearance 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.630
 stake so how do they 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.080
 turn his caste bar once 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.540
 the game launched so 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.810
 first we check that the young helpers 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.550
 are well revived so the four 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.230
 laser modules case this bar and charles 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.230
 media then we come into play 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.590
 so I have already configured a woman 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.060
 I did not do that in us jets 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.770
 configured once that's it 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.030
 give the bellemare end of caste so 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:03.710
 we open the menu I'm going all 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.750
 broken here is that that's what 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.229
 it starts with a small bar of 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.869
 caste 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.330
 so I'm assuming that good 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.560
 with my screen 4 cents by 40 it goes 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.610
 well 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:22.729
 ratio of 10 it goes well so 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
 edit mode if I forget an entry of that 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.640
 risk not doing it 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.800
 here is a good big caste bar 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.259
 so once that's done we 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.390
 let's go into texture appearance of the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.920
 bar we go down and we 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.320
 choose the texture that we 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.530
 interested in my case me semiane for 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:46.260
 nyan cat then 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.080
 we put the background color and 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.940
 bag drop colors the same spell to make 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.940
 so that there is only 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.950
 bar texture really so there on 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.220
 might think it's good but no 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.360
 the bar and bluish so to overcome 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.020
 that we go in additional colors 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.330
 of normal caste and so there we do not 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.600
 let's not go down unless it's 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.670
 give it that we do not see anymore 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.519
 the caste bar so we but much more 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.590
 on the other hand we put in white so you 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.970
 put the cursor in the center and you but 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.330
 you leave yourself ok white and the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.480
 here is the caste bar and so ends 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.420
 for target focus stupid mirror it's 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.420
 exactly the same settings 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.260
 here is a minute thirty watch in hand 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.080

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.269
