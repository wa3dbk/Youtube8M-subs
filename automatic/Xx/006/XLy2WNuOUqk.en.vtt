00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.410
 the rights are a type of organism 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.509
 that belongs to the vegetable kingdom ie 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.170
 the organisms that we know as 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.170
 plants 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 in particular the elected belong to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.330
 a classification called the class and lic 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.630
 rust within this class there are more 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.329
 classifications having between 6,000 and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.510
 15,000 different species of ferns 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.289
 they are different organisms they share all 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.289
 certain characteristics 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.560
 like many other plants the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.920
 Ferns correspond to organisms 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.260
 vascular is to say that they have vessels that 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.510
 they fulfill the function of transporting 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.640
 different substances throughout 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
 the organism 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.290
 unlike the vast majority of 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.440
 Plants do not produce direct 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.250
 seeds for reproduction in exchange 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.880
 of this they produce a similar structure 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.880
 spore call 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.880
 taking into account this particular type 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.860
 of reproduction can be separated 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.980
 rights in two main groups 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.070
 the dogs by anya 2 and the elected by 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.740
 allies this depending on the type 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.740
 cellular spores will derive 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.200
 in general terms we can recognize 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 some parts in a laws 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.180
 most of the body is 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.300
 constituted by large sheets called 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.500
 long 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.409
 in general terms they are subdivided into 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.469
 smaller units 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.630
 the sheet or from the is attached to 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.939
 stem with a structure called pressure 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.430
 the stem on its part is a structure 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.159
 underground that is under the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.050
 surface of the earth and it is covered 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.260
 by scales 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.750
 this non- woody assembly that receives the 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.650
 particular name of rhizome 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.540
 from this stem to the top 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.220
 the leaves that will be found in the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.930
 complete state of development 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.239
 in more central states 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.150
 on the other hand towards the bottom 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.830
 The roots of the workshop are born 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.160
 general terms are not very deep 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.440
 the size in fact may vary according to 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.620
 the species and according to the environment in which 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.540
 is in general terms are 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.480
 very favorable humid environments 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.480
 especially if these are also dark 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.530
 something that characterizes rights by 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.920
 on the rest of the plants is a 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.830
 reproduction system 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.959
 in general terms if you look at 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.660
 the leaves of a fern we will give 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.160
 that the posterior part 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.290
 they can observe a structure 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.020
 these structures are called 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.700
 soro and they work as a 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.209
 compartments 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.610
 each forum inside contains some 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.520
 structures called is for years 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.610
 the josh spores are the equivalent of 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.160
 that in an animal would be the gonad since 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.470
 is inside this structure where 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.210
 the media process is carried out 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.700
 with the aim of generating gametes 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.940
 in this way the interior of the sport 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.150
 Angio will generate spores that contain 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.190
 female and male gametes and when 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.180
 these are already formed will be released 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.209
 towards the environment 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.500
 if the spores fall in an environment that 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.069
 it is favorable 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.109
 especially a very humid environment 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.120
 they will finish to form a structure 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.120
 call rub it 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.440
 a specific guy let me cocito 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.410
 what does it mean a structure that 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.080
 It contains both a female gamete as 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.420
 masculine foundation that in this case 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.420
 they will receive the name of sphere 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.560
 before today's respectively 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.660
 is inside this structure the 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.080
 protal or where the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.540
 fertilization and from this it will begin 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:38.460
 the development of the embryo to go to 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.460
 form an organism similar to the initial
