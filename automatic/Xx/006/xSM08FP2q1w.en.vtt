there should be a door leading through
to<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.440> next<00:04:47.530> exhibit<00:04:53.340> I'm<00:04:54.340> looking<00:04:54.580> right<00:04:54.880> at

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
to the next exhibit I'm looking right at

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.420 
to the next exhibit I'm looking right at
the<00:04:55.120> west<00:04:55.330> wall<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.200> don't<00:04:56.440> see<00:04:56.890> a<00:04:57.130> door

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
time-space continuum door is still there

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.360 
time-space continuum door is still there
what<00:05:09.670> you're<00:05:09.850> seeing<00:05:10.060> is<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.300> fold<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:10.780> reality

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
what you're seeing is a fold in reality

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.740 
what you're seeing is a fold in reality
ghosts<00:05:12.370> remove<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:12.910> door<00:05:13.150> from<00:05:13.360> this<00:05:13.510> plane

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
ghosts remove the door from this plane

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.570 
ghosts remove the door from this plane
of<00:05:13.900> existence<00:05:13.960> all<00:05:14.680> I'm<00:05:14.980> seeing<00:05:15.250> in<00:05:15.490> the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
of existence all I'm seeing in the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.030 
of existence all I'm seeing in the
Paragons<00:05:16.330> is<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.540> kind<00:05:16.870> of<00:05:17.110> glowing<00:05:17.410> purple

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
Paragons is a kind of glowing purple

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.600 
Paragons is a kind of glowing purple
aura<00:05:18.580> no<00:05:19.450> door<00:05:19.770> well<00:05:20.770> this<00:05:21.010> is<00:05:21.100> an<00:05:21.220> educated

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
aura no door well this is an educated

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.460 
aura no door well this is an educated
guess<00:05:21.880> but<00:05:22.180> since<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.720> ghosts<00:05:23.110> are<00:05:23.230> gone

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
guess but since the ghosts are gone

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.470 
guess but since the ghosts are gone
their<00:05:23.710> influence<00:05:24.130> is<00:05:24.250> fading<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:25.000> anomaly

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
their influence is fading the anomaly

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.300 
their influence is fading the anomaly

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
should straighten itself out few hours

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.340 
should straighten itself out few hours
probably<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:28.150> few<00:05:28.630> hours<00:05:28.810> but<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:30.040> gotta<00:05:30.340> go<00:05:31.350> wish

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
probably a few hours but I gotta go wish

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.350 
probably a few hours but I gotta go wish
I<00:05:32.470> could<00:05:32.650> help<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.860> see<00:05:33.160> but<00:05:33.580> any<00:05:33.730> analysis<00:05:34.240> at

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
I could help you see but any analysis at

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.630 
I could help you see but any analysis at
this<00:05:34.510> point<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.870> strictly<00:05:35.110> theoretical<00:05:35.640> okay

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
this point is strictly theoretical okay

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.120 
this point is strictly theoretical okay
but<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.750> biological<00:05:38.440> situation<00:05:38.950> i'm

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
but the biological situation i'm

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.240 
but the biological situation i'm
experiencing<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:40.030> not<00:05:40.240> theoretical<00:05:40.480> at<00:05:41.080> all<00:05:41.250> i

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
experiencing is not theoretical at all i

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.300 
experiencing is not theoretical at all i
suppose<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:43.060> they<00:05:43.540> remind<00:05:43.900> you<00:05:44.310> positively
