anyone picking the first met to get
started<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.360> how<00:01:36.600> long's<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
started now for that so how long's and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
started now for that so how long's and
pull<00:01:37.140> off<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.649> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> strengthen<00:01:38.580> your

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
pull off so you want to strengthen your

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
pull off so you want to strengthen your
fingers<00:01:39.270> should<00:01:39.420> hopefully<00:01:39.630> keep<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> notes

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
fingers should hopefully keep the notes

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
fingers should hopefully keep the notes
coming<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.670> I'm<00:01:42.000> obviously<00:01:42.240> using<00:01:42.600> some

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
coming out I'm obviously using some

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.920 
coming out I'm obviously using some
distortion<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.619> game<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.670> fair<00:01:45.479> amount<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
distortion some game a fair amount I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.960 
distortion some game a fair amount I
never<00:01:46.170> play<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.619> super<00:01:47.130> saturated<00:01:47.670> because

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
never play like super saturated because

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
never play like super saturated because
it's<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.600> messy<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:51.390> better<00:01:52.159> earlier

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it's it's messy and the better earlier

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.490 
it's it's messy and the better earlier
on<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.549> when<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.570> used<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
on in when I used to do a lot of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.670 
on in when I used to do a lot of
practice<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.610> found<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.289> started

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
practice I found that as I started

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
practice I found that as I started
getting<00:01:58.830> better<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.310> needed<00:01:59.640> less<00:01:59.850> gay<00:02:00.149> things

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
getting better I needed less gay things

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.899 
getting better I needed less gay things
sounded<00:02:01.440> clear<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.039> have<00:02:02.190> more<00:02:02.369> dynamic

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
sounded clear and I have more dynamic

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.730 
sounded clear and I have more dynamic
control<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.690> if<00:02:04.110> you're<00:02:04.319> at<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.440> stage<00:02:04.710> where

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
control so if you're at the stage where

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
control so if you're at the stage where
you<00:02:04.950> still<00:02:05.190> got<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.299> metal<00:02:06.810> zone

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

anyway<00:02:17.100> with<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.340> pull<00:02:17.850> off<00:02:17.970> some<00:02:18.180> start<00:02:18.450> on

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
anyway with the pull off some start on

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.150 
anyway with the pull off some start on
the<00:02:18.720> 10th<00:02:18.959> fret<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.440> little<00:02:19.650> finger<00:02:19.830> i'm

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the 10th fret the little finger i'm

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.650 
the 10th fret the little finger i'm
picking<00:02:20.730> 10<00:02:21.180> pull<00:02:22.140> off<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.250> hammer<00:02:23.549> on<00:02:23.850> 8th

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
picking 10 pull off and a hammer on 8th

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.700 
picking 10 pull off and a hammer on 8th
fret<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.290> ring<00:02:25.470> finger

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
fret the ring finger

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.220 
fret the ring finger
pull<00:02:27.280> off<00:02:27.490> have<00:02:28.000> another<00:02:28.240> 7th<00:02:28.630> fret<00:02:28.870> with<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
pull off have another 7th fret with the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.680 
pull off have another 7th fret with the
second<00:02:29.980> finger<00:02:30.660> pull<00:02:31.660> off<00:02:31.840> say<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.440> got

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
second finger pull off say if I got

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.800 
second finger pull off say if I got
then<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.710> basically<00:02:34.860> come<00:02:35.160> back<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.580> nose

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
then you basically come back up a nose

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890 
then you basically come back up a nose
so<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.900> go<00:02:37.430> back<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.670> ring<00:02:38.850> finger<00:02:39.030> back

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so you go back to the ring finger back

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.870 
so you go back to the ring finger back
the<00:02:40.050> little<00:02:40.260> finger<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:41.130> looped<00:02:41.370> random

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the little finger I just looped random

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.930 
the little finger I just looped random
out

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.760 

if<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.570> want<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> expand<00:02:47.080> on<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.320> idea<00:02:47.560> if

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
if you want to expand on this idea if

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.440 
if you want to expand on this idea if
that's<00:02:47.920> quite<00:02:48.190> easy<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.850> can<00:02:49.060> maybe<00:02:49.210> try

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
that's quite easy for you can maybe try

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.660 
that's quite easy for you can maybe try
adding<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.750> little<00:02:49.870> tackle<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.380> top

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.420 

for<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.750> I'm<00:02:57.990> doing<00:02:58.140> 12th<00:02:58.830> fret<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
for that I'm doing 12th fret and the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.880 
for that I'm doing 12th fret and the
13th<00:02:59.849> fret

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.199 

another<00:03:03.890> idea<00:03:04.069> we<00:03:04.430> start<00:03:04.700> crossing<00:03:04.970> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
another idea we start crossing the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:15.640 
another idea we start crossing the
string<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.799> I'm<00:03:12.890> going<00:03:13.099> down<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.519> GNote<00:03:14.650> on

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
string so I'm going down to a GNote on

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.680 
string so I'm going down to a GNote on
the<00:03:15.950> B<00:03:16.430> string<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.360> threat

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the B string so it's a threat

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.020 
the B string so it's a threat
the<00:03:19.170> downstroke<00:03:19.590> then<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.520> go<00:03:20.640> back<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> E

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the downstroke then I go back to the E

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.150 
the downstroke then I go back to the E
string<00:03:21.440> with<00:03:22.440> an<00:03:22.530> up<00:03:22.650> straight<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:28.920> still

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
string with an up straight if it's still

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.440 
string with an up straight if it's still
too<00:03:29.310> easy<00:03:29.490> for<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.060> need<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.330> increase

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
too easy for that you need to increase

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.870 
too easy for that you need to increase
the<00:03:30.660> stretch<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.320> try<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.620> do<00:03:31.680> an<00:03:31.890> FC<00:03:32.490> move<00:03:32.730> it

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the stretch so try and do an FC move it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.600 
the stretch so try and do an FC move it
first<00:03:33.180> fret<00:03:33.600> 1<00:03:34.140> 3<00:03:34.440> 4<00:03:34.680> &amp;<00:03:34.830> 6<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:37.430> would<00:03:38.430> imagine

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
first fret 1 3 4 &amp; 6 I would imagine

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.190 
first fret 1 3 4 &amp; 6 I would imagine
that<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> challenge<00:03:39.420> for<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.990> if

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
that it's a challenge for some of you if

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.400 
that it's a challenge for some of you if
not<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:40.830> no<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.630> better<00:03:42.810> learn<00:03:43.020> something

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
not then no you better learn something

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.180 
not then no you better learn something
harder<00:03:43.910> but<00:03:44.910> no<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:45.690> that's<00:03:45.990> a<00:03:46.470> good<00:03:46.560> way<00:03:47.160> to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
harder but no so that's a good way to

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.650 
harder but no so that's a good way to
work<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.550> your<00:03:47.670> stretching<00:03:48.060> ability<00:03:48.450> and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
work on your stretching ability and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.930 
work on your stretching ability and
improve<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.280> flutter<00:03:50.520> power<00:03:50.820> in

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
improve like the the flutter power in

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.970 
improve like the the flutter power in
your<00:03:51.030> fingers<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:51.570> right<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.770> how<00:03:52.830> many

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
your fingers so right if you how many

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.800 
your fingers so right if you how many
questions<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.550> all<00:03:53.670> difficulties<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.570> can

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
questions with all difficulties you can

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.050 
questions with all difficulties you can
drop<00:03:55.800> me<00:03:55.860> an<00:03:56.040> email<00:03:56.160> but<00:03:56.580> it's<00:03:56.880> fairly

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
drop me an email but it's fairly

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.520 
drop me an email but it's fairly
straightforward<00:03:57.240> it's<00:03:57.990> something<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.380> just

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
straightforward it's something you just

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.900 
straightforward it's something you just
need<00:03:58.740> to<00:03:58.830> do<00:03:58.920> over<00:03:59.100> time<00:03:59.340> maybe<00:03:59.640> with<00:03:59.850> a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
need to do over time maybe with a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.630 
need to do over time maybe with a
metronome<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:01.800> sit<00:04:01.950> there<00:04:02.070> with<00:04:02.250> click<00:04:02.460> and

metronome to sit there with click and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.190 
metronome to sit there with click and
make<00:04:02.760> sure<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.000> nice<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.480> time<00:04:03.690> hey
