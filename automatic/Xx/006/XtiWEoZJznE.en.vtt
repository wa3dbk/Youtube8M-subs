understand for example the technique
that<00:01:20.100> goes<00:01:20.250> into<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.970> creating<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.720> tandy

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that goes into just creating it a tandy

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.620 
that goes into just creating it a tandy
or<00:01:22.380> something<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.340> much

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
or something because there's so much

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.870 
or something because there's so much
processed<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.840> perfection<00:01:25.610> steps<00:01:26.610> and

techniques and everything that that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
techniques and everything that that
that's<00:01:29.820> hard<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.960> show<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> show<00:01:31.799> and
