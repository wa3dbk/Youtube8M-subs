00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.570
 to start a new board here in the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.790
 bin line is mostly easy to do 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.430
 recipes inspired by books and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 series and the like was super difficult to assemble 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.570
 the pomegranate for this picture we have 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 several ideas well renders who you I 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.550
 I blame the pans of cities 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.309
 pastel harry potter the secret seasoning 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 fox and spreading fire hunger games 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.120
 these were some of the parts names that the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.829
 people got to think and we solved 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.730
 as obvious as the name that people 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:09.390
 we chose was geek kitchen solved not 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:11.430
 had this picture is also in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.210
 commemorating the 28 enrolled here from 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.070
 galley channel 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.259
 the first very special recipe because 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.509
 was by percy jackson it stands to reason that in 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.729
 tomorrow night was easy for him and the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.259
 people decided to do it because I think 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.360
 is a recipe that is very striking in the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.250
 book and a fairly easy recipe does not 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.619
 It must be great skill not to know 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.570
 cooking and it is very tasty and very good 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.369
 so jackson so it 's very beautiful said 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 I want to, so we thought it would be convenient. 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.509
 that you two cups of flour 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.630
 wheat 3 4 cup brown sugar 3 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.600
 4 cup sugar crystal two sets 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.640
 a teaspoon of baking powder two 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 spoons of butter with salt 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.710
 the essence of vanilla August dye 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 food color scheme without dramas of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.659
 milk chocolate and 100 grams of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.939
 bitter chocolate you can stay there all 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.710
 together first of all we will go 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.710
 mix all the dry ingredients 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.929
 now just mix everything 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.900
 After we went, he took all the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.180
 dry ingredients and left well 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.760
 We're going to use the mixer and 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.720
 will add the other ingredients - 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.220
 of chocolate 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:41.349
 we should lift the two tablespoons of 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:43.610
 butter and eggs the vanilla 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.690
 now I thank you all and then 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.690
 people are going to put the dye 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.680
 now we will put the dye 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.239
 poses very little because the dye 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.069
 It can be a bit strong not to get 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.900
 a disc and just hit it again after the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.769
 Our ready she stays well she looks good 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.049
 thick 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.150
 You can see that neither does it, and we 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.140
 chose dark tones can make the tone 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.790
 that you want 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.310
 now just turn chocolate in here 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.340
 blend and it's time to put 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.530
 In the oven, we'll need to train. 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.510
 a form with paper butter for him the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.280
 number and that's just making the balls 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.349
 the cookie failing to pass between 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 them not to join as they were 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.950
 growing more or less 12 centimeters 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.019
 You'll see more or less this 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.880
 amount of dough is not a spoon 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.419
 full as you can see it goes 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.419
 put here 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.880
 You can make it even that guardadinhos 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.130
 then he gets dressed 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.790
 there you speak the other far away because 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.790
 it will grow a lot 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.960
 now that you've played the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.970
 respecting the space that we have spoken is 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.710
 only you put in the oven after the plan 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.120
 It is already heated the time you will 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.220
 letting vary according to your 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.980
 oven you will leave the clubs in the oven 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.720
 between 10 and 15 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.980

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.480

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:31.700
 going and back to normal 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.410
 so the staff would take the smile form 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.470
 let it cool down a bit and they 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.470
