00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
might could use the tire somewhere and I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.470

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
which surprised me i didn't think i

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.609 
which surprised me i didn't think i
could<00:01:04.369> get<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.670> spare<00:01:04.909> tire<00:01:05.150> in<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:05.479> trunk<00:01:05.780> but

it<00:01:06.710> laid<00:01:06.890> right<00:01:07.070> down<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:07.490> there<00:01:07.580> perfectly

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
it laid right down in there perfectly

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.530 
it laid right down in there perfectly
feel<00:01:08.509> like<00:01:08.659> it's<00:01:08.840> made<00:01:09.049> for<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.850> now<00:01:11.000> it's

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
feel like it's made for so now it's

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.020 
feel like it's made for so now it's
pretty<00:01:11.689> interesting<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.470> i<00:01:12.759> got<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:13.850> wonder

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
pretty interesting so i got to wonder

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.720 
pretty interesting so i got to wonder
what<00:01:14.180> kind<00:01:14.299> of<00:01:14.390> lug<00:01:14.570> pattern<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:14.960> was<00:01:15.140> and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
what kind of lug pattern it was and

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.620 
what kind of lug pattern it was and
measured<00:01:16.730> it<00:01:16.820> with<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.940> tape<00:01:17.150> measure<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.480> the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
measured it with a tape measure to the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.910 
measured it with a tape measure to the
dance<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.050> i'll<00:01:18.170> be<00:01:18.260> damned<00:01:18.440> if<00:01:18.470> that's<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:18.860> a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
dance so i'll be damned if that's not a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.990 
dance so i'll be damned if that's not a

a jack and if I did have a flat
somewhere<00:01:43.630> it<00:01:44.630> would<00:01:44.780> involve<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.500> know<00:01:45.590> if

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
somewhere it would involve you know if
