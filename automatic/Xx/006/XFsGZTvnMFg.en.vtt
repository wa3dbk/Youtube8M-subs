pretty<00:01:11.010> damn<00:01:11.250> good<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.840> good<00:01:13.110> as

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
pretty damn good but it's not as good as

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.440 
pretty damn good but it's not as good as
some<00:01:13.470> guns<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> insanity<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> insanity

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
some guns like the insanity the insanity

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.010 
some guns like the insanity the insanity
is<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.930> best<00:01:16.320> by<00:01:16.770> far<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.490> best<00:01:17.909> HP<00:01:18.750> ra3

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
is the best by far the best HP ra3
variant<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.360> could

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
variant but this one I think could

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.960 
variant but this one I think could
honestly<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.619> close<00:01:22.979> second<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.580> third<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
honestly be a close second or third this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660 
honestly be a close second or third this
thing<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.570> pretty<00:01:25.439> damn<00:01:25.890> good<00:01:26.250> next

attribute of this gun is the range

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.560 
attribute of this gun is the range
decrease<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.729> longest<00:01:39.060> range

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
decrease so it's the longest range

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
decrease so it's the longest range
decrease<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> distance<00:01:40.500> where<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.979> goes

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
decrease so the distance where it goes

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.359 
decrease so the distance where it goes
from<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:42.180> four<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> A<00:01:42.990> five<00:01:43.439> bullet<00:01:43.890> kill<00:01:44.130> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
from a four to A five bullet kill is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
from a four to A five bullet kill is
changed<00:01:45.000> by<00:01:45.060> about<00:01:45.270> 300<00:01:45.689> millimeters<00:01:46.619> which

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
changed by about 300 millimeters which

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.639 
changed by about 300 millimeters which
is<00:01:47.040> actually<00:01:47.310> quite<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.880> bit<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.210> game<00:01:48.649> however

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
is actually quite a bit in game however

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.370 
is actually quite a bit in game however
this<00:01:50.100> distance<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.000> honestly<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.869> half<00:01:52.200> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this distance is honestly about half of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.639 
this distance is honestly about half of
a<00:01:52.500> map<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.100> um<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.689> still<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> four

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
a map that um you can still get a four

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.499 
a map that um you can still get a four
bullet<00:01:55.979> kill<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.820> long<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.360> getting

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
bullet kill so as long as you're getting

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.480 
bullet kill so as long as you're getting
into<00:01:57.840> somewhat<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.469> close<00:01:58.890> range<00:01:59.219> gunfights

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
into somewhat of close range gunfights

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
into somewhat of close range gunfights
you're<00:01:59.939> pretty<00:02:00.119> much<00:02:00.270> always<00:02:00.479> looking<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you're pretty much always looking at a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.590 
you're pretty much always looking at a
three<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> four<00:02:01.649> bullet<00:02:02.009> kill<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> improve

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
three to four bullet kill now to improve

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.899 
three to four bullet kill now to improve
on<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.500> hips<00:02:04.770> spread<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.280> decreased<00:02:05.759> by

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
on this the hips spread is decreased by

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.609 
on this the hips spread is decreased by
twenty<00:02:06.270> percent<00:02:06.570> which<00:02:06.780> means<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.140> up<00:02:07.409> close

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
twenty percent which means that up close

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.190 
twenty percent which means that up close
this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.550> probably<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.300> best<00:02:09.750> gun<00:02:09.989> you're

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this is probably the best gun you're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.800 
this is probably the best gun you're
going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.440> assume<00:02:10.800> up<00:02:11.069> close<00:02:11.459> because<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
going to assume up close because of that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.950 
going to assume up close because of that
decreased<00:02:13.290> hip<00:02:13.470> spread

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
decreased hip spread

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.540 
decreased hip spread
and<00:02:14.050> because<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.800> only<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.040> three<00:02:15.310> bullet

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and because it's only a three bullet

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.240 
and because it's only a three bullet
kill<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:16.240> gun<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.750> actually<00:02:17.200> possibly<00:02:17.950> beat

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
kill this gun can actually possibly beat

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.700 
kill this gun can actually possibly beat
the<00:02:18.460> ASM<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.180> at<00:02:19.330> close<00:02:19.630> now<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.050> other<00:02:20.380> bad

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
the ASM one at close now the other bad

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.550 
the ASM one at close now the other bad
thing<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.790> view<00:02:22.690> kick<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.080> increased

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
thing is that the view kick is increased

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.950 
thing is that the view kick is increased
by<00:02:23.650> ten<00:02:23.920> percent<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.550> just<00:02:24.850> simply<00:02:25.330> fixed

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
by ten percent this is just simply fixed

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.260 
by ten percent this is just simply fixed
by<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.140> foregrip<00:02:26.590> however<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.190> guns<00:02:27.550> recoil

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
by a foregrip however this guns recoil

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.970 
by a foregrip however this guns recoil
honestly<00:02:29.080> makes<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.800> get

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
honestly makes it so you just get

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.580 
honestly makes it so you just get
headshots<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.880> crazy<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.840> way<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.140> kicks<00:02:32.410> is

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
headshots like crazy the way it kicks is

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.740 
headshots like crazy the way it kicks is
just<00:02:32.890> basically<00:02:33.280> directs<00:02:33.850> your<00:02:34.030> gun<00:02:34.240> straight

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
just basically directs your gun straight

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.900 
just basically directs your gun straight
up<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.050> their<00:02:35.170> head<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.500> got<00:02:35.710> tons<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.490> tons

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
up to their head and I got tons and tons

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.250 
up to their head and I got tons and tons
of<00:02:37.090> head<00:02:37.240> shots<00:02:37.270> throughout<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.870> game<00:02:38.050> play

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of head shots throughout this game play

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.320 
of head shots throughout this game play
as<00:02:38.380> you're<00:02:38.500> going<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.830> see<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.760> wasn't<00:02:39.970> even

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
as you're going to see and I wasn't even

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.700 
as you're going to see and I wasn't even
using<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.750> foregrip<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.350> definitely

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
using a foregrip but I definitely

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.410 
using a foregrip but I definitely
suggest<00:02:41.950> using<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.550> fork<00:02:42.760> up<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.150> top<00:02:43.360> of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
suggest using a fork up and on top of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.910 
suggest using a fork up and on top of
that<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.720> get<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> free<00:02:44.170> red<00:02:44.410> dot<00:02:44.590> sight<00:02:44.800> now

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
that you get a free red dot sight now

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560 
that you get a free red dot sight now
what<00:02:45.070> do<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.190> mean<00:02:45.370> by<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.550> free<00:02:45.850> red<00:02:46.090> dot<00:02:46.300> sight

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
what do I mean by a free red dot sight

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.070 
what do I mean by a free red dot sight
it<00:02:46.960> does<00:02:47.470> not<00:02:47.830> take<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.820> space<00:02:49.330> on<00:02:49.600> your<00:02:49.660> pick

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
it does not take up a space on your pick

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.800 
it does not take up a space on your pick
13<00:02:50.800> so<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.550> means<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.910> actually<00:02:52.060> really<00:02:52.600> do

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
13 so that means you actually really do

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140 
13 so that means you actually really do
get<00:02:52.990> 14<00:02:53.590> things<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.190> use<00:02:54.340> maybe<00:02:54.700> an<00:02:54.820> extra

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
get 14 things to use maybe an extra

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.120 
get 14 things to use maybe an extra
connait<00:02:55.480> or<00:02:56.020> maybe<00:02:56.230> even<00:02:56.320> an<00:02:56.560> extra<00:02:56.950> kill

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
connait or maybe even an extra kill

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.320 
connait or maybe even an extra kill
streak<00:02:57.370> if<00:02:57.490> that's<00:02:57.670> something<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.090> really

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
streak if that's something you really

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.090 
streak if that's something you really
really<00:02:58.360> want<00:02:58.750> because<00:02:58.960> he<00:02:59.320> kill<00:02:59.710> streaks<00:02:59.980> are

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
really want because he kill streaks are

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.580 
really want because he kill streaks are
definitely<00:03:00.520> get<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> bowl<00:03:01.060> with<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:01.450> gun<00:03:01.690> so

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
definitely get a bowl with this gun so

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.740 
definitely get a bowl with this gun so
as<00:03:03.070> far<00:03:03.430> as<00:03:03.490> using<00:03:03.940> this<00:03:04.180> gun<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.480> definitely

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
as far as using this gun I definitely

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.450 
as far as using this gun I definitely
suggest<00:03:04.990> using<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.530> foregrip<00:03:05.950> with<00:03:06.310> the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
suggest using a foregrip with the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.090 
suggest using a foregrip with the
obviously<00:03:07.030> attached<00:03:07.390> red<00:03:07.690> dot<00:03:07.900> sight<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:09.070> that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
obviously attached red dot sight so that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.830 
obviously attached red dot sight so that
fixes<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.670> view<00:03:10.030> kick<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.270> only<00:03:10.540> thing<00:03:10.750> you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
fixes the view kick the only thing you

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.840 
fixes the view kick the only thing you
can't<00:03:11.140> fix<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.980> reduced<00:03:12.460> range

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
can't fix is that reduced range

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.760 
can't fix is that reduced range
unfortunately<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.810> like<00:03:13.960> I<00:03:14.080> said<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.710> is

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
unfortunately so like I said this is

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.090 
unfortunately so like I said this is
probably<00:03:15.190> um<00:03:15.760> up<00:03:16.690> there<00:03:17.170> in<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.470> top<00:03:17.620> three

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
probably um up there in the top three

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.160 
probably um up there in the top three
variants<00:03:18.550> for<00:03:18.670> this<00:03:18.790> gun<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.120> really<00:03:19.630> enjoy<00:03:19.990> it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
variants for this gun I really enjoy it

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.630 
variants for this gun I really enjoy it
the<00:03:20.320> only<00:03:20.710> problem<00:03:21.190> you're<00:03:21.310> gonna<00:03:21.430> run<00:03:21.580> into

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
the only problem you're gonna run into

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.060 
the only problem you're gonna run into
is<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.060> little<00:03:22.630> range<00:03:23.290> decrease<00:03:23.770> which

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
is that little range decrease which

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.530 
is that little range decrease which
means<00:03:24.310> you're<00:03:24.460> going<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.610> not<00:03:24.940> want<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.450> get

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
means you're going to not want to get

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.510 
means you're going to not want to get
the<00:03:25.690> long<00:03:25.930> range<00:03:26.290> gunfights<00:03:26.590> with<00:03:27.100> this<00:03:27.310> now

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
the long range gunfights with this now

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.800 
the long range gunfights with this now

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
as far as a class you're going to want

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.900 
as far as a class you're going to want
to<00:03:28.900> use<00:03:28.990> low<00:03:29.680> profile<00:03:30.130> lightweight<00:03:30.610> blast

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
to use low profile lightweight blast

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.730 
to use low profile lightweight blast

basic assault rifle class and other than
that<00:03:36.730> there<00:03:36.940> really<00:03:37.150> isn't<00:03:37.540> much<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.840> know<00:03:37.960> the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
that there really isn't much to know the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.720 
that there really isn't much to know the
only<00:03:38.500> other<00:03:38.650> thing<00:03:38.740> I<00:03:38.980> want<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.250> stress<00:03:39.490> is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
only other thing I want to stress is

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.460 
only other thing I want to stress is
that<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.000> first<00:03:40.210> few<00:03:40.510> bullets<00:03:40.870> fired<00:03:41.170> out<00:03:41.350> of

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that the first few bullets fired out of

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.810 
that the first few bullets fired out of
this<00:03:41.530> gun<00:03:41.770> fire<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.100> little<00:03:42.460> bit<00:03:42.640> faster

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
this gun fire a little bit faster

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.270 
this gun fire a little bit faster
actually<00:03:43.660> about<00:03:44.520> 225<00:03:46.110> faster<00:03:47.110> than<00:03:47.350> normal<00:03:47.710> so

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
actually about 225 faster than normal so

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.490 
actually about 225 faster than normal so
like<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:48.970> said<00:03:49.030> if<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.510> best<00:03:49.780> variant<00:03:50.140> for<00:03:50.380> this

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
like I said if the best variant for this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.320 
like I said if the best variant for this
gun<00:03:50.710> is<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.950> insanity<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.910> don't<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.300> it

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
gun is the insanity if you don't have it

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.850 
gun is the insanity if you don't have it
