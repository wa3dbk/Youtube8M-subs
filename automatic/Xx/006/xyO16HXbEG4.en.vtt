 ani 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:17.820
 I was not particularly confused 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.460
 I see over and over again because the types that do not fit in easily in just heard that one-time head 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.300
 The video lecture I could do was also very good 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:30.400
 After all it was very big that we could confirm with picture 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:33.370
 After all because only text can not do the image in my head 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.660
 That 's good at that point 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.450
 Because there is a lot of study 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:46.340
 And in what kind of wind in his study has not erected pretty good mid-cap If we were to test 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:49.850
 I think I have the advantage of going to school to manage it well later 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 After all I think it was very big 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.020
 That morning 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:01.220
 Go to work early 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:06.170
 It takes about one and a half hours of study time until the documents and I have a lunch break for an hour as well. 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.960
 Because it 's a waste of time to spend that time 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.610
 It was devoted to the time of the study 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.880
 As a study week of study one week, it is given in advance in the prefecture well 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.409
 Because there is a schedule, while doing it 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:26.509
 Than later forgets it back before that absolutely 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:30.450
 It is always one day that it is time to review what has been done so far 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 Well, it was so little also provided a 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:41.130
 It will be a little lie if it is said that it is not 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.479
 I felt so strong that I learned so much that there was no one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.620
 I was able to 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.140
 However, if the score of the test is bad 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.060
 Cormorants already softening 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.170
 It's a family worried about or to say How about trying has really but I wonder'm not still do it 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.900
 If it were not for the other 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.750
 Pass in the first place 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.610
 I think that it is to study for the time being because there is no chance and I tell myself to learn 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.600
 It was a 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.560
 So also there is a portion that are doing paying for a moment the Kinpara money 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.410
 Because there was a loss if it did not go up 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:22.630
 This holiday agent or path lecture was not as sure to leave 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.830
 It passed the thing is I really was good, but the over the form of still primary architect is very 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.960
 Because there is a little heavy thing 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.460
 Well this is not the end of my study 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.630
 In order to avoid being ashamed of the name of first-class architects, I have to keep studying everyday 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:41.770
 thought 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:44.770
 Class architect is I think that it is sure to pass your test if efforts 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.520
 At first we say that we always want to receive 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.420
 I think it is important to have a certain feeling 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.420
 Good luck everyone 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.989
 me 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.250
