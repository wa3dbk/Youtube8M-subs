in<00:00:16.440> growing<00:00:16.860> citrus<00:00:17.280> we<00:00:17.640> also<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> pay

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
in growing citrus we also have to pay

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.630 
in growing citrus we also have to pay
attention<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.650> problems<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.220> insects

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
attention to the problems with insects

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.429 
attention to the problems with insects
and<00:00:21.440> there<00:00:22.440> are<00:00:23.150> several<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.930> affect<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and there are several that do affect the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.660 
and there are several that do affect the
plant<00:00:25.710> pretty<00:00:25.980> severely<00:00:27.500> most<00:00:28.500> people<00:00:29.040> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
plant pretty severely most people that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.580 
plant pretty severely most people that
grow<00:00:29.880> citrus<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.810> time<00:00:31.020> to<00:00:31.170> time<00:00:31.200> have

distances to get on the plant and then

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.270 
distances to get on the plant and then
there<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:50.969> those<00:00:51.180> insects<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.109> spider<00:00:52.980> mite

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
there are those insects like spider mite

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
there are those insects like spider mite
which<00:00:53.670> actually<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.750> move<00:00:54.899> through<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> air

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
which actually can move through the air

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.180 
which actually can move through the air
and<00:00:55.829> seem<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.239> affect<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.800> foliage<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.070> our

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and seem to affect the foliage of our

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
and seem to affect the foliage of our
plants<00:00:59.640> particularly<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.140> move<00:01:01.320> our

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
plants particularly when we move our

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
plants particularly when we move our
plants<00:01:01.800> from<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> outside<00:01:02.519> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.760> summer

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
plants from the outside in the summer

plants from the outside in the summer
inside<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> winter<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.680> problems

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
inside in the winter we see problems

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 
inside in the winter we see problems
with<00:01:05.489> spider<00:01:05.820> mite<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.990> many<00:01:07.290> ways<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
with spider mite there are many ways to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.100 
with spider mite there are many ways to
control<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.550> spider<00:01:09.270> mite<00:01:09.510> simply<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
control that spider mite simply it's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
control that spider mite simply it's
cold<00:01:10.410> water<00:01:10.740> sprayed<00:01:11.190> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> entire<00:01:11.850> plant

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
cold water sprayed on the entire plant

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
cold water sprayed on the entire plant
do<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:12.810> every<00:01:13.020> day<00:01:13.050> for<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.440> week<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:13.800> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
do it every day for a week and that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
do it every day for a week and that
pretty<00:01:14.130> much<00:01:14.310> eliminates<00:01:14.850> them<00:01:15.120> you<00:01:15.690> can<00:01:15.870> also

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
pretty much eliminates them you can also

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.040 
pretty much eliminates them you can also
use<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.980> of<00:01:17.070> our<00:01:17.190> favorites<00:01:17.730> which<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.090> neem

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
use one of our favorites which is neem

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.680 
use one of our favorites which is neem
oil<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.830> leaf<00:01:20.100> polisher<00:01:20.760> mix<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> up

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
oil that's a leaf polisher mix it up

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.080 
oil that's a leaf polisher mix it up
spray<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.410> entire<00:01:22.680> plant<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.790> works

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
spray it on the entire plant that works

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.600 
spray it on the entire plant that works
very<00:01:24.300> well<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.780> both<00:01:24.810> mealy<00:01:25.260> bug<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> scale

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
very well for both mealy bug and scale

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
very well for both mealy bug and scale
although<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> remember<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.500> those

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
although you have to remember with those

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.040 
although you have to remember with those
two<00:01:28.980> insects<00:01:29.700> repeated<00:01:30.300> applications<00:01:30.900> are

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
two insects repeated applications are

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.800 
two insects repeated applications are
necessary<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:32.250> order<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.580> get<00:01:32.760> control<00:01:33.090> one

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
necessary in order to get control one

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.140 
necessary in order to get control one
application<00:01:34.500> may<00:01:34.800> suppress<00:01:35.580> them<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.060> you'll

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
application may suppress them and you'll

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.170 
application may suppress them and you'll
see<00:01:36.360> them<00:01:36.510> sort<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> disappear<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.560> they<00:01:37.740> will

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
see them sort of disappear but they will

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.880 
see them sort of disappear but they will
but<00:01:39.180> trust<00:01:39.450> me<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.840> will<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.080> back<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.860> we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
but trust me they will be back if we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
but trust me they will be back if we
don't<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.400> repeated<00:01:41.790> applications<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
don't do repeated applications and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.090 
don't do repeated applications and
generally<00:01:43.050> it's<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.680> three<00:01:43.980> or<00:01:44.070> four

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
generally it's like three or four

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.730 
generally it's like three or four
applications<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.630> good<00:01:45.930> penetration<00:01:46.620> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
applications with good penetration of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.590 
applications with good penetration of
the<00:01:46.770> canopy<00:01:47.190> so<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.730> means<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.120> need<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.390> get

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the canopy so that means you need to get

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.720 
the canopy so that means you need to get
a<00:01:48.660> sprayer<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.350> has<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.800> force<00:01:50.160> on<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.580> so

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
a sprayer that has some force on it so

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.550 
a sprayer that has some force on it so
that<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.150> get<00:01:51.330> down<00:01:51.870> into<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.260> cracks

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that you can get down into the cracks

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.770 
that you can get down into the cracks
into<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.160> around<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.550> fruit<00:01:53.760> into<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.390> edges

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
into the around the fruit into the edges

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.900 
into the around the fruit into the edges
of<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.050> leaves<00:01:55.260> here<00:01:55.680> where<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> insects<00:01:56.700> may
