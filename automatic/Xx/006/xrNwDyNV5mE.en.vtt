in the we do offer another alternative
it's<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.439> wind-powered<00:01:35.299> execution

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it's a wind-powered execution

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
it's a wind-powered execution
that's<00:01:37.259> greener<00:01:37.560> option<00:01:38.180> then<00:01:39.180> why<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that's greener option then why don't you

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.429 
that's greener option then why don't you
use<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.020> all<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.170> time

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
use it all the time

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.639 
use it all the time
ah<00:01:40.970> well<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.090> has<00:01:42.210> its<00:01:42.360> pros<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.689> cons<00:01:42.899> it's

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.680 
getting a little impatient they want us
to<00:02:31.950> hurry<00:02:32.220> things<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.640> hey

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
to hurry things up hey

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.280 
to hurry things up hey
so<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:35.280> might<00:02:35.819> just<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.360> go<00:02:36.600> back<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.019> plan

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
so we might just have to go back to plan

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.350 
so we might just have to go back to plan
a<00:02:37.500> if<00:02:38.400> that's<00:02:38.640> okay<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:38.910> you

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
a if that's okay with you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.630 
a if that's okay with you
why<00:02:39.810> don't<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.110> just<00:02:40.319> take<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> chariot<00:02:41.370> on

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
why don't we just take the chariot on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.630 
why don't we just take the chariot on
what<00:02:42.540> are<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.630> talking<00:02:42.900> about<00:02:43.110> what<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.890> was

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
what are you talking about what I was

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.340 
what are you talking about what I was
thinking<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.030> might<00:02:45.330> be<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.569> problem<00:02:45.810> is

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
thinking that might be the problem is

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.920 
thinking that might be the problem is
that<00:02:46.980> there's<00:02:47.130> not<00:02:47.250> enough<00:02:47.519> wind<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:48.090> here<00:02:48.299> to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
that there's not enough wind in here to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.920 
that there's not enough wind in here to
power<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> turbine<00:02:49.940> not<00:02:50.940> exactly<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.390> drafting

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
power the turbine not exactly a drafting

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.949 
power the turbine not exactly a drafting
room<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:53.340> if<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:53.640> took<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.000> cherry<00:02:54.299> out<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.720> to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
room but if we took the cherry out on to

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.970 
room but if we took the cherry out on to
our<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.910> climb<00:02:57.590> probably<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.799> job

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
our and I can climb probably get the job

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.289 
our and I can climb probably get the job
done<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.280> extra<00:02:59.549> night<00:02:59.670> time<00:03:00.590> yeah<00:03:02.299> maybe

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
done in extra night time yeah maybe

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.729 
done in extra night time yeah maybe
something<00:03:03.570> yeah<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.019> like<00:03:04.380> that

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
something yeah I like that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.720 
something yeah I like that
I<00:03:04.769> really<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:06.019> well<00:03:07.160> actually<00:03:08.160> it's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
I really like that well actually it's

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.400 
I really like that well actually it's
much<00:03:08.910> windier<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.630> think<00:03:09.989> that's<00:03:10.110> gonna<00:03:10.230> do<00:03:10.380> the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
much windier I think that's gonna do the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.699 
much windier I think that's gonna do the
trick<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.980> was<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.489> great<00:03:11.820> suggestion

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
trick that was a great suggestion

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.920 
trick that was a great suggestion
where's<00:03:13.709> he<00:03:13.769> gone<00:03:16.880> there<00:03:17.880> is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
where's he gone there is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.490 
where's he gone there is
oh<00:03:20.670> crap<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:22.000> didn't<00:03:22.900> work<00:03:23.019> out<00:03:23.140> well<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.379> all

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500
