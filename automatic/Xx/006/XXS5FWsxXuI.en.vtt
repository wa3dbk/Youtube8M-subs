00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
much gonna take the foundation brush and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.350 
much gonna take the foundation brush and
I'm<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.700> some<00:01:53.909> product

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I'm going to you know get some product

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
I'm going to you know get some product
on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.200> bristles<00:01:55.590> we're<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
on the bristles we're going to do the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.520 
on the bristles we're going to do the
same<00:01:56.850> motion<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.630> terms<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.140> however<00:01:58.290> you'll

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
same motion in terms of however you'll

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.039 
same motion in terms of however you'll
probably<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.070> would<00:01:59.250> put<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.539> so

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
probably you would put it on as well so

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.779 
probably you would put it on as well so
we're<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.649> lay<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.399> down<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
we're just going to lay it down on the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.170 
we're just going to lay it down on the
face<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:04.009> just<00:02:05.009> go<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.579> forth<00:02:05.789> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
face and just go back and forth and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.700 
face and just go back and forth and
that's<00:02:06.390> probably<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:06.780> most<00:02:06.810> people<00:02:07.110> will<00:02:07.530> put

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that's probably how most people will put

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.010 
that's probably how most people will put
it<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:09.479> start<00:02:09.840> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
it on and that's how I would start to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.560 
it on and that's how I would start to
put<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.320> on<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.560> well<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.530> over<00:02:13.740> face

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
put it on as well just going over face

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.210 
put it on as well just going over face
now<00:02:15.570> you'll<00:02:15.750> notice<00:02:15.990> with<00:02:16.500> foundation

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
now you'll notice with foundation

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.980 
now you'll notice with foundation
particularly<00:02:17.640> as<00:02:18.030> well.when<00:02:18.510> because<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:18.960> I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
particularly as well.when because when I

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.840 
particularly as well.when because when I
mentioned<00:02:19.440> face<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.980> body<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.670> there

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
mentioned face and body that there

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.300 
mentioned face and body that there
suddenly<00:02:21.180> start<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> bit<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.990> lag<00:02:22.230> time

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
suddenly start to be a bit of lag time

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.430 
suddenly start to be a bit of lag time
you<00:02:23.310> will<00:02:23.490> suddenly<00:02:23.760> start<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.390> feel<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.080> drag

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
you will suddenly start to feel it drag

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
you will suddenly start to feel it drag
and<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.740> happens<00:02:26.100> with<00:02:26.190> most<00:02:26.430> foundations

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and that happens with most foundations

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.990 
and that happens with most foundations
as<00:02:27.120> they<00:02:27.240> start<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.630> dry<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.640> when<00:02:29.850> that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
as they start to dry and when that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.960 
as they start to dry and when that
happens<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:31.530> technique<00:02:31.980> will<00:02:32.160> change<00:02:32.490> so

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
happens your technique will change so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.280 
happens your technique will change so
we're<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.270> going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.570> get<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> product<00:02:34.200> on

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
incredibly simple but people just don't

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.190 
incredibly simple but people just don't
think<00:03:23.370> about<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.239> just<00:03:24.269> expect<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.930> sort

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
think about it you just expect to sort

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.740 
think about it you just expect to sort
of<00:03:25.260> paint<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.620> wall<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:27.090> should<00:03:27.269> be<00:03:27.420> you

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
of paint the wall and it should be you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.570 
of paint the wall and it should be you
know<00:03:27.780> nice<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.290> beautiful<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.220> then

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
know nice and beautiful and and then

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.240 
know nice and beautiful and and then
suddenly<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.000> isn't<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.830> I'm<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:31.980> putting<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
suddenly it isn't so I'm just putting a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.580 
suddenly it isn't so I'm just putting a
little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.550> more<00:03:32.700> on<00:03:32.760> my<00:03:32.790> forehead<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.590> again

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
little bit more on my forehead and again

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.290 
little bit more on my forehead and again
and<00:03:34.800> I'm<00:03:34.860> going<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.730> pat<00:03:36.060> in

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
and I'm going to just do this pat in

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.229 
and I'm going to just do this pat in
motion<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.650> blend<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.640> really<00:03:38.910> really

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
motion to blend it and it really really

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.949 
motion to blend it and it really really
does<00:03:39.600> blend<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:41.400> do<00:03:41.580> get<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.000> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
does blend it and you do get this this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.380 
does blend it and you do get this this
seamless<00:03:43.410> seamless<00:03:44.190> transition<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.150> color

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
seamless seamless transition of color

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.479 
seamless seamless transition of color
where<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.410> looks<00:03:46.530> beautiful<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.340> this

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
where it just looks beautiful and this

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.180 
where it just looks beautiful and this
is<00:03:47.640> kind<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.060> why<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.500> how<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.709> use<00:03:50.160> it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
is kind of why I this is how I use it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.870 
is kind of why I this is how I use it
and<00:03:51.110> this<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.320> how<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> would<00:03:52.860> apply<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
and this is how I would apply it to the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.400 
and this is how I would apply it to the
skin<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.299> would<00:03:54.420> also<00:03:54.540> apply<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> couple<00:03:55.230> of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
skin and I would also apply a couple of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.780 
skin and I would also apply a couple of
colors<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.799> actually<00:03:56.070> probably<00:03:56.220> apply<00:03:56.549> a

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
colors that actually probably apply a

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.520 
colors that actually probably apply a
light<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.540> show<00:03:57.720> down<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.019> center<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.470> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
light to show down the center of the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.380 
light to show down the center of the
face<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:58.950> then<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.459> slightly<00:03:59.790> darker<00:04:00.060> one

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
face and then a slightly darker one

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.970 
face and then a slightly darker one
around<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.049> perimeter<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.530> didn't<00:04:01.769> do<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:01.890> this

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
around the perimeter I didn't do it this

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.759 
around the perimeter I didn't do it this
time<00:04:02.040> because<00:04:02.810> while<00:04:03.810> signing<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.350> me<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.709> it

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
time because while signing on me so it

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.949 
time because while signing on me so it
doesn't<00:04:04.950> really<00:04:05.010> matter<00:04:05.360> but<00:04:06.360> that's<00:04:06.750> how<00:04:06.930> I

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
doesn't really matter but that's how I

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.509 
doesn't really matter but that's how I
like<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.230> do<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.950> Center<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.340> face

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
like to do and I like to Center the face

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.250 
like to do and I like to Center the face
slightly<00:04:08.850> lighter<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.570> then<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:09.870> sort<00:04:10.230> of

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
slightly lighter and then it's sort of

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.830 
slightly lighter and then it's sort of
fading<00:04:10.590> away<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.950> little<00:04:11.160> bit<00:04:11.280> darker<00:04:11.840> so

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
fading away to a little bit darker so

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.120 
fading away to a little bit darker so
that's<00:04:13.019> how<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.260> use<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> foundation<00:04:13.680> brush

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
that's how you use a foundation brush

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.990 
that's how you use a foundation brush
you<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.700> paint<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.739> then<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:17.010> pat<00:04:17.970> it

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
you just paint it on and then you pat it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.360 
you just paint it on and then you pat it
and<00:04:18.299> I'll<00:04:19.019> get<00:04:19.320> closer<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.830> camera<00:04:20.040> for

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
and I'll get closer to the camera for

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.810 
and I'll get closer to the camera for
you<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:21.060> I'll<00:04:21.150> upload<00:04:21.330> this<00:04:21.690> in<00:04:21.930> HD<00:04:22.820> now

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
you and I'll upload this in HD now

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.279 
you and I'll upload this in HD now
remember<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.240> haven't<00:04:24.390> set<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:24.840> with<00:04:25.050> powder

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
remember I haven't set this with powder

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.890 
remember I haven't set this with powder
so<00:04:25.650> where<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.430> shiny<00:04:27.060> shiny<00:04:27.330> skin<00:04:27.690> I

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
so where this is shiny shiny skin I

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.129 
so where this is shiny shiny skin I
didn't<00:04:28.770> really<00:04:28.919> mention<00:04:29.039> it<00:04:29.340> too<00:04:29.490> much<00:04:29.640> before

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
didn't really mention it too much before

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.600 
didn't really mention it too much before
face<00:04:30.259> and<00:04:30.409> body<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.710> very<00:04:30.830> good<00:04:31.069> for<00:04:31.219> mature

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
face and body is very good for mature

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.850 
face and body is very good for mature
skin<00:04:31.879> because<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:33.229> kind<00:04:33.439> of<00:04:33.499> brings<00:04:33.560> about

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
skin because it kind of brings about

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.679 
skin because it kind of brings about
that<00:04:34.099> glow<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.729> as<00:04:34.969> you<00:04:35.090> get<00:04:35.240> older<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.539> skin

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:35.689 
that glow and as you get older the skin

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.619 
that glow and as you get older the skin
tends<00:04:36.169> to<00:04:36.289> get<00:04:36.409> dry<00:04:36.469> not<00:04:36.860> always<00:04:37.219> but<00:04:37.550> tends<00:04:38.389> to

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
tends to get dry not always but tends to

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.659 
tends to get dry not always but tends to
so<00:04:39.620> that's<00:04:39.740> how<00:04:39.949> you<00:04:40.009> use<00:04:40.129> a<00:04:40.159> foundation<00:04:40.400> brush

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669
