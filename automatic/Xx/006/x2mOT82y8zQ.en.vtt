fail<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.420> here's<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.659> game<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> had

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
fail and here's a game that if it had

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.770 
fail and here's a game that if it had
actually<00:02:25.530> done<00:02:26.400> well<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:26.849> think<00:02:27.420> probably

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
actually done well I think probably

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.009 
actually done well I think probably
could<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.379> become<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.860> successful<00:02:29.610> franchise

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
could have become a successful franchise

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.660 
could have become a successful franchise
but<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.049> really<00:02:31.620> doubt<00:02:31.799> that<00:02:31.830> Capcom<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.519> gonna

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
but I really doubt that Capcom is gonna

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.610 
but I really doubt that Capcom is gonna
go<00:02:32.849> back<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.299> this<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.720> especially<00:02:34.260> with

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
go back with this one especially with

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710 
go back with this one especially with
the<00:02:34.739> whole<00:02:34.920> ending<00:02:35.280> debacle<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.209> an<00:02:36.330> epic

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the whole ending debacle what an epic

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.069 
the whole ending debacle what an epic
fail<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:38.120> next<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.269> know<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:39.599> one's<00:02:39.810> probably

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
fail of next I know this one's probably

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.899 
fail of next I know this one's probably
gonna<00:02:40.440> cause<00:02:40.680> some<00:02:40.920> controversies<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:41.849> I

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
gonna cause some controversies but I

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.270
