that these tanks aren't as good as they
seem<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.399> then<00:01:07.119> i'll<00:01:07.240> stop<00:01:07.509> playing<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.580> get

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.930 
like also him without doing damage he's
too<00:01:42.910> low<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.599> i<00:01:43.630> can't<00:01:43.929> really<00:01:43.990> hit<00:01:44.349> him<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.880> the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
too low so i can't really hit him in the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.550 
too low so i can't really hit him in the
bottom<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:47.410> rear<00:01:47.590> but<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.569> this<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

spinach<00:01:53.560> trouble<00:01:53.950> by<00:01:54.459> all<00:01:54.610> change<00:01:54.929> but<00:01:55.929> i<00:01:56.200> did

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
spinach trouble by all change but i did

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.660

miss<00:01:56.740> or<00:01:57.220> no<00:01:58.030> i<00:01:58.270> think<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.259> then<00:02:00.160> it's<00:02:00.429> back<00:02:00.610> to

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670

the<00:02:01.380> t-34<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:03.750> he<00:02:04.750> obviously<00:02:04.929> haven't<00:02:05.500> played

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
the t-34 and he obviously haven't played

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.339 
the t-34 and he obviously haven't played
this<00:02:05.950> map<00:02:06.160> enough<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:07.000> know<00:02:07.149> that<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:08.170> can

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
this map enough to know that you can

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.250 
this map enough to know that you can
shoot<00:02:08.979> through<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.340> windows<00:02:10.060> i<00:02:10.630> couldn't<00:02:11.170> hit

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
shoot through the windows i couldn't hit

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.440 
shoot through the windows i couldn't hit
him<00:02:11.380> because<00:02:11.530> he<00:02:11.860> was<00:02:12.010> too<00:02:12.520> far<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> write<00:02:13.120> but

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
him because he was too far to write but

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.440 
him because he was too far to write but
now<00:02:13.599> he<00:02:13.660> moved<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.260> i<00:02:15.069> can<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:15.880> safely<00:02:16.150> hit

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
now he moved and i can now safely hit

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.440 
now he moved and i can now safely hit
him<00:02:16.569> because<00:02:17.560> he's<00:02:17.800> not<00:02:17.950> aiming<00:02:18.160> at<00:02:18.370> me

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.410 

and<00:02:21.450> he<00:02:21.959> got<00:02:22.830> hurt<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.430> he<00:02:23.640> obviously<00:02:23.849> didn't

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and he got hurt but he obviously didn't

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.089 
and he got hurt but he obviously didn't
notice<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.560> got<00:02:26.280> another<00:02:26.520> shot<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.980> then<00:02:28.980> he

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
notice so I got another shot and then he

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.110 
notice so I got another shot and then he
starts<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.330> think<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:32.250> goes<00:02:32.520> over<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
starts to think and goes over to the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.180 
starts to think and goes over to the
other<00:02:36.120> side<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:37.020> still<00:02:37.170> hit<00:02:37.319> him<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
other side but I can still hit him and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.410 
other side but I can still hit him and
he's<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:39.030> fuck<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.630> think<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.280> he<00:02:42.150> puts

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
he's like the fuck I think so he puts

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.910 
he's like the fuck I think so he puts
his<00:02:42.690> turret<00:02:43.020> right<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.890> hole<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.709> then

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.570 
I'm thinking okay now he's just he's in
soon<00:02:49.110> mode<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:49.800> waiting<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.190> me<00:02:50.280> so

probably<00:06:33.940> right<00:06:34.090> there<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.479> know<00:06:34.570> but<00:06:35.380> even

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
probably right there I know but even

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.879 
probably right there I know but even
when<00:06:36.130> I<00:06:36.340> aim<00:06:36.520> probably<00:06:37.150> for<00:06:38.080> the<00:06:38.110> weak<00:06:38.320> spots<00:06:38.620> I

right spots right here I aim for the
