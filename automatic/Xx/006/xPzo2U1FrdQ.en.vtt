00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
know it took me a while to make

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.320 
know it took me a while to make
decisions<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> few<00:00:25.859> characters<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.730> um

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
decisions on a few characters because um

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.130 
decisions on a few characters because um
it's<00:00:28.140> seeing<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.070> most<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.599> auditions

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it's seeing that most of the auditions

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.819 
it's seeing that most of the auditions
refer<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:32.520> specific<00:00:33.210> characters<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.739> only

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
refer for specific characters I can only

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.970 
refer for specific characters I can only
use<00:00:35.130> sound<00:00:35.430> waves<00:00:35.610> voice<00:00:36.559> once<00:00:37.559> there's<00:00:37.860> only

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
use sound waves voice once there's only

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
use sound waves voice once there's only
one<00:00:38.280> sound<00:00:38.579> wave<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.030> there's<00:00:39.149> only<00:00:39.270> one

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
one sound wave and there's only one

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
one sound wave and there's only one
shock<00:00:39.870> wave<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.410> only<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.649> Megatron<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
shock wave there's only one Megatron so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
shock wave there's only one Megatron so
if<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.780> voice<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.020> very<00:00:43.530> close<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
if your voice is very close to the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
if your voice is very close to the
original<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:45.090> hard<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.539> use<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.960> voice

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
original it's hard to use that voice

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.029 
original it's hard to use that voice
again<00:00:46.550> if<00:00:47.600> someone<00:00:48.600> else<00:00:48.780> lands<00:00:49.379> sound<00:00:49.739> wave

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
again if someone else lands sound wave

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.889 
again if someone else lands sound wave
is<00:00:50.370> hard<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.420> sound<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.870> for

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is hard for me to use your sound way for

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.830 
is hard for me to use your sound way for
another<00:00:52.379> character<00:00:53.420> some<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.660> were

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
another character some of them were

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.170 
another character some of them were
different<00:00:55.320> enough<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.739> me<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.070> recast<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
different enough for me to recast and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.950 
different enough for me to recast and
another<00:00:57.480> character<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.230> uh<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:59.629> want<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.809> on

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
