so<00:01:44.790> those<00:01:45.030> two<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.600> big<00:01:46.159> problem<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.280> today's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
so those two are big problem in today's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.120 
so those two are big problem in today's
society<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.470> avoid<00:01:49.560> these

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
society so if we can avoid these

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039
