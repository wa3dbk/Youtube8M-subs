00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm fine. I'm coming. 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.580
 with the long awaited and requested the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.920
 book city of the lost souls of the house 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.160
 of claire, which is the penultimate 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.199
 series and I was crazy for him and I got 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.590
 that to say that I practically devoured 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.050
 This book made me very very fast, I think. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.269
 that was a day or two at most I read 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 everything very fast because I wanted so much 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.019
 know what was going to happen and now it's clear 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.429
 I really want to know what will 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.430
 happen on the last network does not have 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.610
 way and I'll try to do a review 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.600
 I will try not to tell you facts. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.399
 important and as we know in the book 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 city ​​of fallen angels 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 the diesse was connected to Sebastian and in this 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.270
 here we will see that everything 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.460
 what they do for sebastian happens to me 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 Count is and if everyone does the day and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.379
 It happens to Sebastian and I said okay. 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.530
 more or less possessed by your bass 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.619
 but it is not so because they are connected there 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.080
 so whatever your bass wants it all 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.760
 that's enough to think and whatever he finds 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.450
 that's right the manager will also 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.040
 Find and the two disappeared disappeared 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.070
 No one can figure it out. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.659
 looking but nobody has found yet 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.759
 very annoyed because she did not 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.860
 can participate in searches by dci 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.460
 because it is being investigated by the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.049
 key for using Angel to resurrect 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.590
 That's the day they are investigating. 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.900
 She and she can not participate in the searches. 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 both in this book and in others 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 pawns that bothers me very much 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 same 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.170
 she does something very stupid but 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.110
 soon and hurt she ends up saving the day 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.509
 Then my sympathy goes back and forth. 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.790
 For her, but she has hours when she irritates me. 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.020
 a lot and this happens also several 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.869
 times in this book 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.960
 as the Jazz if we'll barely 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.469
 see where this true because he in the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.049
 truth is an extension of sebastian 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.329
 so the real ones feel a lot 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.000
 lack thereof of his jokes the way 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.640
 It's really going to be another one. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.610
 sebastian two then we will feel 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.920
 lack of it 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.990
 Do you like saimon? 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.800
 book because the team will stand out 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.500
 much is a key piece in the search for 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.190
 something a weapon to be able to separate 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.860
 and downloading the df or to be able to hurt 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 sebastian without hurting the way then he 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.810
 has a very important piece in the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.910
 search for something of this type who 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.450
 will surprise at the end of this book will 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.450
 be what she tries to protect says 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.450
 the whole book and in the end it makes a 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.610
 amazing thing and will be super 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.880
 cool pay attention to this is more in the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.370
 end of the book and she also starts 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.080
 finally acting as a hunter of 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.880
 shadows that I was already missing the 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.470
 hope because I thought she did not 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.770
 way to be hunters of 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.560
 shadows but finally appears in it a 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.260
 pace in this book is a bit slower 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.900
 in the beginning at the beginning it is very slow 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.930
 It has hours until it ends up getting a bit 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.959
 tiring repetitive author means 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.810
 stretched the middle of this book could 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.730
 be a bit more summed up and a bit 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.920
 more action at the end but she kinda 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.769
 this with a situation so it does not 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.049
 I had a lot to talk about so much. 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.989
 both pages would not need so much 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.260
 so for that matter and she was 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.330
 half of the book but even so it is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.120
 cool, it 's interesting some matches 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.130
 They are more boring but after it's over 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.010
 it begins to be a book is 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.709
 really interesting this time the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.019
 Funny touch on the book will stay by 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.870
 saimon and minimum account 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.110
 the two of you are going to give that funny touch 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.180
 that the 10 is generally 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.019
 will be on account of the saimon and 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.910
 machine in the end has a lot of legal 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.799
 that will leave the pace became a 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.680
 A little bit faster and that will 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.600
 make everyone desperate for the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.910
 next book to know the end know the 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.040
 what happens and I really hope it will come out 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.739
 because I'm already desperate for 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.459
 read and for me here do the review for 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.290
 you 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.289
 so I hope you both have 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.130
 liked this review a super kiss and 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.130
 until the next video
