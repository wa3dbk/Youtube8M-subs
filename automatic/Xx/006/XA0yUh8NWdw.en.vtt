two of them like disappeared this is a

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.800 
two of them like disappeared this is a
plane<00:01:35.410> down<00:01:35.620> here<00:01:36.040> below<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:37.420> it's<00:01:37.600> still

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
plane down here below when it's still

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.350 
plane down here below when it's still
stationary<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:39.250> moving<00:01:39.700> through<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
stationary and it's moving through the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.170 
stationary and it's moving through the
left<00:01:40.600> big<00:01:41.110> northeast<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.640> plane<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.150> other

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
left big northeast the plane the other

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.600 
left big northeast the plane the other
two<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:43.630> kind<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.840> left<00:01:44.080> out<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.310> other<00:01:45.460> ones

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
two just kind of left out the other ones

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.660 
two just kind of left out the other ones
about<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.910> fade<00:01:46.120> out<00:01:46.150> too<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.160> I'm<00:01:48.400> still

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.810

still got it rolling and it's just black

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
still got it rolling and it's just black
platon<00:02:08.479> going<00:02:08.660> behind<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:09.140> tree

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.860 

I<00:02:16.959> haven't<00:02:17.620> moved<00:02:17.769> this<00:02:18.129> camera

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
I haven't moved this camera

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.960 
I haven't moved this camera
really<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.830> much<00:02:21.069> further<00:02:21.340> than<00:02:21.640> where<00:02:21.850> it's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
really like much further than where it's

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.740 
really like much further than where it's
at<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.980> those<00:02:24.280> objects<00:02:24.670> are<00:02:24.790> completely<00:02:25.540> out

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
at and those objects are completely out

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.150 
at and those objects are completely out
of<00:02:25.780> sight

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.770 

I<00:02:31.250> don't<00:02:32.090> know

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
I don't know

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.640 
I don't know
but<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:35.250> swear<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.209> seen<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> couple<00:02:36.780> earlier<00:02:37.350> in

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
but I swear I seen a couple earlier in

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.000 
but I swear I seen a couple earlier in
that<00:02:37.709> exact<00:02:38.340> same<00:02:38.610> area<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.360> they<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:40.010> look

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that exact same area and they just look

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.110 
that exact same area and they just look
like<00:02:41.040> they<00:02:41.340> literally<00:02:41.580> disappeared

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.180 

and<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.599> see<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.959> darkness<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.650> left<00:02:49.980> like

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and I see the darkness on the left like

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.800 
and I see the darkness on the left like
the<00:02:50.310> silhouette<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.970> tree<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.599> like<00:02:51.720> a

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
the silhouette of the tree it's like a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:00.920 
the silhouette of the tree it's like a
spruce<00:02:54.500> those<00:02:55.500> pine<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> Neal<00:02:56.489> trees

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.550 

okay<00:03:01.470> there's<00:03:01.739> another<00:03:01.980> play<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:02.250> Mike

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.309 

so<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.800> go<00:03:09.980> behind<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.370> tree<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.110> about

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
so you go behind the tree this is about

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:21.780 
so you go behind the tree this is about
where<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.530> lice

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.980 

the<00:03:22.000> best<00:03:22.420> sightings<00:03:23.080> I've<00:03:23.230> ever<00:03:23.379> seen

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.100 

never<00:03:29.620> played<00:03:29.890> coming

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
never played coming

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
never played coming
right<00:03:32.110> there<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.990> basically<00:03:35.140> crossing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
right there and it's basically crossing

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.000 
right there and it's basically crossing
those<00:03:36.850> three<00:03:37.240> objects<00:03:37.570> basically<00:03:37.780> stop<00:03:38.410> right

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
those three objects basically stop right

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.500 
those three objects basically stop right
in<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.250> path<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:39.760> where<00:03:39.910> these<00:03:40.060> points<00:03:40.390> are

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
in the path of where these points are

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:50.220 
in the path of where these points are
heading<00:03:40.750> into<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.140> Pearson

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.530 

Oh<00:03:50.260> see<00:03:50.800> there's<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.250> plane<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.270> lights

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
Oh see there's the plane see the lights

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.440 
Oh see there's the plane see the lights
flashing<00:03:52.890> lights

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
flashing lights

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:06.470 
flashing lights
and<00:03:55.540> great<00:03:56.050> support<00:03:56.650> start<00:03:57.190> work

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.449 

I'm<00:04:06.930> gonna<00:04:07.110> turn<00:04:07.319> off<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.620> camera<00:04:07.950> now<00:04:08.069> they

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
I'm gonna turn off the camera now they

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.190 
I'm gonna turn off the camera now they
come<00:04:08.640> back<00:04:08.849> on<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.450> her<00:04:09.660> memory

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
come back on I like her memory

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.530 
come back on I like her memory
with<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.770> background

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.599
