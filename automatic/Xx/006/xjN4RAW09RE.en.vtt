00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
your mouth and don't worry that is

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.369 
your mouth and don't worry that is
completely<00:01:01.809> normal

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
completely normal

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.259 
completely normal
you'll<00:01:02.589> get<00:01:02.769> used<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.219> it<00:01:03.339> it<00:01:03.610> doesn't<00:01:03.969> do<00:01:04.119> that

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
you'll get used to it it doesn't do that

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.180 
you'll get used to it it doesn't do that
every<00:01:04.600> time<00:01:04.869> it's<00:01:05.170> probably<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.680> first<00:01:05.920> two

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
every time it's probably the first two

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.760 
every time it's probably the first two
or<00:01:06.220> three<00:01:06.340> times<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:07.210> think<00:01:08.080> it's<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.350> b12

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
or three times I think it's the b12

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.520 
or three times I think it's the b12
totally<00:01:09.640> awakening<00:01:10.270> your<00:01:10.479> blood<00:01:10.840> vessel

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
totally awakening your blood vessel

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.620 
totally awakening your blood vessel
system<00:01:11.740> in<00:01:12.100> your<00:01:12.220> mouth<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:12.759> does<00:01:13.180> produce

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
system in your mouth and it does produce

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.740 
system in your mouth and it does produce
more<00:01:13.840> saliva<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.729> will<00:01:15.909> get<00:01:16.060> used<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.390> it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
more saliva you will get used to it

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.109 
more saliva you will get used to it
you'll<00:01:16.960> become<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.440> pro<00:01:17.770> at<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.490> not<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.850> big

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
you'll become a pro at it it's not a big

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.880 
you'll become a pro at it it's not a big
deal<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:22.330> will<00:01:22.570> be<00:01:22.600> liquid<00:01:23.229> left<00:01:23.470> over

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
deal and there will be liquid left over

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.800 
deal and there will be liquid left over
after<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.490> ten<00:01:24.700> minutes<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.210> doesn't<00:01:25.420> all

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
after the ten minutes it doesn't all

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.990 
after the ten minutes it doesn't all
dissolve<00:01:26.440> so<00:01:26.950> some<00:01:27.280> people<00:01:27.550> think<00:01:27.759> that<00:01:27.789> there

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
dissolve so some people think that there

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.809 
dissolve so some people think that there
shouldn't<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.330> any<00:01:28.509> left<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.200> there<00:01:30.039> is<00:01:30.190> so

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
shouldn't be any left and there is so

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.969 
shouldn't be any left and there is so
what<00:01:31.179> I<00:01:31.210> do<00:01:31.330> is<00:01:31.630> just<00:01:31.840> swallow<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.409> b12<00:01:32.800> is

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
what I do is just swallow it the b12 is

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:33.840 
what I do is just swallow it the b12 is
so<00:01:33.220> good<00:01:33.429> for<00:01:33.670> us
