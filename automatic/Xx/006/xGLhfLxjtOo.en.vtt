 beauty guilherme and in the area with one more 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.460
 game point and this year is very good in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.460
 relation to rpg games not fact me 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.769
 4 big fallout talking start 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 highlighted at the betesda conference and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 microsoft at e3 2015 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.890
 now its art director talked a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.929
 bit about the inspiration to make the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.910
 game he said they wanted to give the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.160
 player to feel that he can 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.040
 anywhere and do everything with 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.829
 great freedom of exploitation as 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 example he cited the gta 5 saying the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 game served as inspiration for the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.450
 team in the development of fallout 4 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.579
 Tell me, this promise is not open. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 registrations to participate in the beta of 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.180
 street fighter 5 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.520
 to sign up just select the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.280
 country to complete the form and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.500
 This to play Playstation 4 on the pc for 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 have access to the beta just do the pre-sale 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 of the game in steam the link to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 you find in the description of the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.320
 video and now I'll show you 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.439
 the reactions that can be achieved 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.439
 using the next morpheus the glasses 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.900
 The virtual reality of sony 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.450
 journalist practically panics 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 and can not hold back with fear do not 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.500
 knows exactly what she was seeing 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.270
 one more level of immersion should be 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.790
 absurd to arrive at this point 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 imagine a good game of terror with this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.909
 morpheus project and then personal and thinking 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
 not to make the same mistakes two to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.899
 cisco dinho milk made a decision 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.220
 difficult in relation to enrollees 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.220
 syndicate 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.460
 the game will have your version of pc 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.500
 delayed 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.659
 they made that choice because there are 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.540
 different teams taking care of the version of 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.090
 pc and consoles and the pc will take longer 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.430
 to let the game run smoothly 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.460
 not yet been set a new date for the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.159
 game comes to the pc for now and the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.890
 nintendo recognizes that the river did not hit 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.780
 the expectations of the company now I arrived 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.640
 miyamoto creator of important 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.290
 nintendo franchises spoke a little 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.599
 on the weak 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.310
 south of the river he said that at that time in 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.200
 who were developing the ideas 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.900
 the market was 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.329
 different tablets were not part of the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.489
 day to day of people as it is today and 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.400
 the concept of using the second screen of the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.540
 game pad of the river ended up 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.939
 exceeded when the video game was 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.950
 fact that he announced that the price 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.870
 It was very expensive and in the beginning people 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.810
 also failed to understand the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.879
 which was the io and usually shows the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.959
 games here with beautiful graphics and 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.090
 everything not 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.549
 but now watch this video of the game 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.379
 witcher 3 series looks like it is 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.720
 running that do not need two maybe 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.220
 because this game play was captured 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.829
 using the minimum settings 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.109
 possible for the game to run on a pc 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.480
 super old but I 'm not talking about 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.400
 put everything at least it was not used 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.400
 still a program to reduce 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.500
 some hidden settings 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.329
 The result is bizarre. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.790
 is running a real playstation 2 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.379
 and this game is today's bridge does not let 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.629
 to sign up for the channel so you do not lose 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.280
 the next and if you liked the video did not 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.540
 Forget about the one who 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.359
 share with friends on networks 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.359
 social beauty even better and john
