00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.970
 friends of nikic below ours 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.290
 we now have nex 5 last 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.790
 google release 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.800
 it is one of the devices 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.610
 certainly more anticipated than the last 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.910
 times 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.880
 and I as a big fan of went of 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.070
 android of the android stop I decided 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.050
 then to buy it 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.289
 certainly the battery is not one of the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.849
 strongest points of this terminal has 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:35.469
 definitely a very powerful processor 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:39.670
 snapdragon 800 2:23 clocking jeans 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.399
 we have a 330 adreno gpu anyway 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.219
 full hd display and unfortunately this 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.850
 a bit sparse battery of 2,300 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.190
 millionaire 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.710
 well this video what is it for you vi 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.489
 I show some what to set on 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.789
 device from settings to be able to 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.719
 somehow save the battery 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.670
 we leave immediately with wifi or wifi 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.869
 always connected during the day 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.960
 let's go into the advanced and above all 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.930
 you'll have to disable the scan is 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.520
 always available for this consumes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.229
 battery I 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.759
 we say taken away even here avoids the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.509
 weak connections did not cause me 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.240
 big problems and make sure you have 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.520
 enabled wifi optimization reduces to 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.560
 minimum battery usage 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.819
 there is some small improvement and if 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.679
 keep it turned on and bluetooth will keep it 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.130
 the mark of most of the time 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:43.469
 disabled because it is not 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.360
 we always use the most often 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.149
 I use the smartwatch but I use those 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.869
 five six hours a day we go into 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.149
 other and nfc deactivated 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.530
 but unless I have to do pairing with 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:03.610
 some printer or with smartwatch and in the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.709
 In case we need to tell you to synchronize it 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.840
 usually the smartwatch danger with 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.290
 the smartwatch is made only once 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.250
 obviously if you activate the nfc it is activated 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.599
 also android beam and the touch appears here 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.610
 and pay 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:24.579
 but if you don't use it I advise you 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.220
 to disable it display background and 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.980
 brightness but not any background 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.010
 there is more the discourse of the background with 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.109
 dark colors to consume less battery 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.170
 and relative this thing brightness the 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:42.760
 I always keep on the automatic now 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.760
 he lowered it to be able to 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.250
 record better applications that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.650
 in the background my advice from 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.930
 leave some in the background 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.629
 because as you know not 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.390
 in the end more battery is used a 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.719
 reopen them than keep them for a while 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.340
 geolocation background of course 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:10.879
 disabled unless I have to use 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.439
 google maps and the various security satellites 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.530
 language issue in short are a bit 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:19.969
 these are the settings to make I show 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:24.280
 blacks 5 with android 4.4.2 camera 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:28.340
 used a little and also because 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.500
 consumes enough battery 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.760
 let's see then the hours of 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.609
 battery that I did with this method 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.959
 let's say it's the method I use 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:45.530
 without ruth without change of Roma so it is 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.609
 all stop 15 hours 3 minutes screen 40 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.079
 percent 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:53.269
 4 hours and 10 minutes but I'm still at a 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.639
 14 percent so it is absolutely not 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.209
 badly what it consumes and also the 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:02.479
 cellphone in standby if you keep it without 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.609
 signal this will say will try will be 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:07.099
 always looking for the signal and this 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.850
 it will consume batteries in fact me that the 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.770
 area where I live takes little 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:17.050
 the cell phone and therefore many of the times 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.270
 tends to really consume a little more 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.840
 essentially these are the battery 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.470
 methods 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.060
 I made this guide more than anything else 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.570
 for those who do not have much experience in 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.150
 sector 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.150
 for the moment it is all here if b
