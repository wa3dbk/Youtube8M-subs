00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
better off without him but not at this

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.119 
better off without him but not at this
time<00:00:58.879> period<00:01:00.609> we<00:01:01.609> lost<00:01:01.879> precious<00:01:02.359> time<00:01:03.129> by

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
therefore our situation is worse

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.190 
therefore our situation is worse
