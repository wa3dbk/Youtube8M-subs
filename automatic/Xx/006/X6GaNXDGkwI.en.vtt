00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
wasn't much to what I was doing he he

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.220 
wasn't much to what I was doing he he
can<00:00:12.760> basically<00:00:13.300> do<00:00:13.540> it<00:00:13.630> every<00:00:13.840> once<00:00:14.019> of<00:00:14.139> the

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
can basically do it every once of the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.679 
can basically do it every once of the
baseball<00:00:14.650> and<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:16.059> know<00:00:16.180> we<00:00:16.299> probably

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
baseball and you know we probably

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.929 
baseball and you know we probably
attacked<00:00:17.140> a<00:00:17.230> little<00:00:17.650> bit<00:00:17.770> more<00:00:17.950> if<00:00:18.070> we<00:00:18.640> had<00:00:18.849> two

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
attacked a little bit more if we had two

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.920 
attacked a little bit more if we had two
more<00:00:19.330> of<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.480> cushion<00:00:19.660> but<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:22.330> know<00:00:22.420> that<00:00:22.630> the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
more of a cushion but you know that the

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.170 
more of a cushion but you know that the
score<00:00:23.230> dictated<00:00:23.710> otherwise<00:00:23.800> and<00:00:24.369> so<00:00:24.609> we<00:00:24.880> can

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
score dictated otherwise and so we can

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.090 
score dictated otherwise and so we can
pitch<00:00:25.359> little<00:00:25.539> different<00:00:25.930> how<00:00:26.590> impressive<00:00:26.830> is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
pitch little different how impressive is

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
innings and and he did I mean it's just

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.829 
innings and and he did I mean it's just
saw<00:00:51.040> how<00:00:51.159> you<00:00:51.190> look<00:00:51.460> at<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:52.000> don't<00:00:52.600> look<00:00:52.720> at

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
saw how you look at it I don't look at

saw how you look at it I don't look at
it<00:00:52.900> like<00:00:52.989> that<00:00:53.080> so<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:55.180> know<00:00:55.269> I<00:00:55.299> think<00:00:55.420> he

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
it like that so you know I think he

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.160 
it like that so you know I think he
pitches<00:00:56.199> he<00:00:57.040> say<00:00:57.220> no<00:00:57.519> matter<00:00:57.670> what<00:00:57.909> right<00:00:58.900> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
pitches he say no matter what right the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.479 
pitches he say no matter what right the
way<00:00:59.290> he's<00:00:59.320> pitched<00:00:59.739> is<00:00:59.949> there<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.100> different

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
way he's pitched is there a different

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.219 
way he's pitched is there a different
feel<00:01:00.640> when<00:01:00.850> he<00:01:00.970> takes<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.360> mound<00:01:01.479> every<00:01:01.869> 50

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
feel when he takes the mound every 50

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.160 
feel when he takes the mound every 50
