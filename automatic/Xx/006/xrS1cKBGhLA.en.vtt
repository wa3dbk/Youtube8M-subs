this<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:48.800> is<00:00:48.950> pretty<00:00:49.130> simple<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.520> play<00:00:49.670> it

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
this this is pretty simple to play it

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.070 
this this is pretty simple to play it
but<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.030> sounds<00:00:50.360> really<00:00:50.450> difficult<00:00:50.930> that's

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
but it sounds really difficult that's

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.630 
but it sounds really difficult that's
why<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.290> think<00:00:51.380> it's<00:00:51.560> a<00:00:51.620> cool<00:00:51.800> lick<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.430> is<00:00:52.610> a

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
why I think it's a cool lick this is a

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.280 
why I think it's a cool lick this is a
kind<00:00:53.060> of<00:00:53.090> this<00:00:53.420> is<00:00:53.480> kind<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.840> like<00:00:53.990> the<00:00:54.140> big

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
kind of this is kind of like the big

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.810 
kind of this is kind of like the big
peak<00:00:54.560> of<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.860> solo<00:00:55.100> at<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.370> end<00:00:55.490> of<00:00:55.580> a<00:00:55.640> song

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
peak of a solo at the end of a song

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.960 
peak of a solo at the end of a song
called<00:00:55.940> deliver<00:00:56.210> us<00:00:56.390> off<00:00:56.630> my<00:00:56.750> resolution<00:00:57.260> CD

called deliver us off my resolution CD
and<00:00:58.970> it's<00:00:59.150> basically<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.690> pretty<00:00:59.960> easy<00:01:00.140> pattern

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
and it's basically a pretty easy pattern

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.110 
and it's basically a pretty easy pattern
it's<00:01:00.740> just<00:01:00.920> something<00:01:01.550> that's<00:01:01.610> working<00:01:01.940> over

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
it's just something that's working over

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.520 
it's just something that's working over
the<00:01:02.210> chord<00:01:02.450> changes<00:01:02.660> it<00:01:02.990> goes<00:01:03.200> from<00:01:03.290> G<00:01:03.530> minor

the chord changes it goes from G minor
to<00:01:06.530> b-flat<00:01:06.950> major<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.460> D<00:01:07.670> minor<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:09.080> F<00:01:09.110> major<00:01:10.000> so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
to b-flat major to D minor to F major so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.390 
to b-flat major to D minor to F major so
throughout<00:01:12.590> each<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.860> those<00:01:12.950> it's<00:01:13.220> kind<00:01:13.370> of

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
throughout each of those it's kind of

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.740 
throughout each of those it's kind of
outlining<00:01:13.730> the<00:01:13.880> changes<00:01:14.240> starting<00:01:14.540> off<00:01:14.630> with

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.959 

once<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:36.979> get<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.219> together<00:01:37.369> that's<00:01:37.729> pretty

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
once you get that together that's pretty

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:39.249 
once you get that together that's pretty
much<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.270> whole<00:01:38.299> lick<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.960> then<00:01:39.079> I'm<00:01:39.200> just

much the whole lick and then I'm just
moving<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.679> up<00:01:39.799> as<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.369> chords<00:01:40.700> change<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
moving it up as the chords change to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.120 
moving it up as the chords change to
kind<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.479> outline<00:01:41.600> those<00:01:41.990> changes<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:42.979> for
