00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hi all guys are uil object 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.060
 hicks today I'm here with a new video 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 in which I will talk about a discovery mode 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.660
 which deals with bank robbery 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 this time, however, I will talk about the robbery 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 in the bank and not competitive mode 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.910
 cooperative if you haven't seen the video 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 where I talk about these robberies in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.789
 cooperative or the classic robbery 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.720
 at the bank 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.390
 I suggest you take a look 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.820
 you will find the link description or on 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
 annotations in this video I will talk to you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.849
 also of a content of a future one 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.680
 of the c that takes the name of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.240
 assassination however we begin immediately with 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 these bank robberies and arrangements 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 competitive we will practically have some 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.600
 how there will be teams 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.290
 who will fight to rob one 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.540
 bank 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 so as mentioned above this 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.629
 will be different than the robberies in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.579
 bank that will take place in the cooperative 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.920
 because here it will fight for 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 win the loot first and there 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.010
 will also be more team roles for 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.050
 this mode 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.760
 in fact as you see in the video that the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.460
 file showing team roles in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.340
 these robberies we will have the transporter on 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.070
 sniper the watchmen the defenders i 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 hackers attack the breakers i 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.369
 runners 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.799
 the bandits the bodyguards the pilots 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.100
 and finally the drivers and each team 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.140
 will be divided into four parts 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 first part will be occupied by bandits 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 the second by hackers the third of the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.600
 drivers and finally the fourth by the pilots 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.710
 from bodyguards 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.590
 regarding the subdivision 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 other places do not know anything and 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.790
 moment the person who succeeded in 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.350
 find this information found 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170
 only the purpose of one role 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.119
 or rather lacker will practically lacker 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.710
 open doors inaccessible to others 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.329
 people therefore this makes us already understand 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 that this is a fundamental role for 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.200
 activity because if no one succeeds 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.670
 open these doors the activity will last 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.409
 until these people do not 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.780
 will be able to open these accesses that 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.880
 covers a booty and these accesses 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.280
 an example may be a cable or 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 a safe 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.600
 speaking instead of a content of a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 alleged future of the chips ie 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 assassination will be a part of the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.049
 where we will have new special abilities 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.460
 in single player that will be inserted 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.710
 in the three main characters of the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.420
 I mean history for special skills 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.640
 the thing that is activated by pressing 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.590
 the right analog of the controller when 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.989
 three characters are checked on gta 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.630
 In 5 of these we'll have us a 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.160
 truth to do as well as emissions e 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.900
 therefore it makes us understand that the history of the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.030
 three characters is not over 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.519
 finally we will have other features that 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.350
 however these have been and generalized and 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.810
 this part of the future of the chips 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.540
 as previously mentioned treats 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.130
 only single player 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.110
 all the information you have heard 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.790
 and seen in this video you will find them in 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.739
 description so you can give 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.840
 look at these files discovered by 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.700
 this person 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.739
 having said that please let me like it 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.569
 it takes only two seconds to 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.040
 click that blue button the vinegar mi 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.959
 like the facebook page if the la 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.190
 you will find in description comments if 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.360
 you have any questions and concerns required e 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.910
 I will try to respond faster 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.120
 possible and sign up for others 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.410
 contents of citÃ© to 5 by z uil x and all 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.410
 to the next video 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.849
 [Applause]
