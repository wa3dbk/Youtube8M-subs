 paul singer alone to brazil radio that is the case of mpsc 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.440
 let's be assisted 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.650
 when television was born 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.200
 on the general tab 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.660
 bushehr 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.390
 will tell you that you can choose where your movie will be copied 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.760
 in the case of your space here in Ceará 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.090
 I'll even pick from it recorded my documents 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.280
 start this dvd last year 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.750
 the program name 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.750
 I'll choose broken 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.430
 that I do not know if there is room in this 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.570
 start 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.190
 in this position but we will see 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.020
 ediomar you see that there are several in Brazilian Portuguese inclusive 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.830
 Portuguese and Portuguese-Korean and Japanese Chinese 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.769
 but German will avenge him 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.629
 then it was the turn of the bank to prefer 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.680
 now that chapters you insert of how much in how much time you want the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.289
 chapter is created 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:27.379
 It was 5 minutes with the standard but if you want a site of 10,000 with no destination 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.679
 a weed is created when you click the forward button 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.119
 yours 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.170
 control 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.399
 will move to another part 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.039
 How much time can you give here? 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.129
 he created and that at best available in 21 chapters 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.999
 as a five-minute pattern 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.340
 to go last 'awesome leave the photo editor 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.159
 It's changed that we can give more courage. 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.159
 It can be collective 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.399
 what are you doing here? 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.759
 Let's put it back today. 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:06.579
 of the items you can put blue will stay there later when you give it here 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.699
 is here 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.109
 I know that you decrease the items 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.150
 per page 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.109
 but it will be 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.419
 every item that appears per google homepage 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.939
 otherwise you'll have to move forward to look like a forward button to you 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:20.370
 same 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.079
 but when you record the series 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.079
 okazaki occurs now it looks like just one item 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:31.439
 so I was all set up background all right on my new cd the rock and 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.349
 punk yesterday day 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.859
 with vettel 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.139
 started with vettel comet is a detail that precedes what is shown to appear 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.049
 what two 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.049
 gave two points 2 gigs to my movie 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.359
 so hair 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.789
 half a dvd quietly 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.789
 here you will see it start recording 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.819
 now no party 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.769
 and that is where positive visualization comes in, but merely said that the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.309
 inflation forecast 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.729
 maybe before your class name appears tomorrow 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.589
 But if you get involved, start to spend some time here. 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:08.609
 It will take a long time 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.389
 with movie time 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.009
 will pass the whole movie and in the forecast of sanction against and converts 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:15.900
 and does not feel 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.930
 Afraid because the caption does not appear a preview 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:23.509
 If you are not planning to launch, we have nothing wrong. 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.580
 Leave it to me until the end 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.580
 I'm going to cancel here because I've already recorded this duty from her 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.800
 gave white ac 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.159
 when you read 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.189
 finish the program will focus 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:42.719
 he will want to record already opera dvd for you already stopped selling on dvd player 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.389
 but I will not manifest my 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.389
 the dvd when using a rewritable dvd there 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.599
 not to lose you should 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.680
 I know the whole process I believe will give everything correct 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.159
 leaving the big yellow misconfigure goal missed 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.909
 how was it said 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.630
 There you will open 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.470
 there in your possession and that you 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.559
 saved your duty 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.059
 you will open 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:11.839
 and going to test would use God's power a good program 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.189
 Do you have saints and tartá for these vexames? 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.949
 it was an option for him 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.529
 to seem to say that sometimes he has a program that does not show a region 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.139
 done this will come 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.650
 the tranquil legend 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.289
 everything is already right 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.249
 then you can even leave the program open and you asked to dance 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:38.120
 Senator drinking text that serves the program technician records that called 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:41.550
 fast as well without complications will already do the whole process 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.400
 love or for giving up your television 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 Good, you have to run here, it has to be late. 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.040

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.900
