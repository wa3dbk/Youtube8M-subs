right here you see the paper so there's

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.549 
right here you see the paper so there's
already<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.180> diagonal<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> stage<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
already this diagonal on the stage a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.490 
already this diagonal on the stage a
little<00:00:41.489> bit<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.030> half<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:48.350> take<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little bit in half this way take the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.209 
little bit in half this way take the
corner<00:00:49.860> fold<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> center

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.479 

flip<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.420> paper<00:00:58.600> over<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.370> then<00:01:00.370> you're

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
flip the paper over and then you're

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.959 
flip the paper over and then you're
going<00:01:00.609> to<00:01:00.670> fold<00:01:00.879> this<00:01:01.690> edge<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.469> center

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
going to fold this edge to the center

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.120 
going to fold this edge to the center
and<00:01:03.969> when<00:01:04.299> you<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:04.600> you're<00:01:05.019> going<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.259> pop

this part out so it's going to stick out
like<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.890> other<00:01:15.009> side<00:01:22.080> turn<00:01:23.080> like

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
like that on the other side turn like

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.969 
like that on the other side turn like
this<00:01:24.539> just<00:01:25.539> part<00:01:30.929> fold<00:01:31.929> this<00:01:32.200> edge<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.500> this

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
this just part fold this edge to this

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:45.840 
this just part fold this edge to this
edge<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.520> then<00:01:36.850> edge<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:38.050> this<00:01:38.170> edge<00:01:44.850> you're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
edge and then edge to this edge you're

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.080 
edge and then edge to this edge you're
gonna<00:01:46.000> make<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.840> crease<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:48.280> gonna<00:01:48.429> go<00:01:48.909> right

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
gonna make a crease it's gonna go right

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.290 
gonna make a crease it's gonna go right
in<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.300> center<00:01:49.330> where<00:01:49.810> those<00:01:50.909> three<00:01:51.909> creases

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
in the center where those three creases

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:05.040 
in the center where those three creases
made<00:02:01.739> and<00:02:02.739> you're<00:02:02.890> gonna<00:02:03.539> push<00:02:04.539> these<00:02:04.720> two

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
made and you're gonna push these two

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.630 
made and you're gonna push these two
sides<00:02:05.289> in<00:02:05.530> like<00:02:05.709> this<00:02:07.229> squish<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.379> down<00:02:10.620> then

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
sides in like this squish it down then

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.490 
sides in like this squish it down then
fold<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.790> bottom<00:02:13.000> corner<00:02:13.209> up<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.230> point

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
fold this bottom corner up to this point

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.250 
fold this bottom corner up to this point
right<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:17.319> then<00:02:18.129> unfold<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.260> then

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
fold this edge to the crease we just

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.110 
fold this edge to the crease we just
made<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:25.239> sounds<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:28.000> you're

these to make it appear more round and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.400 
these to make it appear more round and
then<00:03:29.390> now<00:03:29.630> for<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.290> head<00:03:32.200> we're<00:03:33.200> going<00:03:33.320> to

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
then now for the head we're going to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.930 
then now for the head we're going to
make<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> crease<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.160> goes<00:03:34.220> from<00:03:34.550> this<00:03:34.820> point

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
make a crease that goes from this point

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.620 
make a crease that goes from this point
to<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:35.660> point<00:03:37.390> hold<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.480> down<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:42.130> and

to this point hold it down this and

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
to this point hold it down this and
we're<00:03:44.630> gonna<00:03:44.780> make<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> crease<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.200> goes<00:03:45.410> from

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
we're gonna make a crease that goes from

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.310 
we're gonna make a crease that goes from
this<00:03:45.950> point<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.030> point<00:03:47.410> back<00:03:48.410> up<00:03:49.990> so<00:03:50.990> it

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
this point to this point back up so it

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.820 
this point to this point back up so it
will<00:03:51.440> have<00:03:51.530> something<00:03:51.890> that<00:03:51.920> looks<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.190> this

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.770 

there<00:03:55.760> should<00:03:55.910> be<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.060> little<00:03:56.270> flap<00:03:56.540> right<00:03:56.750> here

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
there should be a little flap right here

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.770 
there should be a little flap right here
you<00:03:57.590> can<00:03:57.800> just<00:03:58.010> kind<00:03:58.520> of<00:03:58.640> pull<00:03:59.090> out<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.530> then

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
you can just kind of pull out and then

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.979 
you can just kind of pull out and then
button<00:04:03.640> same<00:04:04.640> thing<00:04:04.850> on<00:04:04.910> this<00:04:05.030> side<00:04:05.330> pull<00:04:05.870> it

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
button same thing on this side pull it

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:13.930 
button same thing on this side pull it
out<00:04:07.000> flatten<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:10.750> yeah<00:04:12.610> make<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.640> crease<00:04:13.910> from

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
out flatten it yeah make a crease from

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.710 
out flatten it yeah make a crease from
this<00:04:14.330> point<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.900> point

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.340 

flip<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.840> over

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
flip it over

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.470 
flip it over
we're<00:04:22.160> gonna<00:04:22.280> fold<00:04:22.580> this<00:04:23.450> edge<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:26.180> point

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
we're gonna fold this edge to this point

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
we're gonna fold this edge to this point
right<00:04:26.600> here<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.210> goes<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:29.540> we're

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
right here so it goes like this we're

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.140 
right here so it goes like this we're
gonna<00:04:30.620> pop<00:04:31.070> this<00:04:31.250> corner<00:04:31.610> out<00:04:34.000> then<00:04:35.000> we're

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
gonna pop this corner out then we're

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.280 
gonna pop this corner out then we're
going<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.300> go<00:04:35.390> ahead<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.660> just<00:04:35.780> hold<00:04:36.230> that

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
going to go ahead and just hold that

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.100 
going to go ahead and just hold that
down<00:04:36.760> you're<00:04:37.760> going<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.910> fold<00:04:38.120> this<00:04:38.450> edge<00:04:38.690> to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
down you're going to fold this edge to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.450 
down you're going to fold this edge to
this<00:04:39.560> edge<00:04:41.470> so<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.650> looks<00:04:42.860> like<00:04:42.919> that

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.670 

all<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.550> way<00:04:46.640> down<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:47.990> I'm<00:04:48.140> full

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
all the way down and then I'm full

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.080 
all the way down and then I'm full
gonna<00:04:49.430> do<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:49.580> on<00:04:49.730> this<00:04:49.850> side<00:04:53.830> back<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.490> now

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
gonna do it on this side back and now

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.940 
gonna do it on this side back and now
you're<00:04:56.240> gonna<00:04:56.300> unfold<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.110> then<00:04:57.830> you're

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
you're gonna unfold it and then you're

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.820 
you're gonna unfold it and then you're
gonna<00:04:58.070> bring<00:04:58.730> both<00:04:59.030> these<00:04:59.270> folds<00:04:59.690> back<00:04:59.870> at

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
gonna bring both these folds back at

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.140 
gonna bring both these folds back at
about<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.220> same<00:05:01.400> time<00:05:02.050> so<00:05:03.340> look<00:05:04.340> at<00:05:04.520> since<00:05:05.000> it

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
about the same time so look at since it

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.540 
about the same time so look at since it
looks<00:05:05.360> like<00:05:05.540> this

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
looks like this

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.600 
looks like this
and<00:05:07.550> then<00:05:07.670> you<00:05:07.760> want<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:07.970> take<00:05:08.180> this<00:05:08.750> part<00:05:09.050> and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
and then you want to take this part and

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.830 
and then you want to take this part and
squish<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.800> then<00:05:12.950> you're<00:05:13.100> gonna<00:05:13.600> hold<00:05:14.600> it

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
squish it and then you're gonna hold it

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.120 
squish it and then you're gonna hold it
up<00:05:16.690> and<00:05:17.690> do<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.810> petal<00:05:18.080> hole<00:05:18.350> it's<00:05:18.740> kind<00:05:18.980> of

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
up and do a petal hole it's kind of

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.580 
up and do a petal hole it's kind of
small<00:05:19.790> and<00:05:20.800> adjusting<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:22.120> hard<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.240> do<00:05:23.530> yeah

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
small and adjusting it hard to do yeah

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.870 
small and adjusting it hard to do yeah
not<00:05:25.040> used<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.430> doing<00:05:25.580> that<00:05:27.370> take<00:05:28.370> this<00:05:28.550> corner

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
not used to doing that take this corner

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.570 
not used to doing that take this corner
fold<00:05:29.540> it<00:05:29.690> to<00:05:29.780> this<00:05:29.900> point<00:05:33.190> same<00:05:34.190> thing<00:05:34.370> on<00:05:34.460> the

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
fold it to this point same thing on the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.310 
fold it to this point same thing on the
other<00:05:34.610> side<00:05:38.380> fold<00:05:39.380> it<00:05:39.620> just<00:05:39.800> about<00:05:39.980> right<00:05:40.040> here

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
other side fold it just about right here

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.900 
other side fold it just about right here
that's<00:05:42.320> gonna<00:05:42.530> make<00:05:42.770> an<00:05:42.920> ear<00:05:43.130> so<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.610> just

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
that's gonna make an ear so you just

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.120 
that's gonna make an ear so you just
have<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.120> estimate<00:05:44.720> how<00:05:45.560> big<00:05:45.590> you<00:05:45.800> want<00:05:45.980> there

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
have to estimate how big you want there

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.950 
have to estimate how big you want there
to<00:05:46.250> be<00:05:48.220> full<00:05:49.360> down<00:05:50.360> along<00:05:51.140> here<00:05:52.390> and<00:05:53.390> then<00:05:53.570> fold

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
to be full down along here and then fold

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.640 
to be full down along here and then fold
just<00:05:54.290> part<00:05:54.530> up<00:05:54.680> as<00:05:54.920> far<00:05:55.130> as<00:05:55.250> it<00:05:55.370> goes<00:05:56.500> I'm<00:05:57.500> gonna

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
just part up as far as it goes I'm gonna

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.890 
just part up as far as it goes I'm gonna
flip<00:05:57.950> it<00:05:58.070> over<00:05:58.220> you<00:05:58.550> will<00:05:58.730> see<00:05:58.910> it<00:05:59.060> this<00:05:59.240> is<00:05:59.300> the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
flip it over you will see it this is the

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.550 
flip it over you will see it this is the
computer<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:00.860> read<00:06:01.010> an<00:06:01.130> alien
