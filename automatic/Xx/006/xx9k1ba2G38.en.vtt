book<00:00:45.300> were<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.960> also<00:00:46.200> doing<00:00:48.260> improved

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
book were you also doing improved

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.810 
book were you also doing improved
upgraded<00:00:50.520> High<00:00:51.510> Flow<00:00:51.949> what<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
upgraded High Flow what this is this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.729 
upgraded High Flow what this is this
cooling<00:00:54.539> system<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.379> does<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
cooling system is what it does is it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910 
cooling system is what it does is it
splits<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.520> cooling<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.809> get<00:00:58.079> cold<00:00:58.620> water

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
splits the cooling so you get cold water

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
splits the cooling so you get cold water
going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> motor<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.090> esc

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
going to the motor and the esc

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
going to the motor and the esc
independently<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> each<00:01:01.559> other<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.980> then

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
independently of each other and then

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.810 
independently of each other and then
tying<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> coming<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.600> okay

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
tying back up and coming out okay

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.100 
tying back up and coming out okay
normally<00:01:05.820> normal<00:01:06.270> bolts<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
normally normal bolts will go to the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.190 
normally normal bolts will go to the
motor<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> esc<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> what

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
motor then to the esc and out and what

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.570 
motor then to the esc and out and what
you're<00:01:10.320> getting<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> super<00:01:10.950> hot<00:01:11.070> water<00:01:11.340> going

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you're getting is super hot water going

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
you're getting is super hot water going
through<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> other<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.320> cold

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
through one or the other so this is cold

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
through one or the other so this is cold
water<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.040> times<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.970> extremely

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
water at all times it's extremely

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.810 
water at all times it's extremely
efficient<00:01:18.290> plug<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.690 

I'll<00:01:25.390> get<00:01:25.540> this<00:01:25.750> up<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:25.990> going<00:01:26.290> I<00:01:26.380> got<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
I'll get this up and going I got a

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.680 
I'll get this up and going I got a
remote<00:01:28.210> made<00:01:28.570> by<00:01:28.720> futaba<00:01:30.090> Phil<00:01:31.090> gamble<00:01:31.270> up<00:01:31.510> to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
remote made by futaba Phil gamble up to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.090 
remote made by futaba Phil gamble up to
20<00:01:32.560> different<00:01:32.830> vehicle<00:01:33.310> settings<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.950> also

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
20 different vehicle settings we also

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.770 
20 different vehicle settings we also
have<00:01:36.310> an<00:01:36.400> upgraded<00:01:36.790> rudder<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.030> here<00:01:37.360> it's<00:01:37.660> a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
have an upgraded rudder on here it's a

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.330 
have an upgraded rudder on here it's a
longer<00:01:38.080> rudder<00:01:38.470> because<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.920> cat<00:01:39.100> goes

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
longer rudder because the cat goes

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.880 
longer rudder because the cat goes
extremely<00:01:40.210> fast<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:40.900> those<00:01:41.440> little<00:01:41.530> letters

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
extremely fast so those little letters

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.710 
extremely fast so those little letters
don't<00:01:42.070> cut<00:01:42.220> it<00:01:42.340> anymore<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:43.180> needs<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.540> have<00:01:43.690> a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
don't cut it anymore it needs to have a

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.630 
don't cut it anymore it needs to have a
longer<00:01:44.590> rudder<00:01:44.890> for<00:01:45.070> more<00:01:45.220> stability<00:01:45.340> because

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
longer rudder for more stability because

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.249 
longer rudder for more stability because
it's<00:01:45.850> almost<00:01:46.030> completely<00:01:46.810> out<00:01:46.930> of<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.050> water

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
it's almost completely out of the water

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's almost completely out of the water
and<00:01:47.470> that's<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.580> sharpened<00:01:49.509> balance<00:01:49.840> polished

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
and that's a sharpened balance polished

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.710 
and that's a sharpened balance polished
