 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.330
 channel in this video i want to show you 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.060
 cooking 2 very tasty salads 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.359
 the recipe that I suggested to my two 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.919
 subscribers for which they thank you so much 1 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.739
 the salad is called lagoon 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.099
 for its preparation we need 1 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:33.430
 the salmon is slightly salted 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:37.850
 so I chose the green onion 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.219
 tomato mayonnaise and cooked rice 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.670
 though I was not very good was Sarah 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.440
 They said that the large will be normal 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.870
 somehow not really did not like so we all 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.870
 mixed only mayonnaise left 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.450
 so for the second salad to us 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 need a boiled chicken which we 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:19.110
 either finely chop or fiber 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.549
 we also distribute fried mushrooms 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 we also need celery stalks 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.189
 mayonnaise and canned pineapples 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.909
 which we 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.340
 small such cubes cut mix 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.799
 all the ingredients are dressed with mayonnaise and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.970
 we get very tasty and very 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.970
 hearty salad 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.210
