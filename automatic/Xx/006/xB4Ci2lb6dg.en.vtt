00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello and welcome to our channel in 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.950
 First of all we wanted to thank you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 be here is the third recipe that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.809
 we publish and for us this does not 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.549
 it would make sense if it were not for you 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.590
 this time like the previous two we have 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.269
 prepared something easy to cook with 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.999
 little ingredients but not for that 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.710
 with little flavor but the opposite is 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.359
 try a curry rice with chicken and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 mushrooms 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.759
 we begin by listing the ingredients 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.739
 for four people we have used 300 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.390
 grams of round grain rice though 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.120
 if you prefer, you can also prepare it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.070
 with long grain rice notice that in 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 Volume 300 grams of rice equals 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.900
 about 3 cups to bake 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.370
 the rice in principle we will need the 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.670
 double the volume of water than rice 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.950
 therefore 6 small cups of water too 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.200
 we will need 300 grams of assortment of 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.530
 mushrooms that in this case are frozen 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.320
 but you can use also be transformed 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.300
 300 grams of chicken breast oil 2 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.910
 heaping tablespoons of curry and salt 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.310
 and now hands to the kitchen 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.450
 we put a jet of oil 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.810
 preferably olive in a pan 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.890
 non-stick and light the fire 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.470
 pour the assortment of mushrooms in the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.210
 pan as our defrosted assortment 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.909
 We start frying at high heat and 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.100
 stir from time to time 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.770
 little by little the mushrooms will leave 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.359
 thawing while we wash the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.969
 chicken breast and cut it into 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.920
 bits when we notice that the mushrooms 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.600
 have softened slightly we incorporate 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.479
 the chicken pieces and we keep falling 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.280
 at medium heat when we see that the chicken 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.319
 begins to take color we add the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.140
 rice and we continue to fry everything during a 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.140
 couple of minutes without stopping to remove 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.150
 now we add the water 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.240
 we also add the curry and salt 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.010
 everyone 's taste and stir well 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.180
 we leave to cook until the rice is 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.280
 fact 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.430
 if we see that in the process you need 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.570
 more water we will add it little by little 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.910
 Well, it's not convenient that this rice 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.650
 broths notice that it is preferable to stay 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.110
 short water at the beginning and add it 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.540
 after we go from the beginning 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.580
 and now we only have to serve you I encourage you to 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.860
 cook it if you are curry lovers and 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.720
 repeat is safe to see our 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.070
