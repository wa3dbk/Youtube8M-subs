this end and it's got a stop very beefy
and<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.680> gonna<00:01:28.829> weld<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.240> bumper<00:01:30.720> right

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and I'm gonna weld to the bumper right

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.010 
and I'm gonna weld to the bumper right
there<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.909> then<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> pin<00:01:33.270> goes<00:01:33.540> through<00:01:33.810> there

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
there and then a pin goes through there

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.890 
there and then a pin goes through there
and<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:35.189> handle<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.880> tighten<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> keep<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and a handle to tighten it and keep it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.240 
and a handle to tighten it and keep it
shut<00:01:37.880> then<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.570> gonna<00:01:39.780> take<00:01:40.369> these<00:01:41.369> things

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
shut then I'm gonna take these things

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.679 
shut then I'm gonna take these things
mount<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.659> like<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
mount them like that

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.649 
mount them like that
this<00:01:48.689> white<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.229> will<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.130> top<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:52.200> that

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
this white one will be on top like that

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.899 
this white one will be on top like that
you<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> idea<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.649> they're<00:01:56.610> gonna<00:01:56.700> be

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you get the idea so they're gonna be

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.080 
you get the idea so they're gonna be
stacked<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.079> top<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.500> another<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> have

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
stacked one on top of another so I have

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.300 
stacked one on top of another so I have
gas<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.360> water<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:01.079> me<00:02:02.119> then<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.829> piece<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
gas and water with me then this piece of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.570 
gas and water with me then this piece of
tubing<00:02:06.049> I'm<00:02:07.049> gonna<00:02:07.229> weld<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> top<00:02:08.550> of

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
tubing I'm gonna weld it to the top of

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.559 
tubing I'm gonna weld it to the top of
that<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:10.649> gonna<00:02:10.800> angle<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.879> over<00:02:12.150> top<00:02:12.360> of

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
that it's gonna angle up go over top of

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.170 
that it's gonna angle up go over top of
the<00:02:12.660> white<00:02:12.840> tube

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
the white tube

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.900 
the white tube
water<00:02:15.180> container<00:02:15.920> go<00:02:16.920> cross<00:02:17.280> down<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
water container go cross down to the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.500 
water container go cross down to the
other<00:02:18.090> side<00:02:18.800> like<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:22.020> then<00:02:23.510> these

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
other side like that and then these

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.339 
other side like that and then these
holes<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.709> here<00:02:26.569> I'm<00:02:27.569> gonna<00:02:27.810> come<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.200> with

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
holes right here I'm gonna come up with

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.860 
holes right here I'm gonna come up with
a<00:02:28.560> piece<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.459> tubing<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:29.940> comes<00:02:30.270> from<00:02:30.450> here

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
a piece of tubing that comes from here

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.440 
a piece of tubing that comes from here
go<00:02:31.530> straight<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.040> ties<00:02:32.370> into<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.940> top<00:02:33.180> bar
