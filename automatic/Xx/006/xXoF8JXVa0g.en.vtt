chicken with bacon you can see I have a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.400 
chicken with bacon you can see I have a
piece<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.710> bacon<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:36.540> here's<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
piece of bacon on there and here's a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.940 
piece of bacon on there and here's a
piece<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> orange<00:00:38.760> chicken<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.770> looks

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
piece of the orange chicken so it looks

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040 
piece of the orange chicken so it looks
like<00:00:41.010> theirs<00:00:41.340> they're<00:00:42.059> pretty<00:00:42.360> big<00:00:42.570> chunks<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
like theirs they're pretty big chunks of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.400 
like theirs they're pretty big chunks of
chicken<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.610> pieces<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.059> bacon<00:00:45.410> were

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
chicken here the pieces of bacon were

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.900 
chicken here the pieces of bacon were
bigger<00:00:46.980> than<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.309> thought<00:00:47.520> they'd<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.730> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
bigger than I thought they'd be I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
bigger than I thought they'd be I
thought<00:00:48.120> they'd<00:00:48.270> almost<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.780> bacon<00:00:49.170> bits

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
thought they'd almost be like bacon bits

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.290 
thought they'd almost be like bacon bits
that<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.680> had<00:00:49.829> mixed<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.059> let's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that they had mixed in there but let's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:02.020 
that they had mixed in there but let's
see<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.629> tastes<00:00:51.809> like

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.780 

okay<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.680> too<00:01:04.799> bad<00:01:05.010> we've

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
okay this was not too bad we've

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.230 
okay this was not too bad we've
definitely<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.750> sweet<00:01:07.020> sauce<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.619> it

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
definitely a really sweet sauce on it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
definitely a really sweet sauce on it
the<00:01:09.240> bacon<00:01:09.570> tasted<00:01:09.900> pretty<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.320> pretty<00:01:11.070> well

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the bacon tasted pretty good pretty well

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.240 
the bacon tasted pretty good pretty well
cooked<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.880> everything<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.470> chicken<00:01:13.890> wasn't

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
cooked and everything the chicken wasn't

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.310 
cooked and everything the chicken wasn't
too<00:01:14.400> soggy

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
too soggy

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
too soggy
the<00:01:16.320> sauce<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.880> was<00:01:17.880> pretty<00:01:18.090> decent<00:01:18.450> there's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the sauce was was pretty decent there's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.920 
the sauce was was pretty decent there's
a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:19.110> hint<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> spicy<00:01:20.250> flavor<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.930> but

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
a little hint of spicy flavor to it but

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.990 
a little hint of spicy flavor to it but
definitely<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.530> too<00:01:22.740> much<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
definitely not too much I don't think it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.219 
definitely not too much I don't think it
would<00:01:24.150> overwhelm<00:01:24.390> anyone

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
would overwhelm anyone

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.310 
would overwhelm anyone
and<00:01:26.220> again<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> chicken<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.869> breading

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.170 
and again the chicken and the breading

finish<00:02:04.229> off<00:02:04.500> my<00:02:04.530> meal<00:02:05.040> from<00:02:05.520> Panda<00:02:06.060> Express

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
finish off my meal from Panda Express

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.260 
finish off my meal from Panda Express
and<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.160> mentioned<00:02:08.520> before<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.970> orange

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and as I mentioned before the orange

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.059 
and as I mentioned before the orange
chicken<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.750> bacon<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.289> thought<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.950> was

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
chicken with bacon I thought it was

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.949 
chicken with bacon I thought it was
pretty<00:02:11.430> well<00:02:11.700> cooked<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.209> wasn't<00:02:12.510> too

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
pretty well cooked it wasn't too

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.199 
pretty well cooked it wasn't too
or<00:02:13.230> anything<00:02:13.469> like<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.099> breading<00:02:14.519> would

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
or anything like that the breading would

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.429 
or anything like that the breading would
still<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.659> it<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.810> know<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> little<00:02:16.200> bit<00:02:16.349> of

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
still have it you know a little bit of

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.259 
still have it you know a little bit of
crunch<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.189> and<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.700> were<00:02:17.760> some<00:02:17.909> decent

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
crunch to it and there were some decent

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.649 
crunch to it and there were some decent
pieces<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.719> bacon<00:02:19.159> as<00:02:20.159> I<00:02:20.340> said<00:02:20.579> I<00:02:20.879> thought<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
pieces of bacon as I said I thought the

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.990 
pieces of bacon as I said I thought the
sauce<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.200> bit<00:02:22.530> strong<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.280> towards<00:02:23.849> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
sauce was a bit strong so towards the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.940 
sauce was a bit strong so towards the
end<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.900> was<00:02:24.930> getting<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.379> little<00:02:25.590> sweet

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
end of it it was getting a little sweet

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.250 
end of it it was getting a little sweet
and<00:02:26.189> it<00:02:26.430> was<00:02:26.549> I'm<00:02:27.090> glad<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> didn't<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and it was I'm glad I didn't have just a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.020 
and it was I'm glad I didn't have just a
full<00:02:28.530> box<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.189> or<00:02:29.340> anything<00:02:29.519> like<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.849> I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
full box of that or anything like that I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.119 
full box of that or anything like that I
think<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.480> portion<00:02:30.719> that<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.049> got<00:02:31.349> was<00:02:31.889> just

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
think the portion that I got was just

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.589 
think the portion that I got was just
about<00:02:32.280> enough<00:02:32.579> anymore<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.389> would<00:02:33.510> have

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
about enough anymore and it would have

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.099 
about enough anymore and it would have
been<00:02:33.689> way<00:02:33.840> too<00:02:33.870> sweet<00:02:34.409> for<00:02:34.439> me<00:02:34.829> but<00:02:35.689> it<00:02:36.689> was<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
been way too sweet for me but it was it

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.349 
been way too sweet for me but it was it
was<00:02:37.170> decent<00:02:37.439> I'd<00:02:37.950> say<00:02:38.219> it<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.549> better<00:02:39.150> than

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
was decent I'd say it was better than

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.080 
was decent I'd say it was better than
any<00:02:39.739> previous<00:02:40.739> entrees<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.459> I've<00:02:41.579> had<00:02:41.790> at

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
any previous entrees that I've had at

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.110 
any previous entrees that I've had at
fast-food<00:02:42.599> Chinese<00:02:43.109> places<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:44.609> wasn't<00:02:45.000> my

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
fast-food Chinese places it wasn't my

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.819 
fast-food Chinese places it wasn't my
favorite<00:02:45.389> of<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.959> things<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.349> I've<00:02:46.439> got<00:02:46.650> it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
favorite of the things that I've got it

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.580 
favorite of the things that I've got it
at<00:02:46.980> Panda<00:02:47.370> Express<00:02:47.489> as<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:49.049> mentioned<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.439> got

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
at Panda Express as I mentioned I got

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
at Panda Express as I mentioned I got
the<00:02:49.680> Beijing<00:02:50.069> beef<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.549> kung<00:02:50.730> pao<00:02:50.760> chicken

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
the Beijing beef the kung pao chicken

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.039 
the Beijing beef the kung pao chicken
and<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:52.260> orange<00:02:52.769> chicken<00:02:53.159> with<00:02:53.280> bacon<00:02:53.669> and<00:02:54.049> I

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
and the orange chicken with bacon and I

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.110 
and the orange chicken with bacon and I
think<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.409> one<00:02:55.560> was<00:02:55.650> probably<00:02:55.889> of<00:02:56.250> those<00:02:56.489> my

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
think this one was probably of those my

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.209 
think this one was probably of those my
second<00:02:57.569> favorite<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.109> it<00:02:58.500> was<00:02:58.680> pretty<00:02:58.950> good

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
second favorite one it was pretty good

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.940 
second favorite one it was pretty good
but<00:02:59.280> again<00:02:59.760> because<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.419> sweetness<00:03:00.950> it

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
but again because of the sweetness it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.619 
but again because of the sweetness it
made<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> bit<00:03:02.489> overwhelming<00:03:03.209> as<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.450> ate<00:03:03.599> a

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
made it a bit overwhelming as I ate a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.330 
made it a bit overwhelming as I ate a
lot<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.139> because<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.530> sauce<00:03:04.739> was<00:03:05.040> was

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
lot of it because the sauce was was

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.520 
lot of it because the sauce was was
really<00:03:05.489> strong<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:06.359> wasn't<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.719> bad<00:03:06.870> sauce<00:03:07.200> but

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
really strong it wasn't a bad sauce but

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.080 
really strong it wasn't a bad sauce but
it<00:03:07.590> was<00:03:07.709> just<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:08.040> lot<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.819> lot<00:03:08.969> of

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
it was just a lot of it and a lot of

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.420 
it was just a lot of it and a lot of
sweetness<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.719> it<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.560> if<00:03:10.799> you're<00:03:11.129> not<00:03:11.219> if

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
sweetness to it so if you're not if

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.349 
sweetness to it so if you're not if
you're<00:03:11.519> someone<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:11.939> really<00:03:12.090> like

don't<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:15.659> sweetness<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.200> would<00:03:16.290> probably

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
don't like sweetness it would probably

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.740
