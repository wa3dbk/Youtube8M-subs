00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 in charge in our duck tips that already 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.349
 started preparing the second one that is the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
 of yogurt be many and I'm going to 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.740
 of natural yogurt although she put in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 half cucumber cut into slices I gave him a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.430
 point that no more than that to not lose 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.980
 the consistency a bit of the cucumber 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.290
 meanwhile the ingredients that I 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.030
 Now I'm going to apply a spoonful 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.620
 leather tureen 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 I'm going to repeat the ingredients together 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.380
 the graph we have 2 to 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 natural yogurt by half sliced â€‹â€‹cucumber 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.700
 in slices and a tablespoon of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 honey remember that you do not have to pass it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.610
 so much time for the juicer not to lose 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610
 the consistency of the cucumber 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 then I already had it, I put the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.560
 spoonful of honey and now that I'm going to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.100
 I will give 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.260
 together that he and more the this and this what 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.770
 we are going to empty or that while you 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.720
 empty 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:17.100
 vilma will be the screen that you 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:19.930
 I was seeing him in the supposed world if 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.970
 we did not have creams or anything and we 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.350
 we fill with granites from the earth all 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 the time then now I'm going to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.080
 begin to apply this while I 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.810
 I'm going to count the properties that 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.610
 they contain and that you hear the yogurt contains 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.160
 probiotics that we've seen a couple of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.530
 times that helps soften and increase the 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.050
 skin in this case we have two elements 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.440
 very important the humidification we have 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.630
 the cucumber that apart from containing a lot 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.250
 water contains many vitamins in its 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.920
 composition is more than 90 percent 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.729
 of water and 10 percent material by 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.440
 it does not wet us but in a 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.640
 incredible way and says that too 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.810
 helps to reduce inflammation and look more beautiful 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.750
 really feeling the smell of cucumber 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.880
 so also the side of the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.810
 aromatherapy because one can be 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.090
 trying 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.429
 to leave it soft and the cucumber 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.680
 help and also power rest and 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.940
 the relax I believe in all the delicious 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.800
 it smells delicious delicious and also you 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 is giving the face you can be watching 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.660
 women first while you apply this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.120
 Fabulous cucumber yogurt mask and 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.030
 free honey truth you know how much is going to 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.739
 spend in expressed 250 pesos of 300 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.599
 weights and they are also elements that one 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.040
 have in the kitchen because we have yogurt 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.810
 we have a little honey and also in 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.060
 this case the cucumber how long there is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.400
 to leave it in the face this is left 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.620
 15 to 20 minutes and it's a mask that 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.870
 you can recommend doing it all 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.670
 days if you want to because you do not have 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.980
 elements that are having 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.140
 components let's say color or that go 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.489
 to dye the leg as it is very soft what 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.620
 can occupy occupy during all 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.970
 days and the truth that the days pass if 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.769
 will see the results that it is having 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.150
 skin and how it will improve yourself 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.660
 With new frequencies, you did it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.940
 this mask of cucumber and yogurt and in 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.420
 the program or in the reality almost 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.540
 all 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.590
 and now at home maybe once every 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.040
 two weeks 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.720
 I recognize that you are not going to cost and 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.140
 there were good positives that to the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.220
 skin but if you notice 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.410
 I started doing the other girls 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.319
 also from there like that at the beginning it was 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.750
 fatal the one we had from the earth 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.130
 you indicate the components that 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.750
 we have here natural are always 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.430
 present a cream on your part looks 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.250
 Cucumber cream is looking for yogurt cream 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:43.360
 and at the end of the refrigerator not only for 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.580
 eat now the idea that people can 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.380
 learn to take care of yourself in your home but 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 elements the problem this I tell you 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.590
 if I tell them, you have to put on a little 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.239
 creative or maybe I do not have the and of 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.769
 Estepona moisturizing mask of this but 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.980
 I remember that duck title brings 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.900
 block with the lettuce we also passed 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.910
 hey if it also gets complicated does not have 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.810
 yogurt at home the 10 thousand slices of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.810
 cucumber on the face 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.920
 anti-inflammatory decongestant 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.920
 moisturizing to the hundred and relaxing 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.900
 in the massacre like the other thing that is like 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.440
 thicker and it would seem like I kind of 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.639
 you put little because it's like very liquid not 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.620
 nothing happens because what we are 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.180
 looking here that just the wells are 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.210
 penetrate the skin now if you would 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.870
 maybe you like one more type of mask 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.870
 thick 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.000
 there are people who like things badly 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.000
 made to others more solid you can 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.070
 apply greater as one does not imply as well 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.290
 that's good now that I'm going to be in 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.540
 santiago as I'm not going to be in 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.250
 temuco be more with you the clinic 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.200
 she was transferred to santiago from temuco 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.780
 so the truth is that people can 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.610
 write through the network page 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.440
 or through the clinic's website 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.230
 and there in the background I can go answering 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.450
 your inquiries and give you more advice or 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.250
 how to deal with specific topics for you 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.860
 correctly let's get that out 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.270
 face mask and there is already a 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.270
 mask that has me 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.740
 it can be great
