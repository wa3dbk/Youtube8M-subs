00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.044
(Previous episode ending with Enshou and Totaku armies heading to fight)

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:26.677
Karin-sama. Enshou's main force encountered Kayu.
Both forces are preparing for battle...  I'm too shocked from that stupidity.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:32.468
Indeed... What about the lords?

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:41.656
They're hurrying for rescue... but Sonsaku is heading in the opposite direction.

00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:49.309
Take control of the empty base, huh... This is the optimal
strategy for the current situation.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.443
What should we do? Should we also head to Shisui gate?

00:00:55.543 --> 00:01:00.989
Hm... Shuran, your opinion?

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:09.202
I agree with Keifa. There's nothing more stupid than getting involved in a fight.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:13.657
...Shunran's opinion is?

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:16.566
Ah...

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:22.451
Oh. Is something wrong? You're hesitant all of sudden.
(I think Shunran will say a lot of surprisingly smart opinions from now on)

00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:32.696
No... Strategy-wise, Shuran and Keifa's opinions are correct, but...

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:35.574
But?

00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:46.080
To become world famous, I think heading for assist and defeating Kayu is better...

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.155
...Capturing an empty base is nothing to be proud of, huh.

00:01:53.255 --> 00:02:07.683
Yes. Instead, saving allies will increase our reputation. And increasing
reputation of the Gi army might be useful eventually, is what I thought...

00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:20.061
W, what's wrong, Karin-sama? Ah... Did I say something stupid again...

00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:28.348
Fufu... Sis, Karin-sama is surprised.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:33.261
I'm also quite surprised though.

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:39.692
As they say... I think better of you now, Shunran.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.243
Y, yes!
(Why do you answer "yes" here? It makes no sense!"

00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:52.756
Heh... then, let's stick with Shunran's opinion. Shuran, Keifa.
Start acting on it right away.

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.998
Your will.

00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:58.784
Yes!

00:02:58.884 --> 00:03:06.313
Shunran, lead vanguard, meet up with main force
and take enemy commander's head.

00:03:06.413 --> 00:03:09.761
Yes! Leave it to me!

00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:21.633
Though. Don't go with Ryubi's plan and drag this battle longer than needed.
After you defeat Kayu, return with soldiers at once.

00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:30.787
That I understood... What do you mean by Ryubi's plan?

00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:40.363
You didn't understand that?... To minimize the loss
of soldiers, they're planning to involve lords.

00:03:40.463 --> 00:03:49.318
That... And probably a payback for being forced that role.

00:03:49.418 --> 00:03:57.743
That's how it is... They might be genius villians, she and he.

00:03:57.843 --> 00:04:03.077
Mu... how vicious.

00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:14.166
But it's a correct strategy... Shokatsu Koumei, Ho Shigen, they're skilled.

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:21.877
We have to make sure we don't fall for their plan...
Well then, Karin-sama, I'll depart.

00:04:21.977 --> 00:04:28.401
Please do. I request Kayu's head.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:32.258
Leave it to us! Well then!

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:46.942
Hm... Sousou've chosen to assist the main force. Choosing
reputation over results, I didn't expect that.

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:54.846
Why not? That means we can gain results without any competition.

00:04:54.946 --> 00:05:05.574
Well, yeah... Anyway, Sheren. Don't get carried away, okay?
Shisui gate is still enemy territory after all.

00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:11.205
Hmm... I don't know. Though I'll be careful.
(historically, Sun Jian was supposed to be alive here and die in this campaign)

00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:21.603
Ah... Don't go berserk too much and massacre all enemy soldiers.
It'll affect your reputation after all.

00:05:21.703 --> 00:05:29.461
But if we massacre them, won't it be a useful reputation for us instead?

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:41.274
The reputation of fear can be useful sometimes, indeed...
But right now it's useless to us. Do you understand that much?

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:49.440
I know... but battle without going on a rampage is boring.

00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:57.499
I undestand what you mean, but follow my instructions for now... okay?

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.124
Sure...

00:06:04.226 --> 00:06:13.382
Enjutsu-sama. Kayu force has ran into main force and are fighting.

00:06:13.482 --> 00:06:26.137
W, what?... Just what is Reiha doing? To approach those ruffians
to En family's flag, I'm so shocked I have no words.

00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:37.482
Well, at Enshou-san's side are Bunshu-chan and Ganryo-chan, after all.
Those two are the idiots, so there's no helping it.

00:06:37.582 --> 00:06:48.390
Really... Gathering good officers is one of famous family's heir's role. How pathetic.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:54.261
Well, Enjutsu-sama has me, for that matter.
(And you two are the biggest idiots. Also, Toshi's smart)

00:06:54.361 --> 00:07:02.051
That's right... So, Nanano. What should we do?

00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:07.906
Let's see. Let's just ignore them for now.

00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:12.749
Huh? Is that alright?

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:26.564
Because there's no way main force will lose, judging from forces.
Instead of getting dragged into battle capturing Shisui gate is better, no?

00:07:26.664 --> 00:07:37.148
I see. That's true. Well then, we'll continue attacking Shisui gate then.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:46.118
Yes. Well then, Enjutsu-sama. Orders for attack, please.

00:07:46.218 --> 00:08:01.305
Yeah! Well then, soldiers, loyal to me! Let's capture Shisui gate!
I'll be waiting for good news drinking honey water!

00:08:01.405 --> 00:08:03.601
Enjutsu army: Yes!
