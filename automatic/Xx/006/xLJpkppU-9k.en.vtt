what<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:51.850> mean<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:53.200> didn't<00:02:53.500> immediately

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
what I mean like this didn't immediately

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.500 
what I mean like this didn't immediately
follow<00:02:54.340> Arkham<00:02:54.730> Asylum<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:56.290> Dark<00:02:56.500> Knight<00:02:57.510> but

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
follow Arkham Asylum the Dark Knight but

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.310 
follow Arkham Asylum the Dark Knight but
it's<00:02:59.500> certainly<00:02:59.980> like<00:03:00.459> tried<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.200> then

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
it's certainly like tried to and then

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.900 
it's certainly like tried to and then
they<00:03:02.440> took<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.739> smart<00:03:03.040> step<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.489> delayed<00:03:03.760> it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
they took the smart step and delayed it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.220 
they took the smart step and delayed it
basically<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.390> year<00:03:04.840> mm-hmm<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:10.140> don't<00:03:11.140> know

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
basically a year mm-hmm but I don't know

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.690 
basically a year mm-hmm but I don't know
like<00:03:11.350> The<00:03:11.500> Wolverine<00:03:11.709> game<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.370> came<00:03:12.550> out

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
like The Wolverine game that came out

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.080 
like The Wolverine game that came out
earlier<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:13.060> year<00:03:13.530> wasn't<00:03:14.530> bad<00:03:14.890> well<00:03:15.880> I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
earlier this year wasn't bad well I

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.310 
earlier this year wasn't bad well I
didn't<00:03:16.420> play<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.630> full<00:03:16.810> thing<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.079> play<00:03:17.200> the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
didn't play the full thing I play the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.690 
didn't play the full thing I play the
demo<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.650> seems<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:18.010> little<00:03:18.130> bit<00:03:18.250> more<00:03:18.370> polished

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
demo it seems a little bit more polished

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.819 
demo it seems a little bit more polished
but<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.150> wasn't<00:03:19.420> like<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:20.019> mean<00:03:20.140> no<00:03:20.320> people

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
but it wasn't like this I mean no people

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.830 
but it wasn't like this I mean no people
are<00:03:20.890> talking<00:03:21.130> about<00:03:21.160> this<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.640> gaming<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.540> year

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
are talking about this as gaming a year

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.920

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
but game of the year so far I would

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.850 
but game of the year so far I would

definitely give it a nomination put it
in<00:03:32.950> contention<00:03:33.400> right<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:36.489> that's<00:03:36.850> not<00:03:37.000> to

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
in contention right but that's not to

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.680 
in contention right but that's not to
say<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.510> yeah<00:03:38.110> yeah<00:03:38.680> Wolverine<00:03:39.480> was<00:03:40.480> not<00:03:40.660> a

bad game uh-huh but it severely lacked
polish<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.870> seemed<00:03:47.290> like<00:03:47.799> um<00:03:48.540> there's<00:03:49.540> missing

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019

polish it seemed like um there's missing
like<00:03:50.140> whole<00:03:50.380> layer<00:03:50.709> well<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:52.180> didn't<00:03:52.510> look

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
like whole layer well it didn't look

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.720
