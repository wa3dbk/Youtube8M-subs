00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.059
 soon but what they have also published 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.520
 of what the price is the trailer 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.410
 official let's talk a little bit about that 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.719
 bring this trailer I'll leave it at the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.070
 description and before you go by 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.600
 there terrified to see what the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.699
 trailer that I would guys and you 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 I understand perfectly I will tell you that I am going to 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.360
 analyze a bit in this video that you see 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.850
 and in what details to determine what it is 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.380
 the trailer because it's very interesting and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.600
 you can see some details really 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.900
 amazing about the texture pack and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.300
 any 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.310
 the things that have impressed me so much 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.260
 you know guys click on the trailer and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.670
 then you go back to the video more or less 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.200
 where we have left it and now we are going to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.000
 analyze by commenting a bit on 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.950
 above you see some scenes of what 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.440
 is the prefabricated map that will 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.330
 come with this pack so I think that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.640
 It looks pretty good, it 's pretty 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.920
 well worked and what you see in the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.500
 trailer is the main character that 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.600
 is progressing through a series of sites in 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.460
 what details to watch the trailer guys 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.500
 then there for example a moment in the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.080
 that the protagonist is walking on the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.119
 street with the weapon of what will be I believe 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.130
 that the diamond there we can see it a 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.390
 little that would also design 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.369
 sees a citizen who seems to be 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.900
 working there at home and a detail 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.330
 very interesting that I liked that 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.830
 part of the video is that you can see how 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.810
 for example it has decoration as of 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.640
 animal skins in the background and even 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.590
 as if there were weapons hanging in the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 wall this is a detail that I believe that 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.750
 will surely be the pictures of 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.459
 minecraft and it really gives a very look 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.709
 medieval and I think it's pretty 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.540
 well apart in those scenes is also 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.670
 they see very well what are the textures in 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.410
 general but good the theme of textures 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.420
 we are not going to 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.370
 in detail since then when the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.710
 pack then we will analyze what texture 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.120
 we like more than less and all that one 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.950
 time it advances a little more what is the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.510
 trailer you see two people there from the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.220
 city ​​one of them has a sword that 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.290
 is of a different design than we have 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.940
 seen from diamond and that means that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.010
 the designs of the swords are going to be 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.540
 quite different depending on the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.490
 material of which are things that is 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.230
 pretty good also on top of those 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.970
 characters plus they look a little 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.070
 what are the skins you can see a 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.990
 little armor models a little more 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.430
 simple I would love to see what is the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.830
 diamond armor model by 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.510
 example but for now what is the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.950
 trailer is not seen nothing little 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.200
 then there is a scene that I liked 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.520
 very much is a very short scene if 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.320
 you are watching the trailer or whatever 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.030
 I would say that you pass that scene because it is 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.520
 very good where you see two 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.560
 characters with two different skins one 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.740
 of them wears a demon skin of 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.510
 devil or something like that pretty cool and in 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.100
 his hand carries an ax and the design of the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.560
 ax I liked very much to look at 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.970
 the design because to me personally I 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.830
 he liked what axes are in 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.350
 general so we've seen some 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.380
 images other days about the axes and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.430
 I liked them but you can see what 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.560
 which is the trailer too 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.629
 pretty cool apart in the background 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.120
 you can also see a picture of the 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.760
 great I think it's a decoration 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.189
 that looks pretty good would be like I do not know 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.200
 a portrait of a demon or something 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.239
 It looks very gloomy 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.859
 grayish and such and I also liked 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.450
 what is the look and for decoration 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.250
 I will also be left 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.980
 well all that in that little scene of 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.079
 two seconds but they are details that to me 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.000
 they have seemed important to me too 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.590
 tell you that what is the analysis of 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.849
 trailer I'm doing it over 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.620
 the things that have called me the most 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.849
 attention so first yes that is 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.590
 true that you can see it to the best 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.239
 some skins that we will not comment and 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.730
 other things but as I say 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.889
 personally, I wanted to tell you 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.139
 some of all the things that you see 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.730
 for me the rest of the scenes are pretty 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.650
 quite important because you can see 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.780
 a lot of remodeling mods how are they going to 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.329
 change you see the spiders you see a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.330
 sheep you see a in derman looks like I know 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.430
 how zombies will be and you can even see 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.500
 also as he travels to the world of 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.360
 the entity is pretty cool in general 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.009
 remodeling I liked yes that is 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.050
 true that there are some things that are not 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.610
 They look very good or they look very 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.620
 fast because it 's a very good trailer 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.540
 tiny 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.340
 but overall pretty well the 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.470
 Mox remodeling is also seen in 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.030
 some very interesting plans for 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.500
 check what the map is 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.240
 prefabricated that I think has 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.490
 a lot of work and that will be 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.260
 pretty cool I'm even thinking of 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.540
 start some strange survival in 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.889
 the map of skyrim because it has as os 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.050
 I say very good looking if initially 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.540
 then we will see it a little more in detail 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.820
 when it comes out and such but at the moment it has 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.729
 liked pretty guys I'm waiting 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.580
 the date right now so tell 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.229
 another very important thing have 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.300
 remodeled a little what would be the 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.590
 leander dragon and there also seems to be 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.750
 a design change can not be seen 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.900
 especially well because just the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.240
 trailer ends there when it is facing the 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.680
 dragon not and it does not look very good but yes 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.910
 that seems to have gotten a good 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.889
 design and they have also remodeled it 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.050
 so it will be interesting to see the 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.789
 guys I'm looking forward to having this pack and 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.130
 I tell you that it calls me a lot 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.139
 attention that medieval style I like 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.400
 very much for for minecraft I think 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.789
 that is going to look great is going to be very 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.590
 Playable and hope guys now after 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.810
 see a bit analyze a bit what is 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.430
 the trailer above I have to tell you that 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.260
 the music that plays in the background 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.070
 is the original soundtrack that I 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.360
 I remember that it will also come added or 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.850
 included in this pack which seems to me 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.530
 I think almost the best part guys 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.910
 play with that music 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.590
 let's say it's going to be an addition 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.120
 really amazing we will be 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.010
 playing survival and let's believe ourselves 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.290
 a superhero because it's a music 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.390
 quite epic and that hits very well in 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.980
 minecraft and I think it's going to 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.770
 entertain a little what are the hours of 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.840
 game and now the battle begins 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.150
 of the comments guys leave there in 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.530
 the comments that you have seemed if you 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.540
 you have fixed in some detail more than 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.550
 you liked it personally if you think 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.170
 that will be worth the pack if 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.150
 you are waiting for me to believe that it is 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.190
 waiting for everyone and you know that 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.650
 if it comes out another little thing of dates or 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.690
 some more information we will see it 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.130
