00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 Welcome to all was clear 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.930
 I would like to introduce you today to her new profession August Capsaicin 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.069
 archeology 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:14.199
 Percent this is a secondary job that is similar 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:14.590
 lies 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.610
 Koch reason it gets colder and one for the against also one 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.070
 Main profession teachings 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.130
 that means everybody has a chance to look at it 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.159
 if he feels like um 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.599
 simmering a bit into the dirt and into which it works exactly that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.230
 I'll show you now 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.570
 and it was the first step that goes to the teacher logically money in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.960
 Vocation and then 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.390
 Percent fdp-deputy Welte card 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.990
 and on the world map as it can go on as the first Euroland continent on though 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.540
 currently located 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.230
 and then she is here to the familiar symbols now breaks here that the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.480
 Cities indicates latest products Questions are at the height we here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.020
 See example and also quite by chance right next to us in the climb a rifle g 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.600
 is such a shovel 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.100
 Who would have thought that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.990
 without percent of active if he now seems a supposed to be commemorating 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.600
 on 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.120
 and percent Vienna then 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.320
 Percent for the first time the beats Kate and percent have discovered there and then 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.170
 on the right a small red a jewel a circle and asks in this circle 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.070
 are our Nate 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.610
 Pfatter of which we sound especially makes artifacts fragments of those here 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.180
 In order to dig up a total of three times Vogue, the area is up 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.240
 needed and we have to get one 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 new area Uken once flying again lift 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.630
 Thanks to the new extension, we can indeed assemble our flight even in the old ones 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.650
 Use territories 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.650
 and just land in this beautiful tomb 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.120
 where and projects what if fossils 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.810
 to be guessed 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.009
 it is likely we are looking for middle cities 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.189
 they can investigate and accused Verpoorten going on and on 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.080
 Eyesight leaves a lamp means red lamp means far far away 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.670
 Yellow card mean something closer 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.850
 the usual founder spirit we stand quali too are fragments 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.909
 purchase 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.359
 Aabar's investigation shows us something else that he still does 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.279
 once 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.899
 and here we see that there is a direction to show exactly in 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.999
 this direction is located 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.509
 and say Fragment so we go here now and around Aachen again 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.179
 new investigation 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:34.189
 yes still a red light that means still quite far away that 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.789
 Play games we are only long to give it up to buy first 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.959
 say something later 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.209
 Greens could move around 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.889
 We currently have an added value of 80 tomcat 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.969
 we are almost fragmented on the complete and world percent if 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.059
 we, on the other hand, are the first instance for all parties involved 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.489
 ActiveCare of course only the points 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.829
 probably already behind them as they would have to be between education 60 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.680
 Pug percent dig out stuff but those are the areas where he performs 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.999
 the world percent will get Blizzard then 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.829
 co-considered percent 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.599
 sda now we will be in the slow percent has become fragments 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.069
 4 examine again at this point and see that whole open and give 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 that means there is still some way to go 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.529
 APAs are not that far away from the beginning 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.189
 and therefore 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.159
 We continue to dig in the direction of yellow when it turns green 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.509
 change over and there 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:38.399
 um - you really only have to move forward in small steps now 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.689
 he is a green flashing that is almost insisting on it 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.010
 the last steps we do again »with investigations in very 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.279
 very carefully 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.430
 to 10 then our first step percent 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.000
 which he is fascinating and the fragments are not everywhere right here 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.789
 we miss the WEV minutes away 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:03.279
 the ones that have the Big Band are Dr different brands of 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.559
 fragments 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:09.179
 To find them missing 40 MByte trolls here are various delightful fragments 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.979
 and how do you miss the survey of the moon landing 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.979
 Now if you click on it a short story 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.179
 they'll see that we have 25 here 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.939
 We live on the top left 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.120
 since they came to a nice preserved Fame 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.620
 but here is the overview of all questions in this the Orishas in the world 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.300
 and the critics of this archaeological site 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.809
 was now twice more 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:40.039
 until it's used up and then go to another area like that 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.569
 underneath are those who represented for the first reward 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.439
 Félix Murga still uses 21 um 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.830
 Let's jump a key 4 Tel I've got a little before 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.620
 collected 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.819
 we'll be back in Guca Artur again 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.729
 just before I got the 25% fragment Sam 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:02.819
 Reason Dr 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.819
 Military doctors pick up reward 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.129
 now we are already 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.870
 just a big bike off 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.210
 Here is exactly how and how f4 in Stainz defines his mountains dug 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.750
 Too good a picture, that is to say, it does not need to be pushed anymore 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.330
 long search 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.139
 another 1 2 beaters 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.719
 just go because of the ground and then we have here too 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.819
 To quote fragments and indeed the last verse 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.970
 There are experience points from finding fossils for the process 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:39.469
 a distinctive will and the world and here we are 24 out of 25 5 i get 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.240
 Come on restore 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.349
 Red a nice counter again color chrome left offered we see 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.230
 now the next level is black tea Ludwig 2 of 31 we have from the in 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.169
 indeed in the 51 over valuable beautiful preserved ride 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.369
 St so Müller would not be enough 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.699
 but those against Chile are getting better and better 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.729
 and the office laughs the whole secret behind the new job behind the 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:06.319
 Christians 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.919
 you have now got her a little pleasure 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.960
 to test yourself in the job 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.259
 after 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.049
 that was actually my idea
