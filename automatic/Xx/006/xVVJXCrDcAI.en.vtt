ignited<00:00:28.430> okay<00:00:29.360> the<00:00:29.480> whole<00:00:29.660> thing<00:00:29.960> I'm<00:00:30.169> gonna

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
ignited okay the whole thing I'm gonna

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.440 
ignited okay the whole thing I'm gonna
hook<00:00:30.890> up<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.189> like<00:00:31.279> a<00:00:31.310> little<00:00:31.579> model<00:00:32.150> rocket

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
hook up to like a little model rocket

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.530 
hook up to like a little model rocket
igniter<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:32.989> then<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.780> then<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:38.329> actual

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
igniter and then and then the the actual

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.840 
igniter and then and then the the actual
igniter<00:00:38.989> hooks<00:00:39.530> up<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.710> discharge<00:00:40.220> discharge

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
igniter hooks up to discharge discharge

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.990 
igniter hooks up to discharge discharge
lots<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.720> fuse<00:00:41.960> on<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:43.070> when<00:00:43.460> it<00:00:43.579> blows<00:00:43.790> it

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
lots of fuse on this when it blows it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.650 
lots of fuse on this when it blows it
out<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:45.100> when<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.220> blows<00:00:46.400> it<00:00:46.610> out<00:00:46.670> it'll<00:00:46.910> wait

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
out and when it blows it out it'll wait

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.090 
out and when it blows it out it'll wait
like<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.900> couple<00:00:48.110> like<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.260> second<00:00:48.650> or<00:00:48.770> so<00:00:48.950> and

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
like a couple like a second or so and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.070 
like a couple like a second or so and
then<00:00:49.160> blow<00:00:49.400> up<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.600> um<00:00:52.360> yeah<00:00:53.360> I'll<00:00:53.750> just<00:00:53.780> hook

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
then blow up so um yeah I'll just hook

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.140 
then blow up so um yeah I'll just hook
up<00:00:54.260> that<00:00:54.290> little<00:00:54.560> thing<00:00:54.800> maybe<00:00:55.310> if<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.850> doesn't

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
up that little thing maybe if it doesn't

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.340 
up that little thing maybe if it doesn't
blow<00:00:56.360> up<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.690> whole<00:00:56.840> thing<00:00:56.990> doesn't<00:00:57.080> blow<00:00:57.320> up

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
blow up the whole thing doesn't blow up

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.680 
blow up the whole thing doesn't blow up
and<00:00:57.710> then<00:00:57.860> I<00:00:58.160> will<00:00:59.000> probably<00:00:59.330> put<00:00:59.450> all<00:00:59.570> I'm<00:00:59.660> not

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
and then I will probably put all I'm not

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.450 
and then I will probably put all I'm not
going<00:00:59.930> attachment<00:01:00.410> on<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.500> bottom<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.310> has

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
going attachment on the bottom that has

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.819

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
like a 9-volt battery and then it like

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.520 
like a 9-volt battery and then it like
an<00:01:03.980> igniter<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.610> comes<00:01:05.030> out<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.390> but<00:01:06.290> I
