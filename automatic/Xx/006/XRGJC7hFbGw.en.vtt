00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
routine and all of the animals that it I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.080 
routine and all of the animals that it I
they<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.269> care<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:34.250> with<00:02:35.250> care<00:02:35.760> sheets

they have to care for with care sheets

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.880 
they have to care for with care sheets
you<00:02:36.299> should<00:02:36.450> make<00:02:36.629> sure<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.900> you're<00:02:37.680> being

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
you should make sure that you're being

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.009 
you should make sure that you're being
clear<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.489> organized<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.599> always<00:02:39.780> think

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
clear and organized but I always think

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.960 
clear and organized but I always think
that<00:02:40.140> putting<00:02:40.440> more<00:02:40.799> information<00:02:41.549> in<00:02:41.700> is

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that putting more information in is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.030 
that putting more information in is
better<00:02:42.450> than<00:02:42.780> less<00:02:42.989> but<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.769> shouldn't

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
better than less but you shouldn't

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.380 
better than less but you shouldn't
really<00:02:44.129> be<00:02:44.250> writing<00:02:44.579> like<00:02:44.730> paragraphs<00:02:45.239> and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
really be writing like paragraphs and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.880 
really be writing like paragraphs and
paragraphs<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:46.019> information<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.680> that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
paragraphs of information because that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.880 
paragraphs of information because that
will<00:02:47.010> probably<00:02:47.340> confuse<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.970> person<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:51.890> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
will probably confuse the person and the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.520 
will probably confuse the person and the
fourth<00:02:53.190> tip<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.879> leave<00:02:54.390> emergency<00:02:55.140> numbers

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
fourth tip is to leave emergency numbers

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
fourth tip is to leave emergency numbers

the<00:03:37.349> containers<00:03:37.889> this<00:03:38.340> will<00:03:38.549> save<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> lot<00:03:38.970> of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the containers this will save a lot of

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.559 
the containers this will save a lot of
confusion<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.280> worry<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.970> person<00:03:42.419> who's

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
confusion and worry for the person who's

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.750 
confusion and worry for the person who's
taking<00:03:42.720> care<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.079> them<00:03:43.319> because<00:03:43.590> it'll<00:03:44.549> kind

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
taking care of them because it'll kind

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.430 
taking care of them because it'll kind
of<00:03:44.819> I<00:03:45.090> think<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.569> would<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.870> kind<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.169> stressful

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
of I think it would be kind of stressful

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.440 
of I think it would be kind of stressful
if<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.250> didn't<00:03:47.489> have<00:03:47.609> enough<00:03:47.819> food<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.090> ask

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
if you didn't have enough food to ask

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.970 
if you didn't have enough food to ask
them<00:03:48.810> or<00:03:49.019> hey<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.410> they'd<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.739> go<00:03:49.859> out

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
them or hey and they'd have to go out

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.589 
them or hey and they'd have to go out
and<00:03:50.099> buy<00:03:50.250> some<00:03:50.609> or<00:03:50.880> they'd<00:03:51.090> have<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.329> go<00:03:51.480> in

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
and buy some or they'd have to go in

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.759 
and buy some or they'd have to go in
like<00:03:51.750> rummage<00:03:52.109> through<00:03:52.139> all<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.530> your

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
like rummage through all of your

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.650 
like rummage through all of your
supplies<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.400> try<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.730> find<00:03:53.910> something<00:03:54.239> so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
supplies to try and find something so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.720 
supplies to try and find something so
it's<00:03:55.139> just<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.410> lot<00:03:55.620> easier<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:58.799> sixth<00:03:59.519> tip

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
it's just a lot easier and the sixth tip

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.400 
it's just a lot easier and the sixth tip
is<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.209> prepare<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.690> cages<00:04:01.109> this<00:04:01.290> is

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
is to prepare the cages this is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.199 
is to prepare the cages this is
something<00:04:01.769> that's<00:04:01.950> very<00:04:02.010> important<00:04:02.760> as<00:04:02.970> well

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
something that's very important as well

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.720 
something that's very important as well
what<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> personally<00:04:04.379> have<00:04:04.799> done<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.310> for<00:04:05.639> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
what I personally have done is for the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.509 
what I personally have done is for the
guinea<00:04:05.879> pig<00:04:06.150> cage<00:04:06.389> I<00:04:06.720> have<00:04:07.290> changed<00:04:07.799> them<00:04:08.010> from

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
guinea pig cage I have changed them from

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.970 
guinea pig cage I have changed them from
fleece<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.269> bedding<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.989> like<00:04:10.379> Aspen<00:04:10.799> shavings

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
fleece to bedding I like Aspen shavings

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.490 
fleece to bedding I like Aspen shavings
and<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:12.269> did<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.599> because<00:04:12.810> Aspen<00:04:13.349> shavings

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
and I did this because Aspen shavings

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.650 
and I did this because Aspen shavings
are<00:04:13.859> much<00:04:14.099> easier<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.730> maintain<00:04:14.879> than<00:04:15.150> fleece

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
are much easier to maintain than fleece

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.409 
are much easier to maintain than fleece
as<00:04:15.900> fleece<00:04:16.769> needs<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.160> be<00:04:17.250> sleept<00:04:17.489> up<00:04:17.699> every

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
as fleece needs to be sleept up every

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.210 
as fleece needs to be sleept up every
day<00:04:18.570> if<00:04:18.780> not<00:04:18.930> every<00:04:18.989> second<00:04:19.560> day<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:20.010> didn't

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
day if not every second day and I didn't

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.250 
day if not every second day and I didn't
really<00:04:20.310> want<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.579> leave<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.000> my<00:04:21.239> dad<00:04:21.419> if

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
really want to leave that on my dad if

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.930 
really want to leave that on my dad if
you<00:04:22.380> have<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.500> pet<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.770> needs<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.610> be<00:04:23.639> let<00:04:23.910> out

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
you have a pet that needs to be let out

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.200 
you have a pet that needs to be let out
a<00:04:24.240> lot<00:04:24.510> like<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> rabbit<00:04:25.440> for<00:04:25.620> example<00:04:26.210> you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
a lot like a rabbit for example you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.480 
a lot like a rabbit for example you
could<00:04:27.419> add<00:04:27.630> an<00:04:27.810> extension<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.530> their<00:04:28.680> cage

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
could add an extension to their cage

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.189 
could add an extension to their cage
because<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:29.699> know<00:04:29.910> for<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.240> fact<00:04:30.300> toffee<00:04:31.020> won't

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
because I know for a fact toffee won't

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.960 
because I know for a fact toffee won't
be<00:04:31.319> able<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.560> get<00:04:31.770> let<00:04:32.009> out<00:04:32.130> as<00:04:32.310> much<00:04:32.580> since<00:04:32.910> my

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
be able to get let out as much since my

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.999 
be able to get let out as much since my
dad<00:04:33.210> hasn't<00:04:33.419> doesn't<00:04:33.810> have<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.470> much<00:04:34.740> time

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
dad hasn't doesn't have that much time

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.339 
dad hasn't doesn't have that much time
on<00:04:35.069> his<00:04:35.370> hands<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.880> constantly<00:04:36.479> supervise<00:04:37.110> him

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
on his hands to constantly supervise him

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.800 
on his hands to constantly supervise him
so<00:04:37.949> I'm<00:04:38.190> adding<00:04:38.370> an<00:04:38.550> extension<00:04:38.970> which<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.599> will

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
in one area this is pretty important as

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.279

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
guinea pigs and rabbits for example

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.800 
guinea pigs and rabbits for example
they're<00:05:53.219> pellets<00:05:53.580> do<00:05:53.789> look<00:05:54.000> quite<00:05:54.330> similar

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
they're pellets do look quite similar

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.029 
they're pellets do look quite similar
but<00:05:55.020> they<00:05:55.469> have<00:05:55.650> totally<00:05:56.009> different

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
but they have totally different

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.399 
but they have totally different
ingredients<00:05:56.820> and<00:05:56.880> they<00:05:57.000> shouldn't<00:05:57.210> be<00:05:57.419> fed<00:05:57.690> to

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
ingredients and they shouldn't be fed to

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.589 
ingredients and they shouldn't be fed to
either<00:05:58.740> animal<00:05:59.310> so<00:05:59.729> it's<00:05:59.940> important<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.419> label

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
either animal so it's important to label

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
in like one area as it's much easier for
