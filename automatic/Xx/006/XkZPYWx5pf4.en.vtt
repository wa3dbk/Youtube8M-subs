order to make the glass mosaics basa

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.649 
order to make the glass mosaics basa
brought<00:01:26.859> in<00:01:27.009> a<00:01:27.159> specialist<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:28.090> teach<00:01:28.270> for

specifically<00:01:31.569> for<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:31.929> project<00:01:32.469> so<00:01:32.950> the

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
specifically for this project so the

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.120 
specifically for this project so the
mosaic<00:01:33.670> fabricators<00:01:34.210> were<00:01:34.359> trained<00:01:34.749> by

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
mosaic fabricators were trained by

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.819 
mosaic fabricators were trained by
Sasuke<00:01:36.130> Sieben<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.789> she<00:01:37.359> is<00:01:37.509> with<00:01:37.749> mosaic<00:01:38.350> and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
Sasuke Sieben and she is with mosaic and

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.429 
Sasuke Sieben and she is with mosaic and
Canada<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:40.030> we<00:01:40.299> needed<00:01:40.479> Sasuke<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:41.079> come<00:01:41.259> down

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
Canada so we needed Sasuke to come down

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.010 
Canada so we needed Sasuke to come down
because<00:01:41.950> while<00:01:42.490> our<00:01:42.569> material<00:01:43.569> has<00:01:43.659> been<00:01:43.810> used

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
because while our material has been used

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.709 
because while our material has been used
in<00:01:44.200> mosaics<00:01:44.649> for<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.249> long<00:01:45.639> time<00:01:45.969> we<00:01:46.509> ourselves

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
in mosaics for a long time we ourselves

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.260 
in mosaics for a long time we ourselves
haven't<00:01:47.439> done<00:01:47.649> any<00:01:47.889> mosaic<00:01:48.340> fabrication<00:01:48.999> and

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
haven't done any mosaic fabrication and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.510 
haven't done any mosaic fabrication and
we<00:01:49.719> don't<00:01:49.869> have<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.109> skillset<00:01:50.590> necessary<00:01:50.619> to

we don't have the skillset necessary to
execute<00:01:51.969> the<00:01:52.090> work<00:01:52.240> correctly<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:52.899> we<00:01:53.289> really

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
execute the work correctly so we really

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.289 
execute the work correctly so we really
needed<00:01:53.920> her<00:01:54.039> help<00:01:54.069> and<00:01:54.459> guidance<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:54.999> order<00:01:55.090> to
