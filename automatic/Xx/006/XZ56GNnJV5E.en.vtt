00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.609 
bottom of the double double top valve
closed<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.820> both<00:00:29.880> side<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:30.660> as

America's most my pet here or in the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.050 
America's most my pet here or in the
media<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.070> why<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.400> work<00:03:51.760> your

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
media in that this is why you work your

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.250 
media in that this is why you work your
halfway

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
halfway

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.229 
halfway
because<00:03:53.620> once<00:03:53.920> pull<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.340> meat<00:03:54.519> back<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:55.000> and

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
because once pull the meat back in and

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.069 
because once pull the meat back in and
rises<00:03:55.629> to<00:03:55.659> almost<00:03:56.560> up<00:03:56.860> here<00:03:57.129> and<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.780> should<00:03:58.900> be

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
rises to almost up here and it should be

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.649 
rises to almost up here and it should be
really<00:03:59.290> easy<00:03:59.409> for<00:03:59.620> us<00:03:59.920> to<00:03:59.950> prime<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:00.909> but

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
really easy for us to prime it so but

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.660 
really easy for us to prime it so but
before<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:02.200> put<00:04:02.470> anything<00:04:02.650> for<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.459> Moorhead

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
before you put anything for the Moorhead

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.449 
before you put anything for the Moorhead
out<00:04:04.170> this<00:04:05.170> is<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.470> most<00:04:05.500> important<00:04:06.220> thing

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
out this is the most important thing

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.449 
out this is the most important thing
that<00:04:06.819> you<00:04:07.450> must<00:04:07.599> do<00:04:07.930> before<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.560> put<00:04:08.829> it<00:04:08.980> back

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
that you must do before you put it back

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.830 
that you must do before you put it back
on<00:04:09.810> its<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:11.140> loop<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.650> o-ring<00:04:12.190> here<00:04:12.840> most

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
on its to loop the o-ring here most

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.740 
on its to loop the o-ring here most
people<00:04:14.140> forget<00:04:14.530> about<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:16.269> they<00:04:16.570> will

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
people forget about that and they will

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.550 
people forget about that and they will
have<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.930> leak<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.620> want<00:04:17.949> to<00:04:18.130> loop<00:04:18.430> this

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
have a leak so you want to loop this

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.820 
have a leak so you want to loop this
already<00:04:20.560> we<00:04:20.769> have<00:04:20.919> silicon<00:04:21.310> grease<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:22.830> then

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
already we have silicon grease and then

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.930 
already we have silicon grease and then
put<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.310> back<00:04:24.430> together

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940
