that<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.150> sticks<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> history

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that or sticks with that and history

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
that or sticks with that and history
says<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.280> he<00:01:35.369> won't<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.780> see

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
says that he won't then I really see

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
says that he won't then I really see
this<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.439> good<00:01:37.680> plate<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.159> Philadelphia<00:01:38.310> i

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
this as a good plate for Philadelphia i

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090 
this as a good plate for Philadelphia i
think<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> tough<00:01:39.509> spot<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.049> chicago<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
think is a tough spot for chicago you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.469 
think is a tough spot for chicago you
know<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:41.939> they've<00:01:42.090> got<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> bad

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
know you know they've got a bad

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.999 
know you know they've got a bad
offensive<00:01:42.899> line<00:01:43.290> against<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> team<00:01:43.979> that

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
offensive line against the team that

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.969 
offensive line against the team that
rushes<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> quarterback<00:01:45.360> fairly<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
rushes the quarterback fairly well the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.920 
rushes the quarterback fairly well the
wide<00:01:47.579> receivers<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.360> chicago<00:01:48.840> are

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
wide receivers for chicago are

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.679 
wide receivers for chicago are
completely<00:01:49.500> oh<00:01:49.710> man<00:01:50.250> by<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> defensive<00:01:51.479> backs

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
completely oh man by the defensive backs

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.770 
completely oh man by the defensive backs
in<00:01:51.990> philadelphia<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.640> got<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> Bears<00:01:54.240> defense

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
in philadelphia you got a Bears defense

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
in philadelphia you got a Bears defense
there's<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.409> only<00:01:55.439> twenty<00:01:56.070> third<00:01:56.399> in

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
there's actually only twenty third in

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
there's actually only twenty third in
the<00:01:56.790> NFL<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.840> talked<00:01:58.110> about<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the NFL you know we talked about the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.679 
the NFL you know we talked about the
Bears<00:01:58.740> these<00:01:59.369> sort<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.090> traditional

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
Bears these sort of traditional

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.030 
Bears these sort of traditional
perceptions<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.530> they're<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> good

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
perceptions that they're a good

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.730 
perceptions that they're a good
defensive<00:02:02.579> team<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.899> much<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.290> year<00:02:04.350> so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
defensive team not so much this year so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.380 
defensive team not so much this year so
I<00:02:04.770> think<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.340> Eagles<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.820> their<00:02:05.939> speed<00:02:06.210> could

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I think the Eagles on their speed could

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
I think the Eagles on their speed could
probably<00:02:06.799> get<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> big<00:02:08.310> lead<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
probably get out to a big lead and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.790 
probably get out to a big lead and
probably<00:02:09.149> put<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> boots<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
probably put the boots to the to the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
probably put the boots to the to the
Chicago<00:02:11.250> Bears<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.670> again<00:02:11.970> ternal

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
Chicago Bears but again ternal

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.800 
Chicago Bears but again ternal
servers<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.080> traditionally<00:02:13.950> sloppy<00:02:14.400> team

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
servers is traditionally sloppy team

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.630 
servers is traditionally sloppy team
penalties<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.980> they<00:02:17.130> run<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.460> football

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
penalties and will they run the football

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660 
penalties and will they run the football
those<00:02:18.060> are<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.330> things<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.690> really<00:02:19.550> lend<00:02:20.550> me

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
those are the things that really lend me

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.730 
those are the things that really lend me
to<00:02:20.790> stay<00:02:21.000> away<00:02:21.150> from<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.420> game<00:02:21.630> yeah<00:02:22.020> i<00:02:22.050> agree

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
to stay away from this game yeah i agree

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.980 
to stay away from this game yeah i agree
with<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.010> i'm<00:02:23.160> thinking<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:23.760> taking<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
with you i'm thinking of just taking a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.870 
with you i'm thinking of just taking a
pass<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.560> all<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.100> eagles<00:02:26.430> games<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
pass on all the eagles games for the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310 
pass on all the eagles games for the
rest<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.210> season<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.690> there's<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.960> second

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
rest of the season if there's a second

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.990 
rest of the season if there's a second
team<00:02:28.500> i<00:02:28.620> had<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:29.280> I'd<00:02:29.520> probably

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
team i had to do that with I'd probably

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.850 
team i had to do that with I'd probably
choose<00:02:30.330> Chicago<00:02:31.140> John<00:02:31.440> what<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.710> make<00:02:31.800> of

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
choose Chicago John what do you make of

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.630 
choose Chicago John what do you make of
this<00:02:31.980> line<00:02:32.190> yeah<00:02:33.090> i<00:02:33.120> agree<00:02:33.360> with<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.720> guys

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
this line yeah i agree with you guys

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.190 
this line yeah i agree with you guys
it's<00:02:35.640> too<00:02:35.880> hard<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.120> determine<00:02:36.450> why<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.810> kind

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
it's too hard to determine why the kind

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
it's too hard to determine why the kind
of<00:02:37.260> scheme<00:02:37.560> Philadelphia's<00:02:38.190> gonna<00:02:38.400> employ

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
of scheme Philadelphia's gonna employ

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.000 
of scheme Philadelphia's gonna employ
there<00:02:39.600> they're<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> number<00:02:40.410> one<00:02:40.440> ranked

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
there they're the number one ranked

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.000 
there they're the number one ranked
rushing<00:02:41.520> team<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> Indy<00:02:42.450> NFL<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.770> that's

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
rushing team in the Indy NFL and that's

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.430 
rushing team in the Indy NFL and that's
misleading<00:02:44.280> because<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:45.750> than<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> third<00:02:46.320> of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
misleading because more than a third of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.930 
misleading because more than a third of
that<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.770> Michael<00:02:47.100> Vick<00:02:47.130> running<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.850> his

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
that is Michael Vick running for his

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.960 
that is Michael Vick running for his
life<00:02:48.770> so<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.890> offensive<00:02:50.220> line<00:02:50.340> still<00:02:50.790> has<00:02:50.940> a

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
life so the offensive line still has a

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.990 
life so the offensive line still has a
lot<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.180> holes<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.500> think<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.790> know<00:02:53.880> what

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
lot of holes and I think you know what

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.710 
lot of holes and I think you know what
day<00:02:54.150> was<00:02:55.040> mentioning<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:57.660> know

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
day was mentioning here is that you know

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.210 
day was mentioning here is that you know
based<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.140> stats<00:02:58.470> they<00:02:58.709> are<00:02:58.860> running<00:02:59.070> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
based on the stats they are running the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.980 
based on the stats they are running the
ball<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.640> heck<00:02:59.880> of<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.030> lot<00:03:00.120> more<00:03:00.180> than<00:03:00.600> any<00:03:00.720> time

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
ball a heck of a lot more than any time

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.160 
ball a heck of a lot more than any time
in<00:03:01.020> any<00:03:01.260> reads<00:03:01.620> tenure<00:03:02.580> but<00:03:02.700> that's<00:03:02.910> because

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
in any reads tenure but that's because

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.210 
in any reads tenure but that's because
secondaries<00:03:04.170> have<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.500> guys<00:03:04.680> covered

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
secondaries have the guys covered

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.550 
secondaries have the guys covered
they're<00:03:05.430> not<00:03:05.550> getting<00:03:05.790> separation<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.720> is

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
they're not getting separation and is

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.650 
they're not getting separation and is
forcing<00:03:08.070> vick<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.430> run<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.180> counts<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
forcing vick to run and that counts as a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.900 
forcing vick to run and that counts as a
running<00:03:09.990> play<00:03:10.110> one<00:03:11.040> thing<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.370> does<00:03:11.550> stick<00:03:11.790> out

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
running play one thing it does stick out

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.060 
running play one thing it does stick out
my<00:03:12.120> mind<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.660> chicago<00:03:13.200> has<00:03:13.320> not<00:03:13.530> done<00:03:13.860> well

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
my mind is chicago has not done well

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.600 
my mind is chicago has not done well
against<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.640> teams<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.720> rush<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.530> ball<00:03:16.769> and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
against the teams that rush the ball and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.430 
against the teams that rush the ball and
arguably<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.360> went<00:03:18.660> over<00:03:18.780> why<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.110> is

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
arguably we just went over why this is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.030 
arguably we just went over why this is
not<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> true<00:03:19.980> rushing<00:03:20.400> team<00:03:20.610> but<00:03:21.620> my<00:03:22.620> similar

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
not a true rushing team but my similar

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
not a true rushing team but my similar
shows<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.640> philly<00:03:24.120> will<00:03:24.420> get<00:03:24.660> 150<00:03:25.380> or<00:03:25.470> more

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
shows that philly will get 150 or more

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.740 
shows that philly will get 150 or more

that's<00:03:27.870> worth<00:03:28.080> Chicago's<00:03:28.980> Owen<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.850> year

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
that's worth Chicago's Owen to this year

150 or more rushing yards so again

150 or more rushing yards so again
that's<00:03:40.380> just<00:03:40.650> food<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:40.980> thought<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.910> really

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
that's just food for thought I I really

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.610 
that's just food for thought I I really
think<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.840> game<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.140> stay<00:03:43.350> away<00:03:43.590> from

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
think it's a game to stay away from

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.440 
think it's a game to stay away from
because<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.430> look<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.760> genius<00:03:45.060> or

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
because you really look like a genius or

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.970 
because you really look like a genius or
you<00:03:45.540> look<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> complete<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.620> know<00:03:46.799> what

you look like a complete you know what

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.520 
you look like a complete you know what

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
