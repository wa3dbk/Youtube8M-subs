00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.150 
we have to replay it we will he's just
saying<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.910> affects<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:10.080> people<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.739> terms

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
saying it affects more people in terms

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.140 
saying it affects more people in terms
of<00:02:11.310> number<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> don't<00:02:11.970> know

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of number I don't know

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.550 
of number I don't know
I felt<00:02:12.390> pretty<00:02:12.569> affected<00:02:13.110> by<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:13.409> was<00:02:13.530> going

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
I felt pretty affected by what was going

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.800 
I felt pretty affected by what was going
on<00:02:13.860> with<00:02:13.920> Kayla<00:02:14.220> Mueller<00:02:14.610> yesterday<00:02:15.209> no<00:02:15.780> I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
on with Kayla Mueller yesterday no I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.149 
on with Kayla Mueller yesterday no I
think<00:02:16.079> this<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.680> about<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
think this is all about that the

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.890 
think this is all about that the
president<00:02:17.640> wants<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:17.939> make<00:02:18.090> corporations<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
president wants to make corporations the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.660 
president wants to make corporations the
enemy<00:02:19.200> that's<00:02:19.409> much<00:02:19.650> easier<00:02:19.680> he's<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.489> much

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
enemy that's much easier he's so much

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.149 
enemy that's much easier he's so much
more<00:02:20.700> comfortable<00:02:21.510> fighting<00:02:22.349> back<00:02:22.560> against

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
more comfortable fighting back against

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.550 
more comfortable fighting back against
the<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.519> percent<00:02:24.000> against<00:02:24.480> companies<00:02:24.930> who

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the one percent against companies who

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.410 
the one percent against companies who
are<00:02:25.590> changing<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> environment<00:02:26.430> rather<00:02:27.239> than

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
are changing the environment rather than

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.509 
are changing the environment rather than
against<00:02:27.750> Isis<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.159> more

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
against Isis so this is a more

wrong on the science 24 hours before how
about<00:03:06.629> those<00:03:06.750> models<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.859> 20<00:03:08.220> years<00:03:08.459> let<00:03:08.849> me

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
about those models and 20 years let me

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.460 
about those models and 20 years let me
step<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.209> there<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.659> that<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.139> models

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
step in there because that the models

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.860 
step in there because that the models
out<00:03:10.799> there<00:03:10.829> made<00:03:11.189> for<00:03:11.549> people<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.970> Boston<00:03:12.150> no

they visit the doctor and when their

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.869 
they visit the doctor and when their
cars<00:04:49.240> broken<00:04:49.539> they<00:04:49.750> visit<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.110> mechanic<00:04:50.590> uh<00:04:50.879> but

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
cars broken they visit a mechanic uh but

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.580 
cars broken they visit a mechanic uh but
uh<00:04:51.940> maybe<00:04:52.780> that's<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.139> different<00:04:53.440> type<00:04:53.560> of

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
uh maybe that's a different type of

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.190 
uh maybe that's a different type of
expertise
