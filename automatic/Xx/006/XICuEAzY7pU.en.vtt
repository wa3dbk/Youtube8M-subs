00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
previous two chapters there is actually

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
previous two chapters there is actually
a<00:01:04.350> short<00:01:04.799> cut<00:01:04.979> scene<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> won't<00:01:05.729> spoil

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
a short cut scene that I won't spoil

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
here but I feel that these cutscenes

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.740 
here but I feel that these cutscenes
should<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> been<00:01:08.880> more<00:01:09.030> prevalent<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
should have been more prevalent in the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.090 
should have been more prevalent in the
previous<00:01:10.080> chapters<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.650> well<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> mean<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
previous chapters as well I mean I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
previous chapters as well I mean I
didn't<00:01:11.549> expect<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:11.970> event<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.540> take

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
didn't expect this event to really take

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
didn't expect this event to really take
up<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.960> lot<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.110> time<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> complete<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.340> more

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
up a lot of time to complete but a more

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
something that i just want something
that<00:01:28.680> people<00:01:28.950> feel<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> part<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that people feel they can be a part of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
that people feel they can be a part of
repeatedly<00:01:30.900> even<00:01:31.229> though<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.799> may<00:01:31.950> have

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
repeatedly even though they may have

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.980 
repeatedly even though they may have
gotten<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.610> reward<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.600> maybe

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
gotten one reward from it that maybe

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.300 
gotten one reward from it that maybe
they<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> specific

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
they want to go back and do a specific

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.550 
they want to go back and do a specific
one<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:35.970> different<00:01:36.240> rewards<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.930> they

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
one to get different rewards and they

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.109 
one to get different rewards and they
sort<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.040> did<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.579> first<00:01:38.880> one

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
sort of did that with the first one

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.060 
sort of did that with the first one
where<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> weapons<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.530> it's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
where you can get the weapons but it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
where you can get the weapons but it's
just<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.310> enough<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:42.030> needs<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
just not enough there needs to be a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
just not enough there needs to be a
little<00:01:42.540> bit<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.170> work<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:43.860> this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
little bit more work going into this

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
little bit more work going into this
especially<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.630> something

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
especially because this is something

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870 
especially because this is something
that<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.259> teased<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.579> long<00:01:47.610> time

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that they teased for a really long time

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.270 
that they teased for a really long time
and<00:01:48.509> people<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:49.259> people<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.710> excited

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and people some people really excited

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
and people some people really excited
some<00:01:50.460> people<00:01:50.700> weren't<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.149> obvious<00:01:51.869> reasons

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
some people weren't for obvious reasons

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
some people weren't for obvious reasons
but<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.950> feel<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.000> put

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
but I feel like they just could have put

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
but I feel like they just could have put
a<00:01:54.240> little<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.869> work<00:01:54.930> into<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
a little bit more work into it and I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.200 
a little bit more work into it and I
really<00:01:55.920> hope<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.939> because

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
really hope that this is just because

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.260 
really hope that this is just because
their<00:01:57.390> priorities<00:01:58.100> prioritizing<00:01:59.100> patch<00:01:59.610> 2.1

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
their priorities prioritizing patch 2.1

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.520 
their priorities prioritizing patch 2.1

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and hopefully we'll see something a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
and hopefully we'll see something a
little<00:02:01.710> bit<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.130> involved<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> future
