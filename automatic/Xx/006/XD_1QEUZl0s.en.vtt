 let's discover cut that is cut 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.840
 to cut one is a personal assistant 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.789
 is a program with which we will be able to 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.469
 talk basically let's be able to talk 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.750
 and we will be able to ask for many 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.449
 things we will be able to ask that we do not know 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.280
 is that I do not know, we'll see what 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.179
 we can of what we are going to do in this 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.859
 video is not asking for things is simply 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.960
 set it up okay so let's 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.850
 set it up for it you have to do 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.920
 click here below 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 in agreement we click here 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 Hi, I'm cut 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.290
 you want a personal assistant I'm here 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.900
 to help great these are some 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.790
 things that it can do for you then you 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.430
 can sell light bulbs can send 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.790
 letters can make squares with a 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.370
 Magnifying glass inside knows how to use magnifying glasses 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.410
 driving knows how to cook good 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.630
 enough things like we're seeing this 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.020
 you already give a look me 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.070
 supposed agreement so with the following 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.780
 before starting you need a long 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.100
 information to get better from 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.020
 cortana micros collect this 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.090
 information and taltal to me too I the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.890
 information that I have from this point and 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.710
 to reassure them I want I know that 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.200
 there is a lot of conspiracy with the subject of 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.720
 Microsoft, well, what he's going to do 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.660
 Microsoft is basically taking data from 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.400
 the experience of this software and the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.680
 user so when you 're talking it's going 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.690
 taking your voice this is stored 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.390
 is saving and this information the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.650
 used to perfect the program of 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 according to cortana let's say it's going to go 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.260
 learning based on experience 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.540
 so 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.090
 it's interesting, well, it's interesting 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.980
 and necessary that I can store data from 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.560
 users and that this data can 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.050
 use for in the future give you a 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.600
 better answer so good you have to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.310
 accept and now you have to put here a 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.310
 name jito so let's go there 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.300
 great is Pablo so I can 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.750
 keep track of what 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.450
 you want me to put bread and well here I have 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.700
 that I set up my account one 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.580
 mind that I have to play 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.650
 with cut this part of the video 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.020
 I'm going to have to cut it so a 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.580
 little patience of agreement and good 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.890
 we simply put an account 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.930
 of microsoft you put your password 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.670
 of the microsoft account and without problem 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.480
 for if I had registered one with 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.980
 the system 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.570
 that same the visual purchase of agreement 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.920
 I'm going to complete this part of the assistant 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.959
 and see you right now 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.360
 well it's over the assistant is a 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.770
 simple thing simply for that a 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.950
 user or by your email 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.200
 that you have already registered 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.910
 preferably from microsoft you put a 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.130
 password the password for that account 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.020
 of mail and then good then simply 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.600
 it makes you a check sends you a 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.630
 mail tells you to put a code and 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.330
 Well, that's because this account 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 I'm using is not there and I was not 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.390
 hooked to a microsoft account 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.370
 because he used a different account 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.019
 so we can see the assistant 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.880
 initial because with the other accounts that 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.650
 I have then it is already there 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.710
 done now says that the passwords 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.660
 they are old fashioned 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.810
 I think it's great we're going to admit this 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.970
 He passed 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.020
 let's see this mode by recognition 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.700
 of what you want it to be so that such 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.290
 current art 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.410
 now I have to do a test of 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.410
 voice 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.000
 emotion and intrigue belly pain 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.420
 let's start with the day if it's 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.180
 great but you do not do the voice test 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.040
 now remote audio will give you a 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.900
 phrase that you can repeat so you can 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.760
 make sure I hear you correctly 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.709
 make sure you 're in a place 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.290
 quiet and that the microphone is 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.340
 configured correctly we go to 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.310
 next pedro speaks to this pc prefers 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.910
 speak what to write and above all 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.450
 prefers pencil and paper 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.120
 great just one more thing is missing for 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.780
 check if they cut to is already 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.250
 working 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.250
 or cut it to 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.590
 today it is loose or the short one na 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:00.960
 hello there's something I can help you with 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.960
 yes the truth that if I'm hungry 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.509
 you have to talk about the truth that a 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:12.550
 little bit because it's not something does not work 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.900
 wrong again in a few moments to 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.520

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.969

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.019

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.019

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.200
 very well 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.600
 well one of the things that are cut is 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.490

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.780
 Microsoft search engine 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.780

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.850
 let's go let's go 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.610
 It's funny because I've made videos of 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.520
 cortana and always the first time what 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.050
 I start up the first time 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.790
 especially the first time and it's not 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.550
 joke 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.080
 I would like those who want me to 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.460
 confirm if you can but the first time 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.260
 it works fatal but fatal I do not know if it is 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.150
 that needs a while to go 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.900
 heating I miss you see just 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.370
 stay hung 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.370
 let's rest

 what do you do? 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.850
 in many things although there are more 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.130
 learn good well as we see has a 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.660
 good repertoire let's see the face or 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.660
 cross face or cross 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.190
 as we see in some problem I'm going to 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.039
 restart a couple of times it works 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.650
 try again in a moment 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:05.720
 thank you it 's the second time I'm 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.310
 speaking good I'm going to do it is what 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.250
 I tell you, I'm going to restart the 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.190
 machine a couple of times I'll be 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.389
 talking a little bit to loosen 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.979
 You'll see that it's like that but I really 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.660
 I would like you to confirm this point 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.580
 because it's something that I have a lot 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.759
 curiosity because in this machine well 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:26.659
 that had used cut to the first 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:28.880
 once you really put it in motion 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:29.740
 define up to those problems that is me 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.229

 see what things we can say we 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.729

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.860
 entertaining while and for the last 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:44.870
 video a guillo series' the of how 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.759
 tell cortana to recognize us by 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.530
 our voice and be able to activate it by 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.789
 voice command without having to click 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.919
