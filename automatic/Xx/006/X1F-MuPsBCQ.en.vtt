00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
number two is an old invention but has

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.890 
number two is an old invention but has
we<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.340> now<00:02:44.700> able<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.090> make<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.569> so<00:02:45.870> much

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
we it is now able to make it so much

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.199 
we it is now able to make it so much
better<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> new<00:02:46.739> update<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.819> it's<00:02:47.970> called

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
better in the new update so it's called

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.039 
better in the new update so it's called
the<00:02:48.569> TNT<00:02:48.959> cannon<00:02:48.989> upgraded<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:51.510> reason<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
the TNT cannon upgraded the reason it

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.500 
the TNT cannon upgraded the reason it
works<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.010> new<00:02:53.160> update<00:02:53.519> better<00:02:54.090> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
works in the new update better is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.729 
works in the new update better is
because<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:56.540> ignites<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.810> TNT<00:02:58.230> when<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.590> comes

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
because it ignites the TNT when it comes

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.729 
because it ignites the TNT when it comes
out<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.070> dispensers<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.320> can<00:03:01.500> have

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
out of the dispensers so you can have

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.190 
out of the dispensers so you can have
multiple<00:03:02.459> TNT<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.390> here<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> moment<00:03:04.109> we've

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
multiple TNT in here so the moment we've

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.479 
multiple TNT in here so the moment we've
only<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.890> there's<00:03:05.070> only<00:03:05.160> actually
