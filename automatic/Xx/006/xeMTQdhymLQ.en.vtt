00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
kind of tricky at this point I am using

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.389 
kind of tricky at this point I am using
the<00:00:29.519> truant<00:00:30.420> Durant<00:00:30.689> strategy<00:00:31.309> that's<00:00:32.309> been

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the truant Durant strategy that's been

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.650 
the truant Durant strategy that's been
working<00:00:32.669> pretty<00:00:32.759> well<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> course

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
working pretty well but of course

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.020 
working pretty well but of course
there's<00:00:33.960> still<00:00:34.079> things<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.730> Fischer

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there's still things that have Fischer

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.459 
there's still things that have Fischer
that<00:00:36.710> sometimes<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> wrench<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> my<00:00:38.430> plans

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
that sometimes to a wrench to my plans

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.549 
that sometimes to a wrench to my plans
but<00:00:40.469> hey<00:00:41.340> we're<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:43.079> that'll<00:00:43.440> totally

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
but hey we're here so that'll totally

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.500 
but hey we're here so that'll totally
neat<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.219> she<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> leading<00:00:45.360> with

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
neat up and she is leading with

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.830 
neat up and she is leading with
tornadoes<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> she<00:00:47.039> does<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.840> genie

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
tornadoes and she does use the genie

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.930 
tornadoes and she does use the genie
trio<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.410> she<00:00:49.469> has<00:00:49.649> tornadoes<00:00:50.039> under<00:00:50.760> us

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
trio so she has tornadoes under us

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.160 
trio so she has tornadoes under us
thunderous<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.010> landless<00:00:53.780> they<00:00:54.780> are<00:00:54.870> tricky

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
thunderous and landless they are tricky

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.990 
thunderous and landless they are tricky
luckily<00:00:55.530> none<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.070> no<00:00:57.109> one-hit<00:00:58.109> ko<00:00:58.289> moves

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
luckily none of them no one-hit ko moves

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.490 
luckily none of them no one-hit ko moves
so<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.270> I'm<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> use<00:01:01.140> truant

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so what I'm gonna do here is use truant

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.179 
so what I'm gonna do here is use truant
Durant<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.359> use<00:01:03.359> entrainment<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.199> turn<00:01:04.949> his

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
Durant and use entrainment to turn his

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.830 
Durant and use entrainment to turn his
prankster<00:01:05.640> into<00:01:05.939> truancy<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.600> every<00:01:06.810> other

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
prankster into truancy so every other

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590 
prankster into truancy so every other
turn<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.890> doing<00:01:08.130> nothing<00:01:08.570> which<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
turn you will be doing nothing which is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.260 
turn you will be doing nothing which is
great<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.159> gonna<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.400> into<00:01:11.610> pincer<00:01:11.939> which

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
great so I'm gonna go into pincer which

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.899 
great so I'm gonna go into pincer which
is<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> star<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> show<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.790> he<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.850> a

attack doesn't come stab when he goes to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.650 
attack doesn't come stab when he goes to
mega<00:01:25.350> pincer<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.810> that's<00:01:27.810> essentially

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
mega pincer and that's essentially

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:38.390 
mega pincer and that's essentially
yeah<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:31.170> game-winner<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.190> it's<00:01:38.190> kind<00:01:38.340> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
for a few turns as I max out pincers

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.170 
for a few turns as I max out pincers
attack<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.590> abuse<00:01:50.100> him<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.910> being<00:01:51.090> able
