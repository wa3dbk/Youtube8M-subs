 do you recognize she is no different nothing 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:27.040
 inferior in quality yarn Turkish or 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.970
 I take some Chinese there, I see 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.209
 because of her basically well they say that 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.400
 there is a coil that's all else but coils 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.549
 there are knitting and 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.090
 coils of different yarn are everywhere but 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:47.889
 they leave gradually so I see myself 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.220
 I see children are pretty long out of 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:53.799
 this yarn and that is good 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.790
 the product from this yarn can be washed in 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:01.150
 washing clothes they do not lose shape do not lose 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:06.130
 form absolutely do not sit down 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.609

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:15.420
 socks socks that knit out 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.030
 troechki is not plump 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.400
 very so kind warm what's important 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:28.120
 that they are warm months very well here 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.690
 the cap the cap is also connected in our 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.870
 yarn 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:36.519
 but here I took the knit and suddenly three check 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.510
 to make it more like eg 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:44.200
 Well mated what was announced as you can see 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.960
 very good looking very soft 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:52.500
 very pleasant to the touch so 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:57.400
 here's another hat 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:01.260
 too connected to our yarn black net 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.640
 make also a two-line view 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:10.480
 large mating here's another cap 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.620
 you from and imposed as you see he is all winter 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.940
 and and sneaked 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.209
 and as you can see she has not lost her form 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.500
 no coils very well kept 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:28.470
 the shape of this hat I will do 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:33.030
 somehow master class 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.790
 so the price of yarn 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:41.940
 very pleasant 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:45.250
 kilogram can be taken for 250 rubles and 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.040
 you can impose a lot of all sorts of 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.690
 different here see what else I want 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.720
 say here in this womb 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:59.070
 about 300 grams is a little 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.070
 more is less 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.150
 and what's good that I like about this 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:09.470
 yarn that very little need to make strings 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:13.910
 knitting process is very long 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:16.970
 yarn therefore highly recommend taking 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.940
 it is especially for beginners 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.550
 because before going into 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.770
 expensive yarn learn altogether on it 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.350
 very good and yet 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.580
 this yarn is generally perfect for 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:38.690
 knitting blankets is tack she's very 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:41.150
 Well keeps how to say if they are 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.730
 hot well as a stand under hot it 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.830
 nothing melts very well holds 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.580
 for 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:53.270
 so I recommend well all bye 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:56.110
 if there is something else I will add 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.110
