00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
that 200 mark and i'll make another

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.440 
that 200 mark and i'll make another
massive<00:00:11.370> video<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> hundred<00:00:12.210> dragon

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
massive video like the hundred dragon

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089 
massive video like the hundred dragon
strikes<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:12.809> i<00:00:12.840> did<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.230> then<00:00:13.710> after<00:00:14.009> that

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
strikes one i did and then after that

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.890 
strikes one i did and then after that
i'll<00:00:14.340> probably<00:00:14.549> wait<00:00:14.730> until<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.240> 500<00:00:15.660> dragon

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
i'll probably wait until the 500 dragon

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
i'll probably wait until the 500 dragon
strikes<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.260> do<00:00:16.350> another<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.859> those<00:00:16.949> just

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
strikes to do another one of those just

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.200 
strikes to do another one of those just
because<00:00:18.920> 300-400<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.460> kind<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.699> those

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
because 300-400 that kind of those

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.460 
because 300-400 that kind of those
numbers<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.689> seem<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.900> bit<00:00:21.930> off<00:00:22.080> they<00:00:22.320> don't

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
numbers just seem a bit off they don't

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.070 
numbers just seem a bit off they don't
seem<00:00:22.680> right<00:00:23.010> doing<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.850> will<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.210> 201<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.960> then

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
seem right doing so will do 201 and then

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.710 
seem right doing so will do 201 and then
i'll<00:00:25.199> go<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> 500<00:00:26.609> do<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.880> i<00:00:27.090> was

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
i'll go all the way to 500 do that i was

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.509 
i'll go all the way to 500 do that i was
also<00:00:27.960> considering<00:00:28.920> maybe<00:00:29.160> doing<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
also considering maybe doing a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.630 
also considering maybe doing a
comparison<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:31.130> 250<00:00:32.130> rock<00:00:32.309> strikes

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
comparison one like 250 rock strikes

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
comparison one like 250 rock strikes
versus<00:00:33.149> 250<00:00:33.780> dragon<00:00:34.079> strikes<00:00:34.350> I'll<00:00:34.860> give<00:00:35.070> you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
versus 250 dragon strikes I'll give you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.500 
versus 250 dragon strikes I'll give you
a<00:00:35.219> hint<00:00:35.370> dragon<00:00:35.760> strikes<00:00:35.969> or<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> million<00:00:36.360> times

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
a hint dragon strikes or a million times

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
a hint dragon strikes or a million times
bear<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.440> not<00:00:37.500> too<00:00:37.770> worth<00:00:38.219> doing<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
bear so it's not too worth doing but I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.069 
bear so it's not too worth doing but I
think<00:00:39.149> people<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.629> interested<00:00:39.660> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
think people would be interested in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.720 
think people would be interested in
seeing<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.559> much<00:00:41.010> better<00:00:41.219> dragon<00:00:41.520> strikes

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
seeing how much better dragon strikes

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
seeing how much better dragon strikes
actually<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.239> than<00:00:42.570> rock<00:00:42.750> strikes<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.590> course

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
actually are than rock strikes of course

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
actually are than rock strikes of course
I<00:00:43.920> still<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.489> 250<00:00:45.420> first<00:00:45.629> before

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
I still have to get to 250 first before

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.810 
I still have to get to 250 first before
I<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.530> people<00:00:47.100> also<00:00:47.340> suggested

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I can do that and people also suggested

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.889 
I can do that and people also suggested
I<00:00:47.879> should<00:00:47.910> start<00:00:48.210> doing<00:00:48.270> Tiger<00:00:48.600> strike

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
I should start doing Tiger strike

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.180 
I should start doing Tiger strike
something<00:00:49.170> i'll<00:00:49.469> talk<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:50.010> more

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
these goods the boots could turn into

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.810 
these goods the boots could turn into
the<00:01:00.899> last<00:01:01.109> exotic<00:01:01.649> i<00:01:01.770> need<00:01:02.070> which<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the last exotic i need which is the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
the last exotic i need which is the
bones<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.329> year<00:01:03.510> I've<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.500> been<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.769> two

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
bones of a year I've really been one two

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
bones of a year I've really been one two
trailers<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.479> reason<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> never

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
trailers out because the reason I never

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.590 
trailers out because the reason I never
liked<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> hunter<00:01:07.799> jump<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.390> had

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
liked the hunter jump is because it had

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.390 
liked the hunter jump is because it had
no<00:01:09.780> speed<00:01:10.140> increase<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.220> didn't

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
no speed increase to it like it didn't

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
no speed increase to it like it didn't
have<00:01:11.490> directional<00:01:12.030> control<00:01:12.450> whereas<00:01:13.260> with

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
have directional control whereas with

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
have directional control whereas with
blink<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> Titan<00:01:14.820> increased<00:01:15.600> control

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
blink and like a Titan increased control

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.929 
blink and like a Titan increased control
stuff<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.369> move<00:01:17.490> forwards

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
stuff like that you can move forwards

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
stuff like that you can move forwards
really<00:01:18.210> fast<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.570> save<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> lot<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
really fast and save a lot of time if I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.350 
really fast and save a lot of time if I
always<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.220> bones<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.700> EO<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
always use the bones of EO with the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
always use the bones of EO with the
increased<00:01:21.689> control<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.259> double<00:01:22.530> jump<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.310> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
increased control on double jump then I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.190 
increased control on double jump then I
could<00:01:23.610> probably<00:01:23.759> jump<00:01:24.030> forwards<00:01:24.600> loads<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
could probably jump forwards loads and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
could probably jump forwards loads and
it<00:01:25.320> would<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.759> could<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it would just be really it could be a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.249 
it would just be really it could be a
replacement<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.479> blink<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
replacement for blink and I just want to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
replacement for blink and I just want to
try<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:29.939> think

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
try it out so much I just don't think

that<00:03:49.049> was<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> different<00:03:49.380> attempt<00:03:49.799> at

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
that was a different attempt at

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.979 
that was a different attempt at

recording but somebody asked me if I

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.569 
recording but somebody asked me if I
could<00:03:52.019> do<00:03:52.380> tiger<00:03:52.709> strikes<00:03:53.040> after<00:03:53.250> I've<00:03:53.459> done

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
could do tiger strikes after I've done

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.069 
could do tiger strikes after I've done
joining<00:03:53.880> strikes<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.420> at<00:03:54.570> first<00:03:54.720> i<00:03:54.930> was<00:03:55.049> like

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
joining strikes and at first i was like

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.530 
joining strikes and at first i was like
no<00:03:55.799> why<00:03:56.160> would<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.400> do<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.579> what<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.329> point

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
no why would I do that what is the point

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.990 
no why would I do that what is the point
but<00:03:58.200> they<00:03:58.290> were<00:03:58.410> saying<00:03:58.620> how<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.430> legendaries

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
but they were saying how the legendaries

but they were saying how the legendaries
that<00:04:00.150> drop<00:04:00.420> in<00:04:00.630> tiger<00:04:00.959> strikes<00:04:01.230> still<00:04:02.040> give

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
that drop in tiger strikes still give

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.819 
that drop in tiger strikes still give
you<00:04:02.340> pre<00:04:02.730> dark<00:04:03.000> below<00:04:03.209> weapons<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.410> i<00:04:04.440> could<00:04:04.680> go

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
you pre dark below weapons so i could go

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.590 
you pre dark below weapons so i could go
in<00:04:04.980> there<00:04:05.160> get<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> legendary<00:04:05.940> drop<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.450> it

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
in there get a legendary drop and it

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.640 
in there get a legendary drop and it
could<00:04:06.720> turn<00:04:06.840> into<00:04:06.900> shadow<00:04:07.290> price<00:04:07.500> or

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
could turn into shadow price or

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.800 
could turn into shadow price or
something<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.609> even<00:04:08.760> then<00:04:09.180> even<00:04:09.480> after<00:04:09.660> i

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
something but even then even after i

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.440 
something but even then even after i
realized<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.260> i<00:04:10.470> still<00:04:10.709> thought<00:04:10.950> why<00:04:11.519> what

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
realized that i still thought why what

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.229 
realized that i still thought why what
is<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.959> actual<00:04:13.350> point<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.640> helmet<00:04:14.970> gives

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
is the actual point and the helmet gives

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.940 
is the actual point and the helmet gives
the<00:04:15.359> apex<00:04:15.690> harmonic<00:04:16.109> i'm<00:04:16.620> going<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> talk

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
the apex harmonic i'm going to talk

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.020 
the apex harmonic i'm going to talk
about<00:04:17.070> these<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.459> then<00:04:17.579> i'm<00:04:17.669> going<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:17.850> run<00:04:17.970> a

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
about these and then i'm going to run a

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.550 
about these and then i'm going to run a
cryptic<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.720> i'll<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.049> tagged<00:04:19.289> strikes

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
cryptic and i'll go on tagged strikes

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.920 
cryptic and i'll go on tagged strikes
again<00:04:19.769> heavy<00:04:20.489> gives<00:04:20.970> what<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.630> going<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> be
