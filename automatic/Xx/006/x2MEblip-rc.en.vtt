00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
attentive to detail I think that there's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
attentive to detail I think that there's
no<00:00:22.619> other<00:00:22.740> specialty<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.850> quite<00:00:24.119> say

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
no other specialty that can quite say

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.170 
no other specialty that can quite say
that<00:00:24.449> every<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.500> stitch<00:00:26.099> every<00:00:26.910> little

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
that every little stitch every little

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810 
that every little stitch every little
millimeter<00:00:27.689> matters<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:29.279> other<00:00:29.429> thing<00:00:29.640> was

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
millimeter matters the other thing was

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.150 
millimeter matters the other thing was
that<00:00:29.960> there<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> single<00:00:31.710> part<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that there is not a single part of the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.150 
that there is not a single part of the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
body that I don't want right on his

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.299 
body that I don't want right on his
kindness<00:00:35.730> his<00:00:36.630> compassion<00:00:37.559> his

kindness his compassion his

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.740 
kindness his compassion his
understanding<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.450> three<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> his<00:00:40.469> biggest

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
think that the most important thing is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.779 
think that the most important thing is
if<00:00:48.390> something<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> bothering<00:00:49.079> someone<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
if something is bothering someone you

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
if something is bothering someone you
know<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.360> afraid<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.780> come<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> and

talk<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:53.100> by<00:00:53.850> walking<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> door

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
talk just by walking in the door

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
talk just by walking in the door
certainly<00:00:55.079> does<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.559> mean<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.280> you're

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
certainly does not mean that you're

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
know we can make a game plan we can make
an<00:01:00.239> outline<00:01:00.600> some<00:01:01.050> things<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.710> be

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
an outline some things that we can be

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640 
an outline some things that we can be
done<00:01:02.070> either<00:01:02.280> surgical<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:02.850> non-surgical<00:01:03.650> he

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
done either surgical or non-surgical he

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.590 
done either surgical or non-surgical he
was<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:04.979> friendly<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:06.119> could<00:01:06.270> tell<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> he

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
was very friendly you could tell that he

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.190 
was very friendly you could tell that he
really<00:01:06.990> cared<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.790> what<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.030> wanted<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
really cared about what you wanted and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.039 
really cared about what you wanted and
he<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.130> concerned<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.150> achieving<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
he was concerned about achieving the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.030 
he was concerned about achieving the
main<00:01:13.260> goal<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:14.000> think<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.299> hardest<00:01:15.780> part<00:01:16.080> for

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
main goal I think the hardest part for

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
main goal I think the hardest part for
people<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> pick<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> phone<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.840> want

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
people is to pick up the phone you want

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.350 
people is to pick up the phone you want
people<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> come<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> feel<00:01:20.280> comfortable

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
people to come in and feel comfortable

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.640 
people to come in and feel comfortable
with<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:21.659> walk<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.110> door<00:01:22.200> there

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
with when they walk in the door there

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.789 
with when they walk in the door there
they're<00:01:22.890> met<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.159> smile<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:27.680> think<00:01:28.680> over

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
they're met with a smile I think over

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.350 
they're met with a smile I think over
the<00:01:28.890> last<00:01:29.009> few<00:01:29.250> years<00:01:29.280> I've<00:01:29.700> noticed<00:01:30.119> that

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the last few years I've noticed that

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
the last few years I've noticed that
there<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.079> men<00:01:31.350> coming<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:31.979> the

there are more men coming into the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
there are more men coming into the
practice<00:01:32.549> probably<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> most<00:01:33.570> common<00:01:34.079> thing

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
practice probably the most common thing

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.219 
practice probably the most common thing
is<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.640> non-surgical<00:01:36.119> procedures<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.930> lot<00:01:37.140> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
is the non-surgical procedures a lot of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.270 
is the non-surgical procedures a lot of
men<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.530> start<00:01:37.680> coming<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.070> having

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
men will start coming in and having

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.569 
men will start coming in and having
Botox<00:01:38.820> done<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:39.960> men<00:01:40.200> are<00:01:40.229> starting<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> not

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
Botox done we as men are starting to not

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
Botox done we as men are starting to not
want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> age<00:01:42.150> either<00:01:42.570> probably<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> most

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
want to age either probably the most

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
want to age either probably the most
common<00:01:44.009> procedure<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.180> men<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
common procedure that I do on men is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.020 
common procedure that I do on men is
