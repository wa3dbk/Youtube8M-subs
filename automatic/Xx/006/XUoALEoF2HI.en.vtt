00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.610
 extraterrestrial astronautics is a subject 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.340
 about the existence of life forms 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.470
 intelligent extraterrestrial whose 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.960
 evolution occurred in a world 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.560
 extraterrestrial and they developed the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.220
 technological means to travel from your 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.619
 world to our planet earth the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.870
 reverse engineering is based on the fact 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.100
 that we have acquired through 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.730
 alien hardware 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.670
 and enough physical information to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.970
 to be able to decipher its content and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.730
 possible use 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.980
 it is true that these ships possibly 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.470
 they had some failure in the systems of 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.380
 flight or by means of communication and 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.960
 negotiation and that's precisely why 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.960
 they crashed on earth and could not 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.089
 still subsist reverse engineering 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.280
 of mechanical parts requires the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.130
 extraction of information about a 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.660
 instance of a specific part 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.390
 enough to reproduce the piece 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.860
 using the right techniques to 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.780
 its making a human spaceship 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.840
 manufactured is made up of many sub 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.360
 integrated systems these through 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.070
 various operating parameters our 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.590
 first in a way of example I will say 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.009
 for example a car a car has a 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.040
 brake system has a system of 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.380
 traction that is through the motor has 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.200
 an electrical system that controls the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.540
 lights and door locks and so on 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.290
 has different subsystems a vehicle 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.140
 spatial then the application of the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.229
 astronautics extraterrestrial 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.780
 through reverse engineering 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.690
 develop technology on earth is 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.930
 a situation that in case you 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.659
 count on this may be feasible here 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.659
 the hard part is to try one or the other
