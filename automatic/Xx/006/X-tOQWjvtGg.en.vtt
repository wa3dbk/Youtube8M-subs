00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.490 
and the actually just flew there so
that's<00:02:50.270> why<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.450> don't<00:02:50.570> see<00:02:50.810> them<00:02:50.990> well<00:02:51.380> if<00:02:51.470> I

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
that's why you don't see them well if I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
certain configuration every hour so it

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.570
