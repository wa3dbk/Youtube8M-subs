00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.439 

well<00:00:00.840> now<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.500> think<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.520> should<00:00:02.700> start<00:00:03.000> with<00:00:03.300> a

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
well now I think we should start with a

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.920 
well now I think we should start with a
basic<00:00:03.750> wash<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.920> cover<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.310> page<00:00:05.520> paper<00:00:06.060> and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
basic wash to cover the page paper and

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.520 
basic wash to cover the page paper and
get<00:00:07.080> rid<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.470> white<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.220> paper<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
get rid of that white of the paper I

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.140 
get rid of that white of the paper I
normally<00:00:10.530> like<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.800> stand<00:00:11.400> when<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:11.820> painting

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
normally like to stand when I'm painting

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
normally like to stand when I'm painting
I<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.889> very<00:00:14.429> much<00:00:14.580> wet<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.179> wet<00:00:15.529> so

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
I like to do a very much wet and wet so

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.429 
I like to do a very much wet and wet so
I<00:00:16.560> shall<00:00:16.949> add<00:00:17.160> some<00:00:17.430> clean<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.750> must<00:00:19.080> always<00:00:19.230> be

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
I shall add some clean it must always be

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
I shall add some clean it must always be
clean<00:00:19.710> water<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.990> shall<00:00:31.790> add<00:00:32.790> some

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
clean water and then I shall add some

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.650 
clean water and then I shall add some
colors<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.610> I'll<00:00:35.820> mix<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.420> little

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
colors to that and I'll mix a little

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.220 
colors to that and I'll mix a little
yellow<00:00:36.989> okay<00:00:37.410> there<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.960> don't<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.079> too<00:00:40.290> much

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
yellow okay there I don't want too much

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.520 
yellow okay there I don't want too much
and<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.579> basically<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.700> summer<00:00:45.059> sky<00:00:45.660> we're

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and then basically a summer sky we're

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.740 
and then basically a summer sky we're
going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.820> think<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.780> cobalt<00:00:49.320> blue

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
going to have I think the cobalt blue

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.430 
going to have I think the cobalt blue
and<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.489> should<00:00:53.730> always<00:00:53.969> mix<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.780> might

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and the one should always mix I might

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.250 
and the one should always mix I might
put<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:56.160> more<00:00:56.219> water<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.910> there

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
put a little bit more water in there

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
put a little bit more water in there
because<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.590> always<00:00:58.859> want<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.160> mix<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.609> little

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
because you always want to mix a little

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.930 
because you always want to mix a little
bit<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.680> it's<00:01:01.680> quite<00:01:01.980> strange<00:01:02.309> thing<00:01:02.699> that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
bit more it's quite strange thing that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.050 
bit more it's quite strange thing that
if<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.690> enough<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.860> color<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
if you don't do enough of a color you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
if you don't do enough of a color you
can<00:01:06.090> never<00:01:06.540> repeat<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> color<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
can never repeat that color when you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.460 
can never repeat that color when you
come<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> try<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> same<00:01:09.930> wash<00:01:10.260> again

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
come to try to get the same wash again

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.830 
come to try to get the same wash again
so<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.460> that'll<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:11.970> rather<00:01:12.180> nicely

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so I think that'll do rather nicely

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740 
so I think that'll do rather nicely
I<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> mask<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I want to mask out a little bit of the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.440 
I want to mask out a little bit of the
white<00:01:15.990> sails<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> boats

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
white sails and one or two of the boats

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.230 
white sails and one or two of the boats
to<00:01:18.750> keep<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.200> white<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.520> prevents<00:01:20.939> any

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to keep them white so this prevents any

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
to keep them white so this prevents any
color<00:01:21.570> getting<00:01:21.900> onto<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> paper<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.490> well

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
color getting onto the paper so well

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
color getting onto the paper so well
just<00:01:23.759> very<00:01:24.299> quickly<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:25.770> doesn't<00:01:26.130> take<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
just very quickly it doesn't take very

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.969 
just very quickly it doesn't take very
long<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.630> put<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> little

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.120 

and<00:01:36.979> maybe<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:38.569> vote<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.140> front<00:01:39.439> here<00:01:39.829> and

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
and maybe the vote in the front here and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.910 
and maybe the vote in the front here and
this<00:01:40.969> is<00:01:41.149> all<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.569> give<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:41.899> these<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:42.710> we've

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
this is all to give you these what we've

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.239 
this is all to give you these what we've
been<00:01:43.039> talking<00:01:43.310> about<00:01:43.780> terminal<00:01:44.780> values<00:01:45.439> the

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
been talking about terminal values the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.370 
been talking about terminal values the
white<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.880> then<00:01:47.179> we'll<00:01:47.420> have<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.689> dark<00:01:47.929> trees

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
white and then we'll have the dark trees

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.839 
white and then we'll have the dark trees
and<00:01:49.119> that<00:01:50.119> will<00:01:50.929> help<00:01:51.109> to<00:01:51.439> make<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.189> tanking

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
and that will help to make the tanking

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.059 
and that will help to make the tanking
well<00:01:53.780> there<00:01:53.959> we<00:01:54.049> are<00:01:54.079> we<00:01:54.289> must<00:01:54.469> wash<00:01:54.709> out<00:01:54.920> the

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
well there we are we must wash out the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.760 
well there we are we must wash out the
brush<00:01:55.719> because<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.229> brush<00:01:57.409> will<00:01:57.649> go

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
brush because the the brush will go

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.770 
brush because the the brush will go
quite<00:01:58.579> hard<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.869> it<00:02:00.289> be<00:02:00.439> of<00:02:00.530> no<00:02:00.709> use<00:02:00.740> at<00:02:01.159> all

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
quite hard and it be of no use at all

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.020 
quite hard and it be of no use at all
well<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:02.990> we're<00:02:03.229> ready<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.739> lay<00:02:04.250> in<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:04.579> basic

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
well now we're ready to lay in the basic

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.389 
well now we're ready to lay in the basic
washes<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.229> like<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:06.739> work<00:02:06.950> very<00:02:07.310> much

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
washes and I like to work very much

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.779 
washes and I like to work very much
surfing<00:02:08.269> on<00:02:08.360> these<00:02:08.569> scenes<00:02:08.899> wet<00:02:09.379> into<00:02:09.829> wet<00:02:10.069> so

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
surfing on these scenes wet into wet so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.319 
surfing on these scenes wet into wet so
I<00:02:10.819> take<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.329> large<00:02:11.959> brush<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:13.190> hake<00:02:14.000> brush

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
I take a large brush here a hake brush

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.289 
I take a large brush here a hake brush
and<00:02:14.890> some<00:02:15.890> very<00:02:16.160> clean<00:02:16.400> water<00:02:16.549> must<00:02:16.910> be<00:02:17.000> clean

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
and some very clean water must be clean

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.360 
and some very clean water must be clean
and<00:02:17.569> then<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.349> we<00:02:18.440> start<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.829> process<00:02:19.280> of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and then that we start the process of

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.009 
and then that we start the process of
wetting<00:02:20.349> very<00:02:21.349> quickly<00:02:22.569> over<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.660> whole<00:02:23.840> of

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
wetting very quickly over the whole of

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.979 
wetting very quickly over the whole of
the<00:02:24.109> painting<00:02:24.790> sometimes<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.180> could<00:02:26.359> leave

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
the painting sometimes you could leave

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.229 
the painting sometimes you could leave
out<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.290> little<00:02:27.560> bit<00:02:27.859> of<00:02:27.890> dry<00:02:28.700> there<00:02:29.030> you've<00:02:29.209> got

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
out a little bit of dry there you've got

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.020 
out a little bit of dry there you've got
a<00:02:29.359> bit<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.629> white<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:30.109> the<00:02:30.260> sky<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.849> as<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
a bit of white in the sky and just as a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.170 
a bit of white in the sky and just as a
happening<00:02:32.629> that<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.440> be<00:02:33.590> very<00:02:33.829> attractive

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
happening that can be very attractive

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.420 
happening that can be very attractive
but<00:02:35.180> here<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:35.540> are<00:02:35.569> put<00:02:36.049> plenty<00:02:36.889> of<00:02:36.980> water<00:02:37.160> on

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
but here we are put plenty of water on

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.509 
but here we are put plenty of water on
there

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
there

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.390 
there
in<00:02:40.519> fact<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.569> necessary<00:02:42.910> some<00:02:43.910> very<00:02:44.150> old

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
in fact if necessary some very old

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.370 
in fact if necessary some very old
blotting<00:02:46.400> paper<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:47.840> always<00:02:48.019> double

blotting paper and you can always double

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.740 
blotting paper and you can always double
like<00:02:48.829> that<00:02:49.099> just<00:02:49.340> take<00:02:49.549> out<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:50.359> you<00:02:50.480> think

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
like that just take out if you think

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.229 
like that just take out if you think
it's<00:02:50.900> too<00:02:51.109> wet<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:52.370> let's<00:02:52.639> come<00:02:52.819> back<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
it's too wet now let's come back to the

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's too wet now let's come back to the
painting<00:02:53.690> now<00:02:53.930> then<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:55.120> we'll<00:02:56.120> start<00:02:56.950> I'll

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
painting now then and we'll start I'll

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.909 
painting now then and we'll start I'll
try<00:02:58.340> with<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.609> larger<00:02:59.269> brush<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.780> think<00:03:00.079> into<00:03:00.799> the

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
try with a larger brush I think into the

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.900 
try with a larger brush I think into the
sky<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.180> we'll<00:03:02.329> take<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.630> larger<00:03:03.139> brush<00:03:03.349> here

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
sky and we'll take a larger brush here

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.030 
sky and we'll take a larger brush here
with<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> clean<00:03:05.209> water<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.959> I'll<00:03:06.440> take<00:03:06.709> some<00:03:07.010> of

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
with a clean water and I'll take some of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.759 
with a clean water and I'll take some of
the<00:03:08.200> yellow<00:03:09.200> ochre<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.700> give<00:03:11.030> just<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:12.410> over

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
the yellow ochre and give just just over

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.620 
the yellow ochre and give just just over
the<00:03:12.859> hill<00:03:13.069> there<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.650> one<00:03:15.650> or<00:03:15.769> two<00:03:15.980> streaks<00:03:16.630> in

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
the hill there and one or two streaks in

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.699 
the hill there and one or two streaks in
the<00:03:17.810> sky<00:03:20.109> there<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:21.799> possibly<00:03:22.010> something<00:03:22.730> up

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
the sky there and possibly something up

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.150 
the sky there and possibly something up
there<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.609> not<00:03:25.940> working<00:03:26.930> up<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.500> way<00:03:27.919> like

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
there and not working up that way like

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.390 
there and not working up that way like
that<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.790> then<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.780> want<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.079> get<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.470> reflecting

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
that and then I want to get a reflecting

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.879 
that and then I want to get a reflecting
part<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.090> in<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.079> water<00:03:33.290> as<00:03:33.590> well

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
part of that in the water as well

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.849 
part of that in the water as well
because<00:03:34.849> it<00:03:34.970> will<00:03:35.090> be<00:03:35.239> always<00:03:35.859> reflecting

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
because it will be always reflecting

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.310 
because it will be always reflecting
into<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.280> water<00:03:37.549> so<00:03:38.450> I'll<00:03:38.720> do<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.900> little<00:03:39.049> bit

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
into the water so I'll do a little bit

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.879 
into the water so I'll do a little bit
there<00:03:40.000> wash<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.269> brush<00:03:41.560> I'll<00:03:42.560> take<00:03:42.859> a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
there wash the brush I'll take a

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.589 
there wash the brush I'll take a
slightly<00:03:43.280> larger

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
slightly larger

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.690

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
take the cobalt blue and start to lay in

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.030 
take the cobalt blue and start to lay in

you very rarely see hard lines in the
sky<00:04:23.889> and<00:04:24.889> now<00:04:25.130> we<00:04:25.190> start<00:04:25.669> to<00:04:25.849> let<00:04:26.030> him<00:04:26.560> into<00:04:27.560> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
sky and now we start to let him into the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.999 
sky and now we start to let him into the
water<00:04:28.720> reflecting<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.900> sky<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.560> see<00:04:33.590> how

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
water reflecting the sky and you see how

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.469 
water reflecting the sky and you see how
the<00:04:34.070> blue<00:04:35.169> over<00:04:36.169> that<00:04:36.380> masking<00:04:37.070> fluid<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:38.270> once

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
the blue over that masking fluid so once

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.529 
the blue over that masking fluid so once
you<00:04:38.660> take<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.410> masking<00:04:39.889> fluid<00:04:39.919> off<00:04:40.539> you've

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
you take the masking fluid off you've

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.290 
you take the masking fluid off you've
got<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:42.380> lovely<00:04:42.740> white<00:04:43.070> sail<00:04:43.490> or<00:04:44.120> we'll<00:04:44.270> never

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
got a lovely white sail or we'll never

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.629 
got a lovely white sail or we'll never
get<00:04:44.599> a<00:04:44.660> bit<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:44.930> blue<00:04:45.080> glow<00:04:45.349> through<00:04:45.620> there<00:04:48.639> and

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
get a bit of blue glow through there and

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.820 
get a bit of blue glow through there and
I<00:04:49.759> think<00:04:50.000> maybe<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:50.360> talk<00:04:51.229> about<00:04:51.320> one<00:04:51.650> or<00:04:51.800> two

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
I think maybe just talk about one or two

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.540 
I think maybe just talk about one or two
of<00:04:52.009> those<00:04:52.449> now<00:04:53.449> what<00:04:53.690> I'm<00:04:53.780> going<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:53.990> do<00:04:54.169> now<00:04:54.550> is

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
of those now what I'm going to do now is

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.540 
of those now what I'm going to do now is
to<00:04:55.880> just<00:04:56.389> add<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.690> little<00:04:56.990> bit<00:04:57.169> of<00:04:57.550> French

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
to just add a little bit of French

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.170 
to just add a little bit of French
ultramarine<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.949> give<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.220> as<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.729> go<00:05:01.880> higher

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
ultramarine to give it as you go higher

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.990 
ultramarine to give it as you go higher
in<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.509> sky<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.680> often<00:05:04.220> gets<00:05:04.400> it<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.639> little<00:05:04.699> bit

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
in the sky it often gets it a little bit

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.719 
in the sky it often gets it a little bit
darker<00:05:05.630> so<00:05:05.870> this<00:05:06.560> is<00:05:06.740> only<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:06.979> basic<00:05:07.280> wash

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
darker so this is only a basic wash

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.520 
darker so this is only a basic wash
remember<00:05:08.389> and<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.419> useful<00:05:11.690> though<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.169> do

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
remember and it is useful though to do

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.010 
remember and it is useful though to do
this<00:05:12.770> sort<00:05:13.070> of<00:05:13.220> thing<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.909> then<00:05:14.389> I<00:05:14.539> might<00:05:14.780> add

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
this sort of thing and then I might add

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.939 
this sort of thing and then I might add
a<00:05:15.050> little<00:05:15.259> bit<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:15.800> violet<00:05:16.550> with<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:17.889> just<00:05:18.889> to

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
a little bit of violet with that just to

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.180 
a little bit of violet with that just to
make<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.190> interesting<00:05:19.570> now<00:05:20.680> I'm<00:05:21.680> just<00:05:21.949> going

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.120 
make it interesting now I'm just going
to<00:05:22.750> just<00:05:23.750> do<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.080> little<00:05:24.349> bit<00:05:24.620> on<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.919> edges

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
to just do a little bit on the edges

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.709 
to just do a little bit on the edges
