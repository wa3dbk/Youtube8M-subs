 first of all they wrote the story 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.850
 this is called a scenario and then they have 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:18.550
 does the storyboard the story but in 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.679
 drawing they imagined then draw 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:26.979

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.240
 beautiful textures 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.189
 then they drew all of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.750
 sets from the storyboard then they 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.820
