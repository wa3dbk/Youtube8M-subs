Pinckney and got forming big fields as

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.000 
Pinckney and got forming big fields as
well<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> class<00:00:57.899> yeah<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.859> said

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
well which is a class yeah like we said

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.760 
well which is a class yeah like we said
about<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.250> many<00:00:59.309> horses<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> last<00:00:59.910> mile<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
about so many horses the last mile is a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.439 
about so many horses the last mile is a
concern<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> were<00:01:02.820> looking<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.210> him

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
concern but if you were looking at him

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
concern but if you were looking at him
you'd<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.799> it's<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.640> easily

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you'd be it's just as you can easily

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
you'd be it's just as you can easily
argue<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> might<00:01:06.990> improve<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.290> bit<00:01:07.500> for

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
argue that you might improve a bit for

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.929 
argue that you might improve a bit for
it<00:01:07.710> could<00:01:07.890> easily<00:01:07.979> improve<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.520> far<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it could easily improve so far with the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
it could easily improve so far with the
step<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.479> three<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> quarter<00:01:10.320> miles<00:01:10.530> so

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
step up to three and a quarter miles so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.770 
step up to three and a quarter miles so
I<00:01:10.950> think<00:01:11.250> he's<00:01:11.460> likely<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.000> stay<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.479> not

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
I think he's likely to stay not not

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
I think he's likely to stay not not
certain<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.229> likely<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> stay<00:01:13.920> yeah<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> think

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
certain but likely to stay yeah I think

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.740 
certain but likely to stay yeah I think
that's<00:01:14.760> fair<00:01:14.970> enough<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> we're<00:01:15.509> talking

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that's fair enough and we're talking

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480 
that's fair enough and we're talking
about<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.409> mainly<00:01:16.950> we're<00:01:17.100> talking<00:01:17.310> about

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
about it and mainly we're talking about

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
about it and mainly we're talking about

character<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.009> national<00:02:02.399> yeah<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> think

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
character for the national yeah I think

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
character for the national yeah I think
I<00:02:03.000> would<00:02:03.600> certainly<00:02:03.810> thought<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.290> there

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
I would certainly thought that there

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
I would certainly thought that there
then<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.340> fair<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.700> him<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:05.909> he's<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
then to be fair to him I think he's I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.789 
then to be fair to him I think he's I
think<00:02:06.420> he's<00:02:06.719> tough<00:02:06.990> enough<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.469> me<00:02:07.560> when<00:02:07.740> he

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
think he's tough enough for me when he

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.139 
think he's tough enough for me when he
won<00:02:07.920> describe<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.580> year<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.819> think<00:02:09.030> he's

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
won describe it this year I think he's

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.949 
won describe it this year I think he's
tough<00:02:09.330> enough<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:10.379> I

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
tough enough I have I

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.050 
tough enough I have I
big<00:02:11.950> doubts<00:02:12.219> about<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:12.609> they<00:02:12.700> will<00:02:12.790> get<00:02:12.879> home

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
track and even Newbury I don't think the

Hennessey's<00:03:08.680> always<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.430> big<00:03:10.180> test<00:03:10.419> of<00:03:10.510> summer

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
Hennessey's always a big test of summer

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.050 
Hennessey's always a big test of summer
as<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.989> flat<00:03:11.200> rank<00:03:12.189> is<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.400> factor<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:12.879> it's<00:03:13.030> a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
as a flat rank is a factor but it's a

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.270 
as a flat rank is a factor but it's a
month<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.389> quarter<00:03:13.689> further<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:15.069> would

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
month a quarter further and that would

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.649 
month a quarter further and that would
be<00:03:15.400> my<00:03:15.549> whelming<00:03:15.940> with<00:03:16.030> him<00:03:16.180> he's<00:03:16.329> going<00:03:16.510> we'll

be my whelming with him he's going we'll
get<00:03:16.840> home<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.049> think<00:03:17.139> he<00:03:17.260> jumped<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:17.979> the<00:03:18.069> main

get home I think he jumped in the main

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.949 
get home I think he jumped in the main
wouldn't<00:03:18.790> be<00:03:18.849> surprised<00:03:19.150> if<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.479> a<00:03:19.540> circuit

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
wouldn't be surprised if for a circuit

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.490 
wouldn't be surprised if for a circuit
and<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.139> bit

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
and a bit

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.619 
and a bit
he<00:03:20.769> gives<00:03:21.069> Richard<00:03:21.519> Johnson<00:03:21.909> a<00:03:22.000> really<00:03:22.419> good

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
he gives Richard Johnson a really good

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.390 
he gives Richard Johnson a really good
spin<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.769> they<00:03:23.829> would<00:03:23.949> get<00:03:24.010> four<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> half

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
spin and they would get four and a half

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.259

miles<00:03:24.699> I've<00:03:24.849> got<00:03:24.970> my<00:03:25.060> doubts<00:03:25.180> John<00:03:25.720> you're<00:03:25.930> as

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.210 
miles I've got my doubts John you're as
doubtful<00:03:28.269> about<00:03:28.389> that<00:03:28.689> issue<00:03:28.840> yeah<00:03:29.709> he's<00:03:29.979> got

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
doubtful about that issue yeah he's got

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.129 
doubtful about that issue yeah he's got
a<00:03:30.250> big<00:03:30.819> field<00:03:31.090> handicap<00:03:31.629> form<00:03:31.930> which<00:03:32.049> is

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
a big field handicap form which is

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.140 
a big field handicap form which is
always<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.379> bonus<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.829> think<00:03:32.859> here<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:33.579> he's

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
always a bonus I think here but he's

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.000 
always a bonus I think here but he's
never<00:03:34.299> convinced<00:03:34.870> me<00:03:35.049> as<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.319> horse<00:03:35.709> who's

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
never convinced me as a horse who's

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.110 
never convinced me as a horse who's
gonna<00:03:36.129> appreciate

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
gonna appreciate

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.300 
gonna appreciate
four<00:03:37.299> miles<00:03:37.540> plus<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.319> for<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.859> reason<00:03:38.919> I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
four miles plus so for that reason I

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.559

think I'll leave him alone but like us

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.530 
think I'll leave him alone but like us
he<00:03:41.290> does<00:03:41.470> similar<00:03:42.459> sort<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.090> form<00:03:43.269> he<00:03:43.359> brings

you're looking at room there's a
compressed<00:06:24.500> handicap<00:06:24.950> isn't<00:06:25.130> it<00:06:25.280> these<00:06:25.490> days

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789

the<00:06:26.300> white<00:06:26.630> range<00:06:26.870> is<00:06:27.050> nothing

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
the white range is nothing

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.600 
the white range is nothing
was<00:06:27.720> when<00:06:27.960> we<00:06:28.650> were<00:06:28.740> walking<00:06:28.890> back<00:06:29.220> to<00:06:29.340> olden

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
was when we were walking back to olden

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.100 
was when we were walking back to olden
times<00:06:29.850> there's<00:06:30.090> nothing<00:06:30.330> like<00:06:30.420> that<00:06:30.540> so<00:06:30.900> I

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
times there's nothing like that so I

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.110 
times there's nothing like that so I
think<00:06:31.500> that's<00:06:31.890> that<00:06:32.430> they<00:06:32.550> are<00:06:32.670> I<00:06:32.820> think<00:06:32.940> they

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
think that's that they are I think they

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.020 
think that's that they are I think they
are<00:06:33.330> going<00:06:33.570> to<00:06:33.630> be<00:06:33.750> less<00:06:33.930> likely<00:06:33.960> oh<00:06:34.820> it's<00:06:35.820> such

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
are going to be less likely oh it's such

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.030 
are going to be less likely oh it's such
a<00:06:36.060> valuable<00:06:36.330> race<00:06:36.720> it's<00:06:37.260> a<00:06:37.350> limited<00:06:37.710> handing

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
a valuable race it's a limited handing

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.980 
a valuable race it's a limited handing
up<00:06:38.100> effectively<00:06:38.700> and<00:06:38.850> so<00:06:39.540> you're<00:06:39.780> not<00:06:39.870> gonna

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
up effectively and so you're not gonna

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.210 
up effectively and so you're not gonna
get<00:06:40.110> too<00:06:40.290> many<00:06:40.410> home<00:06:40.560> with<00:06:40.680> one<00:06:40.860> shot<00:06:41.010> yeah<00:06:41.190> I

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
get too many home with one shot yeah I

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.380 
get too many home with one shot yeah I
think<00:06:41.370> that's<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.610> point<00:06:41.820> it's<00:06:42.030> worth<00:06:42.180> more

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
think that's the point it's worth more

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.030 
think that's the point it's worth more
than<00:06:42.540> the<00:06:42.630> gold<00:06:42.810> is<00:06:42.930> a<00:06:42.960> million<00:06:43.260> pound<00:06:43.470> race

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
than the gold is a million pound race

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.110 
than the gold is a million pound race
no<00:06:44.490> it's<00:06:44.730> worth<00:06:44.880> more<00:06:45.090> than<00:06:45.240> the<00:06:45.360> Gold<00:06:45.840> Cup
