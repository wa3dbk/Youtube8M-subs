00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:18.410
 Then I will explain the function of the self-timer 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:23.840
 The drive has a self-timer function. 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:30.189
 This is the same with any camera Here you press the button on the drive and single 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.189
 It is a mode, but this is the second feature of sale 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.010
 It is in this and is a normal self- timer 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.500
 The shutter is released about 10 seconds after the shutter is pressed 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.340
 Right 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 This is it 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.730
 3 seconds for the self-timer and if you say whether will does it mean 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.199
 Here has come out two seconds and it is written, and corresponding government here of two seconds 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.199
 If you do so 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.830
 You can do this much 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.909
 The point to be noted at this time is that when you press the shutter you do not press the shut hard 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.479
 Is important 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.320
 If you press hard, the 2-second self-timer 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.710
 It is by pressing the shutter because is not used in place of Li Leeds 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.380
 If you press hard , the groom may have climbed up in 2 seconds 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.650
 By that remains is this vibration 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.210
 Of its vibration 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.960
 The shutter may disappear before long, so when you release the shutter 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.810
 is not it 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.080
 Turn off the shutter 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.840
 After that, please take your finger off slowly 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.840
 I will try to go a little 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.500
 I'm wearing it in shutter 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.800
 I'm sorry after doing the shutter 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.820
 I 'm releasing my finger and now it's almost on 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.820
 Please look again 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.360
 Almost 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:15.000
 Do not let go of the camera 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.000
 I'm talking about it, but it's an image that still looks like it 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.770
 It is on this basis 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.270
 How to shoot like this 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.620
 Not ill 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.040
 Tie bar 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.380
 Can produce the same effect as release 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.090
 never 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.510
 Be careful not to press hard because the shutter speed is as short as 2 seconds 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.510
 Please
