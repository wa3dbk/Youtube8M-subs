a<00:00:25.050> raid<00:00:25.230> boss<00:00:25.439> um<00:00:26.330> I<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.619> first

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
a raid boss um I this is my first

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.890 
a raid boss um I this is my first
attempt<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.760> didn't<00:00:30.029> go<00:00:30.119> over<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.810> know

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
attempt so it didn't go over you know

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500 
attempt so it didn't go over you know
perfectly<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.640> some<00:00:32.820> reason<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.180> decided

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
perfectly and for some reason I decided

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.660 
perfectly and for some reason I decided
to<00:00:33.690> wear<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> B<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:34.649> play<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.399> wasn't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
to wear a B and then play like I wasn't

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.510 
to wear a B and then play like I wasn't
wearing<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> B<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.680> doesn't<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.219> great

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
wearing the B and so it doesn't go great

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.630 
wearing the B and so it doesn't go great
because<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:40.050> uh<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.100> goes

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
because of that but uh you know it goes

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.740 
because of that but uh you know it goes
alright<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.540> could<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.899> worse<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.410> win<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
alright it could be worse I win as you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
alright it could be worse I win as you
can<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> longbow<00:00:46.469> killed<00:00:46.770> he<00:00:47.160> lived<00:00:47.340> in

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
basileus to get up off of I think we can

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.690 
basileus to get up off of I think we can
go<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> boost<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.980> killed<00:01:23.340> all

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
go down to boost here but I killed all

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.960 
go down to boost here but I killed all
three<00:01:23.850> non<00:01:24.300> Fire<00:01:24.600> Dragons<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.970> longbow

three non Fire Dragons with the longbow

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.870 
three non Fire Dragons with the longbow
and<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:28.110> would<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.710> killed<00:01:29.010> incinerator<00:01:29.700> with

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and I would have killed incinerator with

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.610 
and I would have killed incinerator with
the<00:01:30.000> long<00:01:30.150> ago<00:01:30.360> too<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.810> he<00:01:30.990> wasn't<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.590> know

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
the long ago too if he wasn't you know

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.500 
the long ago too if he wasn't you know
highly<00:01:32.400> resistant<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> fire<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
highly resistant to fire like that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.200 
highly resistant to fire like that
almost<00:01:36.510> died<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:37.580> boost<00:01:38.580> but<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.150> were

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
almost died there to boost but we were

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.840 
almost died there to boost but we were
able<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.660> survive<00:01:40.310> now<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.369> need<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.670> bring

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
able to survive now we need to bring

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.430 
able to survive now we need to bring
incinerator<00:01:42.630> down<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:44.300> should<00:01:45.300> have<00:01:45.360> popped<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
incinerator down I should have popped a

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.530 
incinerator down I should have popped a
critical<00:01:46.950> hit<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.250> incinerator<00:01:47.820> before<00:01:48.240> he

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
critical hit on incinerator before he

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
critical hit on incinerator before he
closed<00:01:48.899> his<00:01:49.080> wings<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.830> good<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.250> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
closed his wings up for good but I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.400 
closed his wings up for good but I
missed<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.300> loose<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:52.500> stacks<00:01:52.800> here

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.960 

we<00:01:58.410> just<00:01:58.620> wait<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.800> incinerator<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> finish

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
we just wait for incinerator to finish

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.230 
we just wait for incinerator to finish
