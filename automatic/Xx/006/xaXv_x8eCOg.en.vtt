00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
from the fact that it did not have the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.500 
from the fact that it did not have the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
additional water facilities but I think

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.430 
additional water facilities but I think

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
that need to be addressed in the Bay

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.420 
that need to be addressed in the Bay
Delta<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:50.410> conversations<00:04:51.160> that<00:04:51.280> I've<00:04:51.400> had

congressional delegation I think it's

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.460 
congressional delegation I think it's
recognized<00:04:55.300> for<00:04:55.570> example<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.260> huge
