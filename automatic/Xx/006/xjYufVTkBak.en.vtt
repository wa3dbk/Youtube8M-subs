it with antifreeze this bolt right here
the<00:00:49.230> problem<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> no<00:00:50.690> mechanics<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the problem is no mechanics know how to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.760 
the problem is no mechanics know how to
do<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> needs<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.180> done<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
do this or that it needs to be done so

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.200 
do this or that it needs to be done so
what<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.699> put<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
what they do is they just put a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.010 
what they do is they just put a
thermostat<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.050> fill<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.870> run<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
thermostat in and fill it up and run it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.420 
thermostat in and fill it up and run it
for<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.260> while<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:02.010> everything's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
for a while and they think everything's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000 
for a while and they think everything's
fine<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.030> even<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.350> put<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> heater<00:01:04.890> on

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
fine but even if they put the heater on

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670 
fine but even if they put the heater on
the<00:01:05.369> problem<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.060> an<00:01:06.240> air<00:01:06.570> pocket<00:01:06.869> tends<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the problem is an air pocket tends to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.880 
the problem is an air pocket tends to
form<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:09.030> water<00:01:09.420> box<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
form in this water box and then the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
form in this water box and then the
thermostat<00:01:11.400> doesn't<00:01:11.760> open<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.180> close

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
thermostat doesn't open and close

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810 
thermostat doesn't open and close
properly<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> cars<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.890> overheat<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
properly and the cars can overheat and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
properly and the cars can overheat and
do<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.090> kinds<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.540> weird<00:01:15.780> things<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.380> drives

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
do all kinds of weird things that drives

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
do all kinds of weird things that drives
people<00:01:16.860> crazy<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> we're<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> explain

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
people crazy so we're going to explain

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.980 
people crazy so we're going to explain
how<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.950> fix<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:20.790> simply<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.960> very

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
how to fix that very simply and very

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.460 
how to fix that very simply and very
easy<00:01:22.970> when<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> new<00:01:24.600> thermostat<00:01:25.259> in

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
easy when you put a new thermostat in

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.910 
easy when you put a new thermostat in
here's<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.580> thermostat<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.450> by<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
here's the thermostat and by the way I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
here's the thermostat and by the way I
suggest<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> live<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> Sun<00:01:30.869> Belt

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
suggest that if you live in the Sun Belt

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
suggest that if you live in the Sun Belt
anywhere<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> gets<00:01:32.130> warm<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.759> lot<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
anywhere where it gets warm a lot of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.310 
anywhere where it gets warm a lot of the
year<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.229> replace<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.159> original<00:01:36.320> 100

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
year that you replace the original 100

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.690 
year that you replace the original 100
well<00:01:37.590> let's<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:38.579> rated<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:40.700> 196

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
well let's see this one was rated at 196

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.969 
well let's see this one was rated at 196
degrees<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.600> actually<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> rating

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
degrees you can actually see the rating

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.940 
degrees you can actually see the rating
thing<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> pallet<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> 180

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
thing on the pallet that you get a 180

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.130 
thing on the pallet that you get a 180
degree<00:01:47.430> thermostat<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.659> cooler

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
degree thermostat because it's cooler

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.460 
degree thermostat because it's cooler
and<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> replace<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.210> put<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> 180<00:01:52.020> degree

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and that you replace it put a 180 degree

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530 
and that you replace it put a 180 degree
in<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:53.549> we're<00:01:53.729> basically<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
in what we're basically going to do is

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
in what we're basically going to do is
these<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:55.619> brackets<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.340> hold<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
these are the two brackets that hold the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.300 
these are the two brackets that hold the
pellet<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.149> place<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.810> we're<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.950> if

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
pellet in place and we're going to if if

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
pellet in place and we're going to if if
you<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.090> those<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.600> being<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.409> nine

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you think of those at being at the nine

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.249 
you think of those at being at the nine
o'clock<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> three<00:02:02.610> o'clock<00:02:02.909> position

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
o'clock and the three o'clock position

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.630 
o'clock and the three o'clock position
we're<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.469> drill<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> hole<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> 12

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
we're going to drill a hole at the 12

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.510 
we're going to drill a hole at the 12
o'clock<00:02:05.880> position<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:07.710> very<00:02:08.009> simple

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
o'clock position and it's very simple

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.180 
o'clock position and it's very simple
you<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.690> basic<00:02:09.899> affordable<00:02:10.709> electric

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you get your basic affordable electric

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.020 
you get your basic affordable electric
drill<00:02:11.489> back<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.360> little<00:02:12.510> bit

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
drill back up a little bit

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.080 
drill back up a little bit
so<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.390> can<00:02:13.600> get<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> long<00:02:14.050> shot<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.640> I'll<00:02:15.790> turn

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
so you can get a long shot and I'll turn

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.370 
so you can get a long shot and I'll turn
this<00:02:16.510> plane<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.850> sit<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.870> you're

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
this plane so you can sit and you're

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.010 
this plane so you can sit and you're
gonna<00:02:20.530> drill<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> hole<00:02:21.220> right<00:02:21.850> here

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.170 

now<00:02:25.590> starting<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.340> whole<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> little

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
now starting the whole is a little

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.680 
now starting the whole is a little
tricky<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.820> once<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.270> get<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.600> started

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
tricky so once you get it started

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.170 
tricky so once you get it started
whoops<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.830> break<00:02:35.100> off<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> drill<00:02:35.730> bit<00:02:35.940> like

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
whoops you break off the drill bit like

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.330 
whoops you break off the drill bit like
I<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.450> did<00:02:36.990> but<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.320> have<00:02:37.620> other<00:02:37.800> drill<00:02:38.100> bits

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
I just did but I have other drill bits

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.580 
I just did but I have other drill bits
so<00:02:38.640> hold<00:02:38.910> on

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
so hold on

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.120 
so hold on
okay<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.650> we're<00:02:41.250> back<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.910> new<00:02:42.120> drill<00:02:42.390> bit

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
okay so we're back with a new drill bit

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.110 
okay so we're back with a new drill bit
slightly<00:02:44.130> smaller<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.670> by<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.820> way<00:02:44.970> this

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
slightly smaller and by the way this

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.850 
slightly smaller and by the way this
hole<00:02:45.360> does<00:02:45.570> not<00:02:45.720> need<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.050> be<00:02:46.110> very<00:02:46.350> big<00:02:46.560> only

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
hole does not need to be very big only

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.210 
hole does not need to be very big only
about<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.160> size<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.640> toothpick<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:49.220> here

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
about the size of a toothpick and here

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.680 
about the size of a toothpick and here
we<00:02:50.340> go<00:02:50.550> hopefully<00:02:50.880> we're<00:02:51.270> going<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.420> finish

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
we go hopefully we're going to finish

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.500 
we go hopefully we're going to finish
without<00:02:52.290> breaking<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:52.950> one

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.190 

there<00:02:59.080> we<00:02:59.230> go<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:02.739> see<00:03:03.480> we've<00:03:04.480> now<00:03:04.510> drilled<00:03:05.079> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
there we go you see we've now drilled a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.550 
there we go you see we've now drilled a
hole<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:06.129> thermostat<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:08.110> see<00:03:08.470> it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
hole in this thermostat you can see it

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.119 
hole in this thermostat you can see it
from<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.860> other<00:03:09.010> side<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:10.680> what<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.860> hole

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
from the other side and what this hole

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.750 
from the other side and what this hole
is<00:03:12.340> going<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.700> do<00:03:12.909> is<00:03:13.299> it's<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.650> allow

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
is going to do is it's going to allow

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.809 
is going to do is it's going to allow
any<00:03:15.760> air<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:16.829> accumulates<00:03:17.829> in<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.159> system

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
any air that accumulates in the system

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.280 
any air that accumulates in the system
behind<00:03:19.659> here<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:21.099> bleed<00:03:21.459> through<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.360> after

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
behind here to bleed through and after

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.080 
behind here to bleed through and after
the<00:03:23.590> air<00:03:23.769> bleeds<00:03:24.159> through<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.730> will<00:03:24.849> pull

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
the air bleeds through it will pull

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.210 
the air bleeds through it will pull
coolant<00:03:25.690> through<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.650> coolant<00:03:27.069> will

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
coolant through and the coolant will

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.550 
coolant through and the coolant will
heat<00:03:27.430> up<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.819> pellet<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.049> it<00:03:29.170> will<00:03:29.319> open

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
heat up this pellet so that it will open

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.610 
heat up this pellet so that it will open
and<00:03:29.859> close<00:03:30.269> consistently<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.540> smoothly<00:03:32.049> like

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
and close consistently and smoothly like

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.869 
and close consistently and smoothly like
it's<00:03:32.890> supposed<00:03:33.340> to

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
it's supposed to

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.289 
it's supposed to
so<00:03:34.980> once<00:03:35.980> you've<00:03:36.159> drilled<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.519> hole<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:37.000> this

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
so once you've drilled the hole in this

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.430 
so once you've drilled the hole in this
little<00:03:37.569> burrs<00:03:37.810> here<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.810> would<00:03:40.810> probably<00:03:41.049> be

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
little burrs here that would probably be

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.899 
little burrs here that would probably be
a<00:03:41.470> good<00:03:41.709> idea<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.190> clean<00:03:42.519> off<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.909> little

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
a good idea to clean off just a little

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.140 
a good idea to clean off just a little
little<00:03:46.409> basic<00:03:47.409> sort<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.769> make<00:03:48.519> sure<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.940> hole

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
little basic sort of make sure the hole

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.580 
little basic sort of make sure the hole
is<00:03:49.530> even<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.709> smooth<00:03:51.069> around<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.670> edges

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
is even and smooth around the edges

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.960 
is even and smooth around the edges
June's<00:03:53.590> afraid<00:03:54.010> she's<00:03:54.250> going<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.459> get<00:03:54.609> metal

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
June's afraid she's going to get metal

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.270 
June's afraid she's going to get metal
shrapnel<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:55.690> her<00:03:55.750> eyes<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.200> she's<00:03:56.440> not<00:03:56.650> it's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
shrapnel in her eyes but she's not it's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.830 
shrapnel in her eyes but she's not it's
not<00:03:57.549> going<00:03:57.879> fast<00:03:58.090> enough<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.569> can<00:03:58.690> turn

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
not going fast enough you can turn

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.009 
not going fast enough you can turn
around<00:03:59.139> now<00:03:59.319> June<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.810> once<00:04:01.810> you've<00:04:01.989> done

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
around now June and once you've done

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.199 
around now June and once you've done
this<00:04:02.530> then<00:04:03.430> what<00:04:03.639> you're<00:04:03.760> going<00:04:03.879> to<00:04:03.970> want<00:04:04.150> to

do is place this thermostat with the
hole<00:04:06.790> at<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.510> 12<00:04:07.989> o'clock<00:04:08.139> position<00:04:09.540> here<00:04:10.540> it

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
hole at the 12 o'clock position here it

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.920 
hole at the 12 o'clock position here it
goes<00:04:11.199> in<00:04:11.440> here<00:04:11.739> in<00:04:11.889> the<00:04:12.040> water<00:04:12.250> box<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:13.000> that

and by the way you should replace these

and by the way you should replace these
about<00:07:28.700> every<00:07:29.000> five<00:07:29.390> or<00:07:29.420> ten<00:07:29.780> years<00:07:30.050> because

about every five or ten years because

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.740 
about every five or ten years because

they sometimes stick closed and when
they<00:07:32.840> do<00:07:32.900> that<00:07:33.050> makes<00:07:33.440> a<00:07:33.560> real<00:07:33.770> nightmare<00:07:34.040> or

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
they do that makes a real nightmare or

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.940 
they do that makes a real nightmare or
if<00:07:34.970> they<00:07:35.090> stick<00:07:35.360> open<00:07:35.840> your<00:07:36.350> engine's<00:07:36.740> going

if they stick open your engine's going

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.010 
if they stick open your engine's going
to<00:07:37.010> run<00:07:37.190> too<00:07:37.400> cool<00:07:37.760> it's<00:07:38.450> going<00:07:38.630> to<00:07:38.720> affect

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 
to run too cool it's going to affect

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.810 
to run too cool it's going to affect
your<00:07:39.140> gas<00:07:39.410> mileage<00:07:39.740> because<00:07:40.370> it<00:07:40.520> will<00:07:40.610> run

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820 
your gas mileage because it will run

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.060 
your gas mileage because it will run
rich<00:07:41.120> it'll<00:07:41.450> think<00:07:41.630> like<00:07:41.870> it's<00:07:42.200> still<00:07:42.470> cold<00:07:42.800> so

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.070 
rich it'll think like it's still cold so

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.200 
rich it'll think like it's still cold so
it<00:07:43.160> adds<00:07:43.370> extra<00:07:43.610> fuel<00:07:44.350> and<00:07:45.350> also<00:07:46.220> it<00:07:46.910> doesn't

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.210 
it adds extra fuel and also it doesn't

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.270 
it adds extra fuel and also it doesn't
burn<00:07:47.570> off<00:07:47.810> the<00:07:48.020> impurities<00:07:48.650> out<00:07:48.800> of<00:07:48.860> the<00:07:49.100> oil

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 
burn off the impurities out of the oil

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.250 
burn off the impurities out of the oil
so<00:07:49.880> it's<00:07:50.000> very<00:07:50.150> important<00:07:50.660> for<00:07:50.690> your<00:07:50.900> engine

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:51.260 
so it's very important for your engine

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.840 
so it's very important for your engine
to<00:07:51.380> operate<00:07:51.470> at<00:07:51.920> about<00:07:52.190> a<00:07:52.220> hundred<00:07:52.400> to<00:07:52.670> 80

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:52.850 
to operate at about a hundred to 80

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.330 
to operate at about a hundred to 80
degrees<00:07:53.360> or<00:07:53.930> a<00:07:53.990> little<00:07:54.440> higher<00:07:54.680> if<00:07:55.040> you're<00:07:55.220> in
