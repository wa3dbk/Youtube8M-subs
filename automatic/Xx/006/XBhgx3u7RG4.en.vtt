a few in the ends in the frying pan you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.210 
a few in the ends in the frying pan you
don't<00:02:51.900> want<00:02:52.050> too<00:02:52.170> many<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.590> there<00:02:52.800> because

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
don't want too many in there because

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.040 
don't want too many in there because
they<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.459> they<00:02:53.970> will<00:02:54.180> stick<00:02:54.450> together<00:02:54.630> so

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
they do they will stick together so

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.070 
they do they will stick together so
you'll<00:02:55.200> need<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.590> separate<00:02:56.070> them<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.720> as<00:02:57.900> you

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
you'll need to separate them so as you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.260 
you'll need to separate them so as you
put<00:02:58.260> another<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.610> then<00:02:59.850> increase

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
put another one in and then increase

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.490 
put another one in and then increase
that<00:03:00.660> for<00:03:01.380> your<00:03:01.530> pour<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.920> there<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:03.500> just

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
that for your pour in there just just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
that for your pour in there just just
separate<00:03:04.980> them<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.000> egg<00:03:06.180> will

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
separate them so because the egg will

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.170 
separate them so because the egg will
kind<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.170> tend<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.680> catch<00:03:08.459> each<00:03:08.730> other<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
kind of tend to catch each other and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.050 
kind of tend to catch each other and
stick<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.920> want<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.220> get<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.490> golden<00:03:11.970> a
