Hello &amp; Welcome to Archana's Rasoi!

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.296
Today I am going to show you how-to make a mithai (sweets)

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:13.815
I have got a request, asking if the mithais we get 
 in shops, can they be made at home? 

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:19.486
Yes we can! The base that is required for making most mithais is what I will show you'll today. The sweet I am going to show you how-to make is called Kalakandh. 

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:25.246
This sweet has many variations which I will tell you'll through the episode, but for that you'll have to keep watching Archana's Rasoi!

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:31.255
Let's have a look at the ingredients required for making 1/2kg Kalakand.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:40.206
1/4l milk, 150g sugar, 1/2kg mawa, chopped pistachios for garnish and 1/2 tsp cardamom powder.    

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.165
Now I am going to start making the sweet.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:46.766
My first step is to boil the milk and sugar together. 

00:00:50.163 --> 00:01:01.322
In a vessel, pour the milk and add 150g sugar. I will boil this till they reduce by almost half of the original. 

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:05.725
I will boil this till this mixture condenses and
once it does, I will add the mawa. 

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:07.589
Till then let's concentrate on getting the milk and sugar to the right consistency.

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:29.789
Now the milk and sugar have condensed, I am adding 1/2kg mawa.  

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.868
Mix the mawa well with the reduced milk and sugar.

00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:45.390
This mixture also has to condense a bit, to a point where, if you take a bit of the mixture and it turns into a ball, it is considered ready. 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.830
However, the mixture doesn't have to become very thick either because this sweet dish takes an hour to set. 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:58.080
So mix this well and I have a something to share with you'll here.

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:02.030
In this sweet dish I have used mawa. Some call it mawa, some call it khawa.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.320
There are 3 types of mawa. 

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:16.700
1 plain mawa, 2 hariyal khawa which is used to make gulab jamuns and the 3 being mitha mawa which is used to make a sweet called Bangdi Peda.   

00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:20.470
So what I have made here is a base for most sweets. 

00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:27.520
The one I am making here is a simple one but if you want to make strawberry barfi then add strawberry colour and essence. 

00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:36.060
If you want to make mango barfi then add mango essence and for chocolate-add cocoa powder to half the mixture and keep the other half as is. 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:45.700
Then place one layer on top of the other and top it with chandicha virk (sliver edible paper), till then let's reduce the milk, sugar and mawa. 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.060
You do not have to reduce the mixture till it turns 
 into a solid mass, it should remain semi-liquid.  

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.340
Now the mixture has become slightly thick, not too thin either.  

00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.630
Now I am going to tell you how-to know when the mixture is ready.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:16.030
Before that, I am adding 1/2 tsp cardamom powder as per taste. Mix it well.  

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.430
This is ready, I am turning off the gas. 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:39.270
Take a bit of the mixture from the side of the vessel, it will be slightly hot. If turns into a soft mass, it is ready. I am turning off the gas.   

00:03:39.787 --> 00:04:01.600
Now I will pour the mixture in a tray to set it, 
spread it evenly. Garnish it with some chopped pistas. 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:13.390
This sweet needs to be cooled for 1-2 hours 
 in order to get the pieces.  

00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:27.230
However, if you want this to be exactly like the sweet you get in shops, then it needs to be set for 5-6 hours. Don't rush this process. So let's wait for an hour now!   

00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:33.990
Kalakandh is ready. I am cutting them into pieces. 

00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:57.790
The sweet dish is ready. I am sure that you'll have subscribed to India Food Network after looking at this sweet.  

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:11.470
If you'll have some good recipes, do send in your feedback which is why I want to thank all of your for writing into me and keep watching Archana's Rasoi!
