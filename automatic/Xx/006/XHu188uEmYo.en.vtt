00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 point for that question I ask myself 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.059
 I want the hard topic days ago the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.700
 president publicly said he was leaving 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.549
 to sit down with the winning mayors and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.109
 reelectos I ask myself a question 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 mature president what is the problem 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.150
 that the maracaibo police have 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.570
 until today it is quartered 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.789
 while he sees with amazement how the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.349
 police officers of the other municipalities and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 of the state walk the streets 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.480
 mature president I make a call 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 that feels to govern with everyone 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.730
 as you say it publicly I 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.460
 I just want to build bridges to 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.350
 that we work the three levels of 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.780
 joint way so that we have 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 answer for that town that is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.030
 pronounced on Sunday look here there's no 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.440
 neither triumphant nor vanquished glory 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.469
 to losers and honor forgiveness put to 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.140
 the losers and glory to the winners 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.269
 here there is no triumphalism here we do not win 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.880
 nor did we lose here there is a venezuela 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.220
 divided in two that what you want to see is 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.500
 to its leaders to respond to 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.960
 town that is the country that we want the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.840
 country of inclusion the country of the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.509
 opportunity the country of the response to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 Venezuelans I step of 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.789
 in front of the president so that really 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.830
 give me some explanation what is the 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.979
 reason why our police up 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.840
 this moment but that has been seen 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.570
 why guarded while 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.330

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.240
 of bar as the other police do not 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.369
 I understand fear the question and then I 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 I take in his words president we have 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.539

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.009

 made public so far in the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.100
 City Hall has not reached any 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.870
 invitation but I repeat again 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.960
 until now he has sheltered 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.540
 our police are not doing it 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.640
