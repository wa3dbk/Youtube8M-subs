I<00:03:54.420> wanted<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.750> book<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.140> then<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.070> a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
I wanted this book and then this is a

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.630 
I wanted this book and then this is a
more<00:03:56.400> expensive<00:03:56.970> book<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:58.010> I'd<00:03:59.010> say<00:03:59.340> these<00:03:59.580> are

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
more expensive book so I'd say these are

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.570 
more expensive book so I'd say these are
a<00:04:00.299> good<00:04:00.900> thirty<00:04:01.380> percent<00:04:01.799> maybe<00:04:02.280> probably

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
a good thirty percent maybe probably

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.970 
a good thirty percent maybe probably
more<00:04:02.850> about<00:04:03.060> fifty<00:04:03.330> percent<00:04:03.360> less<00:04:04.049> than<00:04:04.830> they

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
more about fifty percent less than they

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.949 
more about fifty percent less than they
would<00:04:05.130> be<00:04:05.340> if<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.880> actually<00:04:06.090> bought<00:04:06.510> them<00:04:06.750> at
