00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
move them away while my moment of

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.890 
move them away while my moment of
firemen<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.170> noticed<00:05:07.470> that<00:05:07.620> my<00:05:08.070> opponent<00:05:08.310> had

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
firemen I noticed that my opponent had

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.660 
firemen I noticed that my opponent had
ordered<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.050> attack<00:05:10.110> on<00:05:10.470> me<00:05:10.620> he'd<00:05:11.460> just

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
ordered the attack on me he'd just

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.870 
ordered the attack on me he'd just
ordered<00:05:11.970> them<00:05:12.090> into<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.420> fort<00:05:13.410> so<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:14.250> moved

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
ordered them into the fort so I moved

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.400 
ordered them into the fort so I moved
out<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.120> way<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.570> just<00:05:15.750> let<00:05:15.900> my<00:05:16.020> bows<00:05:16.200> have

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
out the way and I just let my bows have

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.190 
out the way and I just let my bows have
a<00:05:16.470> quick<00:05:16.650> errand<00:05:16.980> first<00:05:17.270> try<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.390> weaken<00:05:18.690> them

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
a quick errand first try and weaken them

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.530 
a quick errand first try and weaken them
as<00:05:19.320> much<00:05:19.500> as<00:05:19.650> possible<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:20.640> think<00:05:21.150> his<00:05:21.240> plan<00:05:21.360> was

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
as much as possible I think his plan was

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.560 
as much as possible I think his plan was
to<00:05:21.600> try<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:21.840> take<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.460> gate<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:24.120> it's<00:05:24.270> general

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
to try and take the gate so it's general

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:34.820 
to try and take the gate so it's general
again<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.610> think<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.880> was<00:05:27.000> his<00:05:27.120> main<00:05:27.330> plan

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.220 

so<00:05:35.460> now<00:05:35.700> I'm<00:05:35.820> going<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:36.000> order<00:05:36.030> my<00:05:36.330> son<00:05:37.080> way

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
so now I'm going to order my son way

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.439 
so now I'm going to order my son way
into<00:05:37.470> attack

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.839 

and<00:05:41.990> hopefully<00:05:42.259> it<00:05:43.069> will<00:05:43.189> be<00:05:43.400> over<00:05:43.520> pretty

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
and hopefully it will be over pretty

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.149 
and hopefully it will be over pretty
quickly<00:05:46.090> whereas<00:05:47.090> am<00:05:47.360> not<00:05:48.009> particularly<00:05:49.009> good

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
quickly whereas am not particularly good

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.769 
quickly whereas am not particularly good
at<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.490> game<00:05:49.520> yet<00:05:49.909> by<00:05:50.449> any<00:05:50.479> means<00:05:52.779> hopefully

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
at the game yet by any means hopefully

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.510 
at the game yet by any means hopefully
I'll<00:05:53.900> get<00:05:54.080> a<00:05:54.139> lot<00:05:54.439> better<00:05:54.589> as<00:05:55.009> the<00:05:55.159> time<00:05:55.189> goes

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
I'll get a lot better as the time goes

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.769 
I'll get a lot better as the time goes
on<00:06:00.639> so<00:06:01.639> it's<00:06:01.879> just<00:06:01.969> picked<00:06:02.240> Maile<00:06:02.509> battle

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:02.779 
on so it's just picked Maile battle

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.939 
on so it's just picked Maile battle
going<00:06:02.930> on<00:06:03.139> there<00:06:04.839> so<00:06:05.839> I'm<00:06:06.080> good<00:06:06.259> keep<00:06:06.650> trying

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
going on there so I'm good keep trying

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.409 
going on there so I'm good keep trying
all<00:06:07.069> the<00:06:07.159> weird<00:06:07.370> kind<00:06:07.849> of<00:06:07.909> different<00:06:08.270> stuff

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
all the weird kind of different stuff

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.860 
all the weird kind of different stuff
I'd<00:06:08.659> not<00:06:08.930> really<00:06:10.419> experienced<00:06:11.419> enough<00:06:11.629> yet<00:06:11.839> to

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
I'd not really experienced enough yet to

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.320 
I'd not really experienced enough yet to
