00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.039 
foundation so I guess I will start with
less<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.039> work<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.340> way<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.549> its<00:01:35.939> 0.98<00:01:36.689> fluid

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

normally do my foundation the texture is

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.190 
normally do my foundation the texture is
really<00:02:06.899> light

really light

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.529 
really light
it<00:02:08.349> just<00:02:08.860> might<00:02:09.039> be<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.250> very<00:02:09.580> light<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.360> medium

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
it just might be a very light to medium

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.540

coverage<00:02:10.800> foundation<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.250> I'm<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:12.459> gonna

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
coverage foundation so I'm just gonna

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.600 
coverage foundation so I'm just gonna
take<00:02:12.819> my<00:02:12.970> Beauty<00:02:13.239> Blender<00:02:13.269> it<00:02:14.550> blends<00:02:15.550> very

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
take my Beauty Blender it blends very

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.509 
take my Beauty Blender it blends very
nicely<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.870> Beauty<00:02:17.140> Blender<00:02:17.519> right

nicely with the Beauty Blender right
away<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.730> feel<00:02:19.000> like<00:02:19.300> it's<00:02:20.260> probably<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.920> light

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
away I feel like it's probably a light

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.699 
away I feel like it's probably a light
coverage<00:02:21.730> blending<00:02:22.269> really<00:02:22.390> easily<00:02:22.989> doesn't

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
coverage blending really easily doesn't

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.280 
coverage blending really easily doesn't
seem<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:24.069> it's<00:02:24.250> drying<00:02:24.550> fast<00:02:24.970> at<00:02:25.180> all<00:02:25.290> but

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
seem like it's drying fast at all but

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.970 
seem like it's drying fast at all but
for<00:02:26.560> sure<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.040> coverage<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.819> not<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:29.830> I'm

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
for sure the coverage is not what I'm

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.580 
for sure the coverage is not what I'm
normally<00:02:30.430> used<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.700> I'd<00:02:30.910> like<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.269> use<00:02:31.590> almost

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
normally used to I'd like to use almost

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.229 
normally used to I'd like to use almost
like<00:02:32.709> full<00:02:32.980> coverage<00:02:33.400> or<00:02:33.640> at<00:02:33.790> least<00:02:34.000> medium

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
like full coverage or at least medium

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.570 
like full coverage or at least medium
coverage<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.680> might<00:02:35.860> be<00:02:36.040> one<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.459> those

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
coverage so this might be one of those

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.280 
coverage so this might be one of those
foundations<00:02:37.090> where<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.540> want<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.810> wear<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
like a medium coverage but for example

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.050

complaint<00:07:20.180> I<00:07:20.270> have<00:07:20.480> is<00:07:20.510> that<00:07:20.840> my<00:07:21.320> pimple<00:07:21.920> and

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480 
complaint I have is that my pimple and

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
my nose area and my chin right here

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.160 
my nose area and my chin right here
there<00:07:26.000> was<00:07:26.090> another<00:07:26.120> pimple<00:07:26.600> right<00:07:26.720> here<00:07:26.900> and

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
there was another pimple right here and

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.770 
there was another pimple right here and
it's<00:07:27.770> just<00:07:27.860> obviously<00:07:28.460> really<00:07:28.760> showy<00:07:29.150> overall

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
it's just obviously really showy overall

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.390 
it's just obviously really showy overall
I<00:07:29.810> would<00:07:29.990> say<00:07:30.140> I<00:07:30.620> would<00:07:30.740> give<00:07:30.860> it<00:07:30.980> an<00:07:31.070> 8<00:07:31.100> out<00:07:31.370> of

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
I would say I would give it an 8 out of

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.880 
I would say I would give it an 8 out of
10<00:07:31.520> if<00:07:32.000> you<00:07:32.570> are<00:07:32.720> someone<00:07:33.110> who<00:07:33.140> doesn't<00:07:33.500> need<00:07:33.830> a

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:33.890 
10 if you are someone who doesn't need a

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.200 
10 if you are someone who doesn't need a
lot<00:07:34.100> of<00:07:34.250> coverage<00:07:34.520> then<00:07:34.790> I<00:07:34.820> think<00:07:35.090> this

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.210 
lot of coverage then I think this

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.580 
lot of coverage then I think this
foundation<00:07:35.690> would<00:07:35.810> be<00:07:35.960> perfect<00:07:36.320> for<00:07:36.440> you<00:07:36.560> I

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590 
foundation would be perfect for you I

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.000 
foundation would be perfect for you I
really<00:07:36.950> like<00:07:37.130> it<00:07:37.310> the<00:07:37.880> powder<00:07:38.530> didn't<00:07:39.530> seem<00:07:39.830> to

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
really like it the powder didn't seem to

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.950 
really like it the powder didn't seem to
mattify<00:07:40.400> me<00:07:40.610> throughout<00:07:40.850> all<00:07:41.120> day<00:07:41.450> powder

mattify me throughout all day powder

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.990 
mattify me throughout all day powder
didn't<00:07:42.380> seem<00:07:42.530> to<00:07:42.710> really<00:07:42.950> absorb<00:07:43.220> my<00:07:43.430> oil<00:07:43.640> a

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 
didn't seem to really absorb my oil a

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.880 
didn't seem to really absorb my oil a
lot<00:07:44.180> throughout<00:07:44.510> the<00:07:44.660> day<00:07:44.840> I<00:07:45.050> started<00:07:45.650> feeling
