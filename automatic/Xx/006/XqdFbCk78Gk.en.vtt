00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
can tell from those it's good thing none

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.510 
can tell from those it's good thing none
of<00:00:51.940> those<00:00:52.059> work<00:00:54.989> today

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
of those work today

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.849 
of those work today
yeah<00:00:57.520> though<00:00:57.730> i<00:00:57.760> purrs<00:00:58.059> that<00:00:58.090> can<00:00:58.829> shut<00:00:59.829> off

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
yeah though i purrs that can shut off

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:09.690 
yeah though i purrs that can shut off
see<00:01:00.760> if<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:00.940> just<00:01:01.090> cranks<00:01:01.329> over<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.400> that

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
see if it just cranks over and that

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.190 
see if it just cranks over and that
would<00:01:09.850> be<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.000> connection<00:01:10.330> because<00:01:10.840> it's<00:01:11.020> just

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
would be a connection because it's just

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.460 
would be a connection because it's just
clicking<00:01:11.440> what<00:01:12.400> I've<00:01:12.520> done<00:01:12.729> here<00:01:13.200> I've<00:01:14.200> just

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
clicking what I've done here I've just

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.249 
clicking what I've done here I've just
took<00:01:14.650> in<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.950> flathead<00:01:15.939> screwdriver<00:01:16.259> just

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
took in a flathead screwdriver just

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.890 
took in a flathead screwdriver just
pounded<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:19.420> makes<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.720> tighter

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
pounded it in that makes the tighter

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.770 
pounded it in that makes the tighter
connection<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.390> doesn't<00:01:22.659> work

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
connection and if that doesn't work

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.880 
connection and if that doesn't work
it'll<00:01:23.380> be<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:23.650> one<00:01:23.970> let's<00:01:24.970> give<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.270> try<00:01:25.420> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it'll be this one let's give it a try I

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.720 
feed that into there like that and then
it<00:03:59.790> should<00:04:00.000> work<00:04:00.210> so<00:04:01.010> i'll<00:04:02.010> probably<00:04:02.310> have<00:04:02.610> it

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730
