 a cordial greeting to all of you from 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 your friendly dyslexic whatever 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.950
 neighborhood director directs her because she 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.429
 you don't know alliances now 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.490
 you will know 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.099
 this is the 412 attempt to do this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 blog because the phone is up first 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.699
 the receiver and nobody answers 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.150
 then you get a message then it arrives 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.590
 people in the house then I do 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.800
 blue skating to say warm 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.279
 welcome first said caorence ho 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.410
 made sentences the sentences of sentences and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.290
 the director laughs because they have already been 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.020
 several attempts to make this blog 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.739
 can not make it more helped by tele a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.079
 respirator 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.050
 I have now put the phone 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.210
 silent I removed the landline and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.969
 so we're okay and try to 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.450
 speak then three arguments of this 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.360
 blog 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 quickly and painlessly hopefully because if not 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.910
 I can if I can't do it either 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.539
 this time I split something first 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.969
 thank you 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.180
 thanks family format for the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.170
 warm welcome 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.439
 the license fee reserved for the video on 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.360
 blankets because you really know it 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 already said it was a video on which 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.909
 emotionally I invested a lot of which 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.530
 I had a thousand anxieties, not so many fears 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 on the result of the video because 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.420
 honestly the video as come likes it 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 video I like one of my videos 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 that I like one of my few videos 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.720
 which I like but I was more afraid of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.450
 other to the point of view of the feedback 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 in the sense that dario had made the video 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.079
 on blanket week before it was a video 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.000
 short synthetic compared to my videos 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.369
 a little bit more spoken more 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.210
 chatted is not a topic 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.310
 as popular as it could be 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.130
 spider man and so I had a thousand anxieties 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.680
 a thousand fears instead from the point of view 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.350
 views but above all from 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.290
 point of view of the comments he had 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.390
 a beautiful welcome of comments 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.600
 beautiful of beautiful words in the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.209
 I hope the video really compares 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.770
 so many of you have brought so many of you 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.900
 dario to read blanc 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.140
 because I'm really glad I am 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.700
 happy with this result I 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.040
 have been told of beautiful things and on a 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.350
 made of being the beautiful youtube ie 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.640
 of youtube youtube with still the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.160
 passion I do not have the presumption of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.920
 say i am the passionate youtube and i 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.660
 others don't do mine as it does 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.880
 dario as others see it 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.160
 that anyway ours is appreciated by 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.709
 you and it's really really important 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.959
 there will still be a little surprise 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.190
 concerning the blanket video 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.800
 you heard it in the background 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.200
 you will feel better today ie bones evening o 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.080
 Monday because not in the span of time that 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.740
 it's between tonight and Monday because I'm leaving 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.340
 I leave tonight for Milan and then leave 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.320
 the next day for lucca in fact as vi 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.489
 I had already said how beautiful this thing is 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.950
 I speak local a1 the adula between us anyway 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.030
 we would be at lucca I will direct and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.959
 so many beautiful people who flee however 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.390
 I 'm not on Friday and Sunday 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.780
 brought behind the mad hulking of drawings 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.239
 as I did for Mantua or Naples 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.550
 I don't know maybe I ended up here initial 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.200
 scribbling something I bring because 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.820
 a little more complicated than that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.390
 compared to these other two fairs that I have 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.090
 lived 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.120
 that is really very complicated me 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.700
 I'm getting ready to make you understand the networks 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.709
 the external ones for the cell phone the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.299
 External mobile phone charger 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.340
 that so much I know that the cell phone does not 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.260
 it will never take to make you understand how 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.910
 we are ready we have the new one here 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.310
 arrived anyway then I saw that 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.410
 many made the rally event 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.190
 of their fans of youtuber counter fans 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.530
 presumed such 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.680
 people who have followed this way 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.510
 are almost more unofficial events than 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.040
 the official ones 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.780
 then I put myself there are no 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.780
 as much as I like very much 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.030
 see you and then you will see me on the street 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.650
 Friday Saturday and Sunday Sunday only 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.910
 half a day because then we have to 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.780
 go back home 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.390
 however there is so if you stop it is not 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.440
 what good escaped board there is almost never 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:46.730

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.930

 long ago also in a news that has 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.470

 come first if you come at 1pm and if 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.430

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.000
 authors however illuminate better however 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:07.500

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.910
 so informative look at the maps if 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.830
 the other new maybe a place and fair sail 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.260
 we are going to conclude instead with the third 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.310
 topic that you remember when I have 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.750
 made that blog where I said then i 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.700
 The channel's programs will be like this 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.190
 program will then be this Monday 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.410
 open air of this mar 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.210
 as you can see and at the end of the blog 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.360
 I did the paraculo of ceo 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.700
 sorry but I'm not sure if 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.780
 I can stay there and here I can't 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:44.100
 being tried behind is difficult 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.530
 videos are also not very good type 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.830
 from the point of view of and my anxiety e 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.230
 so put that in formaldehyde 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.420
 just the palimpsest there a schedule 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.720
 a little bit more relaxing a 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.610
 little more thoughtful we will do it 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.410
 together give me advice what 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.370
 you would like to see first and of what 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.240
 you would like to see later 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.890
 and we arrive a square and therefore also 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.230
 any live I talked about 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.380

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.570
 they will come out we will move to Monday or 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:20.320
 however from the week from November in 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:23.890
 then other things I didn't want to tell you 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.120
 most importantly lucca on Saturday Friday 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.370
