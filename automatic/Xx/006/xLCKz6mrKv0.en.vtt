10<00:00:10.260> recharging<00:00:10.860> project<00:00:12.350> this<00:00:13.350> one<00:00:14.840> this<00:00:15.840> one

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
10 recharging project this one this one

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
10 recharging project this one this one
I<00:00:16.080> did<00:00:16.320> after<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.949> very<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.970> I'd

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I did after the very first one that I'd

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.670 
I did after the very first one that I'd
built<00:00:18.420> which<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.020> green<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.470> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
built which is the green one that you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.790 
built which is the green one that you
seen<00:00:19.950> in<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> other<00:00:20.400> video<00:00:21.290> after<00:00:22.290> I<00:00:22.320> had<00:00:22.560> so

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
seen in the other video after I had so

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.260 
seen in the other video after I had so
much<00:00:22.950> trouble<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.610> one<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.000> I

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
much trouble with this one and I

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.210 
much trouble with this one and I
eventually<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.020> initially<00:00:25.860> started<00:00:25.950> with

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
eventually I initially started with

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
eventually I initially started with
triple<00:00:26.700> A's<00:00:26.850> in<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:27.600> I<00:00:27.630> went<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
triple A's in this one then I went to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.270 
triple A's in this one then I went to
the<00:00:28.080> 9-volt<00:00:28.440> that<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.800> saw<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.160> other

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
the 9-volt that you saw in the other

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.229 
the 9-volt that you saw in the other
video<00:00:29.690> but<00:00:31.399> after<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> made<00:00:32.699> this<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
video but after I made this one with the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.119 
video but after I made this one with the
triple<00:00:33.629> A's<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.050> did<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.500> working<00:00:34.800> for

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
triple A's and I did have it working for

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.160 
triple A's and I did have it working for
a<00:00:35.190> while<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.670> triple<00:00:35.999> A's<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.809> thing<00:00:37.019> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
a while to triple A's but the thing I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.540 
a while to triple A's but the thing I
built<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.589> hold<00:00:37.769> the<00:00:37.829> batteries<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> just

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
built to hold the batteries and just

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
built to hold the batteries and just
didn't<00:00:38.819> work<00:00:38.999> out<00:00:39.179> that<00:00:39.239> well<00:00:39.569> so<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.379> thought

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
didn't work out that well so I thought

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.319 
didn't work out that well so I thought
well<00:00:40.859> why<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.249> try<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.609> with<00:00:41.879> double<00:00:42.210> A's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
well why not try it with double A's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.919 
well why not try it with double A's
because<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.499> you<00:00:43.649> open<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.979> can<00:00:44.929> double

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
because if you if you open a can double

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.110 
because if you if you open a can double
A's<00:00:46.079> will<00:00:46.350> almost<00:00:46.530> fit<00:00:46.949> just<00:00:47.219> perfectly<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
A's will almost fit just perfectly in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.950 
A's will almost fit just perfectly in
there<00:00:48.769> so<00:00:49.769> what<00:00:49.949> I<00:00:50.010> did<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.579> took<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.749> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
there so what I did is I took on if you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.299 
there so what I did is I took on if you
can<00:00:52.109> see<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> real<00:00:52.559> well<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.889> lights<00:00:53.100> not

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
can see it real well and lights not

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.789 
can see it real well and lights not
great<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.510> here<00:00:54.569> I<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.229> PC

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
great in here but right here I have PC

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.129 
great in here but right here I have PC
board<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:56.999> had<00:00:57.210> cut<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:58.339> and<00:01:00.019> made<00:01:01.019> little

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:01.139 
board that I had cut out and made little

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:02.930 
board that I had cut out and made little
contacts<00:01:01.709> on<00:01:01.889> there<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.249> soldered<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.699> some

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
contacts on there and soldered in some

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
contacts on there and soldered in some
Springs<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.420> whatnot<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.320> make<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> good

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
Springs and whatnot to to make a good

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.319 
Springs and whatnot to to make a good
contact<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.370> all<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.590> five<00:01:07.590> double<00:01:08.009> A's

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
contact so all I have is five double A's

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.929 
contact so all I have is five double A's
in<00:01:09.329> series<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> then<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.229> feed<00:01:10.700> my<00:01:11.700> little

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in series and then they feed my little

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.480 
in series and then they feed my little
circuit<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.469> which<00:01:13.469> is<00:01:13.649> the<00:01:13.799> same<00:01:14.009> six<00:01:14.310> volt

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
circuit here which is the same six volt

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
circuit here which is the same six volt
regulators<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> other<00:01:15.329> one<00:01:15.509> I've<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.840> two

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
regulators the other one I've got two

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.230 
regulators the other one I've got two
caps<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.399> case<00:01:17.579> is<00:01:17.789> the<00:01:17.909> nerd<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
caps and it in this case is the nerd I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.800 
caps and it in this case is the nerd I
own<00:01:18.539> the<00:01:18.659> output<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> case<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.810> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
own the output just in case and then you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.160 
own the output just in case and then you
know<00:01:21.899> I've<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.170> USB<00:01:23.420> down<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> then

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
know I've got USB down there and then

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
know I've got USB down there and then
here's<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.530> switch<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.039> it's<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
here's your switch so it's this one is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.599 
here's your switch so it's this one is
really<00:01:27.240> crammed<00:01:27.539> in<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.250> as<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.490> see

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
really crammed in there as you can see

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:30.800 
really crammed in there as you can see
I've<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:29.969> my<00:01:30.030> circuit<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
I've got my circuit just kind of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
I've got my circuit just kind of
floating<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.649> there's<00:01:31.829> there's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
floating there because there's there's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.020 
floating there because there's there's
not<00:01:32.399> really<00:01:32.609> room<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.179> anywhere<00:01:33.509> else

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
not really room for it anywhere else

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
not really room for it anywhere else
like<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.359> original<00:01:37.109> triple-a<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.039> this<00:01:38.250> one

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
like the original triple-a one this one

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.090 
like the original triple-a one this one
is<00:01:38.670> problematic<00:01:39.770> because<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.490> did<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.840> own

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
is problematic because I did make my own

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
is problematic because I did make my own
you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.189> battery<00:01:45.030> contacts<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> whatnot

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you know battery contacts and whatnot

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
you know battery contacts and whatnot
and<00:01:46.670> no<00:01:48.649> Leonardo<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.070> comes<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and no Leonardo when it comes to to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.340 
and no Leonardo when it comes to to
making<00:01:51.090> stuff<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.749> so<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
making stuff like that so it's kind of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.130 
making stuff like that so it's kind of
you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.039> MacGyver<00:01:53.969> together<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.929> works

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you know MacGyver together and it works

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.480 
you know MacGyver together and it works
most<00:01:55.499> of<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.770> time<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.100> got<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
most of the time you got to kind of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.969 
most of the time you got to kind of
wiggle<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> batteries<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.390> stuff<00:01:57.570> but

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
wiggle the batteries and stuff but
