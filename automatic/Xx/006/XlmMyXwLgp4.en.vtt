days ago

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.700 
days ago
but<00:01:41.550> let's<00:01:42.150> move<00:01:42.360> on

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.280 

now<00:01:50.370> we<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.730> in<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.150> inside<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.900> ruins

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
now we are in the inside of the ruins

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
now we are in the inside of the ruins
and<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.680> are<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:53.070> towers<00:01:53.400> of<00:01:53.970> course<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and there are more towers of course the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
and there are more towers of course the
place<00:01:57.330> seems<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.440> been<00:01:58.850> excavated

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
place seems to have been excavated

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.140 
place seems to have been excavated
recently<00:02:01.280> not<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.550> recently<00:02:03.229> this

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
recently not so recently this

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.210 
recently not so recently this
fire-resistant<00:02:06.350> they<00:02:07.350> are<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> good<00:02:07.950> sign

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
fire-resistant they are not a good sign

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.840 
fire-resistant they are not a good sign
let's<00:02:08.550> take<00:02:08.789> them<00:02:09.000> all

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.270 

it<00:02:13.180> was<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> good<00:02:13.810> idea<00:02:14.230> because<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.740> last<00:02:14.920> room

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
it was a good idea because the last room

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.300 
it was a good idea because the last room
looks<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.480> interior<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.170> ugliness<00:02:17.890> or

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
looks like the interior of ugliness or

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
looks like the interior of ugliness or
maybe<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.720> gigantic<00:02:20.170> forge<00:02:21.090> full<00:02:22.090> of

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
maybe of a gigantic forge full of

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.270 
maybe of a gigantic forge full of
oversize<00:02:23.200> at<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.740> flip<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.520> trunk<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
oversize at the flip a trunk and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.740 
oversize at the flip a trunk and
mortarboard<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:32.070> love<00:02:33.070> how<00:02:33.400> its<00:02:33.730> words<00:02:34.150> fall

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
mortarboard I love how its words fall

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.280 
mortarboard I love how its words fall
into<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> Forge<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.930> will<00:02:38.080> turn

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
into the Forge and then you will turn

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.890 
into the Forge and then you will turn
around<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.800> corner<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:40.180> will<00:02:40.360> be<00:02:40.510> faced
