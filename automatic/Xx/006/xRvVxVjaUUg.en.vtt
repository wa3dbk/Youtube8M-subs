00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
single trials passage now what you'll

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.479 
single trials passage now what you'll
actually<00:03:18.260> get<00:03:18.500> these<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:18.980> my<00:03:19.190> guess<00:03:19.459> is

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
actually get these is my guess is

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.430 
actually get these is my guess is
there's<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.030> high<00:03:20.360> potential<00:03:20.810> for<00:03:20.959> probably

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
there's a high potential for probably

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.180 
there's a high potential for probably
blue<00:03:21.890> PvP<00:03:22.700> gear<00:03:23.180> with<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.870> very<00:03:24.440> rare<00:03:24.799> chance

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
blue PvP gear with a very rare chance

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.280 
blue PvP gear with a very rare chance
kind<00:03:25.579> of<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:25.940> an<00:03:26.120> Engram<00:03:26.450> would<00:03:26.600> work<00:03:26.810> for

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
kind of like an Engram would work for

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.259 
kind of like an Engram would work for
the<00:03:27.380> legendary<00:03:27.829> stuff<00:03:28.220> now<00:03:28.639> we<00:03:28.699> don't<00:03:29.000> know

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
the legendary stuff now we don't know

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.970 
the legendary stuff now we don't know
what<00:03:29.449> the<00:03:29.570> other<00:03:29.600> ones<00:03:30.109> are<00:03:30.260> called<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:30.829> you

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
what the other ones are called but you

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.349 
what the other ones are called but you
as<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.310> can<00:03:31.459> see<00:03:31.609> there<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.850> another<00:03:32.060> blonde

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
as you can see there is another blonde

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.530 
as you can see there is another blonde
in<00:03:32.389> two<00:03:32.720> legendary

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
in two legendary

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.910 
in two legendary
I'm<00:03:33.930> assuming<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.349> two<00:03:34.469> legendary<00:03:34.739> ones

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
I'm assuming the two legendary ones

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.649 
I'm assuming the two legendary ones
there's<00:03:35.129> also<00:03:35.340> appears<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:35.909> be<00:03:36.060> two<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.480> them

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
there's also appears to be two of them

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.199 
there's also appears to be two of them
so<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.989> might<00:03:37.439> get<00:03:37.769> two<00:03:38.189> of<00:03:38.219> the<00:03:38.700> legendary

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
so you might get two of the legendary

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.660 
so you might get two of the legendary
packages<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.019> might<00:03:40.200> require<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
packages and might require a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.429 
packages and might require a
substantially<00:03:41.670> larger<00:03:42.090> amount<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.540> wins<00:03:43.079> on<00:03:43.409> a

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
substantially larger amount of wins on a

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.920 
substantially larger amount of wins on a
single<00:03:43.829> trials<00:03:44.099> passage<00:03:44.579> but<00:03:45.180> we'll<00:03:45.599> have<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
single trials passage but we'll have to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.080 
single trials passage but we'll have to
wait<00:03:46.049> till<00:03:46.260> later<00:03:46.799> on<00:03:46.980> today<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.640> actually

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
wait till later on today to actually

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.420 
wait till later on today to actually
find<00:03:48.329> out<00:03:48.569> actually<00:03:49.230> we<00:03:49.379> may<00:03:49.769> not<00:03:49.920> even<00:03:49.980> find

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
find out actually we may not even find

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.149 
find out actually we may not even find
that<00:03:50.640> out<00:03:50.760> later<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.299> today<00:03:51.569> but<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.680> know<00:03:52.829> if

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
that out later on today but you know if

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.800 
that out later on today but you know if
it<00:03:53.400> doesn't<00:03:53.700> well<00:03:54.120> then<00:03:54.329> we'll<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.720> wait

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
it doesn't well then we'll have to wait

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.780 
it doesn't well then we'll have to wait
till<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.049> comes<00:03:55.079> out<00:03:55.349> but<00:03:55.920> regardless<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.579> will

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
till it comes out but regardless I will

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.300 
till it comes out but regardless I will
cover<00:03:56.939> it<00:03:57.120> when<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.329> does<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:58.260> as<00:03:58.560> far<00:03:59.069> as<00:03:59.129> we

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
cover it when it does but as far as we

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.490 
cover it when it does but as far as we
know<00:03:59.489> you<00:04:00.000> need<00:04:00.209> two<00:04:00.359> wins<00:04:00.540> for<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.049> stone<00:04:01.290> tier

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
know you need two wins for a stone tier

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.080 
know you need two wins for a stone tier
and<00:04:01.709> you'll<00:04:01.859> get<00:04:02.069> some<00:04:02.489> sort<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.819> prizes

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
and you'll get some sort of prizes

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.360 
and you'll get some sort of prizes
assumingly<00:04:04.049> that's<00:04:04.620> probably<00:04:04.920> going<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.219> be<00:04:05.340> a

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
assumingly that's probably going to be a
