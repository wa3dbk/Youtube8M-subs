to<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> Sixers<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.180> look<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.510> step<00:00:58.170> back

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
to the Sixers and look at that step back

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.729 
to the Sixers and look at that step back
but<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.940> got<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> six<00:01:00.629> years<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.559> ended

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
but I got to the six years and I ended

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.390 
but I got to the six years and I ended
up<00:01:01.800> scoring<00:01:02.059> 77<00:01:03.059> points<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:05.010> killed

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
up scoring 77 points and we got killed

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.300 
up scoring 77 points and we got killed
we<00:01:05.610> lost<00:01:05.790> by<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.000> 20<00:01:06.619> somehow<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> piston

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
we lost by like 20 somehow the piston

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.340 
we lost by like 20 somehow the piston
shot<00:01:08.580> seventy<00:01:09.000> percent<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> team<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
shot seventy percent as a team in the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.340 
shot seventy percent as a team in the
game<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.939> reason<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.930> why<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
game so for that reason that's why I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800 
game so for that reason that's why I
didn't<00:01:13.590> show<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> game<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.090> playing<00:01:15.420> them<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
didn't show the game so playing them I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960 
didn't show the game so playing them I
really<00:01:16.200> wanted<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.860> win<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.220> game<00:01:17.490> because

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
really wanted to win this game because

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
really wanted to win this game because
we<00:01:18.600> might<00:01:18.840> end<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:19.140> having<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> play<00:01:19.710> them<00:01:19.890> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

one so it's going to be either the
Brooklyn<00:01:45.119> Nets<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.930> Pistons<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:48.240> forgot

that<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.470> might<00:01:52.710> play<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> playoffs<00:01:53.640> in

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that we might play in the playoffs in

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.359 
that we might play in the playoffs in
the<00:01:54.090> first<00:01:54.119> round<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.860> should<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> good

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the first round so it should be a good

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
the first round so it should be a good
one<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> looks<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.780> heat<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
one and it looks like the heat and the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.050 
one and it looks like the heat and the
Pacers<00:01:59.009> are<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.640> playing<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
Pacers are going to be playing in the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.749 
Pacers are going to be playing in the
first<00:02:00.329> round<00:02:00.860> because<00:02:01.860> somehow<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.280> Pacers

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
first round because somehow the Pacers

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.670 
first round because somehow the Pacers
are<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.090> eighth<00:02:03.270> seed<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.899> look<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
are in the eighth seed and look at that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.180 
are in the eighth seed and look at that
and<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.430> layup<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.770> at<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> end<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and one layup just at the end of the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.180 
and one layup just at the end of the
first<00:02:08.429> quarter<00:02:08.959> taking<00:02:09.959> an<00:02:10.140> absorbing<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
first quarter taking an absorbing the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
first quarter taking an absorbing the
contact<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> getting<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> fall

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
contact and getting it to fall

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.180 
contact and getting it to fall
like<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.610> said<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> good

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
like I said so it's going to be a good

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.949 
like I said so it's going to be a good
one<00:02:17.310> between<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.760> Pacers<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> heat<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
one between the Pacers in the heat and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.380 
one between the Pacers in the heat and
if<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.709> Pacers<00:02:19.890> win<00:02:20.370> I'd<00:02:20.580> be<00:02:20.730> really<00:02:20.910> good<00:02:21.150> i'm

lot of time to score in the second and
the<00:02:52.590> defense<00:02:53.100> did<00:02:53.340> pick<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.090> lot<00:02:55.250> so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the defense did pick it up a lot so

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.490

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
moves on and they're double-teaming me

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.880

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.940 
already so I dish it to white and he
gets<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.220> easy<00:03:02.430> layup<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.910> fall<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.800> that's

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
gets that easy layup to fall so that's

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.380

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
that's going in I'm throwing up the

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.659 
that's going in I'm throwing up the
threes<00:05:59.760> so<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.789> 72<00:06:01.479> points<00:06:01.690> at<00:06:01.930> this<00:06:02.110> point<00:06:02.380> and

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
threes so I 72 points at this point and

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.400 
threes so I 72 points at this point and
when<00:06:03.669> I<00:06:03.699> scored<00:06:04.060> 77<00:06:04.570> that<00:06:04.870> was<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.229> team

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
when I scored 77 that was the team

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.200 
when I scored 77 that was the team
record<00:06:05.800> but<00:06:05.979> I'm<00:06:06.070> wobbling<00:06:06.460> up<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.669> no<00:06:06.789> real

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
record but I'm wobbling up to no real

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.810 
record but I'm wobbling up to no real
quick<00:06:07.419> so<00:06:08.380> the<00:06:08.530> team<00:06:08.740> record<00:06:09.099> I<00:06:09.280> currently

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
quick so the team record I currently

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.980 
quick so the team record I currently
hold<00:06:10.150> is<00:06:10.419> 77<00:06:11.139> for<00:06:11.320> most<00:06:11.530> points<00:06:11.740> in<00:06:11.949> a<00:06:12.010> game<00:06:12.990> so

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
hold is 77 for most points in a game so

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.270 
hold is 77 for most points in a game so
let's<00:06:14.139> see<00:06:14.260> if<00:06:14.349> I<00:06:14.440> could<00:06:14.500> beat<00:06:14.830> that<00:06:14.860> record<00:06:17.280> so

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
let's see if I could beat that record so

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.589 
let's see if I could beat that record so
right<00:06:18.430> there<00:06:18.610> they<00:06:18.729> miss<00:06:18.940> it<00:06:18.970> I'm<00:06:19.180> taking<00:06:19.389> it

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
right there they miss it I'm taking it

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.230 
right there they miss it I'm taking it
on<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:19.750> break<00:06:20.729> I'm<00:06:21.729> just<00:06:21.849> gonna<00:06:22.000> pull<00:06:22.210> up

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
on the break I'm just gonna pull up

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.920 
on the break I'm just gonna pull up
figure<00:06:22.900> why<00:06:23.050> not<00:06:23.160> everything's<00:06:24.160> going<00:06:24.310> my<00:06:24.400> way

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
figure why not everything's going my way

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.360 
figure why not everything's going my way
so<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:25.960> little<00:06:26.229> message<00:06:26.410> comes<00:06:26.800> up<00:06:26.949> right<00:06:27.160> now

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
so a little message comes up right now

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.689 
so a little message comes up right now
if<00:06:27.940> I<00:06:28.090> could<00:06:28.150> break<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:28.479> team<00:06:28.630> record<00:06:29.050> for<00:06:29.699> 75

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
if I could break the team record for 75

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.210 
if I could break the team record for 75
points<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:31.900> all<00:06:32.080> I<00:06:32.110> need<00:06:32.229> is<00:06:32.650> three<00:06:33.010> more

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
points so all I need is three more

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.640 
points so all I need is three more
points<00:06:33.430> to<00:06:33.580> beat<00:06:33.849> that<00:06:34.260> so<00:06:35.260> they<00:06:35.380> end<00:06:35.530> up

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
points to beat that so they end up

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.670 
points to beat that so they end up
