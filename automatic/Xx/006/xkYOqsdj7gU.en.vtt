00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello to all those we find ourselves 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.470
 on ultimate team for a test a little 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.940
 duel of boost of the league 1 we go 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:16.980
 oppose djilobodji that has been boosted to 79 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.529
 against serge aurier which has been boosted 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.449
 also at 79 and who is right back 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.199
 there are some who play psg the other who 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.720
 play at nantes 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.039
 both are already very good in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 normal versions so that's why 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 that we are interested in testing 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.830
 the boosts then we will start to see 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.690
 the little right analysis of the map on 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 djilobodji we will say that already the map 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.329
 normal is superb and that we have a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.950
 super card with with other wishes of a 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.320
 everywhere we have 80 if his physique 79 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.340
 in defense and we will be interested in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 fed card 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 if we go to the site was ted and we go 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 see that especially his big strong point 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.070
 in all its line of stats this is the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.280
 stat force at 93 aggression in 93 standing 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 tackle the tackle standing 82 the tackle 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.530
 slipped 86 my sense is not using it and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.520
 Overall he has a beast on racing 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 ie the note beasts or 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.900
 beast which to 89 that is to say that it 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.939
 really positions like a monster 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.070
 in the game is already the verse version 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 normal and monstrous 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.500
 so that's what about serge 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.540
 Aurier 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.689
 serge aurier it looks even more 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.850
 monstrous because already he is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.229
 super fast in the normal version and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.729
 that he is missing just a tiny 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.290
 little defense and me for example I 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.570
 the used with a sentinel card 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.070
 to just improve the defense and the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.079
 physical and it was really top 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.850
 with that then the stats they are 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.690
 shown good he already has speed 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.670
 are 84 it's worth 1,86 87 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.470
 what is very important to him is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 its world freight it's high high 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.190
 so it works only when the player has 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.750
 a big physique that is to say that he will 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.970
 press in attack it will go up in 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.480
 attack and squeezed everywhere in defense and 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.280
 if you are interested in his fed card 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.010
 we see that he has a very good stage of 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.660
 Sault acceleration in acceleration 85 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:14.580
 either 92 the sprint 95 the form 90 the afld 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.310
 the force 80 of aggression 82 brief to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.400
 level of the bisse racing oscillated at 88 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.040
 he's beefy everywhere and we're going to say his 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.020
 main force it's going to be the physical 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.640
 that is, he will be able to run 90 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.460
 minutes is really never stopped dice 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.900
 pass at least two speeds and 2 and 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.020
 So that's why we asked him 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.610
 a small sentinel card for good 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.690
 compare with the normal versions on 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.970
 got sentinel on aurier and 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.800
 shadow of course on djilobodji it's okay 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.100
 we boost speed and defense 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.270
 since he already has a monster physique 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.800
 for the djilobodji world krayt just 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.260
 it's average way so it's perfect 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.850
 it does not move too much we have a 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.010
 we have rather few defenders who are 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.600
 cost that is well in the past the work 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.190
 wright almost ideal for a 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.780
 defender also we can be average 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.980
 haye 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.320
 so we're done for this little girl 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.820
 just analyze the map as we go 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.830
 play with a league team 1 we go 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.330
 keep a few pieces and then mostly 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.530
 we will make the conclusion then is this 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.020
 that it's worth it is what the two 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.400
 are worth it 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.490
 djilobodji he was bought seventeen 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.530
 thousand serge aurier the tht 23000 allers 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.320
 the 17 and 23 the guys that's forty 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.660
 a thousand for the two is no decor 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.489
 even for players then at 79 but hey 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.830
 anyway it was noted that larger 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.850
 we find that the team league 1 that it 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.280
 works 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.030
 so here's the test it's gone go on 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.030
 find himself immediately 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.350
 what are we going to say then we will say 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.650
 to have that both are really not 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.140
 wrong 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.600
 we will say that it is cards that 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.770
 could equate to soils to 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.510
 80 80 so and if we get back into the 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.570
 details we will say that already bungie is 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.690
 really the djilobodji he is really 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.240
 strong ie in the strong sense 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.230
 and here I have for you a shadow map with 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.989
 the speed but actually I find that 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.180
 its speed is it looks like it's 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.920
 a 74 72 74 75 speed is the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.340
 felt speed he is still 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.570
 he is close to the regular so there on 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.280
 here is against it is a monster 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.860
 physically but I fell against 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.590
 a team with robben and this is where 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.300
 I still felt that he was not 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.140
 quite technical where he was not turning 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.540
 pretty fast etc 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.370
 it's the power that will do it at 93 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.710
 the good thing is he's left-handed 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.270
 he plays on the left so you put him to 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.400
 left it's perfect the work that 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.530
 are less etc 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.750
 to summarize 17me I would say it's 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.580
 its price that it will be better to buy it 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.700
 to the 10000 when it will be green from 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.500
 millet with at 79 and that finally between 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.419
 regular oil I have not seen a big 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.230
 difference we went to serge aurier 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.090
 serge aurier 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.080
 told him wow crest we do not forget 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.310
 high high he's in super beefy mode 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.000
 that is, he has the right speed 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.490
 etc. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.410
 and sometimes it's going too fast it's up to 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.030
 to say that it has a little style maÃ¯con it is 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.680
 that sometimes we have the impression that we are 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.550
 take the ball or climb 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.520
 angry etc 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.720
 and then he goes times against where I 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.120
 find very interesting it's the 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.720
 statistics pass because really not 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.890
 so loud and the a75 and we really feel 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.330
 it even happens in the climbs indeed 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.400
 I really find that about patients 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.670
 a precision there is a good recovery 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.230
 of ball with me it was a box 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.910
 in front and really it worked well 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.500
 so that's if we make a small assessment of 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.800
 against each other on this team on 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.840
 will rather give the advantage to sage aurier 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.460
 it's worth 23000 of your seventeen thousand so 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.110
 finally all a little bit the logic of 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.840
 price is really salty because they play 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.900
 there go that is closer to the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.580
 regular is one who really becomes the 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.020
 indispensable player a bit in the 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.610
 league 1 the right defender super strong 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.920
 that's it for this little analysis 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.330
 it was the match between booth allowed 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.680
 to test them I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.440
 and we will find ourselves soon 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.030
 in a video on fifa do not forget to 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.039
 subscribe to the channel is important 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.780
 and then I'll see you soon 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:33.610
 you well ciao bye find there that is 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.610
 left on time it's gone 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.770
 I went to another angle
