00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
1795 now I'm not sure if this is just

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.380 
1795 now I'm not sure if this is just
for<00:00:36.750> some<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> theme<00:00:37.920> plates<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.610> Zelda

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
for some of the theme plates like Zelda

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.630 
for some of the theme plates like Zelda
and<00:00:39.690> Monster<00:00:40.320> Hunter<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.219> kind<00:00:41.610> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and Monster Hunter but I'm kind of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.950 
and Monster Hunter but I'm kind of
hoping<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.180> isn't<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> new<00:00:42.719> price

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
hoping that this isn't the new price

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540 
hoping that this isn't the new price
point<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.410> these<00:00:43.590> cover<00:00:43.800> plates<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.370> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
point for these cover plates because I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
point for these cover plates because I
mean<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.149> eighteen<00:00:45.570> dollars<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.079> thought<00:00:46.379> they

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
mean at eighteen dollars I thought they

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
mean at eighteen dollars I thought they
were<00:00:46.620> stretching<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.610> 25<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.090> think

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
were stretching it and at 25 I think

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.520 
were stretching it and at 25 I think
we're<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:48.750> getting<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> realm<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
we're really getting into the realm of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
we're really getting into the realm of
you<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.430> too<00:00:50.460> expensive<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you know that's way too expensive for a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.990 
you know that's way too expensive for a
couple<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> pieces<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.350> plastic<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.910> any

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
couple of pieces of plastic but in any

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
I'm assuming so something to do with the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.680 
I'm assuming so something to do with the
zelda<00:02:52.880> law<00:02:53.590> but<00:02:54.590> there<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:54.800> go<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.100> uh<00:02:55.690> it's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
zelda law but there you go it's uh it's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.820 
zelda law but there you go it's uh it's
quite<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> nice<00:02:56.989> looking<00:02:57.260> design<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.739> know

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
quite a nice looking design it you know

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.960 
quite a nice looking design it you know
it<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:57.980> picking<00:02:58.220> up<00:02:58.310> fingerprints<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.880> is

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
it is picking up fingerprints it is

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.270 
it is picking up fingerprints it is
actually<00:02:59.209> picking<00:02:59.450> out<00:03:00.010> it's<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.130> picking

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
actually picking out it's not picking

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.620 
actually picking out it's not picking
out<00:03:01.430> fingerprints<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.000> might<00:03:02.150> look<00:03:02.299> like<00:03:02.480> it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
out fingerprints it might look like it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.960 
out fingerprints it might look like it
but<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:03.049> sort<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.380> picking<00:03:03.530> up<00:03:03.739> just<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.190> no

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
but it's sort of picking up just the no

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.479 
but it's sort of picking up just the no
I<00:03:05.000> suppose<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.510> sweat<00:03:05.870> or<00:03:06.049> just<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.680> moisture

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
I suppose the sweat or just the moisture

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.070 
I suppose the sweat or just the moisture
from<00:03:07.670> my<00:03:07.820> hands<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.510> quite<00:03:08.720> hot<00:03:08.930> here

I'm<00:03:56.550> hoping<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.940> Nintendo<00:03:57.540> does<00:03:57.720> releases

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
I'm hoping that Nintendo does releases

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.630 
I'm hoping that Nintendo does releases
on<00:03:58.500> these<00:03:59.069> sort<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.280> things<00:03:59.400> because

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
on these sort of things because

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.180 
on these sort of things because
everything<00:04:00.450> Zelda<00:04:00.870> sells<00:04:01.319> out<00:04:01.500> instantly<00:04:01.920> and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
everything Zelda sells out instantly and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.009 
everything Zelda sells out instantly and
third-party<00:04:02.819> prices<00:04:03.360> just<00:04:03.540> go<00:04:03.660> through<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
third-party prices just go through the

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.930 
third-party prices just go through the
roof<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.890> really<00:04:05.069> hope<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.250> Nintendo<00:04:05.790> do

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
roof and I really hope that Nintendo do

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.390 
roof and I really hope that Nintendo do
what<00:04:06.120> they<00:04:06.209> did<00:04:06.390> with<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.900> 3ds<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:08.040> Majora's

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
what they did with the 3ds the Majora's

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.220 
what they did with the 3ds the Majora's
Mask<00:04:08.640> 3-years<00:04:09.090> console<00:04:09.540> where<00:04:10.019> they<00:04:10.080> did<00:04:10.200> a

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
Mask 3-years console where they did a

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.050 
Mask 3-years console where they did a
second<00:04:10.650> release<00:04:10.920> because<00:04:11.610> things<00:04:11.819> like<00:04:11.940> this

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
