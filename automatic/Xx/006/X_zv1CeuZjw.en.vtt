creative<00:03:18.799> what<00:03:19.040> we're<00:03:19.189> doing<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:19.939> we're

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
creative what we're doing and so we're

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.560 
creative what we're doing and so we're
also<00:03:20.510> who<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.840> smaller<00:03:21.230> table<00:03:21.739> and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
also who a smaller table and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.750 
also who a smaller table and
it's<00:03:24.570> been<00:03:24.780> open<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.620> being<00:03:25.830> adjusted<00:03:26.520> as<00:03:26.640> it

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
it's been open to being adjusted as it

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.000 
it's been open to being adjusted as it
goes<00:03:26.940> along<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.080> some<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.500> values

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
goes along and so some of the values

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.400 
goes along and so some of the values
could<00:03:29.490> be<00:03:29.640> first<00:03:30.120> commented<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.930> adjusted

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
could be first commented on and adjusted

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.100 
could be first commented on and adjusted
with<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.130> some<00:03:32.310> birdies<00:03:32.930> suggestions<00:03:33.930> could

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
with that some birdies suggestions could

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.870 
with that some birdies suggestions could
be<00:03:34.170> putting<00:03:34.350> girls<00:03:34.770> poses<00:03:35.190> when<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.700> been
