00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 it's up to him all those charcoal miles 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 and down here we are for the second video 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.850
 so a video that will not necessarily 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.470
 very long since we are still saying 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.840
 I do not necessarily have the time but 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.640
 right here it really pleases me to the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 therefore do well so I immediately 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 will tell you what will be excused 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.310
 me for saying a lot of times so 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.450
 I know it's a kind of type that 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:41.460
 I took so I have to stop I tell them 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.880
 shit here they are this video all of 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.910
 next I tell you what is there 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.320
 will have in it then it will be a video 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.890
 rather at the level tricks and ed 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.780
 a video that's titled how well 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.350
 create a character with beautiful 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.520
 small colors so for for 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.440
 perform this trick you need 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.140
 of software that is present on all 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.740
 computers absolutely everything that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.930
 is called paint I specify computers 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 windows for linux 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.710
 uh you're fighting no no no I 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.359
 am sure they will find you a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.609
 small combines so 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:29.460
 here you are on your country you have 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:32.039
 open an image and there are colors that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.600
 you obviously like this image of course 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.189
 and you want to use for 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.310
 to simply have the same colors 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.079
 on your game character have for that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 nothing more simple you click on 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.609
 pipette to capture the color you 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 so for example here I would like 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:54.289
 this blue there the blue a little a little towards the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.439
 quay not bad so I click 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.670
 I'm going to change the colors and 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.649
 here as you can see there is a 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.390
 code that's called hervÃ© b everything 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.869
 simply for red green blue this 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.679
 code 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.920
 we're going to copy it and put it on 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.099
 a site like this that converts 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.560
 coderre baby in hexadecimal code and well 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:29.660
 sure in the contrary so we have red nine 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:33.600
 49 to 57 blue it's gone 9 47 59 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.959
 convert to hexadecimal pedal on 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.079
 get that we made a copy I did 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.620
 had risen in order to go faster 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:46.590
 we go back to the window of the ve done 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.859
 then 8 already beats one selects what 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.139
 part of the body we would like to modify 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.200
 and we will click we will type earlier 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.910
 shift key so underneath damage and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.709
 over her land she leaves to 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.710
 because of your keyboard shift + 1 click and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.700
 you get these 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.430
 in fact right click paste flat like 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.210
 by magic we get the color we have 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.630
 chosen and of course we can make 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.030
 really nice people like that 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.970
 by varying over on the hues and on 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.670
 really gets effects are who 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.380
 are really nice so that's for the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.140
 little trick and then now you 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.390
 have no reason to have 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.560
 characters simply disgusting no 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.940
 I laugh but here it is for 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.940
 finally do something 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.580
 rather pretty much the purpose of this video 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.030
 was of course to help you the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.530
 next video will be on my team at it 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.660
 besides that I want to tell you that 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.030
 I stopped on dana wrong then 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.490
 I stopped why ball because I 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.660
 realized that one is naked this 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:03.340
 little beast was better 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.790
 I prefer the 15th ballantyne toy 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.200
 simply because the oysters of 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.050
 corruption is really useful 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.350
 and then and then I make a cinema team 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.860
 I had no jets not hindered m and 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.239
 I thought it was a bit of a shame 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.130
 this is very important the trap sme 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.820
 especially on some dungeons and then 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.980
 same release who is very nice too 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.110
 after that it's a matter of taste 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.020
 in since the zobal antilles but she 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.300
 is just great with with 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.270
 plastron with bat masquerade 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.870
 masquerade and a spell each seals the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.060
 Out of the ball zoo in team 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.850
 this is just for taste and that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.440
 I have that I take to the clouds and then 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.640
 also because here is 20 of grandpa 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.640
 plus it's not disgusting 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:57.799
 so my team will be on brumaire and gold 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.799
