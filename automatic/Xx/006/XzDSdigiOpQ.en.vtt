 Rasic spike I just got to your house and 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.439
 I'm going to open it here with you and I'm going 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.939
 to go right now to practice I was going to say 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.239

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.399
 skating and I will take with me 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:31.530
 let's see it is to say that picchu ro very 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.510
 kindly has already opened the box for me 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.380
 and eye they have sent me also a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.520
 T shirt 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.560
 to see if you can see it well 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.720
 the table is from this flip page 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.060
 first point is that you know they have a 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.910
 lots of penises have a lot of 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.489
 skateboarding have longboard have 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.960
 of topo have everything on this page and 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.390
 all very well priced because I say that 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.060
 this table is very cheap comes also 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.210
 with a lot of stickers 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.980
 and the table was waiting for me smaller 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.370
 but that actually smaller is not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.960
 It would seem to me or feet 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.690
 precious look 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.270
 it is purple 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.430
 I love moradi sima and then the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 green wheels on skate yes skate 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.480
 ever because he gets there all his 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.790
 childhood and adolescence has skated 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.860
 a lot and when we met him you put a 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.960
 little in the world it is true that I have 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.730
 influenced bloggers a lot I do not know if 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.110
 you will know that now all the bloggers 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:33.230
 joaquÃ­n mail or gone and all holy chupi 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.330
 they have a rock or a long and they are left to 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.190
 skate and I'm angry not to be with 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.200
 them to skate because I like the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.940
 idea then is to say that I have 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.860
 influenced a lot but good if your 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.120
 influence friends to start 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 do a sport I do not see the problem anymore 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.530
 if they influence you to get into the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.720
 drugs or drink every weekend 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.550
 or something like that no longer also but for 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.350
 do sport this is good this this is 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.690
 not good for your body burn host 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.300
 so that I'm going to the street far away 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.070
 where I can not be run over by anyone 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.930
 there can not be anyone and where can not 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.300
 run over me to nobody and now I teach you 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.440
 I am already in the place that I told you that 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.850
 I was going to come so that I would not run over 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.860
 nobody and to be calm and such 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.930
 and he already has a small panic attack 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.350
 I have not told you but I panic 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.630
 carmen like everyone is not that to me 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.210
 the fear of falling makes me not do things 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.980
 so for example skateboarding I left 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.870
 because they were too afraid to fall 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.840
 I've talked about whatsapp and churro because 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.700
 I was on a road sign 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 grabbed to try to climb the penis 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.850
 and so it went up but with the peni in the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.890
 ground and I try to climb 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:53.040
 and the other one made me panic raise it churro 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:55.700
 I would need someone to go up and down 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.700
 of the table 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.520
 It's what I'm doing all the time 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.520
 I put 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:19.440
 it's something like that and I get on 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.440
 and now when this movement 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.299
 that you have seen was I was not a 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.150
 double or nothing I have not paid a double 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.379
 because I did it I took it half 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.439
 time practicing and that's what 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.110
 I got half an hour I remember you though 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:02.250
 half an hour ago I was panicking 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.260
 get on the stop table 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.430
 I love the only thing that gives a little bit of 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.489
 fear is that when you take a lot 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:17.590
 speed because you are watching download a 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:21.310
 little scared to catch a lot of speed the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.620
 peni begins as to turn and already alone as 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.510
 is going to become super unstable you have to 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.910
 keep calm 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.020
 and be your skate owner and not that the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.790
 skate you control yourself and cope 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.500
 If I fall I've fallen I've got 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.500
 thinking is amazing 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.820
 things happen to me that happened when 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.350
 I was skiing and also I'm leaving 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.810
 to the left because I put all the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.760
 I am guti guti weight is that you wear your foot 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.470
 right forward left forward 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.730
 with this knowledge 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.050
 with your child if I go with the right foot 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.030
 in front of 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.639
 left foot to the left and 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.940
 behind I'm throwing everything broken towards the 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.030
 left and another thing that happened to me and I 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.949
 continues to happen with the peni is also that 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.330
 by taking the stride to push me 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.360
 I do not know how it's called sure that that has 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.009
 a name stops me because I'm afraid of 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.599
 go very fast and push me a lot 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.220
 to lose balance, if at all 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.379
 I have given you envy that sure yes 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.940
 because this is a sport what ass 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.129
 I want to see ass down here I leave the 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.780
 web page of flipa prime point is that 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.409
 Milk is customer service is 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.409
 wonderful 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.129
 a tablet they say as cool as 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:47.499
 bloggers setting trends from today 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.240
 there is a lot of wind so I 'm half 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:51.639
 sheltered my leg 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.069
 I wanted to ask you if you liked it 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.169
 this video if you would like me to do 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.289
 more videos of my process learning to 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.999
 ride in a movie because the truth is that 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.999
 today it has been useful for me to have 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.860
 show you how I was going to improve for 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.960
 to try and keep practicing and even though 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.460
 I was tired to follow and is then 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.499
 it motivated me enough to record these 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.990
 videos to learn and to practice 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:16.509
 then you seem to make more videos 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.919
 of these you would like and so maybe if 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.840
 some are in doubt and buy a 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.279
 opinion or knowing that I the most clumsy 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.279
 of the universe is getting it 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.800
 so they put on but down here in the 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.330
 comments or give it to me if 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.009
 we have many like me in this video 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.020
 I will understand that you want more 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.639
 videos or directly put one here 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.639

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.129
