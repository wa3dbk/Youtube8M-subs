00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.500
 after watching this but playing Ferstl I really thought so 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.050
 that puts something similar again percent so that's the last game 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.489
 against me too 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.829
 That's what the two Porsche cars were about. "We're mourning and Elliot Schrage over 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.609
 where also it-chef Bern takes place 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.119
 and then I fend off Moosmann's law-finding very well though that too 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.890
 a little more Mr 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.999
 go back and forth 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.269
 at the beginning was not great I'm stupid Michael thought but the 2 GB 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.009
 transition to try to stress So Ismail not 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.500
 always things to dat new leadership 2 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.870
 we do not have ours the world champion strong enough 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.260
 Singapore 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.650
 Pretty good here and then you can see 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.270
 and then show or this one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.650
 with Gambro 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.920
 incomes up to 4 2 but you do not have a percent 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.020
 that wants to proliferate on the game i've tried by distracting that 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.480
 he still i'm coming to the front because they sown late 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.500
 this who could eat exactly this and in a bundle and thus also 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.350
 could score the goal 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.900
 but then I could too 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.330
 so now there would be a goal by already percent but there were the counterattack 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.210
 Snow chains I got his try 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.420
 then I think this decisive scene 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.700
 Water he has fallen has recognized the topics there 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.180
 the OeNB at what he then also something on it as long stops differently sees the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.610
 Thing different 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.250
 to have 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.470
 like Ulrich Hals liked 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.440
 Yes, by making a preliminary decision, Jersey succeeded against the Grande Do Sul 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.480
 difficult 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.700
 we were the girls did not make the clear advantage Berdych, however 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.500
 could this continue 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.550
 but that she's the big one of the Reds stage 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.350
 army 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.270
 I thought the Porsche again at the week 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020
 So you can not talk more spices bought 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.840
 made it clear 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.220
 And yes, that would not be the same as in the first game if the wages would have to be 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.590
 percentage point 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.310
 Although games also regulated 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 4 3 or Peter Bruch 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.980
 Jan Fischer still in work 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.440
 and I said yes stupid to make no lizard 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.679
 but percent after 3 years or even more severe robbery and the cure or get 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.569
 rather counter accent still swears on the three years so 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.769
 Dorner hopes to action 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.839
 one always has when i wake awake esb-ladder then 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.499
 or get 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.499
 Everyone has a lot to save exactly 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.589
 Do not worry about getting here in the end 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.169
 4 900 euros allowed city Delitzsch but 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:42.939
 and I've already seen that 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.989
 yes, I'm just a goal 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.529
 that he 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.759
 So include WÃ¶hrder meadow seen so really does not care 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.589
 Since percent sets and usable and Arcelor begin to build because Falk 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:54.929
 Ohlig still confess 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.949
 she is accused of being stupid as Marsh's gone back 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.119
 but the fight Kurdish still relatively well gains of 5 balls of water then 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.139
 If we get the short straw then it is as good as a draw 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.739
 no chance then percent against his heroes 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.860
 main topics 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.710
 her son by the fact that I could feel the "winner" Marcus Fahn 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.469
 Gained experience and Amada Haider already so Klopp I have and that is too 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.949
 already on 5 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
 not yet 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.289
 the same thing with fuzzy supplier he should by insider trading or 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:36.179
 next power 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.379
 when the decision is made 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.420
 Blitzkonter that I monitor this the samba corpse me 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.959
 TAP warned that Marek is running the countdown threatens to convince me 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.669
 I'm running 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.319
 Percentage Colourbox are kicking Krause to be a bit forward 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.089
 runs and 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.679
 you would have lost gold from Detour 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.849
 or to direct those Scharners and then concert to the big case 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.609
 before the world champion choir to land the reviews it is actually 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.139
 So breaks or and what they make their ideas about it 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.890
 because they tried to kick again 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.829
 i could be kicking licked stuttering 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.169
 Fire kicks me and then it was where
