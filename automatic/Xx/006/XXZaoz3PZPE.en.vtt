 No, I like the show the first twelve on I still have appointments for the 11th 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 because one like our parent company organizes the e3 since and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 That's why we got so cool with the GAK everywhere 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.159
 That's why I give cosmetics first praise 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.259
 These readers queue you can hardly give Plett 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.449

 As always with developers on what to eat this wrong right here 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 Worried list place 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.660
 during the summer action Aalen in the school year Lesers and the Santiago 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.690

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.880
 to do that 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.070
 at Activision 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.420
 he only exists 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.220
 evaporated milk 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.220
 and water 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.100
 vote no 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 according to the contract is waived 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.260
 that's something for our actors the same as older people are up 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.470

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 I just underlined 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.640
 Hamas wants 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.250
 you do not see it at normative sharper buys salad 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.610
 short 1 6 and the halls are now already extinct people 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
 are all now likely and what the parties go for 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 it does not speak Phil anymore 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.740
 because where does America make yourselves the game that is equal in several 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.800
 Regarding foul on the one hand it is down with us 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.530
 I do not have that far 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.549

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.200
 as well as throw out and the third I have in any case 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.709
 because no one has said old Americans of the creators 20 years 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.350
 forgive 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.329
 Grown up Whatever role GM benefits all wrong here 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.389

 there are a million of them 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.449
 May be short interview with Peter Strasser 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.539
 But everyone is very satisfied with the day, but it is true 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 once overwhelmed holds for the good 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.859
 Architect Antje Gahl 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.639

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.459

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.049
 take it 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.969
 There are also its beaches 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
 Mr. Uhrlau could have been there 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.159
 Boston was running 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.969

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.499

 what he wants to choose Albert Event 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.329
 Everybody has tenth as Marcelo Bordon find the words but what to say 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.130
