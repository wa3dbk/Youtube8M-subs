00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi I am all earthly and this is a 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.649
 quick explanation video on how 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.320
 works words place barone place is a 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.690
 program that allows me to create 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.340
 replay file from each game 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 is played that is what happens is 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.550
 installed the program, start 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.550
 on the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 he reggio found creates a file 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 very small between 6 and 10 megabytes 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.250
 usually and you can go to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.900
 concern the registration 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
 whenever you want every single one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.189
 it breaks everything up there 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.020
 within this replay it is a lot 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 easy to install in practice is a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 file zip file that happens you 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.309
 does an execute go inside the dl 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.590
 zip you press this button in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.760
 Taiwanese unfortunately so I do not know that 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.160
 what all this means 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 yes for me this appears a folder on the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.320
 your desktop baron place 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.449
 within this folder you will find 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:03.359
 I only do this one second 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 leave this thing here 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.229
 from the main baron interface 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.560
 place that will appear to you every time 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.729
 start the program go 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.229
 the first thing you should do is 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.509
 put in English I know you are 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.740
 been in English and the second one instead 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.900
 go to settings then this league 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.990
 of legends ex in practice let go 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 a single custom where the program 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.920
 synchronizes with the clients in the dall 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.259
 so you know where the client is 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.990
 which allows him to start replays 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.240
 it's something a little bit technical is Saturday 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.540
 has placed below for that then quaestors 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.549
 play safe in practice this is the place 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.409
 where your replays will be saved 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.399
 you can choose any place I 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.450
 in this case basic state where the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.060
 barro replay folder 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.969
 so in this case the desktop then 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.280
 in fact you will see that users land 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.229
 desktop baron re place e the place 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.729
 then this is discharged the replay ferpi 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.150
 filename here you can put as the file 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.550
 it is 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.930
 appointed may example put the name 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.480
 of your name 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.100
 then the name of the champion then you can 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.990
 put a copy bar to put 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.930
 these finger a space in between 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.750
 so as to organize better then if 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.210
 you have won for your game what it was 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.460
 your kd like that you can 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.430
 put so many details then 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:34.470
 really save and the program does 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 remember then we see a little close the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.980
 play of lon once it was 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.420
 party replay this put let it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.940
 things should have been other basis 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.830
 so chosen the square rouen close 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.190
 window in practice when you take this 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.950
 ex but only like here in the corner 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.209
 I'll show you tricks here it is 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.450
 new 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.130
 reopen those shortcut on desktop in 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.930
 practice this allows you to have one 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.540
 small icon here on the desktop to be able to 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.360
 turn on when you want to baron place 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.740
 store windows is the setting that i 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.480
 I prefer it because I don't even have to 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.750
 remember to turn it on it starts to feed 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.030
 matches and milestones as all records 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.860
 gigi wolves I think that's all that 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.209
