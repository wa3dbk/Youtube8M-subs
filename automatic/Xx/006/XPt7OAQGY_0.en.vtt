since looping it with Maru Lu been

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.849 
since looping it with Maru Lu been

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.270 
again switch to a louder and scratchy or
feel<00:00:44.750> but<00:00:45.199> it<00:00:45.320> does<00:00:45.469> retain<00:00:45.769> some<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.129> its

former<00:00:46.609> smoothness<00:00:47.149> also<00:00:47.929> needless<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.500> say

this cube is very fast even more so

after looping it the corner cutting is

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
overwhelming problem at all the corners

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.860 
overwhelming problem at all the corners
are<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.520> bit<00:01:16.730> more<00:01:16.850> squared<00:01:17.150> off<00:01:17.330> than<00:01:17.540> usual

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
are a bit more squared off than usual

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.510 
are a bit more squared off than usual
which<00:01:18.020> makes<00:01:18.230> corner<00:01:18.590> twists<00:01:18.920> harder<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.340> do

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
which makes corner twists harder to do

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.310 
which makes corner twists harder to do
but<00:01:20.000> also<00:01:20.120> have<00:01:20.390> holes<00:01:20.630> in<00:01:20.780> them<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.110> it's<00:01:21.230> not
