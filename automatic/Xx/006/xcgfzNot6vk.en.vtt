00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.570
 Hello everyone, dudes today, I would like to 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.730
 tell you about how to install 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.720
 francie will be on nobody's complete console 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.700
 playstation 2 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.740
 for those who do not know free msi bot it 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.630
 way to download third-party utilities which 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.699
 allow for example on draws complete 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.670
 consoles run the game from pig 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.500
 flash cards or even hard drives for 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.260
 free msi installation will be required 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.750
 first know your ps2 model 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.129
 to set frames the fuck fits and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.930
 bbw if mke 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.640
 but if your prefix is model number 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.129
 Nine starts, then you can safely 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.699
 close this video you nothing here 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.680
 it does not shine 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.049
 the second thing we need is a license 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.330
 game disc 007 legends 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.640
 There are some more games that have 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.920
 data vulnerability on I removed agent 007 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.080
 since the game is pretty slag it can 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.330
 was found for a penny 3 that us 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.790
 this empty blank 9r comes in handy 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.220
 image capture and recording program 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.010
 for example image berner well and any other 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 Similar as apache for 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.180
 substitution of files removed our image well 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.280
 the actual software package is needed for 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 installation on the console links to downloads 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.539
 all you need is in the description 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.250
 under the video well, now about everything in order 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.469
 first thing we shoot 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 image of the original game 1d disc 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.619
 iso format 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.259
 open the created image of the program 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.149
 apache and find the lf driving file 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.950
 now we need to change the size 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.320
 of this file so that it 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.570
 matched the file size and launch on 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.119
 which in the end we will change it my 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.490
 case and launch weighs 915 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.469
 one hundred ninety six bytes you have size 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.619
 may vary by version 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.630
 and launch further example launch files 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.140
 most likely folders and lunch it's called 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.450
 but all of drawing a lf and replace the file 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.880
 driving from the original disc like this 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.710
 shown in the video that's all you can safely 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.999
 write image spoofed files and 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.979
 launch on disc 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:03.020
 the same to have a bernard who we are 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.240
 image and create write recommend on 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.159
 as low speed as possible 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.179
 need to pass the first mission of the game and 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.220
 jin-tan dove vai 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.620
 and will continue to be required of us 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.660
 a little work screwdriver and remove 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.239
 top cover in the console if you have 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.620
 option if you tab then excuse me 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.780
 I don't have it and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.519
 I don't know the nuances after 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.560
 the top panel of the valley we should 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.540
 fix two sensors for example 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.250
 scotch to console to think that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.049
 remote part of the body in place and without 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 problems continued to read discs not 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.670
 leaving the defense now proceed to the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.590
 the main run the original disk with 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.599
 playing on our console with a remote 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.280
 top cover now then us and 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.150
 useful preservation that we 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.440
 pre-prepared 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.720
 go to the mission selection screen and 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.610
 we substitute the original game disc for 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.769
 pre-prepared disc 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.540
 canceled files and load the second 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.910
 mission if everything was done correctly 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.310
 the prefix began to load file you 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.230
 launch hp it is a vulnerability though already 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.629
 said golden lena slimkat last 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.730
 revisions so their owners unfortunately 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.260
 it turns out to be in flight further bye 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.120
 The prefix expects further from us 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.879
 action loaded launcher and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.739
 we format any USB stick in fat32 and 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.349
 fill it with the necessary files for 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.329
 installation principle of the pack of files remsey 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.190
 but i open but hit for 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.530
 running games from flash drives you 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.480
 find the link in the description below 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.120
 connect the USB flash drive to our usb port 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.340
 consoles and on the gamepad push the button 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.530
 0 to go file manager 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.500
 choose a line of masses that's just ours 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.450
 flash drive and click 50 see 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.079
 the files we just uploaded 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.260
 flash drive 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.629
 Run the free mc file with the boot lf key 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.980
 0 and see the ems installation window will be for 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.500
 start choosing a format 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.660
 ems for formatting a memory card and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.340
 press the cross you threw all 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.500
 important information to another memory card 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.169
 do not you after formatting the card 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.389
 memory , we have 2 options 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.099
 choose rate he became for simple 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.199
 msi settings will be on the memory card 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.000
 after which it will work 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.310
 directly only on your console 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.849
 or the second option is a multi vertex 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.099
 install 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.930
 This installation method is suitable if you 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.970
 plan to run boot in Reims 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.310
 your memory card to another console 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.859
 only consider the console should be yours 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.829
 region that is on the ntsc prefix msi 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.539
 will be installed on ps2 pal region 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.590
 will not work but I will choose multi 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.139
 the installation is not so useful 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.120
 I am not a single prefix ps 2 confirm 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:39.810
 our desire to install msi will be and we wait 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:41.790
 process completion after successful 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.800
 complete the installation, click ok 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.720
 Well, in principle, you can now restart 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.000
 prefix if you did everything right 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.650
 then when loading logs should appear 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.900
 Reims will be with the subsequent loading 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.030
 additional menu you think everything 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.310
 the most important thing you have done to them now 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.470
 will work successfully on your ps2 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.780
 it remains only to copy the program 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.760
 apple loader from flash drive to memory card and 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.590
 add it to the menu for this we 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.169
 we launch change already familiar to us 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.970
 file manager you launch go 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.940
 on our flash drive I repeat that she 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.030
 called the masses and go to the opel folder 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.580
 Copy the file upnp with 2 l d. 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.370

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.070
 select the line copy of the menu that appears 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.410
 and press 0 next go to the directory 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.630
 our memory card in its launcher he 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.270
 Marked MC 0 and insert 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.910
 copied file open loader soon 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.970
 our memory cards pressing the top right 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.039
 shift r1 and remove the pace will have a little 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.560
 wait until our file is copied from 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.960
 flash drives to memory card all program 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.180
 Uploader lies on the memory card and us 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.490
 you need to add it to the initial menu to 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.349
 from there we could and run since 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.389
 automaton program files in title 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.190
 menus can not be added for this 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.960
 we reboot the console and go to 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.330
 menu free msi box figure chance 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.310
 choose config string o and here from 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.070
 communities and in the menu that appears, select 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.470
 config line with this deep select 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.660
 empty line without a name this line and 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.979
 will be our new main menu item 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.380
 click the cross 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.080
 enter our name of the future menu, I will call 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.630
 it fell further in the three bottom lines 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.700
 specify the path to our open file 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.889
 laughter come back to the same 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.220
 the first francie settings menu will be and 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.840
 choose a line with fcm ft mc 0 so that our 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.820
 changes take effect 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.130
 well and we leave from here just having rebooted 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.520
 prefix well, what are we looking for? 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.680
 new main menu item 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.590
 as you can see a new line in my opel 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.849
 It appeared I did everything right 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.479
 I hope that you have the same 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.729
 result 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.310
 sorry but i will interrupt this video 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.419
 on the most interesting place not to 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.120
 bore him with a lot of 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.370
 Formations at a time and in the next video 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.110
 video will tell exactly how to us 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.240
 run games with pigs or with 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.009
