00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
knives or anything I just was at the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
knives or anything I just was at the
grocery<00:00:48.719> store<00:00:48.750> inside<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.950> mean<00:00:50.100> looks

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
grocery store inside and I mean looks

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.340 
grocery store inside and I mean looks
like<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.270> sharper<00:00:51.629> than<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> ones<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.140> have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
like it's sharper than the ones we have

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.610 
like it's sharper than the ones we have
so<00:00:53.000> she<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> biggest<00:00:54.870> cheater<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
so she is the biggest cheater which I

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.920 
so she is the biggest cheater which I
love<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.760> show<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.030> all<00:00:57.329> about<00:00:57.360> how

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
love because this show is all about how

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
love because this show is all about how
to<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.289> something<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.710> quick<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.309> easy

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
to make something really quick and easy

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.590 
to make something really quick and easy
and<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:02.309> way<00:01:02.399> she<00:01:02.430> flavors<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> soup<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and not the way she flavors the soup is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
and not the way she flavors the soup is
by<00:01:03.750> adding<00:01:03.899> salsa<00:01:04.530> she's<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> had<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
by adding salsa she's like if you had a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.240 
by adding salsa she's like if you had a
can<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.060> salsa<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:07.170> salsa<00:01:07.409> already<00:01:07.860> has<00:01:08.070> all

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
can of salsa this salsa already has all

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.530 
can of salsa this salsa already has all
the<00:01:08.340> flavors<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> don't<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> add

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the flavors in it you don't have to add

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.590 
the flavors in it you don't have to add
any<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:09.810> spices<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.530> anything<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.600> that's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
any more spices or anything so that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:02:23.130 
any more spices or anything so that's
what<00:01:12.750> we're<00:01:12.900> doing

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
so in hindsight I either would have used

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.940 
so in hindsight I either would have used
fewer<00:02:29.300> ingredients<00:02:29.540> or<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.230> little<00:02:30.680> bit<00:02:30.769> more
