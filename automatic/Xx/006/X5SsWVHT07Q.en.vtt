00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 There is no way to ignore that we live a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.930
 period of severe drought and despite the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.529
 rains that are already present in some 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.840
 parents 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.980
 the situation is still critical in many 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.809
 shells 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.250
 so it is important that everyone has 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 awareness of this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.150
 When washing the car, remember to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 that there are alternatives to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.750
 the machine is spending the least amount of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.880
 possible water because it is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.460
 was the time when we washed a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.439
 car without worrying about waste 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.040
 leaving the tap on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.559
 while lathering the car door 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.110
 You can not do this anymore, man. 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.030
 know that if you take 20 minutes to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.430
 wash your car using those 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.430
 conventional hoses will spend 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 about 380 liters of water 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.469
 more than a small water tank but 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 there are solutions to minimize this 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.100
 problem 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 high pressure washers guarantee 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.859
 savings of up to 80% of water is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.159
 compared to the common hose or 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.820
 You can wash the car faster 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.650
 spending about 90 liters of water 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.110
 but if you think of radicalizing yet 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.630
 more and contribute significantly 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.740
 for the preservation of this precious 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 liquid 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.650
 there is a very interesting option is the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.650
 called dry cleaning consisting of the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 use of specific products to remove 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.509
 the dirt of the car without the use of water and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.030
 does not cost so dear 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.430
 Of course you can not wash to be with the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.829
 all dirty mud car the one that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 has gone through a radical trail can 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.200
 damage paint 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.060
 the ideal would be with the car was not less 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 dust and gets more still in a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.390
 parking is fine stays shining 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.100
 with polishing and protects the paint also 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.009
 generally before starting the process 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.329
 dry cleaning is done by cleaning the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.460
 wheel housings 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.810
 especially if they are 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.479
 excess of clay 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.590
 in this case the aid of the high- 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.629
 pressure is imperative after 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.390
 a service is started with the application of 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.709
 a product 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.390
 based on benzene carnauba wax 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.470
 abrasive and fragrance among others 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.590
 components 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.050
 correct is to apply the product and remove 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.520
 the dirt immediately with a cloth 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.280
 clean on the top 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.360
 so the ideal is to go cleaning the car 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.300
 step by step 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.690
 and preferably in a shady location and the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:40.030
 The result is really good because 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.670
 painting is shining and not enough 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.830
 saving water when washing the car is 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.260
 I need to invest in other types of 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.160
 actions that help preserve the environment 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680
 environment 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.510
 For example, owners of jet 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.420
 worry about the so-called boxes 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.030
 separators that holds the soil and oil 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.489
 from car wash only 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.310
 after passing through them that the water 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.920
 must be dispensed into the sewage system 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.260
 another providential measure is to have a 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.019
 rainwater collection system for 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.900
 help strengthen the reservoir 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.239
 so if you're the type that cares 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.370
 with the preservation of the environment and 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.600
 want to see no one passing by 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.220
 lack of water 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.019
 think about what you will do next time 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.019
 Once you wash your car
