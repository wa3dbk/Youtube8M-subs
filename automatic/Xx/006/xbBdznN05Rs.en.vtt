charge the battery box and then comes
the<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:33.240> innovative<00:01:33.509> part<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the really innovative part you get a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
the really innovative part you get a
connector<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.610> looks<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> plastic

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
connector that looks like a plastic

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
connector that looks like a plastic
MagSafe<00:01:37.110> connector<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:38.070> obviously<00:01:38.369> because

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
MagSafe connector but obviously because

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.789 
MagSafe connector but obviously because
it's<00:01:38.729> plastic<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.630> doesn't<00:01:39.689> magnetized<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it's plastic it doesn't magnetized to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
it's plastic it doesn't magnetized to
the<00:01:41.130> laptop<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.790> therefore<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.689> just

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the laptop and therefore would just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
the laptop and therefore would just

a really great solution just to give you
some<00:02:54.090> extra<00:02:54.269> power<00:02:54.720> whilst<00:02:55.050> you're<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
some extra power whilst you're on the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.380 
some extra power whilst you're on the
move<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.340> only<00:02:56.489> thing<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.730> wish<00:02:56.910> they<00:02:57.060> had<00:02:57.269> have

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
move the only thing I wish they had have

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.390 
move the only thing I wish they had have
done<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.900> make<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.500> battery<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:59.250> that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
done is make the battery just that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.040 
done is make the battery just that
little<00:02:59.760> bit<00:02:59.850> more<00:02:59.880> attractive<00:03:00.209> rather<00:03:00.810> than

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
little bit more attractive rather than

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.680 
little bit more attractive rather than
just<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.560> kind<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:01.860> plain<00:03:02.160> big<00:03:02.550> lumpy<00:03:03.030> black<00:03:03.330> box

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
just a kind of plain big lumpy black box

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.110 
just a kind of plain big lumpy black box
but<00:03:03.959> all<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.920> works<00:03:05.280> great<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.850> it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
but all in all it works great and it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.640 
but all in all it works great and it
really<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.660> only<00:03:06.690> solution<00:03:07.110> that's<00:03:07.470> out

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
really is the only solution that's out

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
really is the only solution that's out
there<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.010> market<00:03:08.430> today<00:03:08.580> without<00:03:09.209> really

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
there on the market today without really
