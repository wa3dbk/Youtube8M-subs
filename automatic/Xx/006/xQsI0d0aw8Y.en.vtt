this<00:00:27.670> this<00:00:28.420> design<00:00:28.930> that<00:00:29.710> I<00:00:29.740> created<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.779> kind

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
this this design that I created to kind

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.479 
this this design that I created to kind
of<00:00:31.840> test<00:00:32.140> how<00:00:32.349> thin<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.800> could<00:00:32.980> make<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.280> layers

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
of test how thin I could make the layers

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.890

of<00:00:33.850> run<00:00:34.270> on<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:35.379> buco<00:00:35.650> bot<00:00:36.090> right<00:00:37.090> now<00:00:37.330> I<00:00:37.390> have

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
of run on the buco bot right now I have

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.880 
of run on the buco bot right now I have
a<00:00:38.170> slice<00:00:38.860> setting<00:00:39.790> of<00:00:41.220> each<00:00:42.220> layer<00:00:42.580> is<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:43.890> 0.1

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
a slice setting of each layer is a 0.1

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.950 
a slice setting of each layer is a 0.1
millimeter<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:48.239> these<00:00:49.239> wings<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:49.930> I

millimeter and these wings that I

millimeter and these wings that I
printed<00:00:50.290> here<00:00:50.650> are<00:00:51.610> so<00:00:51.909> thin<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:53.699> could

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
printed here are so thin that you could

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.270 
printed here are so thin that you could

it's pretty see through with this PLA
plastic<00:01:02.530> material<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.370> could<00:01:06.520> see<00:01:06.700> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
plastic material as you could see and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.350 
plastic material as you could see and
mostly<00:01:08.200> if<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.440> could<00:01:08.619> zoom<00:01:09.549> in<00:01:09.729> here<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.210> see

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
mostly if I could zoom in here to see

mostly if I could zoom in here to see
how<00:01:10.479> really<00:01:10.869> thin<00:01:11.350> these<00:01:11.500> wings<00:01:11.770> are<00:01:12.390> there

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
how really thin these wings are there

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
how really thin these wings are there
you<00:01:13.479> go<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.340> gives<00:01:15.549> you<00:01:15.670> an<00:01:15.790> idea

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
you go if that gives you an idea

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.649 
you go if that gives you an idea
Felton's<00:01:17.799> is<00:01:18.040> kind<00:01:18.729> of<00:01:18.790> hard<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.119> film<00:01:19.450> this

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
Felton's is kind of hard to film this

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.290 
Felton's is kind of hard to film this
but<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:21.490> very<00:01:21.820> thin

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.510 

very<00:01:27.300> thin<00:01:27.510> layers<00:01:27.800> very<00:01:28.800> clean<00:01:29.130> right<00:01:29.490> now

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
very thin layers very clean right now

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.710 
very thin layers very clean right now
it's<00:01:30.300> pretty<00:01:30.510> pretty<00:01:30.900> slow<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.680> tail<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
it's pretty pretty slow the tail so that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.470 
it's pretty pretty slow the tail so that
way<00:01:33.840> doesn't<00:01:34.050> get<00:01:34.260> all<00:01:34.350> smushy<00:01:35.210> from<00:01:36.210> too<00:01:36.360> much

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
way doesn't get all smushy from too much

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.510 
way doesn't get all smushy from too much
heat<00:01:37.880> too<00:01:38.880> many<00:01:39.110> because<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.710> such<00:01:41.340> as

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
heat too many because it's a such as

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.590 
heat too many because it's a such as
just<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.540> tiny<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:44.120> piece<00:01:45.120> that<00:01:45.330> it<00:01:45.450> needs

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
just a tiny little piece that it needs

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
just a tiny little piece that it needs
to<00:01:45.750> print<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.080> so<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:46.980> just<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.400> slow

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to print out so it's just going slow

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.250 
to print out so it's just going slow
just<00:01:48.150> enough<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.660> where<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.960> cools<00:01:49.110> down

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
just enough to where it cools down

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.730 
just enough to where it cools down
enough<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.280> previous<00:01:50.580> layer<00:01:50.970> doesn't<00:01:51.740> get

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
enough so the previous layer doesn't get

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.890 
enough so the previous layer doesn't get
to<00:01:52.860> smushy<00:01:53.570> anyways<00:01:54.570> I'm<00:01:55.410> going<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:56.750> take<00:01:57.750> this

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
to smushy anyways I'm going to take this

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.890 
to smushy anyways I'm going to take this
out<00:01:58.080> when<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.010> done<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.600> hopefully<00:02:00.600> I'll

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
out when it's done and hopefully I'll

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.280 
out when it's done and hopefully I'll
have<00:02:01.080> some<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> park<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:03.290> see

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
have some time to go to the park and see

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:14.090 
have some time to go to the park and see
if<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> flies

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.330 

all<00:02:15.100> right<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:16.420> here's<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.050> finished<00:02:17.440> buco

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
all right so here's the finished buco

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.020 
all right so here's the finished buco
botfly<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:20.440> put<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> little<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.280> little

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
botfly and I put a little a little

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.280 
botfly and I put a little a little
weight<00:02:22.209> right<00:02:22.390> here<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.110> little

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
weight right here it's just a little

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.840 
weight right here it's just a little
screw<00:02:23.500> just<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.040> put<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> little<00:02:24.400> weight<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
screw just to put a little weight on the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.809 
screw just to put a little weight on the
front<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.440> balanced<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.530> out<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:27.640> should<00:02:27.790> be

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
front I balanced it out it should be

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.360 
front I balanced it out it should be
about<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:29.620> right<00:02:29.890> there<00:02:30.070> should<00:02:30.280> be

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
about about right there should be

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.510 
about about right there should be
balanced<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:32.070> let's<00:02:33.070> try<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.250> out<00:02:33.370> really

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
balanced and let's try it out really

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.660 
balanced and let's try it out really
quick<00:02:34.860> thank<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.070> we<00:02:36.100> go<00:02:36.250> we're<00:02:36.640> going

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
to launch it here in the living room

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.150 
to launch it here in the living room
it's<00:02:39.580> not<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> lot<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:39.940> room<00:02:40.209> but<00:02:40.950> should<00:02:41.950> apply

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
it's not a lot of room but should apply

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:57.200 
it's not a lot of room but should apply
pretty<00:02:42.489> cool
