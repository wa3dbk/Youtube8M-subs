00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
for this there's two purposes number one

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.420 
for this there's two purposes number one
is<00:06:01.539> to<00:06:01.930> help<00:06:02.110> you<00:06:02.229> organize<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.069> to<00:06:03.190> think

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
going to do in that mix and number two

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.760 
going to do in that mix and number two
is<00:06:07.419> to<00:06:07.569> help<00:06:07.779> you<00:06:07.900> actually<00:06:08.080> get<00:06:08.380> that<00:06:08.560> mix

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
is to help you actually get that mix

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.879 
is to help you actually get that mix
done<00:06:09.069> right<00:06:09.669> so<00:06:10.150> make<00:06:10.360> sure<00:06:10.389> that<00:06:10.779> you<00:06:11.080> use<00:06:11.349> gig

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
done right so make sure that you use gig

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.189 
done right so make sure that you use gig
templates<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:12.729> the<00:06:13.210> kick<00:06:13.569> template<00:06:13.960> that<00:06:14.110> I

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
templates and the kick template that I

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.709 
templates and the kick template that I
use<00:06:14.469> is<00:06:14.680> ten<00:06:15.460> songs<00:06:15.729> three<00:06:16.210> minutes<00:06:16.509> each

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
use is ten songs three minutes each

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.749 
use is ten songs three minutes each
right<00:06:17.020> this<00:06:17.139> is<00:06:17.259> approximate<00:06:17.919> rough<00:06:18.159> estimate

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
right this is approximate rough estimate

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.480 
right this is approximate rough estimate
so<00:06:19.120> once<00:06:19.840> you<00:06:20.050> know<00:06:20.080> that<00:06:20.229> then<00:06:20.860> all<00:06:21.219> the

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
so once you know that then all the

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.390 
so once you know that then all the
confusing<00:06:22.300> confusion<00:06:23.169> and<00:06:23.319> and<00:06:23.860> the

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
confusing confusion and and the

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.159 
confusing confusion and and the
resistance<00:06:25.120> out<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.449> getting<00:06:25.719> the<00:06:25.810> mix<00:06:26.020> is

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
resistance out of getting the mix is

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.779 
resistance out of getting the mix is
done<00:06:26.199> pretty<00:06:26.710> much<00:06:26.830> goes<00:06:27.159> away<00:06:27.400> because<00:06:27.550> you

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
done pretty much goes away because you

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.070 
done pretty much goes away because you
know<00:06:27.909> exactly<00:06:28.300> what<00:06:28.509> you're<00:06:28.659> going<00:06:28.779> to<00:06:28.870> play

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
know exactly what you're going to play

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.170 
know exactly what you're going to play
and<00:06:29.319> you<00:06:29.620> can<00:06:29.770> hit<00:06:29.919> record<00:06:30.279> and<00:06:30.490> start<00:06:30.940> getting

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
and you can hit record and start getting

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.029 
and you can hit record and start getting
in<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:31.360> mix<00:06:31.569> and<00:06:31.779> get<00:06:32.139> that<00:06:32.319> mix<00:06:32.529> out<00:06:32.710> there

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
in the mix and get that mix out there

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.639 
in the mix and get that mix out there
right<00:06:33.340> so<00:06:33.370> focus<00:06:34.330> on<00:06:34.509> results<00:06:34.810> focus<00:06:35.529> on

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649 
right so focus on results focus on

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:37.500 
right so focus on results focus on
getting<00:06:35.800> mixes<00:06:36.279> out<00:06:36.399> there<00:06:36.699> upload

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
getting mixes out there upload

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.270 
getting mixes out there upload
your<00:06:37.630> mixes<00:06:37.960> to<00:06:38.140> the<00:06:38.260> sites<00:06:38.500> that<00:06:38.980> I've<00:06:39.100> given
