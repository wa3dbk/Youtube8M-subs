00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
worked and now place it on my block

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.729 
worked and now place it on my block
above<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.680> set<00:00:55.680> block<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:57.440> get<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> same

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
above that set block I get the same

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:08.420 
above that set block I get the same
block<00:00:59.359> and<00:01:00.359> red<00:01:00.809> stone<00:01:01.770> block<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.159> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
block and red stone block and then in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.609 
block and red stone block and then in
here<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> test<00:01:10.430> for<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.880> entities

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
here you just do test for all entities

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.440 
here you just do test for all entities
type<00:01:13.619> arrow<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.780> T<00:01:16.049> equals<00:01:16.439> negative<00:01:16.619> 1<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
type arrow and T equals negative 1 and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
type arrow and T equals negative 1 and
then<00:01:18.450> also<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.790> in<00:01:20.790> ground<00:01:22.280> 1b

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then also you have to do in ground 1b

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
then also you have to do in ground 1b
and<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.700> placed<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.119> stone<00:01:27.390> blocks<00:01:27.689> like

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and I just placed a stone blocks like

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.740 
and I just placed a stone blocks like
this<00:01:28.729> place<00:01:29.729> read<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:30.119> characters<00:01:30.570> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this place read some characters like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.160 
this place read some characters like
this<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.520> put<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.180> book<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:34.520> make<00:01:35.520> this

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
this and now put my book here make this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.370 
this and now put my book here make this
exit<00:01:37.170> cute<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.770> entities<00:01:40.770> type<00:01:42.380> equals

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
exit cute and now entities type equals

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.620 
exit cute and now entities type equals
arrow<00:01:44.119> c<00:01:45.119> equals<00:01:45.540> negative<00:01:45.810> 1<00:01:47.390> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.540> make

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
arrow c equals negative 1 going to make

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.289 
arrow c equals negative 1 going to make
this<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> relative<00:01:49.259> coordinates<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.100> then

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
this the relative coordinates and then

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.870 
this the relative coordinates and then
summon<00:01:51.710> prime<00:01:52.759> tnt<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.560> then<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.250> relative

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
summon prime tnt and then the relative

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.560 
summon prime tnt and then the relative
coordinates<00:01:57.619> now<00:01:58.619> over<00:01:58.829> here<00:02:00.380> put<00:02:01.380> our<00:02:01.649> block

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
coordinates now over here put our block

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
coordinates now over here put our block
and<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:03.810> prasanna<00:02:04.409> Peter<00:02:04.649> set<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> set<00:02:05.520> two

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and now prasanna Peter set the set two

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.630 
and now prasanna Peter set the set two
tix<00:02:07.789> command<00:02:08.789> block<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.959> make<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.289> kill<00:02:10.679> on

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
tix command block and make this kill on

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.620 
tix command block and make this kill on
these<00:02:13.220> type<00:02:14.540> arrow<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.280> then<00:02:17.280> C<00:02:18.090> equals

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
these type arrow and then C equals

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.850 
these type arrow and then C equals
negative<00:02:18.840> 1<00:02:19.050> which<00:02:20.959> act<00:02:21.959> event<00:02:22.319> i'm<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.800> to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
negative 1 which act event i'm going to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.930 
negative 1 which act event i'm going to
activate<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.370> set<00:02:23.640> block<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:25.670> now<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.730> have

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
activate the set block and now you have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:40.910 
activate the set block and now you have
exploding<00:02:27.510> arrows<00:02:38.780> spelled<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.930> executes
