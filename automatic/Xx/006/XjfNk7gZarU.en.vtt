gameplay<00:01:20.740> footage<00:01:21.010> um<00:01:21.640> I<00:01:22.360> think<00:01:22.720> this<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:22.870> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
gameplay footage um I think this is the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.150 
gameplay footage um I think this is the
one<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.320> people<00:01:23.500> are<00:01:23.680> probably<00:01:23.830> going<00:01:24.070> to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
one that people are probably going to

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.070 
one that people are probably going to
like<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.490> most<00:01:24.730> especially<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.750> know<00:01:25.870> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
like the most especially you know the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.020 
like the most especially you know the
really<00:01:26.320> competitive<00:01:26.740> sort<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.400> people<00:01:27.790> like

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
really competitive sort of people like

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.960 
really competitive sort of people like
players<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.870> I<00:01:29.620> imagine<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.340> this<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
players and I imagine that this is the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.160 
players and I imagine that this is the
one<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.300> people<00:01:31.480> are<00:01:31.690> going<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.930> get<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
one that people are going to get the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.530 
one that people are going to get the
most<00:01:32.380> like<00:01:32.650> combos<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.280> things<00:01:33.760> out<00:01:33.910> of<00:01:33.970> as<00:01:34.390> it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
most like combos and things out of as it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.930 
most like combos and things out of as it
says<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.650> can<00:01:35.800> also<00:01:36.010> use<00:01:36.190> her<00:01:36.520> special

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
says that you can also use her special

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.750 
says that you can also use her special
moves<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> stark<00:01:37.780> combo<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.430> yeah<00:01:39.580> that's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
moves to a stark combo but yeah that's

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.250 
moves to a stark combo but yeah that's
pretty<00:01:39.910> much<00:01:40.030> all<00:01:40.300> i<00:01:40.360> have<00:01:40.600> for<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.870> video

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
pretty much all i have for this video

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.110 
pretty much all i have for this video
like<00:01:41.950> i<00:01:42.070> said<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.460> beginning<00:01:42.580> it's<00:01:42.970> going

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
like i said in the beginning it's going

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.260 
like i said in the beginning it's going
to<00:01:43.180> be<00:01:43.240> pretty<00:01:43.300> quick<00:01:43.720> but<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:45.700> they<00:01:46.060> keep

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
to be pretty quick but if they keep

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.660 
to be pretty quick but if they keep
doing<00:01:46.330> more<00:01:46.750> images<00:01:47.320> like<00:01:47.620> this<00:01:47.950> showing

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670
