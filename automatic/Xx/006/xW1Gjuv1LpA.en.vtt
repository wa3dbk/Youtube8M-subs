00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.100
 of him 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.099
 yes 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.470
 ah 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.210
 do not 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.530
 Y 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.040
 and look for me dance is my way of 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.570
 express myself in life in fact to me 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.420
 all the times that it costs me to transmit 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.400
 things with words and I try to think 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.890
 what I feel when I move and 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.090
 from there it appears is for me it is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 vital 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.760
 well, my classes and I say my classes because 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 It's a very personal work that I do 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 stretching and body awareness the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.120
 I work how to get to the body at 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.560
 bodily sensations and translate them into 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.620
 movement 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.770
 then I use stretches as a way 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.330
 of access but then through these 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.300
 stretches that are very exercises 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.210
 regimented indicated that to that people 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.910
 work with your feelings and with your 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.910
 way to improve movement from the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.610
 who perceives good I have participated in 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.580
 very varied shows with a lot 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.510
 different people oriental african dance 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.160
 classic contemporary with people from 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.170
 many countries then it is very difficult 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.650
 select I would stay with 21 is with my 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.260
 group 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.910
 my group of each that forms it with my 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.270
 husband and a multidisciplinary project in 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.250
 the one that we took the students and the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.830
 We made semi professionals inside the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.450
 group then or it was a very experience 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.310
 enriching very hard in some 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.770
 moments but very beautiful and that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.930
 show we take it to senegal 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.720
 so when we dance there, dance 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 African girl in front of a Senegalese audience 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.910
 a wonderful experience the reaction 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.540
 and the welcome the African dance came up 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.600
 because I went to a concert 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.570
 and a wonderful Senegalese appeared 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.880
 playing percussion and I fell in love with 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.340
 sound of what it was invited me to a 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 dance course and from there 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.090
 I continued I married a brother of his and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.610
 it's already in getting into music from 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.430
 the culture itself then appeared 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.740
 coincidentally but then I discovered that for 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.520
 I was a must dance 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.940
 African because the oriental dance is a 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.860
 subtle dance while strong but its 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.860
 way to express those forces of a 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.290
 very subtle way and the body moves to 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.480
 through circles and eights continuously 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.700
 then one is a sequential work 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.160
 of the body while the dance 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.100
 African is the force is transmitted to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.260
 through impulses that's what I 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.790
 more I can differentiate between the two 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.610
 although in both 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.730
 what resembles them is that it is a 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.379
 cultural expression is a root of all 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.560
 a culture in three positions have so much 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.560
 force 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.130
 i 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.370
 feel more a taste him 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.620
 the Spice 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.120
 a smell 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.050
 the smell of night jasmine a texture 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.190
 silk 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:39.160
 the desert and the dunes 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.160
 a sound of African percussion 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.989
 an experience as one that happened 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.459
 practically every day in class and 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.890
 is when I say something that excites me if 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.330
 I put the willies all is that 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.560
 I do not change it 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.560
 per minute
