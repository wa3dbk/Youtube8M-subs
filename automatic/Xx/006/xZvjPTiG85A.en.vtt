hard with throttle and steering compare

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.250 
hard with throttle and steering compare
the<00:02:23.730> three<00:02:23.760> modes<00:02:24.239> are<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.629> same<00:02:24.870> corner

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
the three modes are on the same corner

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
the three modes are on the same corner
and<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.160> how<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.459> standard<00:02:27.000> sports

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
and you can see how the standard sports

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.809 
and you can see how the standard sports
setting<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.900> obviously<00:02:28.530> slowest<00:02:29.069> but<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
setting is obviously slowest but the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.490 
setting is obviously slowest but the
middle<00:02:30.060> race<00:02:30.269> mode<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.810> only<00:02:31.110> marginally

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
middle race mode is only marginally

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530 
middle race mode is only marginally
slower<00:02:31.980> than<00:02:32.459> when<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.760> turn<00:02:32.970> everything<00:02:33.209> off

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
slower than when you turn everything off

it's<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.500> race<00:02:34.800> setting<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.700> think<00:02:35.940> is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
it's this race setting that I think is

it's this race setting that I think is
the<00:02:36.209> key<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.019> f430<00:02:37.739> being<00:02:38.550> truly<00:02:38.879> great
