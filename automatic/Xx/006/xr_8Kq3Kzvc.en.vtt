00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi to all this is the room I am in 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.310
 double company is making fun of and so the one 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.099
 who is in the session with me that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
 and today we will talk about the unknown 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.469
 of the pink tow 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.179
 so why do not we give a name to this 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.530
 character it's just because they 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.049
 change appearance each time 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
 find him on this tower there are two 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.100
 important things to note about the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.390
 Tower is the first that many 11 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.730
 is well highlighted on the roof 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.730
 but also the message we will find 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.680
 down the building v6 broken duck 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.960
 internity with the american flag 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.480
 right next what means this is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.130
 broken or broken is what I can you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.899
 so make it before you give my 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.250
 explanation in relation to the message that 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.170
 ensure the wall at the bottom of the building 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.879
 yahoo make fun who will give you his 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.020
 explanation about the person 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.350
 found on the roof 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 yeah I think the audi person 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.190
 at the death of the tron it is a person 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.710
 who simply wants to commit suicide 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.170
 frequently happens in the united states in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.120
 the big towers it raises relative 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 to debt problems of family 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 that these rates etc 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.300
 Forgiveness is surely for retirement 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 more attention he ended the illicit 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.540
 what ok and so why did they 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.680
 it's happening to me why he's committing suicide 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.880
 marc must know that the United States 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 it's not like France it's not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.680
 as with us there are many people 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.980
 per square kilometer at work level 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.620
 it's a little 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.810
 it's a little hot what the best 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.320
 succeed in life poor poor 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.690
 they are sorry but are in shit 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.590
 and he ends up either in the street under with 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.290
 money problems 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 they do not have a mutual like us 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.430
 have not you finally brief there are plenty of 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.190
 reasons that push them to six ideas and 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.540
 I think that's okay with the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.850
 louey's creation message then on the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.400
 wall so that's broken it can be 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.110
 everything and anything except that there they 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.830
 put the American flag right at 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.810
 side so he speaks well of the united states 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.220
 this message he clearly announces that the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.440
 united states are not what they 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.560
 should have been or are no longer 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.630
 that they were it announces that they have 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.210
 lost something so that could 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.410
 to be their humanity their credibility their 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.420
 course of action 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.310
 no matter there is something that 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.620
 broke down and they want to make the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 united states to which belongs to them or the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.250
 to return to humanity simply 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.830
 anyway no the message is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 clear the country is hurting and the people that 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.510
 rockstar seems to represent well 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.490
 wants to put the country back in 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.980
 best hands 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.780
 so why is this message this 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.489
 becomes too political for a simple 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.260
 game maybe well 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.450
 so we're not going to run out any longer 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.580
 on the question it can quickly become a 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.410
 endless debate especially if you follow 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.590
 the world news of these last 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.790
 years and current after free to you by 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.459
 Following up give your opinion in 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.470
 comment to tell me why you 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.170
 think that the united states have broken 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.030
 and why the people want to make the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.500
 country 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.280
 so to get back to the person who 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.930
 is on the roof 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.150
 she circles in circles for a long 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.440
 moment she's talking on the phone to a 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 at a given moment she's doing enough things 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.489
 weird sometimes she does it so 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.070
 more accelerated as if it were 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.450
 panicked and at some point she ends 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.430
 by committing suicide so we followed him 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.880
 for a long time and she jumps from 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.850
 the building 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.590
 after that happens more or less quickly depending 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.330
 the person who appears on the roof 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.800
 since she has an appearance 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.750
 different each time she has a 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.260
 behavior also that is a little 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.820
 different 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.160
 so here's the little story 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.170
 troubling of tower 11 and 2 are 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.040
 unknown and on that I tell you to the 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.459
 next 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.459
 ciao
