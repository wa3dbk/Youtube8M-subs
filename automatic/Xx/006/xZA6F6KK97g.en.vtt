00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
quite a while ago but we've been working

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.179 
quite a while ago but we've been working
on<00:00:17.820> airline<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> long<00:00:19.410> time<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.680> we've

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
on airline to for a long time and we've

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.189 
on airline to for a long time and we've
completely<00:00:20.760> upgrade<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.359> graphic<00:00:21.630> system

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
completely upgrade of the graphic system

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.230 
completely upgrade of the graphic system
we're<00:00:22.529> using<00:00:22.680> unity<00:00:23.010> 5<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.880> real<00:00:24.090> time

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
we're using unity 5 now for real time

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.950 
we're using unity 5 now for real time
shadows<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.490> cloth<00:00:26.490> physics<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.869> example

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
shadows and cloth physics for example

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.009 
shadows and cloth physics for example
the<00:00:28.769> Cape<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.220> he's<00:00:29.340> using<00:00:29.869> we're<00:00:30.869> using

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
the Cape that he's using we're using

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.540 
the Cape that he's using we're using
speed<00:00:31.410> tree<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> our<00:00:32.279> tree

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
speed tree to do all of our tree

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.840 
speed tree to do all of our tree
rendering<00:00:33.110> most<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.230> our<00:00:34.350> tree<00:00:34.530> rendering<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
rendering most of our tree rendering so

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.889 
rendering most of our tree rendering so
it<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:39.210> wind<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it can it can actually use the wind and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
it can it can actually use the wind and
other<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> lighting<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.670> actually

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
other you know the lighting and actually

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.200 
other you know the lighting and actually
affect<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> trees<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> leaves<00:00:44.210> we've

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
affect the trees and the leaves we've

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
affect the trees and the leaves we've
got<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.629> very<00:00:46.079> large<00:00:46.350> world<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.860> explore<00:00:47.190> which

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
got a very large world to explore which

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.540 
got a very large world to explore which
will<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.760> three<00:00:48.059> continents<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:50.520> now

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
will have three continents so right now

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.270 
will have three continents so right now
I'm<00:00:50.760> exploring<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.690> forest<00:00:52.530> area<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I'm exploring a forest area and you can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
I'm exploring a forest area and you can
see<00:00:53.520> we've<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:54.230> tons<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.379> foliage<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:57.680> bump

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
see we've got tons of foliage and bump

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.810 
see we've got tons of foliage and bump
mapping<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> ground<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.879> happy<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
mapping on the ground I'm happy on the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.160 
mapping on the ground I'm happy on the
cliff<00:01:02.450> walls<00:01:04.540> looking<00:01:05.540> for<00:01:05.750> an<00:01:05.810> enemy<00:01:06.050> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
cliff walls looking for an enemy to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.820 
cliff walls looking for an enemy to
fight<00:01:06.200> I've<00:01:07.130> got<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> bunch<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:08.560> skills<00:01:09.560> at<00:01:09.770> the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
fight I've got a bunch of skills at the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.350 
fight I've got a bunch of skills at the
bottom<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:10.910> can<00:01:11.060> activate

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:23.740 

let's<00:01:14.960> see<00:01:15.110> if<00:01:15.230> I<00:01:15.350> can<00:01:15.380> attack<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:23.600> right

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
let's see if I can attack this so right

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.380 
let's see if I can attack this so right
now<00:01:23.780> I'm<00:01:23.990> exploring<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.590> cave<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:25.210> one<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
now I'm exploring a cave and one of the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.850 
now I'm exploring a cave and one of the
cool<00:01:26.570> new<00:01:26.690> things<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.080> we<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:27.230> done<00:01:27.290> here

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
cool new things that we have done here

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.140 
cool new things that we have done here
is<00:01:28.450> we<00:01:29.450> have<00:01:29.480> torch<00:01:30.320> lighting<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:32.000> light

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
is we have torch lighting and the light

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.460 
is we have torch lighting and the light
from<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> torch<00:01:32.600> actually<00:01:33.020> affects<00:01:33.350> the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
from the torch actually affects the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.740 
from the torch actually affects the
shadows<00:01:33.860> in<00:01:34.010> real<00:01:34.160> time<00:01:34.450> something<00:01:35.450> new<00:01:35.570> that

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
shadows in real time something new that

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.890 
shadows in real time something new that
we<00:01:36.310> I've<00:01:37.310> added<00:01:37.580> since<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.060> last<00:01:38.240> airline<00:01:38.690> we

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
we I've added since the last airline we

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.230 
we I've added since the last airline we
did<00:01:39.050> have<00:01:39.340> real-time<00:01:40.340> lighting<00:01:40.940> in<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.090> last

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
did have real-time lighting in the last

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.540 
did have real-time lighting in the last
airline<00:01:41.660> but<00:01:41.840> now<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:42.170> he<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:42.920> moving<00:01:43.280> real

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
airline but now that he is moving real

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.040 
airline but now that he is moving real
time<00:01:43.760> lights<00:01:43.970> can<00:01:44.180> actually<00:01:44.450> cast<00:01:44.660> shadows

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
time lights can actually cast shadows

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.050 
time lights can actually cast shadows
and<00:01:45.290> makes<00:01:46.070> for<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.280> much<00:01:46.400> more<00:01:46.610> dramatic

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and makes for a much more dramatic

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:02.399 
and makes for a much more dramatic
effect

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.180 

when<00:02:03.070> are<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.219> planning<00:02:03.340> on<00:02:03.579> lunch

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
when are you planning on lunch

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.540 
when are you planning on lunch
we're<00:02:06.000> planning<00:02:06.330> on<00:02:06.450> launching<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.930> game

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
we're planning on launching the game

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.760 
we're planning on launching the game
either<00:02:08.550> late<00:02:08.880> spring<00:02:09.240> or<00:02:09.360> early<00:02:09.420> summer<00:02:09.770> okay

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
either late spring or early summer okay

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.730 
either late spring or early summer okay
it'll<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.460> freemium<00:02:12.300> title<00:02:12.830> 699<00:02:13.830> most<00:02:14.100> likely

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.230 

so<00:02:19.740> I'm<00:02:19.830> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:19.980> go<00:02:20.070> into<00:02:20.250> my<00:02:22.940> skills<00:02:23.940> bar

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
so I'm going to go into my skills bar

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.540 
so I'm going to go into my skills bar
and<00:02:26.030> or<00:02:27.030> my<00:02:27.150> skill<00:02:27.390> tree<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.630> guess<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.490> about<00:02:29.490> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
and or my skill tree I guess and about a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and or my skill tree I guess and about a
whole<00:02:29.760> new<00:02:30.360> set<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.600> options<00:02:30.870> here<00:02:32.390> got<00:02:33.390> two

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
whole new set of options here got two

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.000 
whole new set of options here got two
points<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.050> i<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.290> actually<00:02:34.410> upgrade<00:02:34.920> my

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
points so i can actually upgrade my

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.600 
points so i can actually upgrade my
frost<00:02:38.010> shard

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.660 

because<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.150> way

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.420

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
to zoom so you can zoom right into your

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.960 
to zoom so you can zoom right into your
character<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.420> first<00:03:09.659> person<00:03:10.019> view<00:03:10.170> and

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
character to see first person view and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.470 
character to see first person view and
you<00:03:11.970> can<00:03:12.120> also<00:03:12.569> zoom<00:03:12.810> way<00:03:13.230> out<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:15.030> get<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> much

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
you can also zoom way out to get a much

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.700 
you can also zoom way out to get a much
better<00:03:15.510> view<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:16.110> your<00:03:16.200> character

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.140 

so<00:03:21.710> you<00:03:21.770> can<00:03:21.920> completely<00:03:22.370> move<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.700> camera<00:03:22.910> in

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
so you can completely move the camera in

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.570 
so you can completely move the camera in
the<00:03:23.240> middle<00:03:23.480> point<00:03:23.750> yeah<00:03:24.050> and<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:25.400> know<00:03:25.430> of

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
the middle point yeah and you know of

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.940 
the middle point yeah and you know of
course<00:03:25.760> swimming<00:03:26.150> like<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:27.260> old<00:03:27.380> Arrowhead

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
course swimming like the old Arrowhead

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.980 
course swimming like the old Arrowhead
swimming<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:30.850> think<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.000> game's<00:03:32.210> longer<00:03:32.660> or

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
swimming I think the game's longer or

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.300 
swimming I think the game's longer or
shorter<00:03:33.760> than<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.970> meara's<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.020> here<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.470> think

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
shorter than the meara's on here I think

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.620 
shorter than the meara's on here I think
right<00:03:37.550> now<00:03:37.670> it's<00:03:37.820> kind<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.060> hard<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.360> say

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
right now it's kind of hard to say

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.820 
right now it's kind of hard to say
because<00:03:39.520> we're<00:03:40.520> still<00:03:40.730> doing<00:03:40.910> quests<00:03:41.300> and

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
because we're still doing quests and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.590 
because we're still doing quests and
story<00:03:42.830> stuff<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.460> I<00:03:43.760> can't<00:03:44.240> really<00:03:44.390> give<00:03:44.570> a

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
story stuff so I can't really give a

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.720 
story stuff so I can't really give a
final<00:03:45.260> answer<00:03:45.710> on<00:03:45.740> that<00:03:45.860> we're<00:03:46.400> trying<00:03:46.610> to

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
final answer on that we're trying to

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.090 
final answer on that we're trying to
make<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:47.180> as<00:03:47.630> much<00:03:47.810> content<00:03:48.050> as<00:03:48.320> possible<00:03:48.860> but

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
make it as much content as possible but

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.000 
make it as much content as possible but
the<00:03:50.060> final<00:03:50.510> number<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.990> hours<00:03:51.350> we<00:03:51.860> won't

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
the final number of hours we won't

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:05.559 
the final number of hours we won't
really<00:03:52.160> know<00:03:52.310> until<00:03:52.490> we're<00:03:53.150> done<00:03:53.360> most<00:03:54.140> likely

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.410 

jennifer<00:04:05.870> first<00:04:06.170> person

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
I always frozen is frozen so you have to

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.030 
I always frozen is frozen so you have to
move<00:04:13.970> back<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.330> then<00:04:14.420> he'll<00:04:14.780> attack<00:04:15.110> again
