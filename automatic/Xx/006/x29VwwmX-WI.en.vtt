00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hey guys today we are going to compare

hey guys today we are going to compare
the<00:00:02.190> Lenovo<00:00:02.700> y50<00:00:03.090> against<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.840> year<00:00:03.990> old<00:00:04.200> Wi-Fi

10p the price almost similarly and

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.960 
10p the price almost similarly and
perform<00:00:07.230> almost<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.620> same<00:00:07.859> yet<00:00:08.490> they<00:00:08.910> are

was<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.519> y50<00:00:11.940> comparison<00:00:12.480> video<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.230> let's

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
was the y50 comparison video so let's

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.030 
was the y50 comparison video so let's
get<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.679> it

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
