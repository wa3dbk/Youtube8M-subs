 we saw in the program pachito true the 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.769
 theme of the magpie is worth the little animal 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.080
 the magpie that is a species of raven 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.269
 as you all remember in my 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.280
 documentaries about the not that I have them 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.779

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.160

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.590

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.840
 opportunity to record in one of 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.380

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.140
 record preening and can dance 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.930

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.430
 although the camera seems to have 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.500
 parkinson but clearly with the zoom does not 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.560
 I can record there is a video a documentary 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.600
 a mini animal scene with a lot 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.210
 professionalism of agreement because of course 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.370
 as it turns out that we are still a 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.560
 tiny channel because we do not have no 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.380
 we have to be able to have all those 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.090
 cameras with image stabilizers and 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.320
 with all those cameras with those big ones 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.320
 objectives 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.030
 sound collectors those microphones 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.670
 like the cameras are coming out 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.550

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.850

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.140
 around the world and so on so good 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.210
