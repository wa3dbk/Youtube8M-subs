I've colored the windshield from inside

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.630 
I've colored the windshield from inside
black<00:00:41.329> looks<00:00:42.329> pretty<00:00:42.600> cool<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> only<00:00:44.489> reason

black looks pretty cool the only reason

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.459 
black looks pretty cool the only reason
why<00:00:44.940> they<00:00:45.210> give<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> transparent

why they give you a transparent

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290 
why they give you a transparent
windshield<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.370> when<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> lean<00:00:48.270> down

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
for racing position you can see through

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.279 
for racing position you can see through
