00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.040
 Vlada mialjevic you still have an interlocutor who looks rather strange ... 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
 Here novak Djokovic here with a new look and the Serbian emblem on the head. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 an incredible feeling next to a grand slam and 18 titles this is unheard of. 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 This is the biggest success in a career 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.320
 in mine individually, as in that of my colleagues. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.640
 of our team and our nation. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.480
 I believe this is the greatest sporting feat we have managed to achieve. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.520
 and we are not yet aware of it, especially for a nation that has never been a tennis nation until now. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 the enormity of success. 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.600
 Believe me this is the football world championship for us. 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.440
 this is incredible, in front of our audience 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 to take advantage of the opportunity 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.080
 to come back from a 2-1 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.440
 loser, and play Sunday two match in singles 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.120
 as we play them and under pressure 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.120
 in these circumstances 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.880
 I dunno; I do not know what to say 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 this is brilliant, fascinating, fantastic 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.160
 I do not really know 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.080
 so many emotions that will precede the party. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.480
 It's as if you had a semi-final or final World Cup, 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.880
 were losing at half-time 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.440
 and then you would triumph over what is incredible! 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 you know what, 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.680
 it's probably ... the players ... 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.080
 who were commenting on something very important 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.680
 which concerns our national team. 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.880
 and I will repeat it 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.800
 and that's the friendship we've created and nurtured 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.080
 since many years 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.840
 and not only on the field during the Davis Cup ... 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.960
 even in all other tournaments, off the field too 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.520
 in privacy, we advise each other 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.120
 we are friends for life 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.520
 because we feel, we share positive energies together 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.520
 because we feel, we share positive energies together 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.280
 and these vibrations, that's why we managed this 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.680
 we are the strongest, THAT SAY !!!, we are the masters !!! 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.520
 I think you have to go to the cloakroom 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.680
 to prepare for the presentation of the cup 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.440
 or are we celebrating tonight? 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.600
 we celebrate it in the streets of Belgrade! 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.080
 what do you believe to the city center 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.920
 naked !!, I do not know ... 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.920
 what to say ... I apologize after the public ...
