00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
hit it it was everything those guys had

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.180 
hit it it was everything those guys had
to<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.850> make<00:01:53.030> that<00:01:53.210> happen<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:54.830> just<00:01:55.039> can't

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
to to make that happen I just can't

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.279 
to to make that happen I just can't
think<00:01:55.430> enough<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.880> mean<00:01:56.000> Ozzy<00:01:56.180> was<00:01:56.690> their

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
think enough I mean Ozzy was their

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.160 
think enough I mean Ozzy was their
performance<00:01:57.950> then<00:01:58.390> inspired<00:01:59.390> me<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.780> go<00:02:00.020> out

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
performance then inspired me to go out

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.050 
performance then inspired me to go out
and<00:02:00.409> do<00:02:00.530> what<00:02:00.679> I<00:02:00.770> didn't<00:02:01.039> erase<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:04.399> think<00:02:04.940> that

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
and do what I didn't erase I think that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.029 
and do what I didn't erase I think that
makes<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.420> lot<00:02:05.569> of<00:02:05.630> sense<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.259> their

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
makes a lot of sense that their

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.529 
makes a lot of sense that their
performance<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.759> mean<00:02:07.909> really<00:02:08.090> you'll<00:02:08.300> want<00:02:08.509> to

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
performance I mean really you'll want to

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.389 
performance I mean really you'll want to
let<00:02:08.660> these<00:02:08.810> guys<00:02:09.019> down<00:02:09.259> now<00:02:09.560> yeah<00:02:09.920> they've

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
let these guys down now yeah they've

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.509 
let these guys down now yeah they've
done<00:02:10.429> everything<00:02:10.930> yeah<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.380> mean<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.800> end

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
done everything yeah and I mean that end

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.490 
done everything yeah and I mean that end
and<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.000> fact<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.840> know<00:02:14.930> going<00:02:15.200> into

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
and the fact that you know going into

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.170 
and the fact that you know going into
that<00:02:15.680> chicane<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> last<00:02:16.519> lap<00:02:16.760> we're<00:02:17.120> all

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
that chicane on the last lap we're all

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.940 
that chicane on the last lap we're all
kind<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.569> fanned<00:02:17.840> out<00:02:18.019> across<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.799> back

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
kind of fanned out across the back

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.970 
kind of fanned out across the back
straightaway<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:20.420> was<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:21.260> was<00:02:21.290> really<00:02:21.769> like

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
straightaway it was it was really like

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.570 
straightaway it was it was really like
you<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:24.260> shouldn't<00:02:24.500> even<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:24.860> here<00:02:24.920> at

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
you know we shouldn't even be here at

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.009 
you know we shouldn't even be here at
this<00:02:25.760> point<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.120> my<00:02:26.390> we've<00:02:26.630> gotten<00:02:26.989> a

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
this point this is my we've gotten a

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.930 
this point this is my we've gotten a
second<00:02:27.410> chance<00:02:27.650> we've<00:02:27.890> already<00:02:28.130> for<00:02:28.880> all

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
second chance we've already for all

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.970 
second chance we've already for all
intents<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.360> purposes<00:02:29.810> dan<00:02:30.140> em<00:02:30.350> once<00:02:30.739> today

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
intents and purposes dan em once today

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.039 
intents and purposes dan em once today
so<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.910> second<00:02:32.420> chance<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:32.900> a

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
so this is a second chance this is a

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.979 
so this is a second chance this is a
duel<00:02:33.410> let's<00:02:34.250> go<00:02:34.519> for<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.480> your<00:02:35.630> warning

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
I get back to the basics is one I really

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.149 
I get back to the basics is one I really
really<00:03:37.430> enables<00:03:38.030> elastic<00:03:38.870> safety<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.890> huge

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
really enables elastic safety is huge

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.199 
really enables elastic safety is huge
and<00:03:40.579> better<00:03:40.849> skill<00:03:41.620> absolutely<00:03:42.620> breach

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
and better skill absolutely breach

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.910 
and better skill absolutely breach
safety<00:03:44.209> riding<00:03:44.569> and<00:03:44.959> really<00:03:45.290> what<00:03:45.440> we<00:03:45.650> found

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
safety riding and really what we found

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.039 
safety riding and really what we found
two<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.579> safety

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
two is safety

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.539 
two is safety
safety<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.290> speed<00:03:50.730> much<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:52.060> safety<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.549> the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
fastest way typically coincide you know

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.850 
fastest way typically coincide you know
it's<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.840> same<00:03:59.049> techniques<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.620> are<00:03:59.680> going

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
it's the same techniques that are going

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.080 
it's the same techniques that are going
to<00:03:59.920> make<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:00.250> fastest<00:04:00.700> around<00:04:01.000> the

other<00:06:08.229> than<00:06:08.379> having<00:06:08.829> a<00:06:08.919> death<00:06:09.099> grip<00:06:09.309> and

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
other than having a death grip and

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.879 
other than having a death grip and
getting<00:06:10.569> your<00:06:10.659> arms<00:06:10.899> pumped<00:06:11.259> up<00:06:11.379> a<00:06:11.529> couple<00:06:11.739> of

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
getting your arms pumped up a couple of

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.669 
getting your arms pumped up a couple of
things<00:06:11.919> happen<00:06:12.519> and<00:06:12.999> the<00:06:13.239> biggest<00:06:13.839> thing<00:06:14.110> is

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:14.679 
things happen and the biggest thing is

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:16.409 
things happen and the biggest thing is
that<00:06:14.860> when<00:06:14.979> our<00:06:15.009> weight<00:06:15.309> goes<00:06:16.089> through<00:06:16.299> our

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
that when our weight goes through our

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.889 
that when our weight goes through our
hands<00:06:16.779> on<00:06:16.869> the<00:06:16.959> bars<00:06:17.199> we<00:06:18.069> actually<00:06:18.869> stop<00:06:19.869> the

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:19.899 
hands on the bars we actually stop the

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:22.799 
hands on the bars we actually stop the
bike<00:06:20.229> determine<00:06:20.799> that<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.849> bike<00:06:22.059> naturally

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:22.809 
bike determine that the bike naturally

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:25.139 
bike determine that the bike naturally
the<00:06:23.619> front<00:06:23.889> wheel<00:06:24.069> wants<00:06:24.399> to<00:06:24.519> fall<00:06:24.789> to<00:06:25.029> the

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:25.149 
the front wheel wants to fall to the

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:27.179 
the front wheel wants to fall to the
inside<00:06:25.479> of<00:06:25.509> the<00:06:25.659> corner<00:06:25.989> and<00:06:26.139> the<00:06:26.709> bike<00:06:26.889> wants

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:27.189 
inside of the corner and the bike wants

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:32.200 
inside of the corner and the bike wants
to<00:06:27.279> turn<00:06:27.459> around<00:06:27.579> the<00:06:29.819> corner<00:06:30.819> and

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
to turn around the corner and

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.350 
to turn around the corner and
you<00:06:32.720> know<00:06:32.810> a<00:06:33.020> bike's<00:06:33.380> going<00:06:34.009> to<00:06:34.069> go<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.910> do

implements you know can really make the

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.409 
implements you know can really make the
bike<00:07:21.800> to<00:07:21.949> turn<00:07:22.159> effective<00:07:22.580> and<00:07:22.759> that's<00:07:23.120> that's

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:23.419 
bike to turn effective and that's that's

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.070 
bike to turn effective and that's that's
exactly<00:07:23.960> the<00:07:24.080> sort<00:07:24.289> of<00:07:24.319> stuff<00:07:24.560> that<00:07:24.740> we

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
exactly the sort of stuff that we

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.680 
exactly the sort of stuff that we
it's<00:07:27.080> moving<00:07:27.440> safe
