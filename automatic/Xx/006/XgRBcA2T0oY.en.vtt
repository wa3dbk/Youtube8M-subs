00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
been dope I mean really just being I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.410 
been dope I mean really just being I
here<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.739> these<00:00:49.890> bands<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.149> as

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
here with all these bands and as

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.600 
here with all these bands and as
has<00:00:51.960> been<00:00:52.399> an<00:00:53.399> experience<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
has been an experience you know I I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.560 
has been an experience you know I I
think<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.730> dope<00:00:56.940> when<00:00:57.210> cultures<00:00:58.309> collide<00:00:59.309> or

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
think it's dope when cultures collide or

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.429 
think it's dope when cultures collide or
combine<00:01:01.039> no<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.280> together<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.080> well<00:01:04.080> not

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
combine no get together and well not

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
combine no get together and well not
really<00:01:04.799> cultures<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.430> genres<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.150> music

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
really cultures but genres of music

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.039 
really cultures but genres of music
because<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:08.970> raw<00:01:09.360> American

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
because really this is just raw American

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
because really this is just raw American
culture<00:01:10.670> most<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> kids<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.210> really

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
culture most of the kids are really

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.030 
culture most of the kids are really
cycling<00:01:12.840> hip-hop<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
cycling hip-hop and I think that that

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.230 
cycling hip-hop and I think that that
speaks<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.159> our<00:01:17.280> generation<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
speaks for our generation like the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.700 
speaks for our generation like the
reason<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:18.659> out<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:18.869> doing<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.500> is
