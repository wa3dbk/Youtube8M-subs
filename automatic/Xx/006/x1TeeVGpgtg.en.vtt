00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.970
 Good afternoon guys, a video lesson for 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:15.120
 help you on the connected external 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.870
 via usb and is recognized as 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.870
 connected 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:39.890
 but it does not appear on my computer 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:47.340
 reads safe handling of a computer 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 manage automatically appear 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.500
 computer management line 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.290
 exactly why it does not work 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:34.729
 right 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:45.600
 the new simple volume advanced wizard 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:47.280
 the maximum that the maximum size advances 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 once again attributing the letter to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 drive forward a part again 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.079
 important it is very dangerous it does not have 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 sure if it's possible 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:11.239
 the volume but I believe it can be 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.239
 possible I do not know 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.680
 but for safety 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.120
 when you have a law that worked and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.340
 has the data 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.410
 it happened in this way to 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.630
 looks like recognized but did not open 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.580
 because we are in volume 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:35.790
 you do not have the option to format this 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:38.280
 volume will not kill you while the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:46.340
 following options file system pat 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.880
 ntfs you use but it can also happen 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.720
 normally 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:58.230
 fs why is it safe? 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:10.320
 the default location and the volume label of 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:12.600
 a man in case you want external and 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:22.010
 perform a quick format for 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:24.720
 date automatically appears here O 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.140
 formatting and is already doing everything 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.870
 service and soon thereafter will release 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.690
 present looks there as a whole partition 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.620
 primary note that the magnets themselves 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.620
 by doing this 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:48.000
 showing that it is available for use and 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.800
 Going back here computer appears there 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.800
 gift can use install programs 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.820
 that you may have the same 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.130
 problem soon doing another 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.130
 video lesson has everyone a good afternoon
