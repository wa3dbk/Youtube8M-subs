00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello to all I find today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.899
 with a new video today I 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.610
 not too much time to turn you one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.870
 tutorial that you asked me at once 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.880
 I took a video that I had shot 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.309
 some time ago it's just a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.020
 gradient with holographic varnish 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 of which will find references in the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.130
 info bar and a little stamping by 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.590
 on it then tomorrow as you know 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 there will be a live at 15h on my channel 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.510
 youtube for seven who have never 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.840
 participated 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.369
 just come on the chain to 15 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.929
 hours or less a quarter and you 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.250
 find the live link you do not have 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.380
 than click on the video 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 and at 3 pm the live will start for 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 able to comment you have to be on a 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.260
 computer because on tablet and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 phone sometimes it does not work in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 the majority of cases it does not work and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.219
 you must also be connected to your 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 google account + the tale the account 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.890
 Youtube 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.989
 tomorrow we will do nail art as 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.399
 usually but we will also talk about 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.530
 the opening of the second channel 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 people who follow me on a snapshot 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.219
 you know I'm trying to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.469
 ask the question to separate the nail art 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.940
 other videos that I can do because 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.710
 that I'm a bit of a rigid psycho and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.689
 I do not really like content 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.060
 be mixed and then have some of you 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.710
 who subscribe to this channel for 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.439
 donald art and pop to see cats 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.450
 so we'll talk about that during the live 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.130
 and then you will give your impressions and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.110
 if you also have new ideas 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 it's not to make a 100% chain 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.380
 cat is not at all that the goal is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.850
 plus a channel that I could do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 videos that really do not have 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 relationship with nail art because 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.020
 sometimes you ask me but I can 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.150
 not do them and put them on this 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.450
 chain so what do you have 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.670
 more to tell you varying I did a 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.409
 instant ping with with a bundle plate 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 monster whose you see the reference on 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.820
 the video I used as black polish 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.350
 governor of chelmno threats I 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.540
 you will put the link also in the bar 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.610
 info is for me the black polish 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.409
 which best stops the only problem 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.020
 it is that it is stuffed with formaldehyde 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.490
 and even unknown composition since the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 mark refuses to give the composition 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.299
 happens but we are a majority at 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.759
 think it's paint for 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.009
 car body that smells 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.750
 absolutely horrible but hey it works 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.130
 very very well just it really takes 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.049
 not at all 100 meters on the skin it's 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.759
 for that I put latex on the turn of 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.379
 owes me more than I am 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.760
 allergic to formaldehyde 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.620
 so I just loved you a little 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.690
 excerpt for you see how we 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.260
 remove the latex but nothing very 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.239
 exciting 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.739
 so I stopped talking here 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.870
 I hope this little video you 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.700
 will have more than you spend very good 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.569
 holidays and then bah those who are not 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.030
 on holiday 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.920
 I'll meet you tomorrow so at 3 pm 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.420
 on the channel for the live I make you 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.629
 very big kisses and then I tell you 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.629
 See you tomorrow
