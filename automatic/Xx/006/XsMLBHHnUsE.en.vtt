00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.280 
lived it and gets off the earthquake and
I<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.909> actually<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.869> focus<00:01:46.170> ash

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
I go I actually take it with focus ash

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.450 
I go I actually take it with focus ash
and<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> crit<00:01:47.100> although<00:01:47.310> probably

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and that was a crit although probably

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.030 
and that was a crit although probably
didn't<00:01:47.759> matter<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.890> an

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
didn't matter and I'm going to go for an

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
didn't matter and I'm going to go for an
iron<00:01:50.430> head<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.820> own<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.780> take

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
going to go for the substitute yeah

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.859 
going to go for the substitute yeah
probably<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.729> hoping<00:02:06.030> I'll<00:02:06.180> swap<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.689> or

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
probably just hoping I'll swap out or

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.839 
probably just hoping I'll swap out or
maybe<00:02:06.990> miss<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> move<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.890> was<00:02:08.069> thinking<00:02:08.190> he

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
maybe miss a move I was thinking he

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.999 
maybe miss a move I was thinking he
might<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> lacks<00:02:09.810> distance<00:02:10.289> maybe<00:02:10.800> he's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
might be a lacks distance maybe he's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.130 
might be a lacks distance maybe he's
just<00:02:11.270> banking<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.420> Miss<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.020> he

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just banking on that Miss but he

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.790 
just banking on that Miss but he
actually

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
actually

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.020 
actually
actually<00:02:14.070> never<00:02:14.190> miss<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.730> know<00:02:14.820> that's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
actually never miss you know that's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.140 
actually never miss you know that's
great<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.070> know<00:02:17.160> substitute<00:02:17.550> fate<00:02:17.760> egos

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
great so you know substitute fate egos

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.880 
great so you know substitute fate egos
for<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.330> substitute<00:02:18.690> again<00:02:18.990> she<00:02:19.530> probably<00:02:19.770> just

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
for a substitute again she probably just

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.850 
for a substitute again she probably just
hoping<00:02:20.790> I'll<00:02:20.940> go<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.360> any<00:02:22.140> move<00:02:22.500> or<00:02:22.710> maybe

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
hoping I'll go for any move or maybe

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.650 
hoping I'll go for any move or maybe
I'll<00:02:23.010> miss<00:02:23.250> again<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.880> get<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> iron<00:02:24.420> head

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
I'll miss again I do get the iron head

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.530 
I'll miss again I do get the iron head
off<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> break<00:02:27.390> his

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
off and that is going to break his

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.150 
off and that is going to break his
substitute<00:02:27.930> again<00:02:28.380> as<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.800> super

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
substitute again as it is super

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.940 
substitute again as it is super
effective<00:02:29.550> since<00:02:30.240> he's<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.540> fairy<00:02:30.840> type<00:02:30.990> okay

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
effective since he's a fairy type okay

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
effective since he's a fairy type okay
and<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.220> he<00:02:32.280> goes<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> final<00:02:33.120> substitute

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
and so he goes for the final substitute

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.630 
and so he goes for the final substitute
that<00:02:33.660> he<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:35.100> that'll<00:02:35.310> bring<00:02:35.370> him<00:02:35.520> down

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that he can and that'll bring him down

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.220 
that he can and that'll bring him down
to<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.000> sliver<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.420> health<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.960> go<00:02:37.080> for

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
to just a sliver of health and I go for

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.260 
to just a sliver of health and I go for
not<00:02:37.410> another<00:02:37.890> iron<00:02:38.100> head<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:39.240> course

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
not another iron head and of course

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.360 
not another iron head and of course
that'll<00:02:39.660> break<00:02:39.780> his<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:40.110> again<00:02:43.130> again<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.280> know

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
that'll break his up again again to know

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.220 
that'll break his up again again to know
now<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.880> he<00:02:45.540> knew<00:02:45.690> he<00:02:45.780> was<00:02:45.900> gonna<00:02:45.990> lose

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
now it is the he knew he was gonna lose

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.630 
now it is the he knew he was gonna lose
here<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:46.800> was<00:02:46.890> nothing<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.550> he

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
here there was nothing to do so he

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.580 
here there was nothing to do so he
actually<00:02:47.760> did<00:02:48.060> forfeit<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.290> the
