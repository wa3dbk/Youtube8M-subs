00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
back this bracket it has pins you can

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
back this bracket it has pins you can
set<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.679> your<00:00:31.800> cutting<00:00:32.099> height<00:00:32.270> when<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
draw bar to the exact height that you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.920 
draw bar to the exact height that you
want<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:37.820> you<00:00:38.820> start<00:00:39.149> off<00:00:39.329> by<00:00:39.570> pulling<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
releases all the pressure off the rest

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.459 
releases all the pressure off the rest
of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> pins<00:00:45.539> will<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> real<00:00:46.110> easy<00:00:46.140> for

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of the pins will make it real easy for

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.900 
of the pins will make it real easy for
you<00:00:48.200> we're<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.610> lower

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
your mowing deck all the way down like I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
your mowing deck all the way down like I
said<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.160> releases<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.610> pressure<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
said that releases the pressure off the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.910 
said that releases the pressure off the
pins

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
pins

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.350 
pins
now<00:00:55.920> there's<00:00:56.129> two<00:00:56.280> pins<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> back<00:00:56.969> here

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360

these<00:02:50.770> are<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:51.160> rollers<00:02:51.580> what<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:51.910> can<00:02:52.120> do

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
these are on rollers what you can do

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.330 
these are on rollers what you can do
it's<00:02:52.599> not<00:02:52.780> hard<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.550> get<00:02:57.730> everything<00:02:57.849> lined<00:02:58.420> up
