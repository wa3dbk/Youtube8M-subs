through that doorbell power so you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.410

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.319 
actually left town for vacation for a
week<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.160> was<00:04:04.310> perfect<00:04:04.790> timing

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
week so it was perfect timing

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.940

I<00:04:05.360> went<00:04:05.930> ahead<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.110> set<00:04:06.320> up<00:04:06.410> all<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.650> motion

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
I went ahead and set up all the motion

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.009 
I went ahead and set up all the motion
detection<00:04:07.250> zones<00:04:07.730> inside<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.239> app<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.690> I

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
detection zones inside the app and I

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.509 
detection zones inside the app and I
actually<00:04:09.200> set<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.799> be<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> little<00:04:10.160> bit<00:04:10.310> too

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
actually set it to be a little bit too

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.090 
actually set it to be a little bit too
sensitive<00:04:10.970> checking<00:04:11.480> too<00:04:11.690> far<00:04:11.930> away<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:12.410> while

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100

when<00:04:28.900> you're<00:04:29.020> 600<00:04:29.500> miles<00:04:29.650> away<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.340> just

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
when you're 600 miles away so I just

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.460 
when you're 600 miles away so I just
dealt<00:04:31.000> with<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> lot<00:04:31.420> of<00:04:31.450> notifications<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.350> it

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
dealt with a lot of notifications and it

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.750 
dealt with a lot of notifications and it
did<00:04:32.620> give<00:04:32.830> me<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.040> chance<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.520> really

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
did give me a chance to really

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.430 
did give me a chance to really
thoroughly<00:04:34.180> test<00:04:34.660> out<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.960> battery<00:04:35.200> life

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
thoroughly test out the battery life

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.230 
thoroughly test out the battery life
after<00:04:35.950> just<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.220> few<00:04:36.250> hours<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.820> saw<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.180> the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
after just a few hours I saw that the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.600 
after just a few hours I saw that the
battery<00:04:37.480> had<00:04:37.660> increased<00:04:37.960> 100%<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:38.980> it<00:04:39.370> has

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
battery had increased 100% and it has

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.130 
battery had increased 100% and it has
stayed<00:04:39.880> there<00:04:40.180> ever<00:04:40.420> since

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
stayed there ever since

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.170 
stayed there ever since
so<00:04:41.350> definitely<00:04:42.160> wire<00:04:42.520> into<00:04:42.820> an<00:04:42.910> existing

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
so definitely wire into an existing

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.120 
so definitely wire into an existing
doorbell<00:04:43.510> if<00:04:43.780> that's<00:04:43.960> an<00:04:44.110> option<00:04:44.230> but<00:04:44.860> while

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130

decided<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.710> stand<00:05:24.010> out<00:05:24.190> on<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.400> front<00:05:24.640> porch

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
decided to stand out on the front porch

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.580 
decided to stand out on the front porch
for<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.150> few<00:05:25.330> minutes<00:05:25.600> for<00:05:25.810> whatever<00:05:26.050> reason

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
for a few minutes for whatever reason

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.320 
for a few minutes for whatever reason
and<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.980> motion<00:05:27.280> detection<00:05:27.550> caused<00:05:28.000> it<00:05:28.210> to

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
and the motion detection caused it to

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.850 
and the motion detection caused it to
capture<00:05:28.540> some<00:05:28.870> really<00:05:29.320> cool<00:05:29.470> lightning

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
capture some really cool lightning

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.830 
capture some really cool lightning

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
those videos after the initial 30 days

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.640 
those videos after the initial 30 days
you<00:05:43.450> can<00:05:43.480> either<00:05:43.780> pay<00:05:44.140> for<00:05:44.350> their<00:05:44.470> cloud

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
you can either pay for their cloud

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.190 
you can either pay for their cloud
service<00:05:45.070> at<00:05:45.280> 3<00:05:45.700> dollars<00:05:46.000> a<00:05:46.030> month<00:05:46.210> or<00:05:46.450> $30<00:05:47.080> a

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.800 
service at 3 dollars a month or $30 a
year<00:05:47.500> or<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:48.430> can<00:05:48.610> just<00:05:48.790> access<00:05:49.030> live<00:05:49.480> footage

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
year or you can just access live footage

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.450 
year or you can just access live footage
so<00:05:50.110> there<00:05:50.260> wouldn't<00:05:50.410> be<00:05:50.530> anything<00:05:50.860> recorded

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
so there wouldn't be anything recorded

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.130 
so there wouldn't be anything recorded
one<00:05:51.820> sort<00:05:52.030> of<00:05:52.090> downside<00:05:52.570> to<00:05:52.660> all<00:05:52.780> this<00:05:52.930> is

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
one sort of downside to all this is

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.350 
one sort of downside to all this is
there's<00:05:53.560> not<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> watch<00:05:54.280> Now<00:05:54.550> option<00:05:54.760> built<00:05:55.210> in

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
there's not a watch Now option built in

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.730 
there's not a watch Now option built in
so<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:55.660> only<00:05:55.780> way<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:55.960> see<00:05:56.170> what's<00:05:56.350> going<00:05:56.620> on

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
so the only way to see what's going on

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.860 
so the only way to see what's going on
is<00:05:57.040> if<00:05:57.250> motion<00:05:57.520> is<00:05:57.760> detected<00:05:57.970> or<00:05:58.540> if<00:05:58.780> the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
is if motion is detected or if the

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.660 
is if motion is detected or if the
doorbell<00:05:59.050> gets<00:05:59.380> pushed<00:05:59.590> not<00:06:00.070> really<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.460> big

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
doorbell gets pushed not really a big

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.640 
doorbell gets pushed not really a big
deal<00:06:00.850> since<00:06:01.180> usually<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:02.050> only<00:06:02.290> time<00:06:02.470> you'd

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
deal since usually the only time you'd

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.200 
deal since usually the only time you'd
be<00:06:02.740> interested<00:06:02.920> in<00:06:03.190> watching<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.760> if<00:06:03.910> someone

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
be interested in watching is if someone

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.150 
be interested in watching is if someone
is<00:06:04.240> actually<00:06:04.630> coming<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:05.080> your<00:06:05.230> door<00:06:05.530> but<00:06:06.040> it

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
is actually coming to your door but it

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.800 
is actually coming to your door but it
is<00:06:06.190> an<00:06:06.400> option<00:06:06.700> I<00:06:06.760> wouldn't<00:06:07.060> mind<00:06:07.240> seeing<00:06:07.540> and

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
is an option I wouldn't mind seeing and

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.840 
is an option I wouldn't mind seeing and
that<00:06:08.140> said<00:06:08.380> once<00:06:08.710> my<00:06:08.860> cloud<00:06:09.100> service<00:06:09.460> expires

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
that said once my cloud service expires

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.520 
that said once my cloud service expires
I'm<00:06:10.180> probably<00:06:10.750> going<00:06:10.960> to<00:06:11.020> give<00:06:11.170> it<00:06:11.260> a<00:06:11.320> shot

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
I'm probably going to give it a shot

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.530 
I'm probably going to give it a shot
without<00:06:11.890> the<00:06:12.100> recorded<00:06:12.580> clips<00:06:12.700> just<00:06:13.270> to<00:06:13.360> see

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
without the recorded clips just to see

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.240 
without the recorded clips just to see
how<00:06:13.660> it<00:06:13.780> works<00:06:13.960> out<00:06:14.110> but<00:06:14.680> I've<00:06:14.800> got<00:06:14.980> a<00:06:15.010> feeling

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
how it works out but I've got a feeling

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.800 
how it works out but I've got a feeling
that<00:06:15.490> I'm<00:06:15.640> gonna<00:06:15.760> end<00:06:15.880> up<00:06:16.120> coming<00:06:16.420> back<00:06:16.450> for

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
that I'm gonna end up coming back for

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.300 
that I'm gonna end up coming back for
their<00:06:16.900> paid<00:06:17.110> service<00:06:17.500> after<00:06:17.770> a<00:06:17.800> short<00:06:18.070> time

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
their paid service after a short time

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.730 
their paid service after a short time
because<00:06:19.090> it<00:06:19.210> is<00:06:19.240> really<00:06:19.780> handy<00:06:20.230> in<00:06:20.350> case<00:06:20.380> you

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
because it is really handy in case you

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.320 
because it is really handy in case you
