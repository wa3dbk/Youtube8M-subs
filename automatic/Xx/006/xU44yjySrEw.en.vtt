 district inside do not worry this 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.400
 folder if it contains the games but 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.400

 folders bring it and this program to the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.330
 other folders to read the game so I 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.690
 simply drag in the folder to 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.110
 where it says did or 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.730

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.540
 copy and paste nothing 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.970
 do not scare us if you do not see the games that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.900
 in some downloads it may be that they 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.959
 come out as well as for example 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.910
 we unload mario bros and we will leave 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:14.410
 directly like this 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.410
 I'll give you an example with mario bros 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.519

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:08.760
