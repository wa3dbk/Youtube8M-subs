what it should be so if you round up two

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.290 
what it should be so if you round up two
hundred<00:00:27.590> seventy<00:00:28.009> eight<00:00:28.040> it<00:00:28.730> becomes<00:00:29.059> three

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
hundred seventy eight it becomes three

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.630

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
kind of see something similar on one of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.500 
kind of see something similar on one of
our<00:02:19.100> sets<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.760> did<00:02:19.880> not<00:02:19.970> copy<00:02:20.240> that

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
design on this where or these exhaust

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.710 
design on this where or these exhaust
pipes<00:03:31.130> are<00:03:31.340> if<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.910> flip<00:03:32.120> those<00:03:32.240> down<00:03:32.510> you

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
pipes are if you flip those down you

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.110

like about that but otherwise it's okay

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.690 
like about that but otherwise it's okay
now<00:03:39.290> usually<00:03:39.650> there<00:03:39.980> should<00:03:40.130> be<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> circular

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.120 
now usually there should be a circular
piece<00:03:40.970> there<00:03:41.270> that<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:42.080> that's<00:03:42.350> not<00:03:42.620> after<00:03:43.100> I

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
piece there that but that's not after I

like<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.660> saw<00:04:58.840> this<00:04:59.740> circular<00:05:00.610> piece<00:05:00.820> here<00:05:01.600> I

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
like you saw this circular piece here I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.110 
like you saw this circular piece here I
was<00:05:02.560> missing<00:05:02.889> off<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.070> back<00:05:03.460> of<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.850> truck

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
was missing off the back of the truck

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.650 
was missing off the back of the truck
because<00:05:04.630> usually<00:05:05.110> when<00:05:05.620> you<00:05:05.740> pull<00:05:06.070> off<00:05:06.660> this

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
because usually when you pull off this

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.600 
because usually when you pull off this
from<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.950> base<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.820> takes<00:05:10.660> off<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.610> thing

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
from the base it takes off the thing

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.129 
from the base it takes off the thing
with<00:05:12.760> it<00:05:12.850> otherwise<00:05:13.180> in<00:05:13.510> that<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.840> stays<00:05:14.110> in

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
with it otherwise in that it stays in

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.930 
with it otherwise in that it stays in
usually<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:16.289> yes<00:05:17.289> I<00:05:17.590> like<00:05:18.010> this<00:05:18.160> very<00:05:18.669> much

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
usually and yes I like this very much

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.550 
usually and yes I like this very much
the<00:05:19.300> design<00:05:19.570> was<00:05:19.720> excellent<00:05:20.910> um<00:05:22.229> one<00:05:23.229> point

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
the design was excellent um one point

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.400 
the design was excellent um one point
though<00:05:23.770> is<00:05:24.039> for<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.340> size<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.810> back<00:05:26.199> of

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
though is for the size of the back of

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.520 
though is for the size of the back of
the<00:05:26.500> truck<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.419> trailer<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:29.199> should<00:05:29.410> have

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
the truck the trailer you should have

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.510 
the truck the trailer you should have
had<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.310> little<00:05:30.880> or<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.300> few<00:05:31.780> more<00:05:32.020> Lego<00:05:32.950> boxes

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
had a little or a few more Lego boxes

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.730 
had a little or a few more Lego boxes
you<00:05:34.060> know<00:05:34.180> because<00:05:35.080> nine<00:05:35.729> barely<00:05:36.729> even<00:05:40.740> two

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
you know because nine barely even two

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:51.570 
you know because nine barely even two
inches<00:05:44.280> all<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.340> extra<00:05:45.789> space<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:50.460> have<00:05:51.460> to

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
inches all the extra space so I have to

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.170 
inches all the extra space so I have to
say<00:05:51.820> they<00:05:52.030> should<00:05:52.270> yes<00:05:52.780> included<00:05:53.440> more<00:05:53.650> and

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
say they should yes included more and

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.760 
say they should yes included more and
other<00:05:55.180> than<00:05:55.450> that<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.960> set<00:05:56.260> is<00:05:56.289> very<00:05:56.979> good<00:05:57.340> and

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
other than that the set is very good and

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.839 
other than that the set is very good and
alright<00:05:59.770> so<00:05:59.919> this<00:06:00.039> is<00:06:00.190> proportional<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.700> have<00:06:00.789> a

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
alright so this is proportional I have a

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:08.760 
alright so this is proportional I have a
night<00:06:01.000> sunny

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.830
