00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
for a number of reasons musically I

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.560

think<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.370> brought<00:01:30.580> together<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.180> best<00:01:31.390> of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
think it brought together the best of

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.370 
think it brought together the best of
thrash<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.470> melodic<00:01:33.010> part<00:01:34.080> writing<00:01:35.080> big

hooky<00:01:36.130> riffs<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.440> record<00:01:38.710> really

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
hooky riffs and that record really

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.740 
hooky riffs and that record really
launched<00:01:39.580> us<00:01:39.700> into<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.000> mainstream<00:01:40.240> which

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
launched us into the mainstream which

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.150 
launched us into the mainstream which
opened<00:01:41.110> up<00:01:41.230> a<00:01:41.320> lot<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.650> other<00:01:41.800> opportunities

and things for us to do but and more
importantly<00:01:45.760> I<00:01:45.850> think<00:01:45.910> than<00:01:46.180> all<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.570> is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
importantly I think than all of that is

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.540 
importantly I think than all of that is
that<00:01:47.020> what<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.230> a<00:01:47.260> really<00:01:47.620> cool<00:01:47.830> time<00:01:48.220> when<00:01:48.430> we

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
that what is a really cool time when we

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.190
