00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.109
 long ago but today there is 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.429
 again a favorite video of me and 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.860
 I thought for the next time 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.900
 I'm going only every two months as 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.549
 turn them to my favorites because of me 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.350
 but always the same products 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.940
 so I can not use you in that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 such a short distance always new 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.109
 Show products and then you have to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 not so boring is he coming 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.400
 just just every 200 a podium and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.019
 I apologize for the loud 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.269
 background noise but outside 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.610
 play two kindergarten groups and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.430
 in the house with me is also drilled 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 but what should I do 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 But now we come to the favorites and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 I have you in the last months 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.239
 yes already from the mhd cleansing bvb fans 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.399
 and I think about that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.629
 four months and then absolutely had to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.489
 a replacement 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.770
 and I definitely wanted to go back 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.969
 to a classic bandwidth and to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.949
 luck I already had a replacement 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.480
 ready and that the take on the day 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 off-road vehicle from the premier 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.190
 And that is actually in principle 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.780
 exactly the same as the mhd cleansing 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.290
 bar 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.000
 However, he is not rich 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.700
 essential oil but rather up 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.950
 chemical base but good for 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.880
 Sensitive skin and yes, actually 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.439
 to the acne prone skin and the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.580
 remove the make-up at least as well 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.119
 good as the one having the small 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.590
 ring ground 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 But you need a lot of Berlin 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.299
 I have less feeling so less 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 just to make the complete make up of the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.000
 to get a face 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.189
 the only thing that bothers me so much 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.799
 The problem with clinic is that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.020
 Residues of kieran doe a lot 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.200
 So it's harder to remove 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.850
 you have to scratch a lot and that is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.430
 not so good so that's just real 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.400
 so the bonus at the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.200
 mhh but at least that is just 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.390
 So totally professional is it is not the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.520
 rather unpleasant it smells now 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.170
 not so the driving par excellence though 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.880
 As far as cleaning is concerned, that is what I am allowed to do 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.670
 product very very good and the face 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.800
 just feels very clean and 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.850
 Hainan is also much cheaper than that 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.200
 from mad 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.450
 So you should definitely go 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.010
 Try to get to the next one 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.630
 Product and that there is a lipstick 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.190
 and I already have that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.020
 I only have that for a long time 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.850
 actually not really noticed 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.560
 and never really worn because I always 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.630
 to another certain lipstick 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 have resorted namely it is this 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.480
 lipstick from quito in the pfarre 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.730
 valentine and that's a real thing 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.860
 red so in contrast to the lipstick 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.459
 from advertising to the room grab the yes 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.700
 very 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.760
 What is stich is the rather neutral to 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.709
 just more so to the unterton and the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.260
 Time to wear outlets 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.880
 So just in everyday life a layer 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.650
 and then once with the handkerchief 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.180
 over it the finish on the market becomes 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.239
 that always has a bit of color 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.380
 ringback tone now so loud that on 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.940
 to have the lips and the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.030
 Face Paint then looked the same way 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.660
 fresher so yes somehow 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.780
 exactly my currently drive the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.100
 Actually, if that's not the case 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.230
 sealed off with the handkerchief 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.670
 So completely normal, maybe even 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.950
 More than you have to share 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.470
 take care that he does not bleed because 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.750
 he is very creamy and yes sees 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.730
 already very blurry I say 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.739
 then on her at least lipliner 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.470
 drive or just watch but otherwise 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.640
 the color and also the wearing feeling 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.160
 do not dry out at all 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.290
 he is clearly a favorite now 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.549
 january and february when i was the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.920
 favorite is also a pretty old one 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.500
 product and indeed it is this nail polish 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.110
 from topshop in the color and have 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.840
 I will buy if there in the first place 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.049
 make-up has brought out so in may 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.750
 2010 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.430
 and I made it somehow 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.140
 nail polish to order online 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.969
 Actually, you can stick to the nail long 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.590
 do not order by quad at each 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.540
 I had the luck and he has 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.400
 then go and that's pretty 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.980
 Surprisingly that 's just so old 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.620
 and still looking for is still applicable 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.739
 So that does not mean miserable clubs 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.829
 or dried up but as new and 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.469
 The color is just what I am right now 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:09.530
 So speaks a cross is never there would 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.629
 I say fits fits all 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.680
 weak to everything for you and he stops 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.689
 also very good 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.699
 unfortunately exactly this situation remains 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.310
 not available anymore but recently 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.259
 ta reader had just one color on 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.300
 The nails we had here 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.280
 hands was held together by two 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.599
 exactly the same color 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.520
 I'll write to you anyway 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.560
 in return ochs which nail polish 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.050
 That was the color I think 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.930
 at the moment winter is trying to spring 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.220
 to transition my perfect right 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.900
 next few quiet quite atypical 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.449
 I think I have now 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.310
 only women mascara and there I have 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.620
 lately often to the baby 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.740
 thursday from left salon gripped and 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.000
 Although in the black color and have 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.120
 I just tried it that way 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.740
 otherwise we would like to wear the cover 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.659
 with a rubber brush and the 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.060
 trendconcept extends the but 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.889
 at the same time very good and that has 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.229
 actually try me the first time 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.729
 are immediately convinced and therefore have 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.010
 the last months quite like 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.530
 although I supported him not what none 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.810
 but tell yet just fine 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.349
 extended and equalized 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.210
 eyelashes 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.430
 that's why it was not quite so for me 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.930
 dramatic as I always find it 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.090
 and I'll give you a picture 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.590
 book are also it had so that 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.539
 the look as you can as the result on 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.789
 Main eyelashes look like I have you 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.259
 ever something cavasin very subjective 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.630
 So her can simply super 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.729
 Do not look at someone else again 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.590
 but me it just has now 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.710
 I'm very surprised that I come to the more often 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.380
 times had and generally was the last 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.620
 two months 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.940
 somehow the time for old treasures and 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.800
 then this time I have a favorite again 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.960
 it was not at all with how much 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.810
 that has one thing on it 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.090
 Charging cable for the iphone namely the 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.800
 of outraged and that comes in so 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.550
 different colors therefore I have 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.720
 now the black and white and that the 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.060
 standard variant people expresses but 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.090
 a four cool variant and one 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.710
 that is twice as long is two meters 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.850
 and that's just how convenient I am 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.620
 Remember me and that I'm not easy 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.210
 the double length exactly does it like 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.370
 Often you are annoyed that the cable is not 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.040
 until then right where you own it and 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.680
 that happens when you expected 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.470
 not and totally practical is also 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.050
 Do not be so difficult if you do it 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.700
 want to take it with you or something and so on 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.160
 There are also many different ones 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.480
 I'll definitely paint you 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.460
 link in the infobox 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.040
 the selection is quite good they are 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.810
 just a lot prettier than that 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.640
 standard on charging cable when you 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.020
 Now the standard variant is called 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.330
 not so much more expensive 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.640
 and I think they just a lot 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.680
 are more robust than those of apple 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.570
 because we stop here right now 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.570
 broken very quickly and that 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.940
 So I'm really aware of it 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.650
 case recommendable and just nice so 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.780
 that you have all my favorites in the 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.850
 I would only have one thing last month 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.520
 and willingly soon such a question 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.140
 answer make video there you can 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.120
 In any case, leave your questions 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.700
 you also no matter which channels on 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.430
 facebook instagram twitter or now 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.860
 right at the comments stopped me 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.900
 best times or write the hashtag 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.819
 and all my channels come right in 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.080

 I'll put you down in the infobox 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.349
 So just ask what you guys like that 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.360

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.689
 to answer many of them 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.159
 and then I hope you have that 

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:29.520
 fell here and we'll see you then 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.520
 next week 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.389
 and that fell away from this 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:54.860
 enter into 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:57.250
 the whole principle but on everyone 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.250
 case missing
