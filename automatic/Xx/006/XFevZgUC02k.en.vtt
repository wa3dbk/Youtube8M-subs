00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.400 
down all rights this here and there and
then<00:02:35.340> came<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.970> tried<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.540> loved

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
then came out and tried this and loved

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.960 
then came out and tried this and loved
it<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.459> write<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.820> with

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
it because you can just write up with

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.030 
it because you can just write up with
your<00:02:39.090> mates<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.480> then<00:02:40.140> writes<00:02:40.470> down<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.860> some

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
your mates and then writes down on some

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.010 
your mates and then writes down on some
stick<00:02:41.220> trails<00:02:41.490> my<00:02:42.180> runs<00:02:42.390> were<00:02:42.600> pretty<00:02:42.870> good

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
stick trails my runs were pretty good

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.840 
stick trails my runs were pretty good
today<00:02:43.230> got<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.860> sketch<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.490> on<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> few

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
today got to sketch you on a few

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.180 
today got to sketch you on a few
sections<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.800> overall<00:02:46.800> pretty<00:02:46.860> good

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
sections but overall pretty good

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.820 
sections but overall pretty good
hopefully<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.209> can<00:02:48.330> get<00:02:48.600> racing<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.530> Elite

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

after<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.080> guess

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.580 

why<00:03:03.420> would<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.630> want<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.840> come<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.110> right<00:03:04.290> into

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
why would you want to come in right into

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
berms and flowing trails for what we do

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.650 
berms and flowing trails for what we do
have<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.070> elevation<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:15.060> everything<00:03:15.420> runs
