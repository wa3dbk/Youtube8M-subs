one of the greatest challenges that a
catcher<00:00:07.620> will<00:00:07.950> face<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.840> handling<00:00:09.840> popups

fundamentally sound and handling a
pop-up<00:00:28.260> behind<00:00:28.830> us<00:00:29.689> anytime<00:00:30.689> there's<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

pop-up behind us anytime there's a
right-handed<00:00:31.619> hitter<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.329> he<00:00:33.329> fouls<00:00:33.630> the

right-handed hitter and he fouls the
ball<00:00:33.989> off<00:00:34.820> it's<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.270> off<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.840> my

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
ball off it's going to be off to my

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.950 
ball off it's going to be off to my
right<00:00:37.649> side<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> catcher<00:00:38.960> right-handed

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
right side as the catcher right-handed

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.360 
right side as the catcher right-handed
hitters<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.620> foul<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.829> ball<00:00:41.129> off

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
hitters are going to foul the ball off

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
hitters are going to foul the ball off
in<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.700> direction<00:00:42.530> left-handed<00:00:43.530> hitters

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
in this direction left-handed hitters

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
in this direction left-handed hitters
are<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> foul<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> ball<00:00:45.270> off<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
are going to foul the ball off in this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.080 
are going to foul the ball off in this
direction

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
direction

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.700 
direction
so<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> right-handed<00:00:49.200> hitter<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so if I have a right-handed hitter and I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
so if I have a right-handed hitter and I
recognize<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.760> ball<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.030> fouled

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
recognize that this ball is fouled

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.470 
recognize that this ball is fouled
I'm<00:00:52.170> instinctively<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> open<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I'm instinctively going to open up to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.529 
I'm instinctively going to open up to
this<00:00:54.629> side<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> crucial<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.149> first

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this side that is crucial as the first

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.139 
this side that is crucial as the first
element<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.350> finding<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> baseball<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> being

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
element of finding a baseball and being

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700 
element of finding a baseball and being
efficient<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> getting<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
efficient in getting to it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.440 
efficient in getting to it
I<00:01:02.390> recognize<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.750> baseball<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.530> backspin

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
I recognize that a baseball has backspin

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
I recognize that a baseball has backspin
and<00:01:06.450> when<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> ball<00:01:06.900> goes<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.530> behind<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and when the ball goes up behind the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.359 
and when the ball goes up behind the
plate<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> go<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
plate it is going to go out and up and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.940 
plate it is going to go out and up and
then<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.210> actually<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> circle<00:01:13.770> back

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
then it's actually going to circle back

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.300 
then it's actually going to circle back
to<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> circle<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:16.799> towards

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to me it's going to circle back towards

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.840 
to me it's going to circle back towards
the<00:01:17.460> infield<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.799> all<00:01:19.799> pop<00:01:20.130> ups<00:01:20.400> don't<00:01:20.640> always

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the infield and all pop ups don't always

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
the infield and all pop ups don't always
go<00:01:21.090> backwards<00:01:21.600> sometimes<00:01:22.049> they're<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.470> on

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
go backwards sometimes they're right on

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
go backwards sometimes they're right on
top<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> plate<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:24.240> end<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.600> slightly

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
top of the plate or they end up slightly

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
top of the plate or they end up slightly
in<00:01:25.110> front<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> plate<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.549> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
in front of the plate there's going to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.149 
in front of the plate there's going to
be<00:01:26.700> certain<00:01:27.000> pop<00:01:27.330> ups<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.869> realize<00:01:28.350> have

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
be certain pop ups that I realize have

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.560 
be certain pop ups that I realize have
different<00:01:29.640> direction<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.290> goes<00:01:31.500> up

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
different direction the one that goes up

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.179 
different direction the one that goes up
with<00:01:33.570> very<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:34.049> angle<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.710> know<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
with very little angle I know I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
with very little angle I know I
definitely<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.390> front<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
definitely have to get out in front of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530 
definitely have to get out in front of
the<00:01:36.720> plate<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> ball<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.280> goes<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.850> with

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the plate but a ball that goes up with

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
the plate but a ball that goes up with
backwards<00:01:40.049> angle<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> may<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.579> necessary

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
backwards angle it may not be necessary

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.090 
backwards angle it may not be necessary
for<00:01:42.210> me<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:42.659> those<00:01:43.170> steps<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.829> front

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
for me to take those steps out in front

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
for me to take those steps out in front
and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.210> might<00:01:45.780> could<00:01:45.990> turn

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and then go to it I might could turn

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.550 
and then go to it I might could turn
right<00:01:46.619> where<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> find<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.299> ball

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
right where I'm at and find the ball

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.260 
right where I'm at and find the ball
because<00:01:49.560> some<00:01:50.340> fields<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.240> a

because some fields are going to have a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.660 
because some fields are going to have a
lot<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.600> distance<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.829> cover<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
lot of distance that I got to cover in

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270 
lot of distance that I got to cover in
order<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> catch<00:01:54.509> his<00:01:54.750> pop-up<00:01:55.229> where<00:01:56.070> other

stops so let's use the example of a ball
that<00:02:02.100> say<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> little<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.119> more<00:02:03.360> directly

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that say is a little bit more directly

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
that say is a little bit more directly
up<00:02:03.990> over<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.439> head<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.250> got<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.579> make<00:02:05.670> sure

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
up over my head and I got to make sure

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.449 
up over my head and I got to make sure
that<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.149> turned<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.829> when<00:02:08.009> I'm<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.160> my

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that I get turned so when I'm in my

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.910 
that I get turned so when I'm in my
stance<00:02:08.789> whether<00:02:09.149> primary<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:09.840> secondary<00:02:10.050> when

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
stance whether primary or secondary when

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250 
stance whether primary or secondary when
I<00:02:10.950> recognize<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.790> ball<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.209> hit<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.870> am

I recognize the ball is hit up I am

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
I recognize the ball is hit up I am
coming

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
coming

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
coming
up<00:02:13.980> clearing<00:02:14.790> my<00:02:15.090> mask<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.750> trying<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.170> pick

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
up clearing my mask and trying to pick

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.770 
up clearing my mask and trying to pick
the<00:02:16.410> baseball<00:02:16.980> up<00:02:17.190> I'm<00:02:17.910> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.270> come<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the baseball up I'm going to come to the

and spin I have to be very careful not
to<00:02:25.230> over<00:02:25.620> run<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.190> pop-up<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:27.110> know<00:02:28.110> from

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
to over run this pop-up I know from

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.380 
to over run this pop-up I know from
experience<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.520> ball<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.790> coming<00:02:30.120> back

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
experience that this ball is coming back
