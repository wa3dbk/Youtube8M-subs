00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 and greet season that we find ourselves for 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.369
 another video we'll do a little 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.500
 tutorial about security alarms and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.750
 others so there we are supposed to have lt 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.369
 we are in the company of George Clooney 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.939
 that here 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.289
 it's george hello so he 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.429
 will follow for the duration of this Syrian 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 and maybe others 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.320
 so here we are going to learn how to do 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 a type alarm if we steal you and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 Well, that triggers the tear to their 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.620
 explanations 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.510
 you will take a basic plate 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 like that you're going to put 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.360
 against the wall you are going to search in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.059
 wire you have sending yesterday detection 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 rangers or so I checked off a lot of 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.059
 stuff but they tick you in your 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.680
 world 10 fouls or 0 and you tick 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.270
 would put anti type the most anti ideas 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.729
 its launching share for a cost of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 more more or there I'm trying to whores 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.420
 years titiou more anti radios early so 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.850
 you put the distance you want 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.640
 after which you will put on top of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.909
 so who is aiming at the middle of the plate 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.400
 I 'm like yeah but it's 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.479
 do the same thing at the same time jeans 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.220
 then you can put anything 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.759
 it can be a word is not micro printers 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.890
 wave 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.259
 it can be a simple object whatever 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.820
 so we will put together 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.880
 object that was it that represented our 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.790
 currency printers of which here is an Albanian 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.270
 printer tonnard not so you have a 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.500
 in constant van uhm I need three 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.170
 winners environment the whole you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.320
 look at your rodent and scored between 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.780
 the idea and scored slow the figure of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.130
 your object attention each object a 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.960
 different figure 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.420
 you are noticing you the 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:15.320
 there are old guys excuse me then 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.030
 they excuse me so a role of 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.260
 number you put on the constant of 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.860
 hollywood so me it's 975 then we 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 will put a value of 1 and 2 0 that can 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.210
 always be useful it seems to me that his 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.210
 mustache 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.710
 here you put it then you want 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.290
 you go in gates comparison here 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.900
 in wire control comparisons and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.750
 you will take a star and a 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:52.400
 noted gwan and there you then have you 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:59.060
 go put the equal to the anti 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:01.660
 slow it is high on the 9 104 75 the a2 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.320
 the equal note on dance idea 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:10.340
 the b over 960 that I explain 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.220
 here you see that the tree and what the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.709
 guys one is noted what guys 2 0 in 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.930
 big if there for example if you want 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.910
 put gold fanning and as a coach and 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.720
 no joke it will work I will you 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.910
 show it right now 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.530
 imagine that these this is your 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.530
 door this is this is your body I'm going 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.709
 I take a fan indoor uncheck ta 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.630
 mouth I loved the touch of this time 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.400
 I'm going in wire I take 1.1 steps from 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.320
 id group that we've already seen in 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.330
 the previous tutorials enables us 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.650
 to press the keys on the keyboard 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.570
 digital so gives it no meaning without 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.230
 so basically support going through months 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.570
 yesterday we put the 1 on the gate and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.400
 quads and not goyer who speaks to you and 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.350
 when I'm going to fly micron from 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.709
 printers believe that tonight it's going to be 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.810
 close 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.870
 and so if the thief to go out is he 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.070
 papin who pope either he must reclassify 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.459
 the object then for example for the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.650
 tear 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.239
 you're not going to put on the canvas by 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.680
 example because that's going to trigger 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.760
 tears all the time it will turn off 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.169
 than in Iraq when there will be the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.350
 we will no longer object so for example 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.660
 the ball over 8h the sound must already 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.610
 a band elsewhere that's what this 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.130
 you had the tear and actually put it 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:35.850
 just stupidly has it on the note is what 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.490
 so I'm flying when you see it works 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.440
 I will eat in the same way if I try to 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.760
 take 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.960
 george and will steal our printer 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.960
 and we'll put another one instead 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.949
 as you see even if we see the price 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.039
 earth have their place to another well then 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.930
 it will not work, it must really be 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.639
 either a leg the right object so we can 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.039
 not do you one can not you 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.900
 do a fake objects like for example 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.190
 a flowerpot if ever someone 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.680
 you bowl him well he can not the 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.169
 change by another this will be at this will 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.110
 grilled so I hope that you are 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.690
 of a brain thus retained in an economy 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.830
 note that wall who compare the entity 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.169
 idea of ​​the object so the number one 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.370
 figure with another figure is in 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.440
 done that's all stupid you put the 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.389
 figure of that object and if the figure of 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.590
 this item 6 basically if it is not 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.349
 this object 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.479
 it will trigger the alarmed if it was this 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.150
 object is only that one it will work 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.880
 it will stay as it is 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.120
 well hoping to have helped you george 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.800
 was supposed to be there to say if he 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.110
 there was something that did not understand 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.780
 because me y'en bitumen voyeur there 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.030
 are some stuff that I will not see that 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.229
 I helped jump so I guess I 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.000
 made of people and I think that all the 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.949
 world will understand what you explain 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.220
 no I guess you explain 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.449
 clearly echo world will understand 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.919
 so he is supposed to intervene if ever 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.380
 I explain complained about something because he 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.150
 put yourself in your place like me 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.820
 I'm used to it and there's something I 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.400
 can you jump here you are 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.090
 so I would like to give the setting of the 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.520
 tidy up in her stock hoping that this 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.670
 tutorial was helpful to you 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.670
 time
