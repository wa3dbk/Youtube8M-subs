years I use it once or twice a week so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
years I use it once or twice a week so
eventually<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.840> started<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> pay<00:01:13.470> for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
eventually I really started to pay for

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.109 
eventually I really started to pay for
itself<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:14.939> does<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.840> light

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
itself and what it does is this light

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.560 
itself and what it does is this light
penetrates<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.390> skin<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.830> actually

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
penetrates the skin and it actually

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.070 
penetrates the skin and it actually
allows<00:01:21.570> collagen<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.479> produce<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
allows collagen and to produce it it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.450 
allows collagen and to produce it it
helps<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> production<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> collagen

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
helps with the production of collagen

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.999 
helps with the production of collagen
and<00:01:27.150> you'll<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.320> instant

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and you'll get a little bit of instant

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
and you'll get a little bit of instant
plumping<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:29.970> over<00:01:30.119> time<00:01:30.420> you'll

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
plumping up and then over time you'll

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
plumping up and then over time you'll
feel<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> skin<00:01:31.829> getting<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.310> bit

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
feel the skin getting a little bit

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
feel the skin getting a little bit
thicker<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.200> takes<00:01:34.470> about

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
thicker and it really just takes about

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
thicker and it really just takes about
ten<00:01:35.070> minutes<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.460> day<00:01:35.610> there's<00:01:35.909> three<00:01:36.210> settings

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
ten minutes a day there's three settings

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
ten minutes a day there's three settings
this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.100> light<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.460> top<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
green setting that will give you a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.030 
green setting that will give you a
slightly<00:01:41.400> stronger<00:01:41.990> light<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.380> problem

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
slightly stronger light the problem

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.030 
slightly stronger light the problem
areas<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.600> flushing<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
areas and then flushing like that's the

areas and then flushing like that's the
anything<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.729> being<00:01:47.909> red<00:01:48.950> which<00:01:49.950> you

can't see the infrared light and that's

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
can't see the infrared light and that's
the<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.970> doing

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the one is really doing

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.260 
the one is really doing
a<00:01:54.990> great<00:01:55.350> job<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.920> penetrating<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.730> skin<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a great job of penetrating the skin and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.200 
a great job of penetrating the skin and
boosting<00:01:57.690> collagen<00:01:57.900> this<00:01:58.620> is<00:01:58.920> thus<00:01:59.700> about<00:01:59.940> two

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
boosting collagen this is thus about two

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.690 
boosting collagen this is thus about two
minutes<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.720> section<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.520> you've<00:02:02.670> just

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
minutes of section and then you've just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.870 
minutes of section and then you've just
got<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.210> plain<00:02:03.960> LED<00:02:04.440> light<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.400> idea<00:02:05.730> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
got the plain LED light and the idea is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
got the plain LED light and the idea is
that<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.150> move<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.960> around<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that you move it around so this is

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
that you move it around so this is
something<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.820> use<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.179> my<00:02:09.210> hands<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
something that I use on my hands all the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.600 
something that I use on my hands all the
time<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.130> think<00:02:11.190> they've<00:02:11.430> taken

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
time and you know I think they've taken

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.940 
time and you know I think they've taken
a<00:02:11.760> couple<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.180> years<00:02:12.390> off<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:13.590> anyway<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
a couple of years off but anyway the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.760 
a couple of years off but anyway the
idea<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.730> move<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.840> baby<00:02:16.350> quasar

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
idea is that you move the baby quasar

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.690 
idea is that you move the baby quasar
very<00:02:17.400> very<00:02:17.760> slowly<00:02:18.270> over<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.020> area<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
very very slowly over the area and you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.630 
very very slowly over the area and you
can<00:02:20.910> go<00:02:21.150> backwards<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.050> forwards<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.980> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
can go backwards and forwards and you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.449 
can go backwards and forwards and you
can<00:02:23.910> stop<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.750> pause<00:02:25.160> anywhere<00:02:26.160> where<00:02:26.340> you

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
can stop and pause anywhere where you

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.670 
can stop and pause anywhere where you
think<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.000> needs<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.390> bit<00:02:27.420> more<00:02:27.600> help<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
think it needs a bit more help but the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.130 
think it needs a bit more help but the
idea<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.190> keep<00:02:29.420> moving<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.540> very<00:02:30.870> very

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
idea is to keep moving it very very

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.540 
idea is to keep moving it very very
slowly<00:02:32.060> around<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.290> use<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.739> on

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
slowly around and you can use this on

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.780 
slowly around and you can use this on
the<00:02:35.670> neck<00:02:35.910> they<00:02:36.390> collect<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.959> use<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.160> your

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the neck they collect a use it on your

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.120 
the neck they collect a use it on your
face<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:40.110> think<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.739> one<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
face and I think this is one of the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.949 
face and I think this is one of the
things<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.850> they're<00:02:42.030> very<00:02:42.180> few<00:02:42.420> things<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
things that they're very few things that

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.140 
things that they're very few things that
really<00:02:42.989> work<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:44.280> sagging<00:02:44.850> jawline

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
really work so in this sagging jawline

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.570 
really work so in this sagging jawline
as<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.320> puppet<00:02:46.739> lives<00:02:46.980> people<00:02:47.489> are

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
as the the puppet lives people are

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.729 
as the the puppet lives people are
always<00:02:47.700> writing<00:02:48.090> tweeting<00:02:48.720> saying<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.680> know

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
always writing tweeting saying you know

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.770 
always writing tweeting saying you know
what<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.190> do<00:02:50.250> about<00:02:50.430> puppet<00:02:51.209> lines<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
what can I do about puppet lines in the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.630 
what can I do about puppet lines in the
second<00:02:52.200> year<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.950> know<00:02:53.070> there<00:02:53.310> aren't

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
second year and you know there aren't

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.330 
second year and you know there aren't
really<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.180> many<00:02:54.510> greens<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.380> will<00:02:55.590> will

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
really that many greens that will will

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.670 
really that many greens that will will
deal<00:02:56.550> with<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:58.020> if<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.350> use

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
deal with that for you but if you use

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.050 
deal with that for you but if you use
the<00:02:59.100> baby<00:02:59.700> quasar<00:03:00.080> religiously<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.470> area

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
the baby quasar religiously in that area

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.970 
the baby quasar religiously in that area
twice<00:03:03.060> two<00:03:03.360> three<00:03:03.600> times<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.959> week<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.260> new

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
twice two three times a week a new

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.910 
twice two three times a week a new
bedtime<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:06.660> will<00:03:06.840> take<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.320> five<00:03:07.530> or<00:03:07.739> ten

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
bedtime it will take the five or ten

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.130 
bedtime it will take the five or ten
minutes<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.970> will<00:03:09.180> actually<00:03:09.630> start<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.019> see

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
minutes you will actually start to see

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.039 
minutes you will actually start to see
an<00:03:10.650> improvement<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.880> area<00:03:12.299> as<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.660> even

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
an improvement in this area as you even

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.460 
an improvement in this area as you even
though<00:03:13.170> you're<00:03:13.380> aging<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.450> know<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.780> think<00:03:16.019> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
though you're aging so I know I think I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.920 
though you're aging so I know I think I
do<00:03:16.530> make<00:03:16.890> time<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.459> use<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:18.060> put<00:03:18.510> up<00:03:18.630> money

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
do make time to use this I put up money

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.289 
do make time to use this I put up money
to<00:03:19.019> use<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.799> buy<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.820> think<00:03:20.880> it's<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
to use it to buy this I think it's a

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.070 
to use it to buy this I think it's a
really<00:03:21.630> great

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
really great
