00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.490

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.090
 parent placement 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.039
 the al-qaida in front of you 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.039

 the country brings discussion in a ballroom yet I believe in the middle of the course 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.020
 you hit it hidden I believe that there's a lot going on like a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.240

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.270

 right foot then we changed a bit from the positioning of guys that is the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.370
 more important than usual 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.560
