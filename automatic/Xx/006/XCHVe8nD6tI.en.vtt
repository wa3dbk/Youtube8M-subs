the dough into triangles and then from
these<00:03:56.470> triangles<00:03:57.220> we<00:03:57.459> usually<00:03:58.090> cut<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.569> little

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
these triangles we usually cut a little

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.490 
these triangles we usually cut a little
notch<00:03:59.790> super<00:04:00.790> easy<00:04:01.000> assembly<00:04:01.480> we<00:04:02.049> take<00:04:02.260> some

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
notch super easy assembly we take some

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.839 
notch super easy assembly we take some
yellow<00:04:02.829> mustard<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:05.170> do<00:04:05.709> what<00:04:05.980> we<00:04:06.069> call<00:04:06.280> a

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
yellow mustard and you do what we call a

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.449 
yellow mustard and you do what we call a
schmear<00:04:07.360> we<00:04:07.959> usually<00:04:08.230> put<00:04:08.440> down<00:04:08.620> two<00:04:08.980> slices

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
schmear we usually put down two slices

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.089 
schmear we usually put down two slices
of<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:10.239> deli<00:04:10.540> ham<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.319> then<00:04:12.099> a<00:04:12.549> nice<00:04:13.680> ball<00:04:14.680> of

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099
