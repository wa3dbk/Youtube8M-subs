 I am a woman July 20, 1969 to make the panorama worse for Rome 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.580
 the biggest forty years later transition to a real one already seems small 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.220
 even for them the astronauts who will be years have taken the honor in the

 everything changes 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:00.870
 arrived collins 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.230
 students is also as interesting a place as the red planet 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.610
 I imagined 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.030
 years later the dream abroad but to go to Mars the nasa needs to come back 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.770
 to the street 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.590
 only the first stage of the mission will cost 150 billion dollars ten 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.690
 times more than the space agency's year-round budget 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.909
 for critics, the precedent for the neighborhood needs to worry about 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.299
 economy and the millions of jobs Americans here on earth before thinking 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.409
 in investing in space to try to overthrow the project nasa used technology 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.409
 and special effects of last generation 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.710
 the video shows how the future would be the trip to the moon in 2020 the death of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.740
 most economical spacecraft 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.210
 solar energy 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.690
 the goal of the mission with beer is to set up a permanent base there 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 will serve as a stopover for the arrival of 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.120
 the man and the red planet of shame how much it seems until science fiction 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.610

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.579
 tip of many people's tongues 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.900
 just talk about it and it soon comes to mind is a way to squid still

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.209
 but why 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.750
 so much of her influence on earth 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.999
 I think it's a natural satellite a legal contracture 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.609
 so far the students also ask questions about income around the world 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:54.660
 believe in such 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.889
 the great step for mankind

 anyone who treats the subject as fraud 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.209
 this video simulates a farce produced in studio in which the lamp 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.449
 plunge the astronaut's direction 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.449

 over there what happened this part opened here 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.879

 in the action beyond it 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.150
