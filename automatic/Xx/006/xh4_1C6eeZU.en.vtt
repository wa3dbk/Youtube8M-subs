00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.700
 this is a project seven times measure and Anton 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.769
 free 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.480
 and today we want to give exhaustive 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.980
 answers to questions about what 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.470
 quality plastic windows 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:23.019
 high-quality installation and what should be 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:25.480
 window company service I am in the window shop 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.820
 minister companies and today we will be seven 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.999
 compare two plastic windows 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.619
 one design weighs 50 kilograms a 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.260
 second 70 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.950
 where does the weight difference come from and what is he 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.680
 means 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:44.829
 we will understand here it is one of the main 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.739
 heroes any window history profile and 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.890
 one of its most important indicators is width 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.260
 First of all, the strength depends on it 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.320
 will the frames sag to form 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.890
 chili secondly width directly affects 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.579
 heat conservation the wider the better and 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.299
 so the width of the profile in the first window is 50 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.810
 millimeters 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.920
 about this 90 the difference is almost double 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.770
 Now 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.530
 internal metal reinforcement 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.220
 skeleton if you look at the first sample 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.189
 profile 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.340
 then we see just a piece inside the tape a 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.030
 in the second sample a square tube 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.310
 sections 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 it is not difficult to guess what reinforcement 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.229
 stronger well then let's do an experiment 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 I will cut 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.950
 sample 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.480
 so the first sample lasted only 5 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.050
 seconds by 2 it took three times 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.630
 more time 15 seconds visual 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:52.030
 the result you guessed what sample 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.670
 profile is massive with glass pack 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.150
 an important part of the window with the mind it seems that these 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.780
 two samples of the same each of three 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.340
 glass 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:07.120
 but appearances are deceptive first thickness 30 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 millimeters in the second 50 besides 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.040
 the second sample glass with a special coating 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.140
 thermal mirror she is so 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.870
 effective that it must be 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.720
 use the Siberian conditions in 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.180
 as a result if it is freezing outside 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.760
 indoors 1 double-glazed window 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.790
 cools down to almost zero and gets covered 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.860
 dew and him water runs down the window sill 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.200
 spoil the finish and the temperature is 2 plus 14 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.950
 degrees no problem by the way 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.160
 double glazing its width in charge of 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.130
 soundproofing is now fittings 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.350
 these are different metal parts of the window here 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.140
 many tricks like iron 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.140
 plates are points of pressure 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.900
 in the first sample there are only three in the second 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.060
 six means the second window will be 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.060
 close twice as thick 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.120
 more reliable and accessories can talk 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.020
 long but should also pay attention 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.310
 and on the windowsill the main requirement 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.070
 imposed on him strength and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.160
 scratch stain resistance 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.550
 UV resistance 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.950
 simple test 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.760
 draw an edge on the usual coin 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.970
 window sill 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.580
 and on the windowsill and was on the first 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.830
 there will be a scratch on the second mark 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.630
 like slate pencils on Wednesday trying easily 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.730
 and does not eats into the window sill 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.430
 high strength sill surface 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.239
 el battle is monolithic without 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.430
 porous 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.610
 that will allow him to serve as a stand under 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.510
 flower pots vases aquariums and other 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.090
 decorating your home for at least 50 years 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.879
 have you seen how two look different 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.549
 identical windows which choose you decide 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.870
 Well, I thank for the help of specialists 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.079
 finestra companies 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.400
 it was a project measure seven times and i'm anton 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.400
 Privolnaya before meeting
