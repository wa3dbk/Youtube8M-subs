hi my name is Jordan Steve junoon and

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
hi my name is Jordan Steve junoon and
this<00:00:06.910> is<00:00:07.060> going<00:00:07.210> to<00:00:07.299> be<00:00:07.359> the<00:00:07.480> first<00:00:07.689> time<00:00:07.870> that

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
this is going to be the first time that

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.350 
this is going to be the first time that
I've<00:00:08.230> done<00:00:08.410> a<00:00:08.440> recording<00:00:09.070> while<00:00:10.030> I've<00:00:10.330> been

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
I've done a recording while I've been

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.860
