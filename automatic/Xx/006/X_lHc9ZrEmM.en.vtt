what's up guys sean here bringing you a
another<00:00:23.730> trap<00:00:24.330> tutorial<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:27.090> an

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
another trap tutorial this one is an

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.609 
another trap tutorial this one is an
advanced<00:00:28.259> try<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.250> run<00:00:29.490> tutorial<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.989> if<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
advanced try and run tutorial so if you

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.570 
advanced try and run tutorial so if you
saw<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.730> know<00:00:33.170> pressure<00:00:34.170> put<00:00:34.580> you

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
saw this one you know pressure put you

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.240 
saw this one you know pressure put you
die<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.330> this<00:00:36.449> one<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.900> basically<00:00:37.410> without<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
die so this one is basically without a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.119 
die so this one is basically without a
pressure<00:00:38.519> plate<00:00:38.820> um<00:00:39.150> it's<00:00:39.960> used<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.949> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
pressure plate um it's used with the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.740 
pressure plate um it's used with the
picking<00:00:41.580> up<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.970> item<00:00:42.330> through<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.720> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
picking up and item through like a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.759 
picking up and item through like a
corner<00:00:43.199> right<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.410> i'm<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> show

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
corner right there so i'm going to show

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.750 
corner right there so i'm going to show
you<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.579> tools<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.970> need<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.300> make<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
you all the tools you need to make this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
you all the tools you need to make this
it's<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.059> confusing<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> had

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it's pretty confusing so if you had

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
it's pretty confusing so if you had
trouble<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> try<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.520> run<00:00:53.730> i<00:00:53.940> would<00:00:54.719> not

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
trouble with the try and run i would not

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
trouble with the try and run i would not
recommend<00:00:55.050> building<00:00:55.949> us<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.550> it's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
recommend building us because it's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
recommend building us because it's
pretty<00:00:57.539> frustrating<00:00:58.100> alright<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> let's<00:00:59.520> get

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
pretty frustrating alright so let's get

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.590 
pretty frustrating alright so let's get
into<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:01.160> first<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.000> used<00:01:03.359> by

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
into it here first of all it is used by

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.380 
into it here first of all it is used by
a<00:01:04.019> dispenser<00:01:04.769> popping<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:05.610> an<00:01:05.789> item<00:01:06.240> right

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a dispenser popping out an item right

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
a dispenser popping out an item right
there<00:01:06.630> hitting<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.410> pressure<00:01:07.649> plate<00:01:07.920> which

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there hitting a pressure plate which

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.540 
there hitting a pressure plate which
once<00:01:08.789> you<00:01:08.970> pick<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.710> saw<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
once you pick it up as you saw then the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.109 
once you pick it up as you saw then the
trap<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.270> activate<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.940> what<00:01:14.940> you're<00:01:15.030> going

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
trap will activate so what you're going

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.990 
trap will activate so what you're going
to<00:01:15.179> need<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.830> one<00:01:16.830> pressure<00:01:17.100> plate<00:01:17.340> redstone

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to need is one pressure plate redstone

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.960 
to need is one pressure plate redstone
right<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.600> towards<00:01:18.869> repeaters<00:01:19.580> city<00:01:20.580> pistons

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
right so towards repeaters city pistons

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.389 
right so towards repeaters city pistons
and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.080> block<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.679> choice<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.220> guess

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.949 

so<00:01:26.399> how<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.819> make<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.209> little<00:01:27.420> inverter

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
so how to make that little inverter

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:29.029 
so how to make that little inverter
right<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:28.349> it<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.679> little<00:01:28.890> bit

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
right there it was a little bit

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.660 
right there it was a little bit
confusing<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.789> your<00:01:30.060> trap<00:01:30.539> is<00:01:30.830> say<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:32.399> is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
confusing if your trap is say that is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.809 
confusing if your trap is say that is
the<00:01:32.910> floor<00:01:33.209> for<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.630> trap<00:01:34.069> and<00:01:35.069> this<00:01:35.429> is<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
the floor for your trap and this is the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.669 
the floor for your trap and this is the
corner<00:01:36.239> that<00:01:37.080> they<00:01:37.259> would<00:01:37.349> be<00:01:37.380> walking<00:01:37.770> by<00:01:37.920> um

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
corner that they would be walking by um

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.190 
corner that they would be walking by um
you<00:01:40.679> would<00:01:40.830> need<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.310> put<00:01:41.690> since<00:01:42.690> hits<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.989> block

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you would need to put since hits a block

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.469 
you would need to put since hits a block
up<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.530> put<00:01:43.739> your<00:01:43.920> pressure<00:01:44.700> plate<00:01:45.149> right

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
up you put your pressure plate right

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.650 
up you put your pressure plate right
there<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.160> see<00:01:47.399> over<00:01:47.429> here<00:01:47.660> your

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
there and then as you see over here your

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.279 
there and then as you see over here your
pressure<00:01:48.929> plate<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.880> one<00:01:50.880> block<00:01:51.239> yeah<00:01:52.020> one

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
pressure plate is one block yeah one

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.479 
pressure plate is one block yeah one
block<00:01:52.530> i<00:01:52.770> believe<00:01:54.050> one<00:01:55.050> block<00:01:55.319> above<00:01:55.890> your

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
block i believe one block above your

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:02.210 
block i believe one block above your
dispenser<00:01:56.959> so<00:01:58.849> you<00:01:59.849> put<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.929> are<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:01.950> also

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
dispenser so you put your are you also

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.249 
dispenser so you put your are you also
need<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> dispenser<00:02:03.050> you'll<00:02:04.050> put<00:02:04.229> your

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
need a dispenser you'll put your

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.570 
need a dispenser you'll put your
dispenser<00:02:04.739> right<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.220> fill<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.550> with

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
dispenser right there and fill it with

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.240 
dispenser right there and fill it with
just<00:02:05.819> like<00:02:06.000> 64<00:02:06.720> like<00:02:07.080> dirt<00:02:07.410> or<00:02:07.709> something<00:02:08.039> if

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
just like 64 like dirt or something if

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.690 
just like 64 like dirt or something if
you're<00:02:08.399> playing<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:09.259> on<00:02:10.259> survival<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.280> then

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you're playing on on survival and then

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400 
you're playing on on survival and then
you<00:02:11.879> put<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> torch<00:02:12.390> underneath<00:02:12.900> your

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you put a torch underneath your

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.410 
you put a torch underneath your
dispenser<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> power<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.370> dispenser<00:02:14.819> you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
dispenser the power of the dispenser you

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.250 
dispenser the power of the dispenser you
put<00:02:15.660> one<00:02:16.370> right<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.660> dear

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
put one right here and then you dear

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.260 
put one right here and then you dear
like<00:02:19.590> output<00:02:20.190> i<00:02:20.220> guess<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.760> could<00:02:20.940> call<00:02:21.209> it

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
like output i guess you could call it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.380 
like output i guess you could call it
would<00:02:24.270> be<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:26.969> it<00:02:27.090> converts

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
would be like this so then it converts

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.780 
would be like this so then it converts
that<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:28.109> so<00:02:28.709> with<00:02:28.859> your<00:02:29.010> Spencer<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.609> looks

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
that one so with your Spencer that looks

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.790 
that one so with your Spencer that looks
supple<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.359> just<00:02:30.480> put<00:02:30.840> some

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
supple like that I just put some

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.830 
supple like that I just put some
some<00:02:32.190> wooden<00:02:32.550> blocks<00:02:33.450> over<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
some wooden blocks over it so when the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.390 
some wooden blocks over it so when the
so<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.050> pressure<00:02:37.230> plate<00:02:37.410> gets<00:02:37.980> triggered

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
so on the pressure plate gets triggered

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.640 
so on the pressure plate gets triggered
your<00:02:38.820> dispenser<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:39.990> when<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.200> take<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.560> out

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
your dispenser like when you take it out

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.220 
your dispenser like when you take it out
your<00:02:41.430> dispenser<00:02:41.880> item<00:02:42.390> will<00:02:42.510> always<00:02:42.840> land<00:02:43.050> in

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
your dispenser item will always land in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.610 
your dispenser item will always land in
that<00:02:43.260> one<00:02:43.530> spot<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:44.390> then<00:02:45.390> your<00:02:46.170> redstone

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that one spot and then your redstone

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.360 
that one spot and then your redstone
will<00:02:47.370> come<00:02:47.550> from<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.860> have<00:02:49.890> this

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
will come from here so you have this

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.280 
will come from here so you have this
this<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.880> one<00:02:51.210> block<00:02:51.390> down<00:02:51.660> because<00:02:52.020> it's

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
this is one block down because it's

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410 
this is one block down because it's
flush<00:02:52.740> with<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.070> ground<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.610> then<00:02:54.150> this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
flush with the ground and then this

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720 
flush with the ground and then this
one's<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:54.990> bit<00:02:55.200> higher<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.640> yeah

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
one's a little bit higher so so yeah

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.100 
one's a little bit higher so so yeah
then<00:02:56.970> your<00:02:57.090> red<00:02:57.240> Sun<00:02:57.420> will<00:02:57.510> come<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.720> from

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
then your red Sun will come out from

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.030 
then your red Sun will come out from
this<00:02:58.380> torch<00:02:59.360> so<00:03:00.360> when<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:01.320> pick<00:03:01.530> up<00:03:01.560> your<00:03:01.710> item

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
this torch so when you pick up your item

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.580 
this torch so when you pick up your item
that<00:03:05.040> gets<00:03:05.220> turned<00:03:05.550> on<00:03:05.670> um<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:07.020> then<00:03:07.170> that

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
that gets turned on um and then that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.230 
that gets turned on um and then that
line<00:03:08.280> right<00:03:08.490> there<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:08.820> that's<00:03:08.880> how<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.090> make

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
line right there so that's how you make

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240 
line right there so that's how you make
the<00:03:09.390> inverter<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.080> guess<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.890> want<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> call<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the inverter I guess you want to call it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.070 
the inverter I guess you want to call it
and<00:03:11.460> then<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.210> line<00:03:12.420> as<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.870> see<00:03:13.050> right

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
and then that line as you can see right

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.820 
and then that line as you can see right
here<00:03:13.650> will<00:03:14.370> go<00:03:14.550> down<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.180> below<00:03:15.840> your<00:03:16.230> trap<00:03:16.560> like

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
here will go down a below your trap like

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.560 
here will go down a below your trap like
you'd<00:03:17.010> be<00:03:17.130> walking<00:03:17.400> right<00:03:17.640> here<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.210> is<00:03:18.270> your

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
you'd be walking right here this is your

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.650 
you'd be walking right here this is your
floor<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:20.100> might<00:03:20.280> need<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.460> repeater<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:21.150> for

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
floor you might need a repeater just for

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.020 
floor you might need a repeater just for
the<00:03:21.930> sake<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.650> continuing<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.400> red<00:03:23.580> zone<00:03:23.610> and

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the sake of continuing the red zone and

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.000 
the sake of continuing the red zone and
then<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.230> try<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.530> run<00:03:25.770> set

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
then it's just like to try and run set

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.410 
then it's just like to try and run set
up<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> redstone<00:03:26.790> torches<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
up with the redstone torches and the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.460 
up with the redstone torches and the
repeaters<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:29.280> will<00:03:29.660> instantly<00:03:30.660> want

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
repeaters and this will instantly want

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.290 
repeaters and this will instantly want
in<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.770> licensors<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> little<00:03:32.550> bit<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.820> there's

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
in so licensors a little bit of there's

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.580 
in so licensors a little bit of there's
some<00:03:33.510> delay<00:03:33.780> with<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:33.930> repeaters<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.500> will

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
some delay with the repeaters it will

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.790 
some delay with the repeaters it will
pull<00:03:34.830> away<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.220> floor<00:03:36.020> like<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.200> try<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.500> run

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
pull away the floor like and try and run

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.670 
pull away the floor like and try and run
and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.280> your<00:03:38.489> victim<00:03:38.910> will<00:03:39.060> fall<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and then your victim will fall in the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.610 
and then your victim will fall in the
the<00:03:41.250> area<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.850> this<00:03:42.660> side<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.410> way

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
the area on this side going this way

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.890 
the area on this side going this way
which<00:03:44.370> brings<00:03:44.580> us<00:03:44.820> over<00:03:45.060> here<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.450> really

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
which brings us over here to the really

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.090 
which brings us over here to the really
confusing<00:03:46.500> part<00:03:46.709> um<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.810> here's<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.260> Pistons

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
confusing part um so here's the Pistons

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.820 
confusing part um so here's the Pistons
up<00:03:50.310> pull<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:50.820> crush<00:03:51.180> your<00:03:51.390> head<00:03:51.830> because

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
up pull that crush your head because

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.080 
up pull that crush your head because
it's<00:03:53.070> kind<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.280> putting<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.760> makeup

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
it's kind of putting like the makeup

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.199 
it's kind of putting like the makeup
applicator<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.860> try<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:55.920> run<00:03:56.130> together<00:03:56.280> so

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
applicator and try and run together so

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.260 
applicator and try and run together so
this<00:03:57.480> will<00:03:57.989> also<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.950> Lana<00:03:59.400> redstone<00:03:59.850> runs

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
this will also this Lana redstone runs

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.180 
this will also this Lana redstone runs
right<00:04:00.570> here<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.110> also<00:04:01.470> gets<00:04:01.770> triggered

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
right here it also gets triggered

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.490 
right here it also gets triggered
immediately<00:04:02.760> once<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.420> pressure<00:04:03.870> plate<00:04:04.170> or

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
immediately once the pressure plate or

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.710 
immediately once the pressure plate or
once<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.770> item<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.160> taken<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:06.480> want<00:04:06.660> a

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
once the item is taken you want a

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.330 
once the item is taken you want a
repeater<00:04:07.020> here<00:04:07.080> on<00:04:07.380> for<00:04:07.650> tick<00:04:07.830> delayed<00:04:08.100> just

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
repeater here on for tick delayed just

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.770 
repeater here on for tick delayed just
to<00:04:08.430> give<00:04:08.550> enough<00:04:08.760> time<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.390> victim<00:04:09.660> to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
to give enough time for the victim to

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.350 
to give enough time for the victim to
fall<00:04:10.050> down<00:04:10.380> before<00:04:11.190> they<00:04:11.640> get<00:04:12.060> their<00:04:12.209> head

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
fall down before they get their head

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.600 
fall down before they get their head
smushed<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:13.020> also<00:04:13.230> for<00:04:14.040> tech<00:04:14.250> delay<00:04:14.489> on

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
smushed and then also for tech delay on

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.699 
smushed and then also for tech delay on
these<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:15.450> they<00:04:15.540> get<00:04:15.660> like<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.900> what's<00:04:16.470> not<00:04:16.590> like

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
these so they get like a what's not like

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.870 
these so they get like a what's not like
point<00:04:17.690> point<00:04:18.690> seven<00:04:19.140> seconds<00:04:19.650> time<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.669> fall

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
point point seven seconds time to fall

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.159 
point point seven seconds time to fall
down<00:04:20.910> because<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.510> have<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.630> repeater<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:22.020> the

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
down because you have a repeater on the

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.970 
down because you have a repeater on the
other<00:04:22.290> side<00:04:22.470> arm<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.970> then<00:04:24.630> also<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.530> want

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
other side arm and then also you want

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.060 
other side arm and then also you want
that<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.880> Rebs<00:04:27.180> online<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.690> tee<00:04:27.960> off<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.530> go

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
that that Rebs online to tee off and go

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.460 
that that Rebs online to tee off and go
into<00:04:29.340> 80<00:04:30.120> flip-flop<00:04:30.540> don't<00:04:30.780> worry<00:04:31.020> about<00:04:31.080> this

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
into 80 flip-flop don't worry about this

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.260 
into 80 flip-flop don't worry about this
thing<00:04:31.710> right<00:04:31.740> here<00:04:31.919> just<00:04:32.370> yet<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.880> goes<00:04:33.060> into<00:04:33.180> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
thing right here just yet it goes into a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.170 
thing right here just yet it goes into a
tea<00:04:33.419> flip-flop<00:04:33.840> um<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:35.610> I've<00:04:35.970> already

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
tea flip-flop um I can I've already

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.350 
tea flip-flop um I can I've already
explained<00:04:36.480> how<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.660> build<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.590> other

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
explained how to build that in other

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.719 
explained how to build that in other
tutorials<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:39.900> check<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.110> out<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:41.160> then<00:04:41.370> so

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
tutorials so check that out and then so

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.580 
tutorials so check that out and then so
it<00:04:41.940> will<00:04:42.090> turn<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.810> right<00:04:43.020> now<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.200> track

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
it will turn on right now the track

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.080 
it will turn on right now the track
needs<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.919> be<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.700> trap

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
needs to be the trap

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.090 
needs to be the trap
to<00:04:45.240> be<00:04:45.360> reset<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.139> i<00:04:46.380> just<00:04:47.040> reset<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.430> um<00:04:48.830> but<00:04:49.830> so

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
to be reset so i just reset it um but so

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.700 
to be reset so i just reset it um but so
the<00:04:50.430> t<00:04:50.850> flip-flop<00:04:51.330> redstone<00:04:51.990> line<00:04:52.199> will<00:04:52.500> go

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
the t flip-flop redstone line will go

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.500 
the t flip-flop redstone line will go
you<00:04:53.340> might<00:04:53.490> even<00:04:53.520> repeated<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.060> just<00:04:54.270> keep<00:04:54.389> the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
you might even repeated I just keep the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.450 
you might even repeated I just keep the
redstone<00:04:54.870> going<00:04:55.229> it<00:04:55.680> will<00:04:55.860> go<00:04:56.010> into<00:04:56.160> two

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
redstone going it will go into two

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.340 
redstone going it will go into two
different<00:04:56.610> lines<00:04:56.880> from<00:04:57.090> here<00:04:57.240> one<00:04:57.630> it'll<00:04:58.229> go

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
different lines from here one it'll go

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.860 
different lines from here one it'll go
into<00:04:58.530> your<00:04:58.590> timer<00:04:58.949> for<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.870> particular

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
into your timer for the particular

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.400 
into your timer for the particular
victim<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.680> then<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.220> will<00:05:02.310> go<00:05:02.340> into<00:05:03.410> this

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
victim and then it will go into this

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.400 
victim and then it will go into this
which<00:05:04.860> power<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.340> your<00:05:05.610> pissing<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.330> when<00:05:07.110> this

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
which power is your pissing so when this

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.379 
which power is your pissing so when this
gets<00:05:07.680> turned<00:05:07.979> on<00:05:08.130> right<00:05:08.280> here<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.669> line<00:05:08.940> it

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
gets turned on right here this line it

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.930 
gets turned on right here this line it
will<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.650> will<00:05:10.710> power<00:05:11.010> your<00:05:11.100> Pistons<00:05:11.610> just

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
will it will power your Pistons just

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.700 
will it will power your Pistons just
long<00:05:12.150> enough<00:05:12.180> for<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.630> t<00:05:12.810> flip-flop<00:05:13.260> to<00:05:13.470> turn

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
long enough for the t flip-flop to turn

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.510 
long enough for the t flip-flop to turn
and<00:05:14.010> for<00:05:14.610> this<00:05:14.729> instant<00:05:15.360> redstone<00:05:15.810> line<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.740> to

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
and for this instant redstone line to to

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.879 
and for this instant redstone line to to
run<00:05:17.729> on<00:05:17.850> top<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.330> Pistons<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:19.410> be<00:05:19.530> powered

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
run on top of the Pistons to be powered

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.510 
run on top of the Pistons to be powered
arm<00:05:21.139> and<00:05:22.139> so<00:05:22.350> that<00:05:22.590> will<00:05:22.770> keep<00:05:22.800> them<00:05:23.010> because

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
arm and so that will keep them because

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.100 
arm and so that will keep them because
this<00:05:23.669> line<00:05:23.910> only<00:05:24.120> gets<00:05:24.360> powered<00:05:24.630> for<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.870> few

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
this line only gets powered for a few

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.930 
this line only gets powered for a few
seconds<00:05:25.470> or<00:05:25.800> not<00:05:26.070> even<00:05:26.160> a<00:05:26.340> few<00:05:26.460> seconds<00:05:26.820> like

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
seconds or not even a few seconds like

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.300 
seconds or not even a few seconds like
me<00:05:27.360> like<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.840> half<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.200> second<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.650> then<00:05:28.710> this

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
me like a half a second and then this

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.760 
me like a half a second and then this
redstone<00:05:29.669> line<00:05:29.910> will<00:05:30.030> keep<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.479> powered<00:05:30.870> until

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
redstone line will keep it powered until

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.250 
redstone line will keep it powered until
this<00:05:32.340> redstone<00:05:32.850> which<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.660> your<00:05:33.780> timer<00:05:34.020> right

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
this redstone which is your timer right

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.450 
this redstone which is your timer right
here<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:35.520> will<00:05:35.729> power<00:05:35.940> your<00:05:36.090> pits<00:05:36.450> piston

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
here it will power your pits piston

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.060 
here it will power your pits piston
which<00:05:38.460> will<00:05:38.669> turn<00:05:38.880> off<00:05:39.180> your<00:05:39.810> head<00:05:40.470> Smasher

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
which will turn off your head Smasher

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
which will turn off your head Smasher
thing<00:05:41.430> um<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.750> then<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.530> then<00:05:43.789> this<00:05:44.789> stuff

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
thing um and then and then this stuff

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.420 
thing um and then and then this stuff
will<00:05:45.270> all<00:05:45.479> be<00:05:45.660> uh<00:05:45.960> it<00:05:46.710> will<00:05:46.830> all<00:05:46.949> be<00:05:47.070> triggered

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
will all be uh it will all be triggered

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.700 
will all be uh it will all be triggered
on<00:05:47.639> because<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.539> T<00:05:48.690> flip-flop<00:05:49.080> won't<00:05:49.350> go<00:05:49.530> back

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
on because the T flip-flop won't go back

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.650 
on because the T flip-flop won't go back
so<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.100> reset<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:50.970> you<00:05:51.180> build<00:05:51.389> this<00:05:51.600> thing

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
so to reset it you build this thing

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.900 
so to reset it you build this thing
which<00:05:52.530> is<00:05:52.590> a<00:05:52.650> redstone<00:05:53.010> torch<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.550> repeater

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
which is a redstone torch and a repeater

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.360 
which is a redstone torch and a repeater
and<00:05:54.150> then<00:05:54.690> this<00:05:55.169> is<00:05:55.320> your<00:05:55.350> reset<00:05:55.860> switch<00:05:56.100> it'll

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
and then this is your reset switch it'll

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.690 
and then this is your reset switch it'll
just<00:05:56.610> turn<00:05:57.090> this<00:05:57.860> turn<00:05:58.860> this<00:05:58.979> piston<00:05:59.370> on<00:05:59.490> for

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
just turn this turn this piston on for

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.820 
just turn this turn this piston on for
just<00:06:00.630> like<00:06:00.840> one<00:06:00.870> take<00:06:01.289> and<00:06:01.440> won't<00:06:01.590> stay<00:06:01.800> on

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
just like one take and won't stay on

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.430 
just like one take and won't stay on
which<00:06:02.550> will<00:06:02.760> power<00:06:03.300> this<00:06:03.900> will<00:06:04.139> power<00:06:04.320> the

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
which will power this will power the

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.860 
which will power this will power the
block<00:06:04.800> which<00:06:05.130> will<00:06:05.340> reset<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.150> T<00:06:06.389> flip-flop

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
block which will reset the T flip-flop

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.360 
block which will reset the T flip-flop
see<00:06:07.110> like<00:06:07.229> now<00:06:07.410> that's<00:06:07.800> another<00:06:08.070> thing<00:06:08.250> the

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
see like now that's another thing the

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.240 
see like now that's another thing the
item<00:06:08.729> potential<00:06:09.660> goes<00:06:10.050> away<00:06:10.229> sometimes<00:06:11.039> so

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
item potential goes away sometimes so

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.430 
item potential goes away sometimes so
like<00:06:11.490> if<00:06:11.880> you<00:06:12.030> haven't<00:06:12.690> reset<00:06:13.020> it<00:06:13.139> in<00:06:13.229> a<00:06:13.289> while

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
like if you haven't reset it in a while

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.860 
like if you haven't reset it in a while
you<00:06:13.800> can<00:06:13.919> just<00:06:14.160> check<00:06:14.910> come<00:06:15.240> back<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:15.539> reset

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
you can just check come back and reset

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.150 
you can just check come back and reset
it<00:06:16.020> um<00:06:17.060> but<00:06:18.060> so<00:06:18.870> yeah<00:06:19.050> that's<00:06:19.200> basically<00:06:19.500> how

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
it um but so yeah that's basically how

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.159 
it um but so yeah that's basically how
the<00:06:20.490> trap<00:06:21.330> works<00:06:21.570> I<00:06:21.690> know<00:06:21.750> it's<00:06:21.930> really

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
the trap works I know it's really

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.610 
the trap works I know it's really
