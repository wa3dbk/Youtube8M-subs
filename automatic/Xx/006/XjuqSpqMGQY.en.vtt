00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.350
 it's max lawson during the river 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.380
 Did you see that the bomb she stole the ball? 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.310
 oil pump 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.510
 the situation of the bomb is there caught 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:49.980
 He had not seen her as he had. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.520
 So, who's the one who plays the kiyota ? 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.970
 I believe it happened 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.970
 or cerapio 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.219
 only a piece of soap opera 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.450
 joint piece arrives together operation 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.200
 on here 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.750
 on a piece of brass in it also because 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.010
 confused is not just a piece itself 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.140
 wait together should have entered the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.830
 bomb and caught what caused this 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.460
 I mess up what happens 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.830
 here also this oil path here 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.930
 This is what makes the bearing feed 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.200
 14 outputs 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.780
 here a weld has been made where 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.790
 Do you know that you're passing your right eye? 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.490
 It's happening the more or less it's going. 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.560
 to know 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.280
 there is also a little ring here 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.740
 he was alone and was docked and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.040
 I could have lost is not run away from 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.260
 loss of pressure here is just where 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:58.330
 get out of here and get your job 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:01.910
 cardinal how it came about is 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.820
 It seems like sand a few pieces here. 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.790
 see the bronze in china 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.360
 as soon as the case that affected the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.360
 Following 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.150
 is how lubrication of the bearings was missing 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.549
 here the buckles have turned and 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.269
 they skated in here then spent here 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:31.250
 what he talks turned out to be good and that 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:37.430
 turned bronze in block block showed here 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:41.150
 should be the wear and tear that arrived until did 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:48.519
 one repair out here there is only one place 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.519
 it's something else 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.890
 the pistons we noticed that who made the 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:00.740
 assembly here did not follow the correct order 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.870
 yesterday one a position here the connecting rods by 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.380
 example here mounted on the wrong side 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.460
 should have been mounted so mounted 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.370
 so this is the service manual everything 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.170
 explains erika and this is the only one that is 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.380
 sure is every service manual explains 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.920
 Easy on the internet, right? 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.110
 an airplane that is the first cylinder 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.560
 this is the 3rd third also reached the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.560
 end of the day 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.629
 the minister assures you that this one here 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.090
 I do not even need to explain much more 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:41.400
 account is black discolored, has not suffered a 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:47.950
 temperature to beat the second too 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.209
 practically melted the picture had a 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.510
 war mounted right 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:58.109
 had only third sequence 123456 that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.109
 was right 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:15.260
 the damage in the block will participate in 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.260
 patchwork the horns to a hole that is 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.290
 there was even a rebound here the tennis player 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.730
 more or less a millimeter does not have until 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.900
 more here too 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.700
 She's the one who turned right here. 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.520
 I just have to stay locked here. 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:40.080
 he can not even hear his daughter 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.210
 if you are a lois 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.960
 They're all doing it right. 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:53.530
 All this is pump. 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:05:01.360
 stopped heart stopped bronzinas the power plant 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:02.890
 macau that also rocker does not have two 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.740
 bronzes in the best line and only for 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:12.930
 show how it should be approximately 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.930
 more or less here on the street 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:22.669
 going down a little those of biel 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.599
 it's here too 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:39.659
 summarizing them there destroyed a ball 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:42.869
 left of the head line alone around the 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.959
 Leftover, maybe you do not have to ask 

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:50.119
 see but told me simons 

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:50.119
 Maybe if you're lucky 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.719
 hat open a business there 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:05.100
 the robot puts itself there is already based on the most 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.100
 only 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:15.010
 and see how much the club will be going out 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.010
 Let's see if we can solve it. 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.950
 It's just for today.
