00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 today we talk about the inevitable shoulder 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.089
 of the dark knight of the sit let's talk 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.089
 about robin 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
 many are the characters they have 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.789
 impersonated robin so let's do one 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.609
 nice roundup of the main ones the first 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.100
 obviously and dick grayson the young man 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.740
 say 12 years was part of a circus 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.099
 itinerant and was a member of the famous 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.740
 family of flying grayson acrobats 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.680
 when the circus arrives tam to the master 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.469
 is ordered to pay the lace from 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.110
 bossy family Zucco the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.690
 master refuses and says discount all 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.610
 the conversation but not giving it weight 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.000
 that same evening during a performance 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 the gangsters break into the circus and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.219
 they kill all his family 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.920
 Orphaned he will be adopted by 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.829
 young enrico bruce wayne who had been 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.020
 very impressed by his non-story dic 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.600
 it will give peace of the disappearance of his 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.090
 family and then start looking for the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.670
 boss gravy throughout the city for this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.170
 will almost kill mar batman lo 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.689
 will save the last one 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.570
 awakened in the batman bat cave 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.820
 he reveals his true identity and proposes 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.490
 to the young dic to become his 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.979
 shoulder from then on dic becomes 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.590
 robin accompanying the dark knight 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.259
 of his adventures arrived though 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 at the age of 17 he begins to have one 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.049
 very different view of the struggle to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.420
 crime with batman abandons in a manner 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.939
 wayne not knowing what to do turns to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.310
 superman superman and recommend them 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.130
 to go it alone and so it is becoming 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.670
 nightwing but there is no batman i 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.100
 without a robin and here comes the second 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.340
 jason todd a problematic young man 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.790
 street orphan who tried to steal 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 the wheels of the batmobile struck by the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.930
 boy and wanting to save it from 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.020
 orphanage where he was 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.590
 he only churned out criminals, he takes it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.780
 with him and adopts it after an in 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.510
 I think training becomes the second 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.599
 but robin jason has a temper 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.480
 very violent and impulsive e 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.090
 extremely angry and upsets 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.670
 many in the plans drawn up by batman 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.769
 come to a climax bruce you see 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.230
 forced to suspend the young man e 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.239
 therefore jason will return to his neighborhood 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.580
 in search of his mother 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.150
 and in this research he will unfortunately find the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.910
 death joker hits him repeatedly 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.310
 almost to death with an iron bar e 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.040
 then lets it die in an explosion 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.440
 Jason will return after final crisis like 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.180
 anti hero with the name of red hood 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.400
 but that's another story 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.129
 batman was completely disheartened 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.379
 from the death of jason and therefore day 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.410
 after day his methods are done 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.690
 more and more obscure this time will not look 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.099
 a new robin but to the new robin 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.379
 he will look for him 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.390
 tim drake I was a kid that 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.150
 the show aid in which 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.099
 died the flying grayson is also a 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.880
 passionate about the feats of batman e 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.069
 robin is known a very detail 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.620
 particularly the movements of the first robin 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.500
 they remember very much those of dick 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.500
 circus grayson doing research 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.739
 discovers that the young dick grayson was 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.799
 It was adopted years earlier by Bruce Wayne 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.889
 the boy between two and two discovers the 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.989
 true identity of batman and robin then 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.760
 approaches the nightwing and convinces him to 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.459
 take it to the cave bat where 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.319
 will meet batman and in person explaining 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.900
 his reasons and his great 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.109
 volunteer to help him in his mission 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.230
 batman 1 will take third robin after 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.180
 a long career as a sidekick too 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.069
 tim drake will start his own business 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.620
 becoming red robin 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.290
 let's say that he was really forced 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.230
 given the arrival of the secret son of 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.299
 batman demian wayne demian is a 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.060

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.760

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.280

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.950

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.389
 after this training is brought to the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.269

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.000
 shocking truth bruce will decide to 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.030
