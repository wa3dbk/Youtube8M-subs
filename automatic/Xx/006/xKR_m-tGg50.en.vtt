out as well that is where you have a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.729 
out as well that is where you have a
flag<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.929> bounces<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.470> between

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
flag that you that bounces back between

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.699 
flag that you that bounces back between
the<00:02:10.950> two

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
the two

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.160 
the two
the<00:02:12.709> flag<00:02:13.250> carrier<00:02:13.580> shows<00:02:14.209> up<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.689> map<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
the flag carrier shows up on the map and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.920 
the flag carrier shows up on the map and
then<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.769> course<00:02:15.799> your<00:02:16.220> job<00:02:16.519> as<00:02:16.819> his<00:02:17.239> team<00:02:17.689> is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
then of course your job as his team is

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.050 
then of course your job as his team is
to<00:02:18.049> defend<00:02:18.379> him<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.920> while<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.579> guys<00:02:19.760> have

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
to defend him and while you guys have

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.350 
to defend him and while you guys have
the<00:02:20.239> flag<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:21.170> earn<00:02:21.409> extra<00:02:21.860> points<00:02:21.980> for<00:02:22.640> each

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the flag you earn extra points for each

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.319 
the flag you earn extra points for each
kill<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.049> i<00:02:24.409> believe<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:25.340> longer<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.120> have

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
kill and i believe the longer you have

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.539 
kill and i believe the longer you have
the<00:02:26.480> flag<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.049> more<00:02:27.349> point<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.799> your<00:02:27.980> earning

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
the flag the more point to your earning

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.300 
the flag the more point to your earning
so<00:02:28.819> i<00:02:29.090> was<00:02:29.810> earning<00:02:29.989> up<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.290> 200<00:02:30.829> points<00:02:31.099> per

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
so i was earning up to 200 points per

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.479 
so i was earning up to 200 points per
kill<00:02:31.549> at<00:02:31.849> one<00:02:32.030> point<00:02:32.269> which<00:02:32.930> was<00:02:33.170> leveling<00:02:33.950> so

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
kill at one point which was leveling so

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.309

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
possible so keeping in mind that the

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.270 
possible so keeping in mind that the
spawns<00:03:35.989> are<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.319> little<00:03:36.560> messed<00:03:36.769> up<00:03:36.949> and<00:03:37.160> it's

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
spawns are a little messed up and it's

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.879 
spawns are a little messed up and it's
hard<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.790> get<00:03:37.910> higher<00:03:38.209> killstreaks<00:03:38.989> if<00:03:39.260> you

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
hard to get higher killstreaks if you

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.039 
hard to get higher killstreaks if you
think<00:03:40.160> about<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.430> using<00:03:41.269> your<00:03:41.419> lower<00:03:41.629> kill

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
think about it using your lower kill

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.960 
think about it using your lower kill
streaks<00:03:42.410> like<00:03:42.609> UAVs<00:03:44.470> counter<00:03:45.470> UAVs<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.459> then

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
streaks like UAVs counter UAVs and then

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.059 
streaks like UAVs counter UAVs and then
maybe<00:03:47.209> up<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.780> seven<00:03:48.379> kill<00:03:48.590> streak<00:03:48.889> which

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
maybe up to a seven kill streak which

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.860 
maybe up to a seven kill streak which
would<00:03:49.220> be<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.639> know<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> helicopter<00:03:50.599> or

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
would be a you know a helicopter or

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.349 
would be a you know a helicopter or
something<00:03:51.290> like<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.760> using<00:03:52.760> those<00:03:52.940> lower

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
something like that using those lower

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.629 
something like that using those lower

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
whatever and then of course you're

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.450 
whatever and then of course you're

earning your kill screens more rapidly

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.189

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
because you're using the lower kill

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.200 
because you're using the lower kill
streaks<00:04:29.560> in<00:04:29.740> addition<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:31.030> use<00:04:31.180> a

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
streaks in addition to that you use a

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.300 
streaks in addition to that you use a
hard<00:04:31.660> line<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.500> you're<00:04:32.650> getting<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.979> ton<00:04:33.280> of

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
hard line so you're getting a ton of

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.230 
hard line so you're getting a ton of
score<00:04:33.729> right<00:04:34.389> now<00:04:34.419> I'm<00:04:34.720> averaging<00:04:35.259> between

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
score right now I'm averaging between

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.770 
score right now I'm averaging between
7,000<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.360> 10,000<00:04:38.139> score<00:04:39.130> per<00:04:39.460> game<00:04:39.759> which<00:04:40.509> I

little bit quicker if that's what you're

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.159 
little bit quicker if that's what you're
interested<00:05:02.199> in<00:05:02.500> doing<00:05:02.889> other<00:05:03.490> than<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:04.169> as
