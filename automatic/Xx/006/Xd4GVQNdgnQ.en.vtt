00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Good people today, Sunday, I decided to do the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 video here to show you 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.540
 the arm support of the faxon art that I 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.340
 I put it in my club and how I had it 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.009
 doubt whether this support would be 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.599
 really useful if it would disrupt the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 term car age 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.859
 I was in doubt before buying 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.609
 I thought it was good to know what 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.580
 purchase 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.210
 so I bought staley the finish is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 very good to have a reasonable object holder 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.399
 wait a lot 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.210
 the driving position is very comfortable 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.100
 and it helps a lot if you can support the arm 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.010
 so that you have access to the steering wheel and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 gearshift both ride 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 also it helps a lot is the arm and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.210
 messes up a little bit when it's time to use 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
 the handbrake 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.120
 You have to find it by the side of here. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.120
 you can access or from here 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:56.240
 in the same way to raise a flat iron 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.240
 of iron 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:10.399
 It was very simple and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.399
 put on the good belt stays firm 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.640
 Instant the inside of the car I liked it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.490
 very worth the investment of a 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 different air in the car became more beautiful 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.540
 interior 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:03:39.110
 it mixes a lot in the tone of the car a 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:03:42.080
 Very good steering wheel and good problem in the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.880
 arm or such installations 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.590
 who have any questions only 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.830
 asking in my garage there that I 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.160
 I'll respond to you, it 's a good one. 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.160
 day
