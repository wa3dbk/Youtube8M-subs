your<00:00:42.300> basic<00:00:42.690> headway<00:00:42.989> setup<00:00:43.379> ok<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.100> let's<00:00:44.399> see

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
your basic headway setup ok so let's see

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.529 
your basic headway setup ok so let's see
it's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.000> two<00:00:45.360> very<00:00:45.840> simple<00:00:47.270> steps<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it's a two very simple steps that you

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.380 
it's a two very simple steps that you
actually<00:00:48.690> take<00:00:49.110> two<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.300> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
actually take two to do that so all you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.150 
actually take two to do that so all you
need<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.170> let's<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.739> jump<00:00:52.949> into

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
need to do first is let's just jump into

need to do first is let's just jump into
the<00:00:53.489> visual<00:00:53.910> editor<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:56.010> first<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.340> want

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the visual editor and the first we want

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790 
the visual editor and the first we want
to<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.000> save<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.270> basic<00:00:57.809> styling<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.410> the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
what making a change here ok and reload

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.520 
what making a change here ok and reload
visual<00:04:19.459> editor<00:04:19.580> so<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.810> is<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.289> test

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
visual editor so this is the the test

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.140 
visual editor so this is the the test
site<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.919> it's<00:04:22.220> starting<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.580> look<00:04:22.729> a<00:04:23.120> little

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
site and it's starting to look a little

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.260 
site and it's starting to look a little
bit<00:04:23.720> like<00:04:24.050> this<00:04:24.229> one<00:04:24.440> okay<00:04:25.039> but<00:04:25.760> what<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.120> need

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
bit like this one okay but what we need

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.500 
bit like this one okay but what we need
to<00:04:26.360> do<00:04:26.450> now<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.930> get<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.620> same<00:04:27.860> bar<00:04:28.100> area<00:04:28.510> look

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
to do now is get the same bar area look

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.909 
to do now is get the same bar area look
in<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.690> same<00:04:29.870> over<00:04:30.140> here<00:04:30.169> now<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.530> could<00:04:30.770> go

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
in the same over here now I could go

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.040 
in the same over here now I could go
into<00:04:31.039> this<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.669> make<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.210> change<00:04:32.570> using

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
into this and just make a change using

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.310 
into this and just make a change using
the<00:04:33.669> actual<00:04:34.669> visual<00:04:34.820> editor<00:04:35.060> but<00:04:35.840> like<00:04:36.080> I<00:04:36.110> say

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
the actual visual editor but like I say

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.080 
the actual visual editor but like I say
there's<00:04:36.530> another<00:04:36.710> simple<00:04:37.310> step<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.820> had<00:04:37.970> we

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
there's another simple step that had we

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.900 
there's another simple step that had we
allows<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.570> do<00:04:38.740> okay<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.310> all<00:04:40.340> want<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.789> do
