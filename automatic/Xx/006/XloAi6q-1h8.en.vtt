omnidirectional thruster just in case

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.640 
omnidirectional thruster just in case
you<00:00:09.360> don't<00:00:09.660> know<00:00:09.719> what<00:00:10.080> an<00:00:10.170> omni<00:00:10.530> directional

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
you don't know what an omni directional

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.539 
you don't know what an omni directional
thrusters<00:00:11.360> it's<00:00:12.360> something<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:13.559> drops<00:00:14.190> in

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
thrusters it's something that drops in

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.429 
thrusters it's something that drops in
all<00:00:15.120> directions<00:00:17.570> this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:19.020> beyond<00:00:19.289> the

all<00:01:14.460> set<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.210> mound<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.659> snow<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.380> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
all set up with a mound of snow and so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.600 
all set up with a mound of snow and so
we<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.310> burn<00:01:17.549> Melbourne<00:01:18.090> stratasys<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
we don't burn Melbourne stratasys I

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.850 
we don't burn Melbourne stratasys I
believe<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> launch<00:01:21.000> nice<00:01:21.360> right<00:01:21.689> over<00:01:21.810> here

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.340 

the<00:01:26.860> first<00:01:27.159> step<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.690> place<00:01:29.140> the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
the first step is to place the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.130 
the first step is to place the
omnidirectional<00:01:29.830> toaster<00:01:30.670> like<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:34.140> second

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
omnidirectional toaster like so second

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.370 
omnidirectional toaster like so second
step<00:01:35.380> make<00:01:36.010> sure<00:01:36.040> that<00:01:37.260> your<00:01:38.260> rocket<00:01:38.740> igniter

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
step make sure that your rocket igniter

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.550 
step make sure that your rocket igniter
which<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.740> item<00:01:42.070> right<00:01:42.220> here<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
which is this item right here is

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.070 
which is this item right here is
properly<00:01:45.520> aligned<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.660> that's<00:01:46.840> what<00:01:46.960> we're

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
properly aligned so that's what we're

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.300 
properly aligned so that's what we're
going<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.259> do<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:47.530> have<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.830> make<00:01:47.950> sure<00:01:47.979> that

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
going to do we have to make sure that

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.300 
going to do we have to make sure that
none<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.729> wires<00:01:49.000> touch<00:01:49.600> each<00:01:49.810> other

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
none of the wires touch each other

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.650 
none of the wires touch each other
otherwise<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.670> will<00:01:51.759> short-circuit<00:01:52.210> and

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
otherwise it will short-circuit and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.700 
otherwise it will short-circuit and
that's<00:01:53.470> not<00:01:53.830> very<00:01:54.009> good<00:01:54.900> because<00:01:55.900> I'll<00:01:56.410> walk

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
that's not very good because I'll walk

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.889 
that's not very good because I'll walk
up<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.430> then<00:01:57.759> my<00:01:58.000> head<00:01:58.240> will<00:01:58.450> get<00:01:58.660> blown

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
up to it and then my head will get blown

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.800 
up to it and then my head will get blown
off<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:01.210> here<00:02:01.690> we<00:02:01.720> are<00:02:02.100> trying<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.630> fix<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
off so here we are trying to fix the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.670 
off so here we are trying to fix the
damn<00:02:05.020> thing<00:02:09.179> somehow<00:02:10.179> these<00:02:10.360> two<00:02:11.320> seem<00:02:11.650> to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
damn thing somehow these two seem to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.590 
damn thing somehow these two seem to
have<00:02:11.830> done<00:02:12.040> criss-cross<00:02:12.670> are<00:02:13.000> right<00:02:13.270> here<00:02:13.480> we

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
have done criss-cross are right here we

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.740 
have done criss-cross are right here we
go<00:02:14.310> note<00:02:15.310> how<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.550> two<00:02:15.850> ends<00:02:16.030> meet<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.720> that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
go note how the two ends meet at that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.870 
go note how the two ends meet at that
central<00:02:17.320> point<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:18.670> will<00:02:18.850> now<00:02:19.000> attach<00:02:20.880> the
