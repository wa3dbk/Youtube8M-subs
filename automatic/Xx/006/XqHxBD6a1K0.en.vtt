00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
vertigo things like that but basically

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.670 
vertigo things like that but basically

you're just going to load up the capture
the<00:00:22.710> flag<00:00:23.010> game<00:00:23.580> mode<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.060> does<00:00:24.539> not<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the flag game mode it does not have to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.060

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
required for this one it is just a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
required for this one it is just a
complete<00:00:31.320> glitch<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.340> probably<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> best

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
complete glitch it is probably the best

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.780 
complete glitch it is probably the best
coaches<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.960> seen<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.770> black<00:00:35.040> ops<00:00:35.190> 2<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.579> far

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
coaches have seen on black ops 2 so far

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430 
coaches have seen on black ops 2 so far
because<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.270> doesn't<00:00:36.510> require<00:00:36.540> mods<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
because it doesn't require mods like the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
because it doesn't require mods like the
Dragon<00:00:37.800> Fire<00:00:38.010> capture<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> flag<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:39.030> but

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
Dragon Fire capture the flag thing but

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.479 
Dragon Fire capture the flag thing but

and<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:19.110> i<00:01:19.200> said<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.470> don't<00:01:19.619> need<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and like i said you don't need to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
and like i said you don't need to
capture<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.220> flag<00:01:20.400> bond<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.450> use

capture the flag bond but you can use

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.469 
capture the flag bond but you can use
them<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> killstreak<00:01:22.650> faster<00:01:23.479> but

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.300 
AGR and you should be in this weird
screen<00:03:07.670> you're<00:03:07.970> kind<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.209> at<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.360> low<00:03:08.569> point<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
screen you're kind of at a low point and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.770 
screen you're kind of at a low point and
once<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.430> do<00:03:10.610> that<00:03:10.640> you've<00:03:11.180> done<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.540> glitch

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
once you do that you've done the glitch

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.350 
once you do that you've done the glitch
so<00:03:12.590> basically<00:03:13.579> after<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:14.060> you're<00:03:14.299> just

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
so basically after that you're just

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.840 
so basically after that you're just
going<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:14.750> want<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.349> go<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.560> an<00:03:15.769> area<00:03:15.950> where

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
going to want to go to an area where

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.610 
going to want to go to an area where
there<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> death<00:03:17.630> barrier<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.260> you're

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
there is a death barrier and you're

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.650 
there is a death barrier and you're
going<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.829> have<00:03:18.920> your<00:03:19.100> friend<00:03:19.459> come<00:03:20.359> with<00:03:20.540> you

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
going to have your friend come with you

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.539 
going to have your friend come with you
because<00:03:20.810> your<00:03:21.380> friend<00:03:21.709> if<00:03:21.889> he<00:03:21.920> does<00:03:22.190> not<00:03:22.310> want

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
because your friend if he does not want

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.920 
because your friend if he does not want
to<00:03:22.609> hit<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.819> death<00:03:22.970> barrier<00:03:23.269> has<00:03:23.569> to<00:03:23.810> be

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
to hit the death barrier has to be

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.680 
to hit the death barrier has to be
within<00:03:24.319> about<00:03:24.859> it<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.220> little<00:03:26.030> bit<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.329> radius

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
within about it a little bit of a radius

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.720 
within about it a little bit of a radius
he<00:03:27.200> can't<00:03:27.620> get<00:03:27.739> very<00:03:27.889> far<00:03:28.010> away<00:03:28.190> from<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.639> or

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
he can't get very far away from you or

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.129 
he can't get very far away from you or
else<00:03:28.819> he<00:03:29.030> will<00:03:29.150> die<00:03:29.329> from<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.630> death<00:03:29.780> barrier

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
else he will die from the death barrier

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.449 
else he will die from the death barrier
