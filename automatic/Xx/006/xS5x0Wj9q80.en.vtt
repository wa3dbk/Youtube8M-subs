00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.430
 bassist this is a bass player that 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.900
 It seems that I also made a back if not 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.550
 I remember very well but it is already 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.260
 detracting the video from a boxing 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.510
 this knife and well let's go to 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.140

 wireless or the pinches hearing aids not that 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.750
 is what the box has to see if what 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.200
 I can focus here because with the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.150
 budget to buy here is a 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100
 patita and I have it tied here with a 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.210
 league that you can not see is 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.970
 this camera 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.000
 but here we see what is the front of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.000
 the camera and there I am dancing 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.960
 the side the back not here the side 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.220
 left here and the top part that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.530
 here, if you do not want to open them 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.210
 you just want to hang them here 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.610
 you can do it, but we're going to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 quickly remove here what is the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.500
 the plastic to this 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.570
 let's take this very shiny and very 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.229
 opaque at a time and I do not know if it is understood 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.150
 that a box extremely similar to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.580
 a shoe box I think of this 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.500
 side is how it opens because there 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.259
 the logo shines let's open it 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.140
 there is the box here has the view of 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.300
 the time to box something like that and not here 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.470
 has a small tongue a small 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.470
 language that we can do well 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.209
 and something like that is very pretty but good 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.540
 let's lift it up and gentlemen look at nothing 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.849

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:34.180

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.480
