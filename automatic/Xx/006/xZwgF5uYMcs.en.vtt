do it like this and then do the same to
the<00:02:19.710> other<00:02:19.740> side<00:02:20.070> fold<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.700> over<00:02:22.550> do<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.580> like

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
the other side fold it over do it like

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:46.120 

10<00:02:35.960> i<00:02:36.140> get<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> another<00:02:36.890> hair<00:02:37.220> bow<00:02:37.430> and

and loop it through like I had the
original<00:02:50.099> one<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.980> other<00:02:53.160> loop<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.610> right

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
original one so the other loop is right

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.760
