lay the machete on top of your knee I'd
run<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.400> stone<00:01:51.700> all<00:01:52.300> along<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.020> edge<00:01:53.790> maybe

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
run the stone all along the edge maybe

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.480 
run the stone all along the edge maybe
you<00:01:54.940> can<00:01:55.150> see<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:55.540> way<00:01:55.750> better

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.590 

what<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.270> important<00:02:00.780> well<00:02:01.409> first<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.600> get

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
what is important well first of all get

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.719 
what is important well first of all get
it<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.810> bit<00:02:03.840> wet<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.070> case<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> bit<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it a bit wet or in this case a bit of

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.839 
it a bit wet or in this case a bit of
slow<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
slow on it

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.080 
slow on it
this<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.149> prevents<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> stone

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this just prevents that the stone

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.820 
this just prevents that the stone
doesn't<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.690> stick<00:02:12.989> full<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.560> metal

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
doesn't get stick full of the metal

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.380 
doesn't get stick full of the metal
pieces<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.910> full<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> metal<00:02:15.599> dust<00:02:17.390> second

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
pieces and full of the metal dust second

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.699 
pieces and full of the metal dust second
thing<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.930> very<00:02:19.140> important<00:02:19.590> when

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
thing that is very important when

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.250 
thing that is very important when
sharpening<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.340> machete<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.870> hold

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
sharpening a machete is that you hold

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.860 
sharpening a machete is that you hold
the<00:02:22.410> angle<00:02:22.800> constant<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.209> whole<00:02:24.390> length

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the angle constant in the whole length

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
the angle constant in the whole length
of<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> blade<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.750> simply<00:02:32.060> run<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.209> stone

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
of the blade and I simply run the stone

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.660 
of the blade and I simply run the stone
over<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.530> edge<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:37.170> honing<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.100> edge<00:02:38.280> as

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
over the edge you are honing the edge as

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.120 
over the edge you are honing the edge as
well<00:02:39.299> as<00:02:39.569> sharpening<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> edge<00:02:45.920> well<00:02:46.920> there

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
well as sharpening the edge well there

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.120 
well as sharpening the edge well there
are<00:02:47.280> many<00:02:47.430> many<00:02:48.269> ways<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:49.049> sharpen<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.860> machete

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
are many many ways to sharpen a machete

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.900 
are many many ways to sharpen a machete
but<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:51.390> small<00:02:51.660> stone<00:02:52.280> comes<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.459> very<00:02:53.700> handy

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
but this small stone comes in very handy

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.309 
but this small stone comes in very handy
because<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.080> fine<00:02:55.410> grit<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.850> almost<00:02:57.319> is

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
because it's so fine grit it almost is

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.610 
because it's so fine grit it almost is
finer<00:02:58.769> than<00:02:59.040> natural<00:02:59.819> stone<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.019> find<00:03:01.349> in

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
finer than natural stone you can find in

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.789 
finer than natural stone you can find in
any<00:03:01.830> River<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.910> course<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.799> selenium

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
any River and of course the selenium

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:15.170 
any River and of course the selenium
carbide<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:09.540> harder<00:03:10.290> than<00:03:12.079> metal<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:14.150> one<00:03:15.150> of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
carbide is harder than metal so one of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.520 
carbide is harder than metal so one of
the<00:03:15.650> other<00:03:16.650> pieces<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.840> not<00:03:19.019> far<00:03:19.290> behind

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
the other pieces it's not far behind

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.750 
the other pieces it's not far behind
diamonds

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.540 

so<00:03:27.760> holding<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.300> angles<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:30.010> running<00:03:30.400> the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
so holding the angles and running the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.030 
so holding the angles and running the
stone<00:03:30.850> all<00:03:31.120> along<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.540> blades<00:03:31.810> if<00:03:32.770> you're

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
stone all along the blades if you're

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.030 
stone all along the blades if you're
really<00:03:33.250> sharp<00:03:33.790> machete<00:03:37.319> but<00:03:38.319> let's<00:03:38.770> take<00:03:38.980> a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
really sharp machete but let's take a

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.190 
really sharp machete but let's take a
close-up<00:03:39.370> view<00:03:39.750> there<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.020> blade<00:03:41.370> let's

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
close-up view there is the blade let's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.460 
close-up view there is the blade let's
still<00:03:45.510> put<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.540> big<00:03:46.720> snow<00:03:46.959> on<00:03:47.110> it

all<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.489> way<00:04:18.640> up<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.180> tip<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:21.130> tip<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.340> a

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
all the way up to the tip the tip is a

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.270 
all the way up to the tip the tip is a
bit<00:04:21.700> tricky<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.060> sharpen<00:04:22.900> because<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:24.100> can

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
bit tricky to sharpen because you can

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.980 
bit tricky to sharpen because you can
either<00:04:24.600> twist<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.750> blade<00:04:25.990> towards<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.910> or

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
either twist the blade towards you or

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.370 
either twist the blade towards you or
follow<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:30.180> tip<00:04:31.180> part<00:04:31.540> with<00:04:31.810> your<00:04:31.960> grinding

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
follow the tip part with your grinding

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.940 
follow the tip part with your grinding
stone<00:04:32.680> so<00:04:32.980> you<00:04:33.070> have<00:04:33.250> always<00:04:33.520> ninety<00:04:34.060> degree

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
stone so you have always ninety degree

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:43.890 
stone so you have always ninety degree
and<00:04:36.570> also<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.870> have<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:39.060> increase<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:43.450> angle

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
and also you have to increase the angle

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:52.860 
and also you have to increase the angle
of<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.440> stone<00:04:44.680> at<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.190> tip<00:04:45.400> portion<00:04:51.630> but<00:04:52.630> once

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
of the stone at the tip portion but once

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.820 
of the stone at the tip portion but once
you<00:04:52.990> get<00:04:53.110> used<00:04:53.290> to<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:56.230> end<00:04:56.380> up<00:04:56.530> with<00:04:56.710> the
