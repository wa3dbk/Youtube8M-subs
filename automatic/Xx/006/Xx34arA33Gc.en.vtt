first is to remove this screw that's on

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.530 
first is to remove this screw that's on
the<00:00:33.840> back<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.730> spin<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.030> off<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the back here and just spin it off and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750 
the back here and just spin it off and
it<00:00:36.630> comes<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.890> attach<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it comes right off and then attach the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
it comes right off and then attach the
base<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.899> way<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> is

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
base to it and the way you do that is

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.869 
base to it and the way you do that is
simply<00:00:41.219> by<00:00:42.559> inserting<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.460> hole<00:00:44.670> that's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
simply by inserting the hole that's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.959 
simply by inserting the hole that's
there<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.170> into<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.649> screw<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> then

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
there from this into your screw and then

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
there from this into your screw and then
you<00:00:48.090> tighten<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.570> back<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:51.110> easily

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you tighten that back here easily

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.819 
you tighten that back here easily
supposedly<00:00:53.370> okay<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.000> go<00:01:00.559> okay<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.739> we

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
supposedly okay there we go okay here we

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.630 
supposedly okay there we go okay here we
go<00:01:02.090> alright<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.390> tightened<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:03.799> now<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
go alright it's tightened down now this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.859 
go alright it's tightened down now this
arm<00:01:06.049> slides<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.760> little<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:08.850> slides<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
arm slides a little bit slides up and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
arm slides a little bit slides up and
down<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> angle<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:12.600> it'll

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
down as you can see the angle that it'll

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.620 
down as you can see the angle that it'll
give<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.740> substantial<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> have

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
give you is substantial so what you have

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.749 
give you is substantial so what you have
to<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.259> determine<00:01:16.650> what's<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> best<00:01:17.189> angle

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to do is determine what's the best angle

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.340 
to do is determine what's the best angle
if<00:01:18.150> you're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:18.780> well<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.140> let<00:01:19.259> me

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
if you're going to use well here let me

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.140 
if you're going to use well here let me
tighten<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> show<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.880> you're

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
tighten it up and show you if you're

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
tighten it up and show you if you're
going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.390> use<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.840> unit<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> desktop

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
going to use this unit as a desktop

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.700 
going to use this unit as a desktop
replacement<00:01:23.580> stand<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.530> your

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
replacement stand you would take your

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
replacement stand you would take your
computer<00:01:26.659> set<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> open<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> up

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
computer set it on here and open it up

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.870 
computer set it on here and open it up
now<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.290> angle<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> too<00:01:32.369> severe<00:01:32.850> for

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
now you can this angle is too severe for

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.730 
now you can this angle is too severe for
this<00:01:33.329> screen<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.170> open<00:01:34.259> all<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> way

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
this screen it doesn't open all the way

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980 
this screen it doesn't open all the way
so<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> set<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.600> back<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so you would have to set this back a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.340 
so you would have to set this back a
little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.390> then<00:01:39.390> move<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.810> somewhat

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
little bit and then move it up somewhat

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.999 
little bit and then move it up somewhat
maybe<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.130> third<00:01:42.079> then<00:01:43.079> set<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> unit<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:43.950> on

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
maybe a third then set the unit back on

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.830 
maybe a third then set the unit back on
top<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.030> all<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> sudden<00:01:45.479> you've<00:01:45.810> got

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
top of it and all of a sudden you've got

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
top of it and all of a sudden you've got
a<00:01:45.930> better<00:01:46.140> viewing<00:01:46.439> angle<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
a better viewing angle can you see that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.630 
a better viewing angle can you see that
and<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and so this is and you can see that the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.969 
and so this is and you can see that the
lip<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:52.320> than<00:01:52.500> enough<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
lip is here is more than enough to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.230 
lip is here is more than enough to
support<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:54.119> lip<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:55.520> plastic<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
support this this lip is plastic it's a
