a<00:00:58.989> little<00:00:59.110> different<00:00:59.650> than<00:00:59.799> staying<00:01:00.159> on<00:01:00.339> top

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
a little different than staying on top

a little different than staying on top
of<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:00.760> ball<00:01:00.940> from<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.659> guy<00:01:01.809> who's<00:01:02.049> throwing

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
there's an easy way to figure out if a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
let's get started here I'm gonna first

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.929 
let's get started here I'm gonna first
move<00:01:23.649> up<00:01:23.829> here<00:01:24.009> so<00:01:24.219> you<00:01:24.310> can<00:01:24.429> see<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.700> little

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
move up here so you can see a little

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.749 
move up here so you can see a little
easier<00:01:25.179> but<00:01:25.960> let's<00:01:26.229> say<00:01:26.469> I<00:01:26.500> am<00:01:26.979> throwing<00:01:27.399> a

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
easier but let's say I am throwing a

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.719 
easier but let's say I am throwing a
ball<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.359> I<00:01:28.869> throw<00:01:29.289> right<00:01:29.649> over<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.189> top<00:01:30.429> and

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
ball and I throw right over the top and

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.609 
ball and I throw right over the top and
my<00:01:31.090> fingers<00:01:31.509> are<00:01:31.689> right<00:01:31.780> on<00:01:31.929> top<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.409> ball

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
my fingers are right on top of the ball

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.300 
my fingers are right on top of the ball
this<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.460> course<00:01:33.490> would<00:01:33.969> be<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.240> player's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
this of course would be that player's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.859 
this of course would be that player's
perfect<00:01:36.310> position<00:01:36.789> in<00:01:36.909> terms<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.329> keeping<00:01:37.749> his

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
perfect position in terms of keeping his

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.779 
perfect position in terms of keeping his
fingers<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.499> top<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.280> ball<00:01:39.460> when<00:01:39.700> he

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
fingers on top of the ball when he

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.550 
fingers on top of the ball when he
throws<00:01:40.090> that's<00:01:40.840> where<00:01:41.109> he's<00:01:41.200> going<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.499> get

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
throws that's where he's going to get

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.919 
throws that's where he's going to get
the<00:01:41.710> maximum<00:01:41.890> velocity<00:01:42.780> movement<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.899> whole

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
the maximum velocity movement the whole

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.580 
the maximum velocity movement the whole
bit<00:01:44.320> now<00:01:44.950> when<00:01:45.159> players<00:01:45.429> start<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.820> get<00:01:46.030> tired

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
bit now when players start to get tired

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.620 
bit now when players start to get tired
sometimes<00:01:47.590> their<00:01:48.070> fingers<00:01:48.490> start<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:48.880> dip<00:01:49.359> on

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
sometimes their fingers start to dip on

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.050 
sometimes their fingers start to dip on
the<00:01:49.689> side<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.499> the<00:01:50.560> ball<00:01:50.770> first<00:01:51.460> off<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.909> could

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
the side of the ball first off it could

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.419 
the side of the ball first off it could
be<00:01:52.119> because<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.780> arm<00:01:52.990> angle<00:01:53.259> their<00:01:54.009> arm<00:01:54.189> gets

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
be because the arm angle their arm gets

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.099 
be because the arm angle their arm gets
tired<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.909> they<00:01:54.999> stop<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.329> drop<00:01:55.600> their<00:01:55.810> arm<00:01:56.020> a

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
tired and they stop to drop their arm a

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.050 
tired and they stop to drop their arm a
little<00:01:56.200> bit<00:01:56.350> but<00:01:57.009> it<00:01:57.100> could<00:01:57.249> also<00:01:57.399> be<00:01:57.579> that

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
little bit but it could also be that

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.059 
little bit but it could also be that
instead<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.509> being<00:01:58.840> completely<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.619> top<00:01:59.890> of

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
instead of being completely on top of

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.249 
instead of being completely on top of
the<00:02:00.130> ball<00:02:00.340> their<00:02:00.939> fingers<00:02:01.420> kind<00:02:01.719> of<00:02:01.810> go<00:02:01.929> off<00:02:02.079> to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
the ball their fingers kind of go off to

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.620 
the ball their fingers kind of go off to
the<00:02:02.289> side<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.679> little<00:02:03.009> bit<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:04.149> that's<00:02:04.359> when

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
the side a little bit and that's when

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.629 
the side a little bit and that's when
they<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.929> lose<00:02:05.139> movement<00:02:05.710> velocity<00:02:06.429> and

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
they can lose movement velocity and

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:09.150 
they can lose movement velocity and
generally<00:02:07.329> things<00:02:07.569> go<00:02:07.810> wrong<00:02:08.020> from<00:02:08.229> there<00:02:08.500> now

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.420 
catch with your kids some kids throw
what<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.150> called<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.570> natural<00:03:35.870> slider<00:03:36.590> now<00:03:37.250> what

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
what is called a natural slider now what

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.250 
what is called a natural slider now what
that<00:03:37.460> means<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:38.180> when<00:03:38.420> they<00:03:38.600> throw<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> baseball

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
that means is when they throw a baseball

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.370 
that means is when they throw a baseball
their<00:03:40.250> fingers<00:03:40.850> generally<00:03:41.510> come<00:03:41.750> on<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.080> side

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
their fingers generally come on the side

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.710 
their fingers generally come on the side
of<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.740> ball<00:03:42.950> instead<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.790> saying<00:03:44.060> staying

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
of the ball instead of saying staying

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.740 
of the ball instead of saying staying
directly<00:03:45.410> behind<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.190> baseball<00:03:46.640> they<00:03:47.450> kind

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
directly behind the baseball they kind

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.260 
directly behind the baseball they kind
of<00:03:47.810> turn<00:03:48.110> their<00:03:48.380> arm<00:03:49.130> just<00:03:49.490> like<00:03:49.550> this<00:03:49.670> or<00:03:50.060> turn

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
of turn their arm just like this or turn

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.760 
of turn their arm just like this or turn
their<00:03:50.450> hand<00:03:50.660> just<00:03:50.840> like<00:03:50.990> this<00:03:51.170> many<00:03:51.500> kids

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
their hand just like this many kids

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.770 
their hand just like this many kids
don't<00:03:51.980> even<00:03:52.070> know<00:03:52.310> they're<00:03:52.520> doing<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:53.060> but<00:03:53.630> the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
don't even know they're doing it but the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.930 
don't even know they're doing it but the
easiest<00:03:54.290> way<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.560> figure<00:03:55.040> out<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.640> kid<00:03:55.910> is

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
easiest way to figure out if a kid is

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.810 
easiest way to figure out if a kid is
doing<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.840> his<00:03:57.500> ball<00:03:57.860> will<00:03:58.130> almost<00:03:58.370> come

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
doing that is his ball will almost come

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.990 
doing that is his ball will almost come
out<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.090> his<00:03:59.180> hand<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.780> spin<00:04:00.340> like<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.640> on

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
out of his hand and spin like this on

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.210 
out of his hand and spin like this on
its<00:04:02.360> way<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.750> target<00:04:02.960> almost<00:04:03.620> like<00:04:03.920> a

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
its way to the target almost like a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.340 
its way to the target almost like a
little<00:04:04.850> bit<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.180> curve<00:04:05.450> or<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.870> ball<00:04:06.170> that's

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
little bit of a curve or a ball that's

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.280 
little bit of a curve or a ball that's
certainly<00:04:06.830> not<00:04:07.640> spinning<00:04:08.120> like<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.600> fastball

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
certainly not spinning like a fastball

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.730 
certainly not spinning like a fastball
which<00:04:09.980> would<00:04:10.190> be<00:04:10.370> more<00:04:10.670> 12<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.810> 6<00:04:12.110> or<00:04:12.380> if<00:04:12.590> he's<00:04:12.710> a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
which would be more 12 to 6 or if he's a

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.270 
which would be more 12 to 6 or if he's a
3/4<00:04:13.520> it<00:04:14.030> would<00:04:14.210> be<00:04:14.360> spinning<00:04:14.660> like<00:04:15.020> this<00:04:15.860> any

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
3/4 it would be spinning like this any

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.280 
3/4 it would be spinning like this any
time<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.060> see<00:04:17.270> that<00:04:17.480> ball<00:04:17.660> spinning<00:04:18.080> the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
time you see that ball spinning the

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.710 
time you see that ball spinning the
other<00:04:18.320> way<00:04:18.680> like<00:04:18.710> a<00:04:19.070> slider<00:04:19.609> or<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.000> curve<00:04:20.420> ball

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
other way like a slider or a curve ball

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.350 
other way like a slider or a curve ball
that's<00:04:21.590> when<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.010> know<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.640> kids<00:04:22.910> fingers

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
that's when you know the kids fingers

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.600 
that's when you know the kids fingers
are<00:04:23.600> not<00:04:23.930> staying<00:04:24.740> on<00:04:25.010> top<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.460> ball

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
are not staying on top of the ball

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.540 
are not staying on top of the ball
they're<00:04:26.330> coming<00:04:26.780> off<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.200> side<00:04:27.440> now<00:04:28.220> as<00:04:28.400> I

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
they're coming off to the side now as I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.250 
they're coming off to the side now as I
said<00:04:28.610> what's<00:04:29.060> causing<00:04:29.390> that

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
said what's causing that

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.950 
said what's causing that
could<00:04:30.500> be<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.770> kids<00:04:30.980> arm<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:31.520> tired<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.000> it's

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
could be the kids arm is tired and it's

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.530 
could be the kids arm is tired and it's
harder<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.410> keep<00:04:33.650> my<00:04:33.890> arm<00:04:34.100> up<00:04:34.310> top<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.850> my<00:04:35.360> arm

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
harder to keep my arm up top and my arm

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.680 
harder to keep my arm up top and my arm
starts<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.140> drop<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.680> my<00:04:36.770> fingers<00:04:37.160> come<00:04:37.370> down

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
starts to drop and my fingers come down

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.540 
starts to drop and my fingers come down
but<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.780> could<00:04:38.900> also<00:04:39.050> just<00:04:39.560> be<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.920> kids<00:04:40.130> never

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
but it could also just be the kids never

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.150 
but it could also just be the kids never
taught<00:04:40.880> how<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.450> stay<00:04:41.840> behind<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.710> baseball

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
taught how to stay behind the baseball

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.190 
taught how to stay behind the baseball
more<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.090> can<00:04:44.240> take<00:04:44.390> some<00:04:44.420> practice<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
more and that can take some practice and

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.230 
more and that can take some practice and
that's<00:04:45.290> something<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.950> every<00:04:46.670> kid<00:04:46.700> can

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
that's something that every kid can

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.790 
that's something that every kid can
learn<00:04:47.510> when<00:04:47.780> they're<00:04:47.930> playing<00:04:48.170> catch<00:04:48.500> is

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
learn when they're playing catch is

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.630 
learn when they're playing catch is
watch<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:50.420> person<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.980> ball<00:04:52.190> that's<00:04:52.400> being

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
watch the person the ball that's being

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.520 
watch the person the ball that's being
thrown<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.180> them<00:04:53.390> watch<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:54.050> spin<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
thrown to them watch the spin of the

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.550 
thrown to them watch the spin of the
ball<00:04:54.770> if<00:04:55.310> it's<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.550> normal<00:04:55.970> fastball<00:04:56.630> action<00:04:57.170> it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
ball if it's a normal fastball action it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.380 
ball if it's a normal fastball action it
should<00:04:57.830> be<00:04:57.980> getting<00:04:58.130> some<00:04:58.520> movement<00:04:58.670> down<00:04:59.120> the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
should be getting some movement down the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.380 
should be getting some movement down the
way<00:04:59.830> if<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:01.160> fingers<00:05:01.730> come<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.090> underneath

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
way if the fingers come in underneath

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.720 
way if the fingers come in underneath
the<00:05:02.510> ball<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:02.840> not<00:05:03.320> staying<00:05:03.740> on<00:05:03.950> top<00:05:04.160> it's

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
the ball and not staying on top it's

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.520 
the ball and not staying on top it's
going<00:05:04.880> to<00:05:04.970> be<00:05:05.090> more<00:05:05.300> of<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.510> curveball<00:05:05.810> action

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
going to be more of a curveball action

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.320 
going to be more of a curveball action
and<00:05:06.770> that's<00:05:07.250> not<00:05:07.460> good<00:05:07.700> for<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.940> pitcher<00:05:08.240> it's

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
and that's not good for a pitcher it's

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.030 
and that's not good for a pitcher it's
not<00:05:08.450> good<00:05:08.630> for<00:05:08.780> his<00:05:08.930> arm<00:05:09.170> but<00:05:09.710> it's<00:05:09.830> certainly

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
not good for his arm but it's certainly

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.760 
not good for his arm but it's certainly
not<00:05:10.130> good<00:05:10.490> for<00:05:10.700> velocity<00:05:11.000> or<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:12.470> kind<00:05:12.680> of

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
not good for velocity or the kind of

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.620 
not good for velocity or the kind of
movement<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.220> want<00:05:13.490> so<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.090> hope<00:05:14.210> that<00:05:14.390> clears

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
movement you want so I hope that clears

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.720 
movement you want so I hope that clears
up<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.960> question<00:05:15.350> about<00:05:15.560> what<00:05:16.070> staying<00:05:16.490> on

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
up the question about what staying on

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.820 
up the question about what staying on
top<00:05:17.060> of<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.330> ball<00:05:17.450> means<00:05:17.750> as<00:05:18.140> a<00:05:18.170> pitcher<00:05:18.650> and

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
top of the ball means as a pitcher and
