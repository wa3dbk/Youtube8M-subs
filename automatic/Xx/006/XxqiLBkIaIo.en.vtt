now<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.080> technique<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:38.560> going<00:03:38.950> to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
now this is a technique that's going to

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.680 
now this is a technique that's going to
take<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> lot<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:39.760> practice<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.480> going<00:03:40.630> to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
take a lot of practice and it's going to

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.300 
take a lot of practice and it's going to
take<00:03:40.900> some<00:03:41.110> time<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.740> don't<00:03:41.890> think<00:03:42.160> that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
take some time so don't think that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.980 
take some time so don't think that
you're<00:03:42.430> going<00:03:42.520> to<00:03:42.580> get<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.880> all<00:03:43.060> done<00:03:43.390> this<00:03:43.750> by
