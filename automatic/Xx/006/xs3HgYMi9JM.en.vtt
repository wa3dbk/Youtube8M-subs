 substance represents what is happening 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.230
 in doors with storms this project 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.909
 represents what it is about since 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.680
 when we started the department of 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.840
 trade and the secretary the president 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.110
 obama on his staff

 countries with emerging economies and there 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.960
 we decided to compete the companies that 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.680
 already existed in Puerto Rico - world fame 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.080

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.490
 from scenes of millions of dollars that 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.370
 they are getting up here at the airport 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.400
