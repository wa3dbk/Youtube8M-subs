 [Music] 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.070
 have you played the so popular minecraft 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.289
 it is an independent electronic game 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.289
 created by Swedish programmer markus 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.230
 persson a game basically made of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.750
 blocks with landscapes and most of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.599
 their objects composed of them and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 allowing them to be removed and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.210
 replaced elsewhere to create 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.370
 buildings piling up the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 mining mechanics and collection of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.250
 in-game construction features 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 mixture of survival and exploitation 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 even has no goals and so 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.640
 You just can not say hello. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 he has no end 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.410
 with more than one million copies sold 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.960
 shortly after the target version of the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.109
 game has been released the game has conquered 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.660
 millions of fans and it's hard to never 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.450
 heard of it but in all this 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.200
 there is a dark side to the report of a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.240
 player 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.820
 spread fear on the internet and created 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 hypotheses that a hidden creature 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.650
 would exist in the game or only now this 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.100
 report and take your own 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.200
 conclusions 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 recently created a new map in 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.299
 minecraft single player game on 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.210
 everything was normal as long as 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.360
 cut the trees and created a small 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.970
 but I noticed something moving between the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.280
 dense haze have a very 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.930
 slow so I have to play with a 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.050
 minute rendering 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.240
 at first I thought it was a cow for 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.250
 I went after her in the hope of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.950
 get some furs for my 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.680
 armor however was not a cow 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.979
 looking in my direction was another 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.020
 character with the default skin color in the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.030
 his eyes were empty 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 I did not see any names appear and I 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.410
 I checked a couple of times for me 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.430
 make sure you were not in the 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.560
 multiplayer 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.259
 he did not stay very long simply 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.550
 looked at me and quickly ran to 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.280
 in the mist 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.070
 I ran after him out of curiosity but he 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.739
 It was though I continued with the game not 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.380
 knowing that thinking while expanding the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.080
 things that seemed outside the world. 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.690
 place for random map generator 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.239
 tunnels two by two in the middle of rocks 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.790
 small and perfect pyramids of sand 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.180
 in the ocean and the woods of trees with 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.560
 all its leaves cut 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.310
 constantly thought that there were 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.989
 seen the other player in the fog 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.810
 deep but I can never get a 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.209
 better view of him I tried to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.180
 more my camera whenever I thought I had 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.640
 a visa but it was no use saving the map 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.160
 and went to the internet forums to 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.980
 see if anyone had found the pseudo 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.470
 there was no one who had the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.570
 Since I created my own topic 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.489
 closed talking about the man and 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.080
 asking if anyone had any 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.480
 similar experience 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.200
 topic has been deleted within five 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 minutes 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.190
 I tried once more that the topic was 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.560
 eliminated even faster 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.380
 then received a personal message 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.570
 of a user named brainwave 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.510
 saying only one word 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.940
 pare when did you go to errol's profile 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.310
 brain gave error on the page I received one 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.650
 mail from another forum user it 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.079
 said the Forum could the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.930
 messages from the forum users and that 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.480
 it was safer to communicate via email to 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.239
 The person who sent the email claimed that he 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.160
 had also seen the mysterious player 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.060
 and had a small forum of others 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.270
 users who had also seen 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.650
 their worlds were obviously 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.349
 covered with strange characteristics 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.290
 they also said that the player 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.810
 mysterious had no pupils around a 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.510
 month passed until I received news 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.640
 of my informant again some of the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.519
 people who had met the man 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.310
 mysterious searched for the name errol brain 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.470
 and found that name was 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.670
 often used by a player 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.650
 from sweden 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.350
 after collecting a few more 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.510
 additional information has revealed that 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.700
 the player was the brother of north 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.970
 the game developer I personally 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.290
 send a message write down and ask if 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.240
 he had a brother 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.400
 It took a while but he told me to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.639
 returns a very short message 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.490
 I had but he is no longer among us 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.590
 I have not seen the mysterious man since our 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.950
 first meeting and I noticed 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.450
 another change on my other maps 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.270
 luckily I was able to take a printscreen 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.760
 When I first saw you, here it is. 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.760
 the only evidence of its existence 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.370
 [Applause] 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.890
 from there several other 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.440
 stories surrounding this legend 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.990
 some say that the note brother had 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.900
 died drowned and would have been added 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.150
 to the game as a tribute although the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.910
 moody company responsible for the game 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.100
 deny the existence of the river or braille 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.080
 whenever there is a large update 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.440
 they put in the list of modifications 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.840
 that the brain river was removed 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.030
 we will hardly know this legend is 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.400
 true or not but through some 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.740
 modes and maps we can have the 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.510
 fear and apprehension that this 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.000
 history can offer 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.400
 the most famous mode is rio bruno 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.860
 player can invoke the 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.590
 feared ghost through the construction of 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.500
 a totem to activate it is necessary to fire 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.900
 fire in the top block of the building and 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.450
 wait for a lightning strike to fall 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.820
 indicating that the monster has already been summoned 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.520
 in this mold the player will have to 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.860
 prepare to face challenges such as 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.260
 traps holes in the ground and animals 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.720
 possessed in addition it is necessary to be 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.750
 prepared for sudden appearances 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.850
 feared to laugh the brain that will not 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.790
 limit to just appear in front of you 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.280
 it may also be equipped with a 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.880
 diamond pick ready for you 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.640
 kill 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.160
 which usually happens so far 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.320
 there is no evidence that the mysterious 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.510
 spirit really exists within the game 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.610
 the developer of minecraft 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.320
 has repeatedly stated that the real 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.720
 brain is just a legend 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.180
 however she plays with the imagination of 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.380
 players always putting on your list 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.380
 Updates 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:41.250
 the message that it was removed 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.360
 If you liked the video, I liked it. 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.700
 down here 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.050
 do not forget and sign up if you are 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.020
 new here 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:54.570
 until the next required 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:59.400
