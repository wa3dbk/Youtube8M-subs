hi this is rolling for nitro Plains calm
we're<00:00:03.360> out<00:00:03.419> here<00:00:03.570> today<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:04.380> test<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.980> dynam

we're out here today to test the dynam
fever<00:00:06.629> now<00:00:06.810> we<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.140> floats<00:00:07.410> set<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.010> a

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
fever now we have the floats set on it a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.940 
fever now we have the floats set on it a
few<00:00:09.179> days<00:00:09.330> ago<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.780> had<00:00:09.929> tested<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.500> using<00:00:10.830> it

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
few days ago we had tested it using it

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.520 
few days ago we had tested it using it
on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> runway<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.269> here's<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.809> float<00:00:13.019> setup

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
on the runway so here's the float setup

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.950 
on the runway so here's the float setup
so<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.769> notice<00:00:14.099> house<00:00:14.340> brackets<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.330> it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
so you notice house brackets here and it

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.370 
so you notice house brackets here and it
has<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.609> wire<00:00:17.609> struts<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:19.230> know

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
has the wire struts that you know

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.570 
has the wire struts that you know
they're<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> little<00:00:19.800> loose<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.279> that's<00:00:20.460> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
they're a little loose but that's that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.890 
they're a little loose but that's that
kind<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> okay<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.570> supposed<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
kind of okay because it's supposed to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.330 
kind of okay because it's supposed to
give<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> little<00:00:22.410> bounce<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.010> keeps<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
give it a little bounce it just keeps it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.060 
give it a little bounce it just keeps it
from<00:00:23.460> bouncing<00:00:23.850> too<00:00:24.029> far<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.500> has<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> spar

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
from bouncing too far and it has a spar

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.939 
from bouncing too far and it has a spar
for<00:00:26.310> support<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> rudder<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.949> steering

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
for support in the rudder for steering

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
for support in the rudder for steering
on<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> water<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.269> let's<00:00:30.779> pop<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> battery

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
on the water so let's pop in a battery

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.229 
on the water so let's pop in a battery
and<00:00:31.980> take<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.969> give<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and take it out there and give it a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.570 
and take it out there and give it a
flight

there's no breeze today as you tell the
trees<00:00:54.430> aren't<00:00:54.670> moving<00:00:54.789> we<00:00:55.390> got<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.570> wonderful

nice clear day you've got the mountains
in<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.420> background<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:59.309> here<00:01:00.309> we<00:01:00.399> go<00:01:00.519> lined

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
in the background and here we go lined

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.719 
in the background and here we go lined
up

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.940 

there<00:01:07.729> she<00:01:07.880> goes<00:01:08.200> nice<00:01:09.200> scale<00:01:09.500> fight<00:01:09.770> for

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
there she goes nice scale fight for

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.990 
there she goes nice scale fight for
takeoff<00:01:11.260> keep<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.380> power<00:01:12.619> on<00:01:12.850> with<00:01:13.850> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
takeoff keep the power on with the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.990 
takeoff keep the power on with the
weight<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.360> floats<00:01:15.340> handles<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.520> little

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
weight of the floats handles a little

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.710 
weight of the floats handles a little
bit<00:01:17.210> differently<00:01:17.600> than<00:01:17.840> with<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.229> wheels<00:01:19.720> so

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
bit differently than with the wheels so

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.960 
bit differently than with the wheels so
you<00:01:20.780> need<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.110> keep<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.350> power<00:01:21.560> on<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.909> other

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
you need to keep the power on the other

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.730 
you need to keep the power on the other
thing<00:01:26.270> you'll<00:01:26.450> need<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.720> do<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:27.110> fly<00:01:27.350> more<00:01:27.590> with

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
thing you'll need to do is fly more with

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.710 
thing you'll need to do is fly more with
the<00:01:27.860> rudder<00:01:28.040> rather<00:01:29.000> than<00:01:29.180> Ella<00:01:29.390> run<00:01:29.570> you

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
the rudder rather than Ella run you

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.359 
the rudder rather than Ella run you
don't<00:01:29.869> want<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.110> get<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.350> wings<00:01:30.560> up<00:01:30.800> tipped

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
don't want to get the wings up tipped

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.680 
don't want to get the wings up tipped
over<00:01:31.550> too<00:01:31.880> much<00:01:32.860> because<00:01:33.860> we<00:01:34.369> do<00:01:34.550> have<00:01:34.759> trees

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
over too much because we do have trees

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.639 
over too much because we do have trees
on<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.200> west<00:01:36.560> side<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:37.009> our<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:38.289> little<00:01:39.289> pond

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
on the west side of our a little pond

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.770 
on the west side of our a little pond
area<00:01:39.920> here<00:01:40.399> I<00:01:40.610> have<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.149> make<00:01:41.300> my<00:01:41.420> turns<00:01:41.660> a

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
area here I have to make my turns a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.460 
area here I have to make my turns a
little<00:01:42.020> earlier<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.560> steer<00:01:42.830> clear<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:43.160> it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
little earlier to steer clear of it

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.960 
little earlier to steer clear of it
we're<00:01:45.470> basically<00:01:45.740> just<00:01:45.890> flying<00:01:46.280> around<00:01:46.460> I'm

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
we're basically just flying around I'm

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.499 
we're basically just flying around I'm
giving<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.660> idea<00:01:49.030> how<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.149> looks<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
giving you the idea how it looks in the

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.399 
giving you the idea how it looks in the
air

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.990 

bring<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> down<00:01:58.680> low<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.159> water<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> next

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
bring it down low with water on the next

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.530 
bring it down low with water on the next
path

so<00:02:21.489> we<00:02:21.610> do<00:02:21.730> have<00:02:21.849> trees<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.230> distance

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
so we do have trees and the distance

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.979 
so we do have trees and the distance
there<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.099> we<00:02:24.189> want<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.400> keep<00:02:24.549> it<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.819> close<00:02:25.030> you
