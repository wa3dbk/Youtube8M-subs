00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
quality and first of all you have to do

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.790 
quality and first of all you have to do
is<00:00:16.690> go<00:00:16.840> to<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.410> configuration<00:00:18.160> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
is go to the configuration and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.900 
is go to the configuration and
emulations<00:00:20.800> settings<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:23.560> check<00:00:24.429> all<00:00:24.730> of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
emulations settings just check all of

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:34.799 
emulations settings just check all of
these<00:00:25.210> that<00:00:25.570> I<00:00:25.779> have<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:33.040> in<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.809> plug-in

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
these that I have now in the plug-in

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.430 
these that I have now in the plug-in
settings<00:00:35.730> direct<00:00:36.730> text<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.539> software<00:00:38.230> mode

settings direct text and software mode

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.010 
settings direct text and software mode
and<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.300> all<00:00:40.539> we<00:00:40.690> have<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:41.050> do<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:43.020> I'm

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
and that it all we have to do and I'm

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.080 
and that it all we have to do and I'm
just<00:00:44.350> going<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.649> show<00:00:44.770> you<00:00:44.949> a<00:00:45.100> little<00:00:45.520> little

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
just going to show you a little little

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.260 
just going to show you a little little
gameplay<00:00:46.660> but<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.620> will<00:00:47.859> be<00:00:47.890> very<00:00:48.309> very<00:00:48.850> slow

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
gameplay but it will be very very slow

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.139 
gameplay but it will be very very slow
and<00:00:49.449> I<00:00:49.629> recommend<00:00:50.079> that<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.710> should<00:00:51.609> have<00:00:51.879> an

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
and I recommend that you should have an

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.549 
and I recommend that you should have an
i5<00:00:53.140> or<00:00:53.170> i7<00:00:54.210> computer<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.660> graphic<00:00:56.109> card<00:00:56.350> of

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
i5 or i7 computer and a graphic card of

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.000 
i5 or i7 computer and a graphic card of
the<00:00:56.590> GT<00:00:57.039> x<00:00:57.219> rays<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:57.730> media<00:00:58.030> geforce

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the GT x rays and media geforce

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.669 
the GT x rays and media geforce
otherwise<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.280> will<00:01:00.429> not<00:01:00.489> work<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:02.260> these

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
otherwise it will not work because these

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:03.990 
otherwise it will not work because these
graphics<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.399> i'm<00:01:03.579> going<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:03.760> show<00:01:03.969> you

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
graphics that i'm going to show you

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.570 
graphics that i'm going to show you
there<00:01:04.390> are<00:01:04.420> even<00:01:05.199> higher<00:01:05.350> than<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.740> ps2<00:01:11.580> as

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
there are even higher than the ps2 as

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.460 
there are even higher than the ps2 as
you<00:01:12.970> can<00:01:13.090> see<00:01:13.330> it's<00:01:13.600> really<00:01:14.229> really<00:01:14.619> slow<00:01:19.470> but

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
you can see it's really really slow but

00:01:20.470 --> 00:02:01.320 
you can see it's really really slow but
the<00:01:20.619> graphics<00:01:20.890> are

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.780 

well<00:02:02.330> that's<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:02.780> for<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.460> that's<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.610> for

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
well that's it for that that's it for

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.020 
well that's it for that that's it for
that<00:02:05.290> long<00:02:06.290> as<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.770> see<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.370> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
that long as you can see the the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.060 
that long as you can see the the
graphics<00:02:08.450> are<00:02:08.570> even<00:02:08.810> higher<00:02:08.930> than<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.290> ps2<00:02:09.770> so

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
graphics are even higher than the ps2 so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.720 
graphics are even higher than the ps2 so
but<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:10.970> clicker<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.420> really<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.800> one<00:02:12.800> half<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.190> an

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
but a clicker is really a one half of an

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.380 
but a clicker is really a one half of an
hello<00:02:13.970> Fred<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:16.430> might<00:02:16.640> not<00:02:16.790> work<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:17.150> most

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
hello Fred so it might not work on most

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.430 
hello Fred so it might not work on most
computers<00:02:18.220> given<00:02:19.220> mine<00:02:20.050> since<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.230> had<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
computers given mine since I had the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.030 
computers given mine since I had the
into<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.770> code<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.130> do<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.930> even<00:02:23.930> though<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.530> have

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
into a code to do and even though I have

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.590 
into a code to do and even though I have
a<00:02:25.070> graphic<00:02:25.790> card<00:02:25.970> from<00:02:26.210> luigy<00:02:26.630> force<00:02:27.250> 9500<00:02:28.250> GT

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
a graphic card from luigy force 9500 GT

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.090 
a graphic card from luigy force 9500 GT
even<00:02:29.600> then<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:30.080> doesn't<00:02:30.320> work<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
even then it doesn't work on the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.800 
even then it doesn't work on the
specification<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:33.140> need<00:02:33.350> an<00:02:33.500> i7<00:02:33.680> or<00:02:34.280> an<00:02:35.270> i5

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
specification so you need an i7 or an i5

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.340 
specification so you need an i7 or an i5
and<00:02:36.170> good<00:02:37.160> graphics<00:02:37.640> card<00:02:38.000> almost<00:02:38.750> light<00:02:39.020> and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
and good graphics card almost light and

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
gtx 320m ensues on the answer is

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.560 
gtx 320m ensues on the answer is
something<00:02:43.580> like<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:45.140> into<00:02:45.440> work<00:02:46.570> ok

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
something like that then into work ok

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.770 
something like that then into work ok
