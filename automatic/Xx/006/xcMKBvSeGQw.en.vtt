00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.329
 well here we are still in minecraft we are 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.670
 taking wood to build a new 

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:12.700
 home because if you remember I was left without 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.100
 house in the previous episode was a 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.840
 pretty fat bitch so we're not going to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.430
 we are not going to waste time we are going to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.560
 build as soon as possible already 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.490
 we have the house that is very important in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.860
 Minecraft 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 and I'm dedicating myself to take everything 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.750
 what I can from woods to sack to sack 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.560
 because I'm going to need 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.310
 I remove until 2 and that's it, I think 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.050
 with this I'm fine 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.050
 I take it all wrong 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.550
 well 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.850
 let's pass it all the tables all 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.850
 all everything 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.890
 OK 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.659
 and this because let's start 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.240
 build here 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.620
 yes I think that there is a good place here but 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.360
 do not lose it 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.360
 do not lose sight of the site this 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.189
 well we do it fast we go there 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.080
 I'm not going to leave a hole here 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.080
 to the wall, forgiveness for the door 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.990
 I have leftover wood dress account 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.220
 I have wood of that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.220
 let's make one more floor 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.770
 my little one more and this is going to stay 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.180
 like a very small burrow but 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.340
 good 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.750
 At least we can sleep 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.750
 what is it that interests us 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.090
 ah 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.620
 Well, we have the second one here 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.360
 home 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.690
 I'm going to do 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.530
 a work bench 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.530
 here we have it 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.260
 I'm going to expand the house a little bit because it's 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.260
 very small 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.599
 to 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.970
 do not 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.270
 and a little better I think there's a bit 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.350
 of space especially for the camera and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.350
 I 'm not going to make a door 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.640
 perfect 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.640
 I do not know why I shot this always 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.190
 we have the door 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.990
 does not fail the hinge or anything 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:41.830
 like that we will take 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.830
 this from here 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.760
 I like not only has been going to 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.740
 finish it so we will put here 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.250
 as well 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.250
 do not 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.520
 good 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.019
 I should make a spike I think I make a 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.019
 peak and a shovel 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.360
 at least 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.320
 a shovel 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.689
 and the peak as it was worth so 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.230
 this is how it is 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:36.310
 do not 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.310
 so it's worth 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.860
 well with this we're going to leave 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:46.449

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.449
