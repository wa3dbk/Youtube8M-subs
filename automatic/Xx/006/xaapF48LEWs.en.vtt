00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.860 

we're<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.210> doing<00:00:15.330> some<00:00:15.599> tracking

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
we're going to be doing some tracking

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.779 
we're going to be doing some tracking
with<00:00:16.139> Aragon<00:00:16.560> today<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.100> see<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.369> he<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.580> find

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
with Aragon today and see if he can find

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.880 
with Aragon today and see if he can find
us<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.660> doing<00:00:18.869> airborne<00:00:19.350> meaning<00:00:19.770> he's

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
us what we doing airborne meaning he's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.769 
us what we doing airborne meaning he's
not<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> be<00:00:20.400> necessarily<00:00:21.240> sticking<00:00:21.630> his

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
not going to be necessarily sticking his

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.630 
not going to be necessarily sticking his
nose<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.199> follow<00:00:22.410> our<00:00:22.619> footprints<00:00:23.010> he's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
nose to follow our footprints he's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
nose to follow our footprints he's
hopefully<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.420> following<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
hopefully going to be following the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019 
hopefully going to be following the
scent<00:00:25.260> that's<00:00:25.410> left<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> air<00:00:26.099> which<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
scent that's left in the air which is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.849 
scent that's left in the air which is
not<00:00:27.210> left<00:00:27.480> behind<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.140> long<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
not left behind for that long so you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.040 
not left behind for that long so you
have<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.429> tracking<00:00:30.269> whoever<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.960> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
have to get tracking whoever it is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.740 
have to get tracking whoever it is
relatively<00:00:31.590> quickly<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.790> an<00:00:32.850> airborne<00:00:33.360> scent

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
relatively quickly for an airborne scent

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600 
relatively quickly for an airborne scent
because<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.710> doesn't<00:00:35.190> stay<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> air

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
because they doesn't stay in the air

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
because they doesn't stay in the air
very<00:00:35.880> long<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.360> doesn't<00:00:36.600> stand<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> branches

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
very long or doesn't stand the branches

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.790 
very long or doesn't stand the branches
as<00:00:37.469> long<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> would<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> ground

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:52.010

hide around the corner hopefully he'll

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.570 
hide around the corner hopefully he'll
hold<00:01:12.490> same<00:01:13.000> path<00:01:13.330> over<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.930> me<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.580> eventually

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
hold same path over to me and eventually

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.160 
hold same path over to me and eventually
i'll<00:01:15.729> hide<00:01:16.000> where<00:01:16.420> he<00:01:16.509> can't<00:01:16.750> see<00:01:16.840> me

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170

is the one I didn't call him I could
make<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.050> couple<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.530> noise<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.920> tipping<00:01:45.340> off

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
make a couple of noise is a tipping off

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.580 
make a couple of noise is a tipping off
perhaps<00:01:46.030> but<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> long<00:01:46.929> run<00:01:46.960> nobody's

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
perhaps but in the long run nobody's

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.430 
perhaps but in the long run nobody's
gonna<00:01:47.710> find<00:01:48.100> me<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:49.030> use<00:01:49.240> his<00:01:49.450> nose<00:01:49.720> okay

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
gonna find me is to use his nose okay

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.649 
gonna find me is to use his nose okay
and<00:01:50.800> if<00:01:51.520> he<00:01:51.670> doesn't<00:01:51.819> want<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> use<00:01:52.330> his<00:01:52.479> nose

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
and if he doesn't want to use his nose

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.109 
and if he doesn't want to use his nose
to<00:01:52.899> find<00:01:52.929> me<00:01:53.349> feat<00:01:54.039> which<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.640> why<00:01:54.789> we<00:01:54.970> use

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
to find me feat which is why we use

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.320 
to find me feat which is why we use
footsteps<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:55.899> they<00:01:56.020> learn<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.470> sniff<00:01:56.830> each

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
footsteps so they learn to sniff each

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.520 
footsteps so they learn to sniff each
individual<00:01:58.330> footsteps<00:01:58.869> if<00:01:59.050> they<00:01:59.200> do<00:01:59.259> that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
individual footsteps if they do that

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.000 
individual footsteps if they do that
they'll<00:01:59.709> never<00:01:59.890> lose<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> try<00:02:00.520> for<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.789> books
