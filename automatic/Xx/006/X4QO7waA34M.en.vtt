00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
we like to express ourselves fully on

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.100 
we like to express ourselves fully on
this<00:00:18.230> instrument<00:00:18.529> you<00:00:19.279> know<00:00:19.400> powerfully<00:00:20.330> with

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
this instrument you know powerfully with

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.560 
this instrument you know powerfully with
a<00:00:21.140> lot<00:00:21.349> of<00:00:21.380> force<00:00:21.770> and<00:00:22.430> I<00:00:22.700> do<00:00:22.759> like<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:23.150> do<00:00:23.420> that

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
a lot of force and I do like to do that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.440 
a lot of force and I do like to do that
do<00:00:24.080> that<00:00:24.140> but<00:00:24.529> I<00:00:25.130> think<00:00:25.189> a<00:00:25.520> balance<00:00:26.000> there

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
do that but I think a balance there

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.290 
do that but I think a balance there
needs<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:26.990> be<00:00:27.050> balance<00:00:27.290> in<00:00:27.710> yang<00:00:28.300> male/female

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
needs to be balance in yang male/female

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.599 
needs to be balance in yang male/female
masculine<00:00:29.840> feminine<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:30.920> can't<00:00:31.189> just<00:00:31.460> be

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
masculine feminine and you can't just be

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.710 
masculine feminine and you can't just be
all<00:00:31.820> yang<00:00:32.239> you<00:00:32.629> can't<00:00:32.870> be<00:00:32.989> all<00:00:33.230> power<00:00:34.129> and<00:00:34.720> what

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
all yang you can't be all power and what

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.090 
all yang you can't be all power and what
happens<00:00:36.110> oftentimes<00:00:36.620> is<00:00:37.750> there's<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:39.100> there's

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
happens oftentimes is there's a there's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.130 
happens oftentimes is there's a there's
that<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.400> distribution<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.960> the

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
that the distribution of that the

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.189 
that the distribution of that the
balance<00:00:42.559> is<00:00:42.710> off<00:00:42.920> with<00:00:43.699> with<00:00:44.030> our<00:00:44.199> existing

going on around you and I think all of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.360 
going on around you and I think all of
us<00:02:02.540> are<00:02:03.020> who<00:02:03.500> play<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.800> drums<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:04.250> this

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
us are who play the drums in this

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.719 
us are who play the drums in this
tradition<00:02:05.229> are<00:02:06.229> used<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.740> listening<00:02:07.220> to

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
tradition are used to listening to

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.759 
tradition are used to listening to
what's<00:02:07.970> going<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.420> around<00:02:08.599> us<00:02:09.049> and<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.709> think

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
what's going on around us and I think

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.140 
what's going on around us and I think
that's<00:02:10.099> one<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.369> reasons<00:02:10.610> why<00:02:10.729> drummers

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
that's one of the reasons why drummers

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.110 
that's one of the reasons why drummers
make<00:02:11.390> good<00:02:11.629> band<00:02:12.049> leaders<00:02:12.440> or

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
make good band leaders or

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.580 
make good band leaders or
could<00:02:13.269> potentially<00:02:13.870> make<00:02:13.989> good<00:02:14.200> families

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
could potentially make good families

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.270 
could potentially make good families
because<00:02:14.860> we're<00:02:15.010> always<00:02:15.159> used<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.610> hearing

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
