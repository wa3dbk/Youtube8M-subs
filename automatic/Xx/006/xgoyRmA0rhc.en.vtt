00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.000
 Good morning, we start today with the 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.559
 images of a video that shows 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.790
 good part of what happened today in the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.160
 Philadelphia International Airport 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.050
 when the Mexican team was ready 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.330
 to return to the city ​​of mexico 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.040
 what we see on the screen are the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.590
 images taken with a cell phone 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.380
 there we see christian martinoli being 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.780
 pushed by the one they describe in the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.030
 Video as the daughter of Miguel Herrera 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.920
 coach of the Mexican national team we see 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.930
 members of the coaching staff and to own 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.610
 miguel herrera changing next to luís 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.469
 Garcia another sportscaster from the 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.449
 Aztec TV chain 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.670
 where he was headed apparently 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.850
 involved his daughter to this commentator 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.980
 sporting that then claims to have been 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.500
 assaulted by the technical director of the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.480
 Mexican selection in a video too 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.679
 what are we going to see next this is 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.609
 the moment when the daughter of miguel 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.400
 herrera claims luís garcía cachete a 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.690
 we saw it there clearly and then it arrives 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.690
 Miguel Herrera with Luis García 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.219
 they have an exchange of words miguel 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.409
 Herrera asks her daughter to keep 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.729
 silence and apparently arranges part of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.829
 the equation we see some players 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.840
 members of the coaching staff trying to 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.610
 intervene there have an exchange 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.120
 words are trying to narrate because 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.740
 Sound 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.420
 and the video is not enough 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.680
 good to hear exactly what 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.900
 is what they say we are working on 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.300
 we received it some moments ago 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.340
 but that's why I try to tell you what 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.720
 happened there we see already after Luis 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.950
 García walking with Miguel Herrera 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.850
 embraced 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.570

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.830

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.810

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.940
 in the security line prior to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.430

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.410

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.230

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.890
