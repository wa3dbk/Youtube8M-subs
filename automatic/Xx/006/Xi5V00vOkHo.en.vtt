there was an old version a couple years
ago<00:00:11.389> which<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.570> have<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:14.400> i<00:00:14.429> might<00:00:14.670> do

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
ago which I do have so i might do

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.170 
ago which I do have so i might do
comparison<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.710> so<00:00:16.850> start<00:00:17.850> off<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.090> get

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
comparison on that so start off you get

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
comparison on that so start off you get
a<00:00:18.240> brick<00:00:18.480> separator<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.170> new<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.529> become<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
a brick separator the new one become a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.620 
a brick separator the new one become a
lot<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.400> bigger<00:00:21.330> sets<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:24.119> instruction

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
lot of bigger sets now to instruction

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
lot of bigger sets now to instruction
books<00:00:26.390> nothing<00:00:27.390> special<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:27.990> those<00:00:28.429> quick

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
books nothing special about those quick

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
set 10 226 ages 14 plus 883 pieces so as

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
all the pieces on the top then not too

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.869 
all the pieces on the top then not too
much<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> back<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.460> sopwith

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
much at the back so here is the sopwith

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.709 
much at the back so here is the sopwith
camel<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:50.910> nice<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.329> looks<00:00:51.480> really

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
camel it's very nice it looks really

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.340 
camel it's very nice it looks really
cool<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.840> I'd<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> build

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
cool I really like it I'd like to build

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.110 
cool I really like it I'd like to build
because<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.550> harder<00:00:56.820> than

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.349 

normal<00:01:00.120> sets<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.079> wasn't<00:01:01.730> too<00:01:02.730> difficult<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
normal sets it wasn't too difficult that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.410 
normal sets it wasn't too difficult that
you<00:01:03.480> couldn't<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:05.210> just<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you couldn't do it but it was just a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.380 
you couldn't do it but it was just a
little<00:01:06.659> bit<00:01:06.780> harder<00:01:07.020> than<00:01:07.049> normal<00:01:07.260> LEGO<00:01:07.590> sets

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
little bit harder than normal LEGO sets

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.219 
little bit harder than normal LEGO sets
but<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:11.540> these<00:01:12.540> were<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> flash<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
but one thing these were the flash that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
but one thing these were the flash that
move<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> back<00:01:15.710> then<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> later<00:01:17.070> step<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
move on the back then a later step that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.030 
move on the back then a later step that
makes<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.380> first<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> they're

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
makes like when you first do it they're

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.999 
makes like when you first do it they're
up<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.150> doesn't<00:01:21.420> look<00:01:21.509> right

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
up like this and it doesn't look right

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.660 
up like this and it doesn't look right
because<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.220> supposed<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.640> like

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
because we're not supposed to be like

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
because we're not supposed to be like
that<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> later<00:01:24.570> step<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> fixes<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that but then a later step it fixes it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280 
that but then a later step it fixes it
so<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.460> kind<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.729> confusing<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
so it's kind of confusing in the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.660 
so it's kind of confusing in the
instructions<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.490> should<00:01:29.640> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
instructions so I think they should have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
instructions so I think they should have
addressed<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.290> earlier<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:31.439> they

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
addressed that earlier because they

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.730 
addressed that earlier because they
could<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:31.829> done<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.780> would<00:01:34.650> have

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
could have done that and it would have

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
could have done that and it would have
caused<00:01:35.009> less<00:01:35.220> confusion<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.479> other<00:01:36.780> than

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
caused less confusion but other than

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.940 
caused less confusion but other than
that<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.650> liked<00:01:38.579> set<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.290> I'll<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.829> from

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that I liked set so I'll just go from

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
that I liked set so I'll just go from
the<00:01:41.100> front<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.360> there's<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> propeller<00:01:43.049> it's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the front so there's the propeller it's

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.950 
the front so there's the propeller it's
bins<00:01:43.710> nicely

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.590 

it's<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:50.860> while<00:01:51.820> back<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.270> forth<00:01:52.480> but

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
it's a little while back and forth but

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.560 
it's a little while back and forth but
that's<00:01:52.750> okay<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.770> guns<00:01:54.100> at<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.310> top<00:01:54.550> here<00:01:54.820> and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
that's okay the guns at the top here and

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.190 
that's okay the guns at the top here and
the<00:01:56.140> way<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.500> was<00:01:56.590> times<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.390> when<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.480> was

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
the way it was times and when this was

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.890 
the way it was times and when this was
used<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.430> shoot<00:02:00.910> all<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.210> propellers<00:02:01.600> weren't

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
used so shoot all the propellers weren't

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.150 
used so shoot all the propellers weren't
in<00:02:01.990> front<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.230> it<00:02:06.000> these<00:02:07.000> wheels<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.890> rubber

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
in front of it these wheels these rubber

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.920 
in front of it these wheels these rubber
bands<00:02:09.369> they're<00:02:09.730> popping<00:02:10.450> off<00:02:10.540> right<00:02:10.750> now<00:02:10.869> this

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
bands they're popping off right now this

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.320 
bands they're popping off right now this
is<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.200> first<00:02:11.470> time<00:02:11.590> it's<00:02:11.770> happened<00:02:12.330> they're

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
is the first time it's happened they're

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.020 
is the first time it's happened they're
little<00:02:13.570> hard<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.170> off<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:15.160> need<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:15.910> on

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
little hard to get off I need to get on

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.300 
little hard to get off I need to get on
but<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.230> too<00:02:17.470> bad<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.860> should<00:02:18.010> be<00:02:18.040> too

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
but it's not too bad it should be too

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.530 
but it's not too bad it should be too
hard<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.490> fix<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.970> it's<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.420> is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
hard to fix and it's for this is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.480 
hard to fix and it's for this is
probably<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.960> be<00:02:20.050> used<00:02:20.200> as<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> model<00:02:20.620> so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
probably can be used as a model so

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.770 
probably can be used as a model so
you're<00:02:21.610> probably<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:22.030> gonna<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.480> worry

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
you're probably not gonna have to worry

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.210 
you're probably not gonna have to worry
about<00:02:22.930> their<00:02:23.200> bands<00:02:23.530> popping<00:02:23.710> off<00:02:24.010> it's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
about their bands popping off it's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.070 
about their bands popping off it's
probably<00:02:24.490> only<00:02:24.610> if<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.910> push<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.870> side<00:02:26.050> to

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
probably only if you push it side to

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.390 
probably only if you push it side to
side<00:02:26.230> as<00:02:26.590> when<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.310> would<00:02:27.430> happen<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:30.310> they

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
side as when that would happen so they

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.650 
side as when that would happen so they
did<00:02:30.520> use<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> lot<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.940> string<00:02:31.240> in<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.480> set

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
did use a lot of string in this set

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.290 
did use a lot of string in this set
which<00:02:31.900> was<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.500> movie<00:02:32.740> flaps<00:02:33.180> which<00:02:34.180> is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
which was for the movie flaps which is

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.360 
which was for the movie flaps which is
nice<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:35.530> also<00:02:35.650> used<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.980> lot<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.190> dark

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
nice and they also used a lot of dark

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.370 
nice and they also used a lot of dark
green<00:02:36.640> which<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.570> completely<00:02:38.020> different<00:02:38.170> from

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
green which is completely different from

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.100 
green which is completely different from
the<00:02:38.560> old<00:02:38.590> old<00:02:39.550> one<00:02:39.790> where<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.270> have<00:02:40.420> Browns

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
the old old one where they have Browns

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.400 
the old old one where they have Browns
and<00:02:41.530> reds<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.950> stuff<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.950> here's<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.410> cockpit

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
and reds and stuff so here's a cockpit

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.390 
and reds and stuff so here's a cockpit
here<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.850> gold<00:02:49.680> gold<00:02:50.680> see<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.160> kind<00:02:51.280> of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
here as a gold gold see it's kind of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.220 
here as a gold gold see it's kind of
hard<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.640> see<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.780> then<00:02:53.350> there's<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:55.230> lever

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
hard to see and then there's the lever

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.040 
hard to see and then there's the lever
here<00:02:56.590> which<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.130> move<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.400> all<00:02:57.520> directions

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
here which can move in all directions

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.979 
here which can move in all directions
and<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.380> controls<00:02:59.850> flaps<00:03:00.850> on<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.270> wings<00:03:01.600> and

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
and it controls flaps on the wings and

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.930 
and it controls flaps on the wings and
in<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.860> back<00:03:03.040> which<00:03:03.310> I'll<00:03:03.430> show<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.790> a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
in the back which I'll show you in a

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.660 
in the back which I'll show you in a
second<00:03:04.300> control<00:03:05.230> panel<00:03:05.560> there<00:03:05.739> small<00:03:06.459> wind

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
second control panel there small wind

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.280 
second control panel there small wind
window<00:03:07.150> they're<00:03:08.459> not<00:03:09.459> sure<00:03:09.580> what<00:03:09.610> these<00:03:09.850> are

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
window they're not sure what these are

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.150 
window they're not sure what these are
so<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.500> know<00:03:11.590> what<00:03:11.680> those<00:03:11.800> are<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.040> can

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
so if you know what those are you can

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.090 
so if you know what those are you can
tell<00:03:12.310> me<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.550> comments<00:03:13.860> stickers<00:03:14.860> here

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
tell me in the comments stickers here

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.520 
tell me in the comments stickers here
they're<00:03:15.340> stickers<00:03:15.930> same<00:03:16.930> stickers<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.410> both

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
they're stickers same stickers on both

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.620 
they're stickers same stickers on both
sides<00:03:17.800> so<00:03:18.700> there's<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.120> one<00:03:19.270> on<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.450> top

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
sides so there's just one on the top

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.190 
sides so there's just one on the top
this<00:03:20.320> one<00:03:20.530> side<00:03:21.300> number<00:03:22.300> there<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.840> then<00:03:22.959> sets

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
this one side number there and then sets

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.800 
this one side number there and then sets
up<00:03:23.410> with<00:03:23.590> there<00:03:23.830> right<00:03:24.640> there

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
up with there right there

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.830 
up with there right there
this<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.530> pretty<00:03:27.190> much<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.569> then<00:03:28.690> these

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
this is pretty much this and then these

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.890 
this is pretty much this and then these
two<00:03:28.900> are<00:03:29.230> really<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.650> only<00:03:29.680> things<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.900> make

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
two are really the only things that make

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.229 
two are really the only things that make
it<00:03:32.050> asymmetrical<00:03:32.400> legasus<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.580> step<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:34.090> get

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
it asymmetrical legasus is a step to get

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.440 
it asymmetrical legasus is a step to get
on<00:03:35.849> these<00:03:36.849> strings<00:03:38.940> aren't<00:03:39.940> they<00:03:40.180> don't<00:03:40.300> do

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
on these strings aren't they don't do

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.940 
on these strings aren't they don't do
anything<00:03:40.660> better<00:03:40.930> stay<00:03:41.230> there<00:03:41.440> but<00:03:41.590> then<00:03:41.739> this

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
anything better stay there but then this

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.050 
anything better stay there but then this
D<00:03:42.310> string<00:03:42.670> here<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.050> looks<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.319> flap<00:03:45.060> in

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
D string here this one looks a flap in

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.530 
D string here this one looks a flap in
the<00:03:46.120> back<00:03:46.360> here<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.170> moves<00:03:47.709> back<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.099> forth

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the back here this moves back and forth

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.820 
the back here this moves back and forth
it's<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> test<00:03:50.050> of<00:03:50.230> string<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.680> have<00:03:50.769> to

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
it's not a test of string so you have to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.020 
it's not a test of string so you have to
do<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.069> manually<00:03:53.250> then<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.430> bottom<00:03:54.640> here

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
do that manually then the bottom here

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.690 
do that manually then the bottom here
there's<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.780> great<00:03:55.989> piece<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.590> keep<00:03:57.580> it

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
there's that great piece just to keep it

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.890 
there's that great piece just to keep it
from<00:03:57.819> going<00:03:58.000> down<00:03:58.239> too<00:03:58.420> much<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.780> could

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
from going down too much so you could

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.870 
from going down too much so you could
still<00:03:59.080> roll<00:03:59.290> it<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.510> then<00:04:01.690> for<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:01.989> flaps<00:04:02.880> when

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
still roll it so then for the flaps when

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.680 
still roll it so then for the flaps when
you<00:04:03.970> move<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.360> stick<00:04:04.630> side<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.080> side<00:04:06.690> you

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
you move the stick side to side you

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.650 
you move the stick side to side you
could<00:04:07.840> see<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.799> moves<00:04:08.980> up<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.280> down<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.700> then

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
could see it moves up and down and then

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.440 
could see it moves up and down and then
when<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.200> move<00:04:11.319> it<00:04:11.440> up<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.709> back<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:13.150> can<00:04:13.299> see

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
when you move it up and back you can see

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.080 
when you move it up and back you can see
these<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.290> back<00:04:14.500> move<00:04:14.739> up<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:14.980> down

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
these in the back move up and down

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.449 
these in the back move up and down
that's<00:04:16.090> really<00:04:16.329> cool<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.389> now<00:04:19.510> I'm<00:04:19.690> going<00:04:19.959> to

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that's really cool so now I'm going to

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.280 
that's really cool so now I'm going to
grab<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.790> old<00:04:22.000> sopwith<00:04:22.450> camel<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:23.139> show

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.460 
grab the old sopwith camel so I can show
you<00:04:23.380> them<00:04:23.530> side-by-side<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:25.270> right<00:04:25.389> back<00:04:25.510> so

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
here's the new and old sopwith camel as

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.130 
here's the new and old sopwith camel as
you<00:04:29.950> can<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.370> old<00:04:30.550> one<00:04:30.789> is<00:04:31.660> completely

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
you can see the old one is completely

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.120 
you can see the old one is completely
different<00:04:32.590> color<00:04:32.800> scheme<00:04:34.260> uses<00:04:35.260> red<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.979> the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
different color scheme uses red in the

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.719 
different color scheme uses red in the
front<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.660> brown<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.960> wings<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.610> that's

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
front and brown and the wings so that's

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.060 
front and brown and the wings so that's
completely<00:04:40.090> different<00:04:40.710> it's<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.770> little<00:04:41.919> dusty

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
completely different it's a little dusty

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.070 
completely different it's a little dusty
so<00:04:42.430> sorry<00:04:42.640> about<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:42.900> actually<00:04:43.900> it's<00:04:43.990> really

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
so sorry about that actually it's really

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.760 
so sorry about that actually it's really
dusty<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.330> one<00:04:46.479> still<00:04:46.690> rolls<00:04:46.930> cells

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
dusty so this one still rolls cells

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.900 
dusty so this one still rolls cells
wheels<00:04:49.380> propeller<00:04:50.380> doesn't<00:04:51.250> spin<00:04:51.430> as<00:04:51.640> well

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
wheels propeller doesn't spin as well

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.270 
wheels propeller doesn't spin as well
but<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.390> could<00:04:52.600> probably<00:04:52.720> be<00:04:53.100> loosened<00:04:54.100> up<00:04:54.190> a

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
but that could probably be loosened up a

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.430 
but that could probably be loosened up a
little<00:04:54.340> bit<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.990> can<00:04:56.080> see<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.320> propellers

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
little bit you can see the propellers

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.040 
little bit you can see the propellers
different<00:04:57.070> you're<00:04:57.910> just<00:04:58.060> one<00:04:58.300> piece<00:04:58.510> well<00:04:58.930> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
different you're just one piece well the

different you're just one piece well the
new<00:04:59.169> one<00:04:59.580> the<00:05:00.580> pieces<00:05:00.910> put<00:05:01.030> together<00:05:03.000> jill<00:05:04.000> has

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
new one the pieces put together jill has

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.940 
new one the pieces put together jill has
the<00:05:04.300> guns<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.870> like<00:05:05.139> these<00:05:05.289> guns<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.650> little<00:05:05.830> bit

the guns I like these guns a little bit

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.690 
the guns I like these guns a little bit
better<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.740> still<00:05:08.919> has<00:05:09.100> all<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.370> string

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
better and it still has all the string

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.180 
better and it still has all the string
string<00:05:10.539> work<00:05:10.720> there<00:05:11.020> doesn't<00:05:11.800> actually<00:05:11.889> move

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
string work there doesn't actually move

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.529 
string work there doesn't actually move
any<00:05:12.370> flaps<00:05:12.669> though<00:05:14.039> now<00:05:15.039> on<00:05:15.160> top<00:05:15.450> stickers<00:05:16.450> are

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
peeling off a little bit because it's

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.950 
peeling off a little bit because it's
just<00:05:17.800> old<00:05:18.240> that's<00:05:19.240> what<00:05:19.360> happens<00:05:19.660> I<00:05:19.780> don't

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
just old that's what happens I don't

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.450 
just old that's what happens I don't
know<00:05:20.050> if<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.200> newer<00:05:20.410> LEGO<00:05:20.620> sets<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.160> stickers

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
know if the newer LEGO sets the stickers

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.760 
know if the newer LEGO sets the stickers
will<00:05:21.610> peel<00:05:21.789> or<00:05:21.910> not<00:05:22.229> because<00:05:23.229> it<00:05:23.410> hasn't<00:05:23.560> been

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
will peel or not because it hasn't been

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.490 
will peel or not because it hasn't been
too<00:05:23.950> long<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.570> don't<00:05:25.570> put<00:05:25.750> as<00:05:25.870> many<00:05:25.960> stickers<00:05:26.350> on

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
too long I don't put as many stickers on

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.090 
too long I don't put as many stickers on
anymore<00:05:28.380> but

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
anymore but

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.140 
anymore but
these<00:05:32.100> are<00:05:32.250> starting<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.580> peel<00:05:32.760> off<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:32.940> little

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
these are starting to peel off a little

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.900 
these are starting to peel off a little
bit<00:05:33.300> as<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:33.990> can<00:05:34.110> see<00:05:34.350> they<00:05:35.280> had<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:35.520> put<00:05:35.639> two

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
bit as you can see they had to put two

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.010 
bit as you can see they had to put two
different<00:05:36.210> stickers<00:05:36.389> because<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.810> change

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
different stickers because the change

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.690 
different stickers because the change
the<00:05:37.110> level<00:05:37.410> but<00:05:38.040> here<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.310> sticker<00:05:38.520> is

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
the level but here the sticker is

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.879 
the level but here the sticker is
smaller<00:05:39.030> so<00:05:39.360> they<00:05:39.570> only<00:05:39.690> need<00:05:39.930> one<00:05:40.230> it's<00:05:40.740> not<00:05:40.860> a

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
smaller so they only need one it's not a

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.860 
smaller so they only need one it's not a
new<00:05:41.070> piece<00:05:41.280> there<00:05:42.120> are<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.210> lot<00:05:42.330> more<00:05:42.360> stickers

on this local Persian too and if this

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.760 
on this local Persian too and if this
was<00:05:47.160> one<00:05:47.490> Lego<00:05:47.730> would<00:05:48.450> put<00:05:48.660> stickers<00:05:49.050> over<00:05:49.350> top

they're still lover and a seat stuff but
it<00:06:13.860> doesn't<00:06:14.130> do<00:06:14.250> anything<00:06:14.640> this<00:06:15.419> was<00:06:15.600> strictly

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
it doesn't do anything this was strictly

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:25.909 
it doesn't do anything this was strictly
a<00:06:16.110> model<00:06:23.060> but<00:06:24.060> they<00:06:24.240> are<00:06:24.330> both<00:06:24.600> very<00:06:24.840> nice<00:06:25.110> they

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
a model but they are both very nice they

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.260 
a model but they are both very nice they
both<00:06:26.100> have<00:06:26.310> nice<00:06:26.490> pieces<00:06:28.130> but<00:06:29.130> obviously<00:06:30.090> this

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
both have nice pieces but obviously this

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.890 
both have nice pieces but obviously this
one<00:06:30.479> you<00:06:31.080> can<00:06:31.260> play<00:06:31.440> with<00:06:31.620> a<00:06:31.680> little<00:06:32.010> bit<00:06:32.900> but

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
one you can play with a little bit but

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.780 
one you can play with a little bit but
they're<00:06:34.229> both<00:06:34.380> pretty<00:06:35.010> much<00:06:35.310> for<00:06:35.520> model

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
they're both pretty much for model

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.960 
they're both pretty much for model
purposes<00:06:36.750> I<00:06:36.960> don't<00:06:37.800> remember<00:06:37.950> how<00:06:38.940> many

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
purposes I don't remember how many

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.670 
purposes I don't remember how many
pieces<00:06:39.300> with<00:06:39.630> old<00:06:39.840> one<00:06:39.990> had<00:06:40.169> or<00:06:40.320> how<00:06:40.500> much<00:06:40.620> it

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
pieces with old one had or how much it

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.450 
pieces with old one had or how much it
cost<00:06:41.010> so<00:06:41.160> I<00:06:41.280> can't<00:06:41.550> compare<00:06:41.850> it<00:06:41.940> that<00:06:42.090> way<00:06:43.460> but

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
cost so I can't compare it that way but

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.650 
cost so I can't compare it that way but
they're<00:06:44.610> both<00:06:44.729> nice<00:06:44.970> models<00:06:45.479> but<00:06:47.479> if<00:06:48.479> you'd

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
they're both nice models but if you'd

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.640 
they're both nice models but if you'd
like<00:06:48.780> planes<00:06:49.050> i<00:06:49.200> definitely<00:06:49.560> recommend

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
like planes i definitely recommend

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.250 
like planes i definitely recommend
getting<00:06:50.010> this<00:06:50.220> new<00:06:50.400> one<00:06:50.550> it<00:06:50.760> would<00:06:51.260> for

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
getting this new one it would for

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.650 
getting this new one it would for
younger<00:06:52.440> kids<00:06:52.560> i<00:06:52.919> would<00:06:53.130> pay<00:06:54.030> attention<00:06:54.510> to

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
younger kids i would pay attention to

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.560 
younger kids i would pay attention to
the<00:06:54.810> age<00:06:56.090> they<00:06:57.090> could<00:06:57.300> get<00:06:57.419> a<00:06:57.450> little

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
the age they could get a little

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.770 
the age they could get a little
frustrated<00:06:57.810> with<00:06:58.200> a<00:06:58.229> string<00:06:59.360> but<00:07:00.360> is<00:07:00.450> not<00:07:00.600> too

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
frustrated with a string but is not too

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.060 
frustrated with a string but is not too
bad<00:07:00.960> they'll<00:07:01.140> definitely<00:07:01.320> be<00:07:01.560> able<00:07:01.710> to<00:07:01.890> build

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
bad they'll definitely be able to build

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.150 
bad they'll definitely be able to build
it<00:07:02.250> i<00:07:02.340> would<00:07:02.490> think<00:07:02.930> but<00:07:03.950> depending<00:07:04.950> on<00:07:05.070> their

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
it i would think but depending on their

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.930 
it i would think but depending on their
patients<00:07:05.610> to<00:07:06.500> some<00:07:07.500> things<00:07:07.680> pop<00:07:08.580> off<00:07:08.789> like

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
patients to some things pop off like

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.550 
patients to some things pop off like
these<00:07:09.180> rubber<00:07:09.419> bands<00:07:09.630> might<00:07:09.870> pop<00:07:10.080> off<00:07:10.229> in<00:07:10.470> the

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
these rubber bands might pop off in the

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.960 
these rubber bands might pop off in the
wheels<00:07:10.740> and<00:07:11.600> they<00:07:12.600> might<00:07:12.780> get<00:07:13.370> confused<00:07:14.370> with

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
wheels and they might get confused with

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.960 
wheels and they might get confused with
the<00:07:15.440> string<00:07:16.440> in<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:16.830> back<00:07:17.010> here<00:07:17.280> when<00:07:17.460> the<00:07:17.640> or

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
the string in the back here when the or

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.320 
the string in the back here when the or
over<00:07:18.660> here<00:07:18.900> when<00:07:19.050> the<00:07:19.200> flaps<00:07:20.190> are<00:07:20.460> not<00:07:21.150> in<00:07:21.240> the

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
over here when the flaps are not in the

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.000 
over here when the flaps are not in the
right<00:07:21.450> position<00:07:21.900> at<00:07:21.990> first<00:07:22.169> but<00:07:22.410> they<00:07:22.590> do<00:07:22.650> fix

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010 
right position at first but they do fix

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.420 
right position at first but they do fix
that<00:07:24.860> so<00:07:25.860> i<00:07:25.890> would<00:07:26.039> definitely<00:07:26.070> recommend
