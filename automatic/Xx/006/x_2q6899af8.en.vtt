too they often have to walk for one or

too they often have to walk for one or
two<00:00:59.240> hours<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:03.320> usually<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.920> women<00:01:04.220> and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
two hours and it's usually the women and

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.480 
two hours and it's usually the women and
children<00:01:04.460> who<00:01:05.000> fetch<00:01:05.479> water<00:01:06.070> they<00:01:07.070> spend<00:01:07.369> the

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.340 

obviously<00:01:13.759> it's<00:01:14.240> not<00:01:14.450> very<00:01:14.689> beneficial<00:01:14.929> for

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
obviously it's not very beneficial for

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.990 
obviously it's not very beneficial for
the<00:01:15.530> development<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.219> the<00:01:16.369> country<00:01:16.789> and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
the development of the country and

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.260 
the development of the country and
society<00:01:17.869> if<00:01:18.380> women<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.100> children<00:01:19.759> especially

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
society if women and children especially

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.719 
society if women and children especially
young<00:01:20.630> girls<00:01:21.049> have<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:21.890> spend<00:01:22.159> most<00:01:22.369> of<00:01:22.579> their

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
young girls have to spend most of their

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.239 
young girls have to spend most of their
time<00:01:22.789> fetching<00:01:23.539> water<00:01:23.649> instead<00:01:24.649> of<00:01:24.710> attending

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
time fetching water instead of attending

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.870 
time fetching water instead of attending
school<00:01:26.469> so<00:01:27.469> it's<00:01:27.649> always<00:01:27.859> a<00:01:27.979> major<00:01:28.280> event<00:01:28.520> for

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
school so it's always a major event for

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.489 
school so it's always a major event for
the<00:01:28.969> population<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.810> village<00:01:29.840> when<00:01:30.380> they
