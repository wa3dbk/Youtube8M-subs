00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the way I do it because I don't want to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.240 
the way I do it because I don't want to
have<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.770> put<00:02:09.509> nail<00:02:10.509> polish<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.470> card<00:02:11.800> or<00:02:12.190> a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
have to put nail polish on the card or a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.960 
have to put nail polish on the card or a
piece<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.000> paper<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.440> I'm<00:02:15.040> just<00:02:15.340> gonna<00:02:16.019> take<00:02:17.019> my

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
piece of paper so I'm just gonna take my

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.900 
piece of paper so I'm just gonna take my
toothpick<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.300> put<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> long<00:02:19.780> side<00:02:19.810> um

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
toothpick I just put on the long side um

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.140 
toothpick I just put on the long side um
I'm<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.870> start<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.350> draw<00:02:24.150> horizontal

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
I'm going to start to draw horizontal

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.640 
I'm going to start to draw horizontal
lines<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:28.050> probably<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.470> worst

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
lines and this is probably the worst

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.850 
lines and this is probably the worst
part<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.459> this<00:02:30.670> nail<00:02:31.660> design<00:02:32.080> because<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
part of this nail design because it

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.750 
part of this nail design because it
takes<00:02:33.250> patience<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.180> time<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.650> I'm<00:02:35.860> just

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
takes patience and time but I'm just

00:02:36.760 --> 00:03:17.420 
takes patience and time but I'm just
like<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.420> i'm<00:02:37.959> going<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.470> make<00:02:39.840> lines

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.580 

this<00:03:18.030> would<00:03:18.299> be<00:03:18.480> easier<00:03:18.870> with<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.109> striper

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
this would be easier with the striper

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.280 
this would be easier with the striper
tool<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.400> don't<00:03:20.640> have<00:03:20.849> one<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.420> color<00:03:21.780> so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
tool but I don't have one this color so

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.000 
tool but I don't have one this color so
this<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:23.359> what<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.780> do<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:25.950> don't

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
this is what I have to do but I don't

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:54.520 
this is what I have to do but I don't

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
last time and this is why I'm going to

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.159 
last time and this is why I'm going to
use<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.550> time<00:04:26.790> just<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> other<00:04:27.270> side<00:04:27.540> I'm

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
use this time just the other side I'm

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.040 
use this time just the other side I'm
going<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.590> smash<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.220> tip<00:04:29.550> down<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:30.180> you

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
going to smash this tip down to you

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.780 
going to smash this tip down to you
don't<00:04:31.229> have<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.590> smash<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.010> down<00:04:32.040> but<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.460> just

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
don't have to smash it down but I just

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.820 
don't have to smash it down but I just
like<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.330> because<00:04:33.750> if<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.200> use<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.380> point

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
like to because if you use the point

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.560 
like to because if you use the point
it's<00:04:35.130> harder<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.490> get<00:04:35.729> more<00:04:35.910> polish<00:04:36.360> on<00:04:36.540> your

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
it's harder to get more polish on your

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.760 
it's harder to get more polish on your
nail<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.190> I'm<00:04:38.370> going<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.880> take<00:04:39.210> my<00:04:40.139> black<00:04:40.440> nail

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
draw the anchors start by drawing a

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.300 
draw the anchors start by drawing a
straight<00:04:53.639> line<00:04:54.120> on<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.660> center<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.380> your<00:04:55.800> nail

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
curvy part right here so that way when I

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.460 
curvy part right here so that way when I
go<00:05:05.490> like<00:05:06.919> like<00:05:07.919> this<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:09.600> anchors<00:05:09.930> are<00:05:10.080> facing

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
go like like this the anchors are facing

go like like this the anchors are facing
toward<00:05:10.770> me<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:15.450> just<00:05:16.070> start<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.280> draw<00:05:17.550> one
