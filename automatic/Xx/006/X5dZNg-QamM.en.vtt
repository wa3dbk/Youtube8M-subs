00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.620
 build a house not matter 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.530
 how 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.020
 that is to say for me build a 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.210
 house was to value dubois which 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.170
 was in the east who were on the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
 timber from the farm 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.989
 and then valued also others 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.090
 local resources and in particular the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.760
 straw that I have grown for the occasion 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.080
 and start a bibliographic work 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.330
 from the years 2005 when I 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.910
 felt that my project was ready that 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.190
 I had done enough synthesis 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 techniques I had encountered 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 loads is tied up a project that I have 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 submitted an architect 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.440
 we are always on the strategy of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.269
 compromise between the ecological dimension 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.930
 the economic dimension 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.909
 the thermal the technical end here is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.940
 is still in the compromise it's from 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.130
 to make a quotation mark the house of the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.229
 common sense comes from polystyrene because 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
 it was cheaper than the pestle chambering 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.700
 favorite massom use that and I under 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.799
 treat this part there it is for 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.980
 soil insulation for others 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.970
 materials it's straw wood and 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.360
 mortar 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.430
 which is composed of sand three volumes 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.700
 sand four volumes of catfish 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.640
 voice so we get the aid product back 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.320
 wake of the pieces of wood and a volume 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.930
 lime and a volume of cement 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.360
 so the technique used the technique 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.810
 grebe is a double bone of 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.260
 carrier wood and between the amounts of 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.390
 this frame that are 10 4 good glide 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.370
 straw boots when we will have the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.200
 bale of straw we put nails here 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.039
 to hold the mortar and go 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.000
 casket this part there and sunk a 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.940
 mortar so this mortar show sand cyr 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.099
 and sand that goes for sale and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.129
 the whole frame 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.840
 it is a house that breathes I followed 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.450
 training with the association 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.690
 approaching straw which is in orleans and 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.310
 who organizes training courses at 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.010
 self-builders who start their 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.170
 project I made contact with 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.750
 a young carpenter who escorts 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.090
 of projects he comes to your house and he 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.400
 supports the organization of your 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.769
 project as we are sure of the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.049
 participatory construction it forms the 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.870
 people the volunteer helpers who are coming 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.709
 help you on your job site 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.599
 to be very patient 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.310
 what i would like because ben 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.340
 here I always dream of new 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.500
 projects is to capitalize 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.319
 this experience that I had I would have 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.840
 well be able to design a model of 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.250
 house in the spirit of the house to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.049
 100000 euros but to make it less than 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.810
 one hundred thousand euros to make to 50000 euros 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.250
 to montaud construction because at 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.560
 beginning of the century there is an engineer 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.319
 who's called Mr. Feuillette who has 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.079
 montargis had already designed this type of 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.859
 house at the end of the war but we 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.859
 did not have to believe it 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.420
 Oh 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.420
 Oh
