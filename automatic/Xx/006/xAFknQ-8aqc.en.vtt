00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay in this video I'm gonna show you I

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.220 
okay in this video I'm gonna show you I
deal<00:00:03.090> with<00:00:03.149> power<00:00:03.629> seats<00:00:04.020> here<00:00:05.930> if<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.049> have<00:00:07.170> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
deal with power seats here if you have a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.750 
deal with power seats here if you have a
manual<00:00:07.470> see<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:07.919> pretty<00:00:08.160> much<00:00:08.250> easy<00:00:08.490> you

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
manual see it's pretty much easy you

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.459 
manual see it's pretty much easy you
slide<00:00:09.030> seat<00:00:09.389> back<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.599> forth<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.230> get<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
slide seat back and forth to get the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.959 
slide seat back and forth to get the
bolts<00:00:10.710> out<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:10.920> he's<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.429> got<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> battery<00:00:11.880> here

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
bolts out and he's I got a battery here

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.839 
bolts out and he's I got a battery here
to<00:00:12.090> jumper<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.540> I've<00:00:13.080> already<00:00:13.610> found<00:00:14.610> which

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
to jumper it I've already found which

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.220 
to jumper it I've already found which
wires<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.269> got<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> seat<00:00:15.839> pulled<00:00:16.139> them

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
wires actually got a seat pulled them

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.529 
wires actually got a seat pulled them
out<00:00:16.410> I've<00:00:17.279> also<00:00:17.400> pulled<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> two<00:00:18.150> bolts<00:00:18.420> out

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
out I've also pulled the two bolts out

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.870 
out I've also pulled the two bolts out
the<00:00:18.660> front<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.220> I'm<00:00:20.279> gonna<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the front here now what I'm gonna do is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.410 
the front here now what I'm gonna do is
the<00:00:21.619> roll<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> seats<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> forward<00:00:23.460> now<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the roll the seats the forward now I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.599 
the roll the seats the forward now I
guess<00:00:25.050> I've<00:00:25.199> never<00:00:25.410> done<00:00:25.680> these<00:00:25.769> older<00:00:26.279> power

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
guess I've never done these older power

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.189 
guess I've never done these older power
seats<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.390> used<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> old

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
seats because I used to be in the old

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.980 
seats because I used to be in the old
days<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.429> newer<00:00:29.670> ones<00:00:29.990> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
days on there or on the newer ones you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.100 
days on there or on the newer ones you
just<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:32.149> you<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.180> eat<00:00:33.450> there's<00:00:33.780> separate

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
just have you know eat there's separate

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.670 
just have you know eat there's separate
motors<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.510> two<00:00:36.510> wires<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> each<00:00:37.350> motor

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
motors and two wires to go to each motor

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.810 
motors and two wires to go to each motor
well<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.690> when<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> found<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.260> got<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
well in this one when I found you got a

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.049 
well in this one when I found you got a
black<00:00:41.820> ground<00:00:42.559> white<00:00:43.559> positive<00:00:44.550> whatever<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
black ground white positive whatever it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
black ground white positive whatever it
works<00:00:45.270> both<00:00:45.510> ways<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.160> smaller

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
works both ways and then these smaller

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.250 
works both ways and then these smaller
leads<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:49.579> relays<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.879> green<00:00:51.149> green

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
leads here are relays to green green

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.450 
leads here are relays to green green
blue<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.289> brown<00:00:52.770> wire<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.750> like<00:00:54.750> relays<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
blue and brown wire or like relays so so

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.389 
blue and brown wire or like relays so so
I<00:00:56.489> heard<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.030> hooked<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> black<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
I heard that I hooked that black and

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.270 
I heard that I hooked that black and
white<00:00:59.399> wire<00:00:59.789> hooked<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.890> how<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> doing<00:01:02.160> here

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
white wire hooked up how you doing here

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
white wire hooked up how you doing here
the<00:01:02.370> motor<00:01:02.520> run<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:04.500> I'll<00:01:04.619> run<00:01:04.769> forward<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the motor run and I'll run forward and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.500 
the motor run and I'll run forward and
backwards<00:01:05.580> depending<00:01:05.790> which<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.360> got

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
backwards depending which way you got

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
backwards depending which way you got
gonna<00:01:07.170> run<00:01:07.350> forward<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:07.799> backwards<00:01:08.130> depend

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
gonna run forward or backwards depend

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
gonna run forward or backwards depend
which<00:01:08.549> way<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.000> wires<00:01:09.270> hooked<00:01:10.260> up

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
which way you got these wires hooked up

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.420 
which way you got these wires hooked up
so<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.110> I've<00:01:13.500> already<00:01:13.619> forgot<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.220> course

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so and and I've already forgot of course

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
so and and I've already forgot of course
I'd<00:01:15.240> say<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.659> start<00:01:15.869> started<00:01:16.140> mess<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I'd say we start started mess with this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.359 
I'd say we start started mess with this
which<00:01:17.280> wire<00:01:18.170> relay<00:01:19.170> wire<00:01:19.380> does<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:19.979> we'll

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
which wire relay wire does what we'll

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.330 
which wire relay wire does what we'll
figure<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.040> try<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
figure it out here and try and get the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.459 
figure it out here and try and get the
seat<00:01:23.549> defective<00:01:26.810> we<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> view<00:01:28.200> that

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
seat defective we get a view that

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.319 
seat defective we get a view that
I<00:01:30.179> think<00:01:31.179> it<00:01:31.299> was<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> blue<00:01:31.630> bar<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:34.210> go

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
I think it was the blue bar so just go

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.120 
I think it was the blue bar so just go
this<00:01:34.479> way<00:01:34.719> tap<00:01:35.319> the<00:01:35.469> blue<00:01:35.619> wire<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:35.979> white

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
this way tap the blue wire and the white

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.520 
this way tap the blue wire and the white
wire<00:01:36.310> together<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:36.990> put<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.109> black<00:01:38.259> are<00:01:38.500> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
wire together and put the black are the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.200 
wire together and put the black are the
positive<00:01:39.219> and<00:01:39.340> see<00:01:39.609> what<00:01:39.729> happens

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
positive and see what happens

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.919 
positive and see what happens
nope<00:01:41.700> yeah<00:01:42.700> that's<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.179> wrong<00:01:43.359> direction<00:01:43.539> or

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
nope yeah that's the wrong direction or

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:51.510 
nope yeah that's the wrong direction or
the<00:01:44.020> wrong<00:01:44.170> wire<00:01:44.409> will<00:01:44.649> traverse<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:50.520> no

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
the wrong wire will traverse it no

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.539 
the wrong wire will traverse it no
contact<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.750> reverse<00:01:53.109> dead<00:01:54.009> up<00:01:54.130> there<00:01:54.159> and

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
contact this reverse dead up there and

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:09.319 
contact this reverse dead up there and
reverse<00:01:54.789> it<00:02:00.299> yep<00:02:01.329> oh<00:02:01.569> wait<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:04.619> try<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.649> be<00:02:05.890> in

reverse<00:02:10.329> it<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.660> way<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:21.660> knew<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.720> was<00:02:22.959> right

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
reverse it this way I knew I was right

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.940 
reverse it this way I knew I was right
the<00:02:23.260> first<00:02:23.440> time

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950

now we're lucky we can get to these

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.220 
now we're lucky we can get to these
bolts<00:02:56.020> in<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.170> back<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.630> when<00:02:58.900> they<00:02:58.990> didn't
