00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
what happens when you put four Giants to

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:25.940 
what happens when you put four Giants to
the<00:00:08.550> test<00:00:13.460> you<00:00:14.460> get<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.910> giantess

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.800 

the<00:00:26.950> last<00:00:27.160> time<00:00:27.430> I<00:00:27.610> needed<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.240> new<00:00:28.420> printer<00:00:28.780> I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
the last time I needed a new printer I

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.630 
the last time I needed a new printer I
sensibly<00:00:29.530> did<00:00:29.830> a<00:00:29.980> little<00:00:30.190> research<00:00:30.400> before

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
sensibly did a little research before

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.510 
sensibly did a little research before
parting<00:00:31.420> with<00:00:31.540> my<00:00:31.720> cash<00:00:31.960> but<00:00:32.680> what<00:00:33.130> I<00:00:33.310> read

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
parting with my cash but what I read

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.510 
parting with my cash but what I read
wasn't<00:00:34.090> useful<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.630> how<00:00:34.750> I<00:00:34.960> print<00:00:35.260> at<00:00:35.410> home<00:00:35.520> so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
wasn't useful to how I print at home so

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.030 
wasn't useful to how I print at home so
I<00:00:36.730> have<00:00:37.000> decided<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.570> do<00:00:37.809> my<00:00:37.840> own<00:00:37.989> thero<00:00:38.650> test

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
I have decided to do my own thero test

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.490 
I have decided to do my own thero test
using<00:00:39.760> printers<00:00:40.210> from<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.600> full<00:00:40.870> big<00:00:41.170> names

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
using printers from the full big names

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.010 
using printers from the full big names
picked<00:00:42.220> for<00:00:42.430> about<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.820> same<00:00:42.850> price<00:00:43.059> so<00:00:43.720> all's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
picked for about the same price so all's

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.880 
picked for about the same price so all's
fair<00:00:44.470> admittedly<00:00:45.430> this<00:00:45.910> won't<00:00:46.180> be<00:00:46.330> as<00:00:46.420> dynamic

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
fair admittedly this won't be as dynamic

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.009 
fair admittedly this won't be as dynamic
dramatic<00:00:47.890> or<00:00:48.070> as<00:00:48.460> noisy<00:00:49.000> as<00:00:49.030> my<00:00:49.330> usual<00:00:49.750> tile

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
dramatic or as noisy as my usual tile

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.470 
dramatic or as noisy as my usual tile
screeching<00:00:50.170> antics<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.940> could<00:00:52.239> take<00:00:52.420> a

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
screeching antics and it could take a

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.020 
screeching antics and it could take a
while<00:00:52.830> so<00:00:53.830> in<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.100> meantime<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:54.610> think<00:00:54.760> we'll

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
while so in the meantime I think we'll

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:18.050 
while so in the meantime I think we'll
go<00:00:55.150> and<00:00:55.269> have<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.720> spot<00:00:56.379> at<00:00:56.530> fun

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.669 

back<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.240> business<00:01:19.450> for<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.869> minute<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.320> the

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
way I use a printer goes something like

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.410 
way I use a printer goes something like
this<00:01:22.859> print<00:01:23.859> off<00:01:24.009> some<00:01:24.070> grown-up<00:01:24.729> PowerPoint

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
testing a car I'm looking at the whole

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.249 
testing a car I'm looking at the whole
package<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.520> these<00:01:48.700> printers<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.450> color

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
package of these printers the color

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:58.039 
package of these printers the color
design<00:01:51.130> features<00:01:52.000> control<00:01:52.599> and<00:01:52.950> reliability

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.630 

testing<00:01:59.049> them<00:01:59.229> until<00:01:59.560> they<00:01:59.679> can<00:01:59.799> take<00:02:00.009> room<00:02:00.459> or

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
testing them until they can take room or

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.399 
testing them until they can take room or
the<00:02:02.789> test<00:02:03.789> proved<00:02:04.090> too<00:02:04.450> much<00:02:04.479> for<00:02:04.720> some<00:02:04.959> of<00:02:05.319> the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
the test proved too much for some of the

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.780 
the test proved too much for some of the
printers<00:02:10.079> but<00:02:11.079> for<00:02:11.290> me<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.799> most<00:02:11.920> important

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
printers but for me the most important

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.539 
printers but for me the most important
test<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.150> all<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.720> how<00:02:14.290> many<00:02:14.349> pages<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.190> photos

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
test of all is how many pages and photos

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.220 
test of all is how many pages and photos
you<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.819> get<00:02:16.000> before<00:02:16.299> you<00:02:16.780> change<00:02:17.049> the

you can get before you change the
