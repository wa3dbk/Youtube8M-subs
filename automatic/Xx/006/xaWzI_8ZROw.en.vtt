the UMP from water warfare two was

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.600 
the UMP from water warfare two was
better<00:01:28.520> than<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.000> UMP<00:01:29.450> for<00:01:29.720> modern<00:01:29.990> warfare<00:01:30.200> 3

jump into the official comparison and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.559 
jump into the official comparison and
see<00:03:48.409> which<00:03:48.590> one<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.799> these<00:03:48.950> two<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.190> better

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
see which one of these two is better

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.759 
see which one of these two is better

we'll<00:04:00.709> see<00:04:00.950> if<00:04:01.159> you<00:04:01.610> guys<00:04:01.730> get<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.030> right<00:04:02.239> by

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
we'll see if you guys get it right by

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.390 
we'll see if you guys get it right by
the<00:04:02.450> end<00:04:02.629> of<00:04:02.689> this<00:04:02.780> comparison<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.310> was

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
the end of this comparison and it was

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.280 
the end of this comparison and it was
let's<00:04:04.640> jump<00:04:04.819> into<00:04:04.939> some<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.269> these<00:04:05.390> stats<00:04:06.080> for

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
let's jump into some of these stats for

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.970 
let's jump into some of these stats for
you<00:04:06.409> guys<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:07.640> recoil<00:04:08.180> on<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.780> umps<00:04:09.409> as<00:04:09.739> we

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
you guys the recoil on the umps as we

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.720 
you guys the recoil on the umps as we
see<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.430> low<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.420> low<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.200> medium<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:13.610> this

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
see is low and low to medium so this

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.429 
see is low and low to medium so this
just<00:04:13.849> basically<00:04:14.269> means<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:14.659> the<00:04:14.810> UMP<00:04:15.230> for

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
just basically means that the UMP for

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.710 
just basically means that the UMP for
modern<00:04:15.769> warfare<00:04:15.950> 2<00:04:16.250> had<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.519> lower<00:04:16.789> recoil<00:04:17.209> than

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
modern warfare 2 had a lower recoil than

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.520 
modern warfare 2 had a lower recoil than
we<00:04:18.169> saw<00:04:18.409> in<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.739> modern<00:04:19.310> warfare<00:04:19.459> 3<00:04:19.609> version

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
we saw in the modern warfare 3 version

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.260 
we saw in the modern warfare 3 version
now<00:04:21.530> this<00:04:21.709> kind<00:04:21.919> of<00:04:21.979> made<00:04:22.130> some<00:04:22.340> people<00:04:22.729> stay

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
now this kind of made some people stay

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.810 
now this kind of made some people stay
away<00:04:23.539> from<00:04:23.599> longer<00:04:24.260> range<00:04:24.500> gunfights<00:04:25.159> because

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
away from longer range gunfights because

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.100 
away from longer range gunfights because
they<00:04:25.970> didn't<00:04:26.270> know<00:04:26.300> if<00:04:26.510> they<00:04:26.539> could<00:04:26.690> win<00:04:26.960> it

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
they didn't know if they could win it

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.020 
they didn't know if they could win it
due<00:04:27.409> to<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.710> recoil<00:04:28.099> that<00:04:28.250> they<00:04:28.370> saw<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.880> the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
due to the recoil that they saw on the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.089 
due to the recoil that they saw on the
UMP<00:04:29.450> from<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.229> water<00:04:30.409> modern<00:04:30.830> warfare<00:04:30.950> 3

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
UMP from the water modern warfare 3

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.770 
UMP from the water modern warfare 3
version<00:04:32.950> so<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.700> recoil<00:04:35.150> category<00:04:35.630> the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
version so in the recoil category the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.370 
version so in the recoil category the
UMP<00:04:36.320> for<00:04:36.590> modern<00:04:36.830> warfare<00:04:36.979> two<00:04:37.310> wins<00:04:38.380> moving

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
UMP for modern warfare two wins moving

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.010 
UMP for modern warfare two wins moving
on<00:04:39.470> two<00:04:39.620> shots<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:40.099> kill<00:04:40.280> because<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.510> UMP

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
on two shots to kill because the UMP

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.440 
on two shots to kill because the UMP
from<00:04:42.349> modern<00:04:42.649> warfare<00:04:42.830> 2<00:04:43.190> had<00:04:43.460> such<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.909> short

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
from modern warfare 2 had such a short

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.440 
from modern warfare 2 had such a short
or<00:04:44.899> a<00:04:44.930> low<00:04:45.440> amount<00:04:45.890> of<00:04:46.219> drop-off<00:04:46.729> or<00:04:47.000> damage

we<00:04:48.860> see<00:04:49.130> that<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.400> ump<00:04:50.000> from<00:04:50.300> modern<00:04:50.570> warfare

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
we see that the ump from modern warfare

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.670 
we see that the ump from modern warfare
2<00:04:51.020> only<00:04:51.350> took<00:04:51.530> three<00:04:52.130> shots<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.580> kill<00:04:53.260> now<00:04:54.260> on

effective damage done over a range we

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.320 
effective damage done over a range we
see<00:05:54.950> that<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.220> UMP<00:05:55.640> for<00:05:55.850> modern<00:05:56.060> warfare<00:05:56.180> 3

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
see that the UMP for modern warfare 3

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.540 
see that the UMP for modern warfare 3
does<00:05:56.930> more<00:05:57.169> damage<00:05:57.200> and<00:05:57.740> it<00:05:57.919> wins<00:05:58.160> in<00:05:58.430> the

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
does more damage and it wins in the

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.480 
does more damage and it wins in the

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
damage category the last category the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.760 
damage category the last category the
reload<00:06:01.820> time<00:06:01.850> is<00:06:02.330> equal<00:06:02.539> among<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.140> two<00:06:03.289> umps

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
reload time is equal among the two umps

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.560 
reload time is equal among the two umps
making<00:06:04.190> it<00:06:04.310> a<00:06:04.490> 2.5<00:06:05.210> volt<00:06:05.450> second<00:06:06.130> reload<00:06:07.130> time

making it a 2.5 volt second reload time

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.940 
making it a 2.5 volt second reload time
so<00:06:08.570> what<00:06:08.750> does<00:06:08.870> this<00:06:09.020> basically<00:06:09.410> mean<00:06:09.680> it

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
so what does this basically mean it

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.430 
so what does this basically mean it
means<00:06:10.250> that<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.030> UMP<00:06:11.419> from<00:06:11.630> modern<00:06:11.930> warfare<00:06:12.110> 2

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
means that the UMP from modern warfare 2
