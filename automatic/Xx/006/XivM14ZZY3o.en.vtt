 of the polyps their natural environment 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.380
 are humid mountainous forests and with 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.139
 little Asian lighting for almost 4,000 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.150
 years the lucid ganoderma mushrooms have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.180
 been recognized by doctors 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.510
 Orientals as a valuable remedy to

 health his name in chinese is music that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.510
 means spiritual power there was

 also known as the medicine of the

 kings or the depth of immortality the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.020
 famous doctor Jim Lee during the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 Ming dynasty endorsed the effectiveness 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.800
 of the lychee in his famous book go

 drowning the great karma cope to him 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.829
 wrote that take continuously 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.520
 ganoderma will build a strong body and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.620
 healthy and long life ensure the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.949
 Japanese doctors of antiquity will 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.860
 they called ricky modern science has 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.760
 found that the ganoderma possesses more than 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.490
 200 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.060
 important and nutrients of the organism 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.970
 human of which more than 150 are 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 important antioxidant their 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.410
 active constituents are beckley 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.510
 cannes anti tumor and immunostimulants 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.570
 Acids won from rich little penises 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.720
 anti-allergic agents reducing the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.910
 cholesterol and blood pressure 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.840
 anti tumor and stimulant polysaccharides 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.630
 of cells of defenders of immunity 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 unsaturated fatty acids vitamins and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 minerals such as germanium and calcium 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.690
 as well as numerous alkaloids in addition 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.510
 Ganoderma is considered an expense 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.870
 genes or a substance that helps 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.900
 leveling discrepancies in the body is 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.020
 say that going up low levels already 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.570
 go down to high levels for centuries the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.479
 ganoderma has been known as a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.179
 cardio tonic grass and has been 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.819
 routinely prescribed for those 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.579
 people with symptoms of tight chest 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.159
 or sore arteries disease 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.579
 coronary arteries related to angina 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.829
 chest researchers in china 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.620
 They found that the fungus improves the flow 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.560
 blood and reduces oxygen consumption 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.959
 of the cardiac muscle results 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.969
 similar were also found by 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.359
 Japanese scientists who 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.849
 They found that racing contains acid 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:42.450
 won from erico which lowers the pressure 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.519
 blood and cholesterol and inhibits 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.579
 platelet aggregation within the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.980
 arteries whose accumulation can lead 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.379
 to heart attacks and other problems 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.719
 circulatory by its baggage of 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.389
 nutrients the ganoderma has been 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:00.209
 traditionally recommended by 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.569
 Serbo Chinese and Japanese logos for 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.230
 innumerable conditions among them the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.230
 diabetes and even insomnia due to its 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.900
 sleep promotion factor is also 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.889
 prescribed in China for a large number of 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.850
 psychiatric and neurological conditions 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.100
 Additionally 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.500
 the studies carried out seem 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.960
 demonstrate that the fungus helps in 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.880
 improvement of Alzheimer's that can be 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.190
 use as analgesic and relaxing 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.680
 muscle without being a narcotic or 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.590
 hypnotic all this maybe because of its 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.560
 Apparent power to oxygenate the blood and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.080
 the cells that the blood provides 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.940
 oxygen and of course you have 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.490
 found powerful properties 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.550
 anti-inflammatory as if this were 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.850
 little in japan has been made extensive 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.930
 Reiki studies in research 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.590
 against cancer and it has been proven 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.560
 antitumor 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.020
 this investigation has continued in 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.080
 Korea-Japan Chinese constituents 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.260
 anti-cancer assets present in the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.500
 fungus are the so-called beta glÃ¼ck have 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.500
 here I must warn that it is not appropriate 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.989
 say that ganoderma cures cancer 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.730
 cancer is not a disease but a 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.880
 set of different conditions 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.360
 always changing and although the ganoderma 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.090
 of 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.110
 shown to be helpful in many cases of 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.449
 breast and colon cancer no 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.969
 case is equal to another 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.439
 the ganoderma commonly used in 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.319
 Chinese for the treatment of 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:42.479
 chronic hepatitis in Japan have 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.060
 reported that the ganoderma extract 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.479
 is effective in treating patients 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.150
 with other problems in the liver 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.669
 mushroom polysaccharides stimulate the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.909
 immune system for activation 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.300
 of immunological cells such as 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:03.389
 macrophages and cells and also 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.419
 increase immunoglobin levels 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:10.409
 to produce a greater response against 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.990
 bacteria virus and tumor cells this 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.529
 help against viruses suggests that the use 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.990
 continued ganoderma could help 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:21.599
 raise the defenses to prevent 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.469
 serious diseases from the 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:28.319
 viruses such as hb what if 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:30.610
 it has been proven it has already been proved that the 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.240
 fungus helps that treatment 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.300
 conventional against those terrible 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.250
 diseases like AIDS and cancer 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.979
 produce fewer side effects 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.860
 the patient extracts the fungus 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.490
 significantly inhibit four 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.379
 types of allergic reactions including 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.009
 positive effects against asthma 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.169
 bronchitis conjunctivitis and dermatitis 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.819
 by contact 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.889
 likewise the ganoderma can be 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.139
 used effectively in the 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.990
 treatment of muscle pain because 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:09.009
 It is anti-inflammatory torticollis shoulders 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.379
 Rigid rheumatism and chronic fatigue 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.509
 the mining area help action to the 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.490
 sea grain health has created a 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.599
 fungus use style that in 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.969
 naturopathy we call lengthen or therapy 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:25.330
 it is based on certain principles 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:28.599
 basic to know that diseases are 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.629
 caused by the accumulation of toxic 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:34.750
 and an imbalance in the functions that 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.930
 has verified that ganoderma helps 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.050
 heal 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.600
 by balancing the organism and uploading its 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.960
 defenses that is to strengthen the system 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.070
 immune that sometimes there are reactions 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.389
 of the body called the healing crisis 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.660
 resisting the elimination of 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.940
 toxins that the dose of ganoderma is 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.370
 irrelevant to the seriousness of the 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.910
 condition and that there are no effects 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.699
 side that the only people who 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:08.479
 they should not take ganoderma are women 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:11.990
 pregnant women and people with a transplant 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:15.320
 organs in naturopathy we studied that the 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:19.310
 ganoderma works organically in 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.400
 our body to know from 1 to 15 days of 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.580
 use he ganoderma starts helping the 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.729
 agency to start acting in the 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:32.300
 areas with health problems from 1 to 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:35.449
 30 days of use begins cleaning the 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:39.349
 organism eliminating accumulations 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:41.540
 toxic from 1 to 6 months of use on 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:46.070
 organism is already regulated 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:50.350
 and running balanced from 6 to 24 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:54.090
 months of use ganoderma complete the 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:56.970
 strengthening of the immune system 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:00.780
 if he won brother has effects 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:03.600
 secondary some just do the 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:09.169
 proof that it is best for you not 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.169
 have nothing to lose except the bad
