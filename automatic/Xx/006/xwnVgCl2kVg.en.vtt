that's<00:00:58.799> what<00:00:58.920> LG<00:00:59.430> says<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.330> can<00:01:00.510> work<00:01:00.689> this<00:01:00.839> up

that's what LG says you can work this up

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.479 
that's what LG says you can work this up
to<00:01:01.199> full<00:01:01.409> brightness<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.979> you<00:01:02.040> can<00:01:02.189> see<00:01:02.369> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
to full brightness and you can see it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
to full brightness and you can see it's
totally<00:01:02.850> throwing<00:01:03.089> off<00:01:03.299> my<00:01:03.330> camera<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
totally throwing off my camera and this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
totally throwing off my camera and this
isn't<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.830> overly<00:01:05.309> dark<00:01:05.580> room<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> that's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
isn't an overly dark room so that's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.150 
isn't an overly dark room so that's
pretty<00:01:06.420> decent<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.050> but<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> wait<00:01:08.010> til

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.320 
well it's also an unchangeable F 1.8
aperture<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:31.580> that's<00:05:31.759> a<00:05:31.880> camera<00:05:32.090> in<00:05:32.240> a

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
aperture so that's a camera in a

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.719 
aperture so that's a camera in a
nutshell<00:05:32.539> it<00:05:32.900> also<00:05:33.050> records<00:05:33.440> 4k<00:05:33.889> video<00:05:34.220> but<00:05:34.639> we

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
nutshell it also records 4k video but we

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.820 
nutshell it also records 4k video but we
can't<00:05:34.909> really<00:05:35.090> test<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.509> out<00:05:35.690> on<00:05:36.259> the<00:05:36.500> spot

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
can't really test that out on the spot

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.670 
can't really test that out on the spot
so<00:05:36.860> I'm<00:05:37.130> going<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.400> leave<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.639> for
