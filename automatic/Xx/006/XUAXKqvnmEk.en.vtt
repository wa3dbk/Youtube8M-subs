00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.430
Hello and welcome to Get Thready With Me episode
#7. Now I am *so* excited about today's project.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.250
Even though more than half of my audience
are in summer at the moment, it is winter

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.630
here in Australia, so if this isn't one that
you can do at the moment, then just save it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.500
away for autumn or winter - because I promise,
it is so worth it.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.289
So I'm going to shut up now, and let's get
started.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.620
Okay, so I thrifted this AMAZING sweater a
couple of months ago. But, it’s a little

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.550
bit too small, so unfortunately I never wear
it. But the dog print is just adorable, so

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.470
I thought that I would try and turn it into
something wearable!

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.910
So the first thing I did was turn the sweater
inside out.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.649
I put a bunch of pins through both layers
to hold them together, and then decided on

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.750
the shape of my skirt.
My waist measurement is 30 inches, but because

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.649
this material STRETCHES, I’m going to take
2 inches off that measurement.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.590
I’m also going to allow a bit more room
across here for my hips and butt.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.089
So I’m going to draw something like this
in pen onto my inside-out sweater.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.289
Of course, if you’re using a more oversized
sweater, then you’d draw something like

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.440
this instead.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.530
Now, I’m going to use my overlocker to both
cut and sew the sides of the skirt at the same time.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.350
So I’m going to run my overlocker down both
the sides of the sweater like this.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.390
So first, I’ve set my overlocker's differential
feed to its highest (positive) setting, so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.820
that it'll get a waver-free seam. This will
just mean that hopefully, the seam will be

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.420
as flat as possible. And then, I sew.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.500
And, that’s a pretty alright seam! I’m
pretty happy with that!

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:46.630
Okay, so now I’ve done this on both sides,
I’m going to cut all along this line, through both layers of the sweater.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.980
Then I turned it the right way around again.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.299
Now, for my waistband I am using this navy
blue ribbed jersey material – but any kind

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.200
of jersey material, or even an old t-shirt,
should do.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.009
So, I folded this fabric in half. I then stuck
some pins in it to keep the two layers sandwiched

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.479
together in place. I then measured a rectangle
that’s 5 inches by 14 inches, and then cut

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.619
this rectangle out, on the fold. Which I then
unfold, and so I have this strip, which is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.880
28 inches by 5 inches.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.200
So then I place this waistband fabric down
onto the front of my skirt like this. And

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.440
then I start putting in pins, pinning this
bit of fabric onto my skirt all the way around.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.120
Once I’ve pinned it on all the way around,
I join the two ends of the waistband together like this.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.810
And then, I’m going to sew the waistband
to the skirt. So because I have an overlocker,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.090
I’m going to first sew the waistband in
place using a very long straight stitch – also

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.090
called a “basting” stitch.
Then, I removed all the pins, and use my overlocker to again sew all the way around.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.420
The next step was to measure a piece of elastic.
The elastic I got is 1 and a half inches wide.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.879
I wrapped a piece of elastic comfortably around
my waist, and then pulled it just *slightly*

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.569
tighter, to measure the correct length.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.799
Then, I unfolded the waistband, and again
turned everything inside out.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.049
Then, with the waistband material, I folded
it down, in half so that the raw edge lay

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.969
just on top of the seam that I made when I
attached the waistband.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.140
Then, I started putting in pins to hold it all together!

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.580
Now, I’m going to sew across this, to make
a kind of tube out of the waistband, attached

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.689
all the way around the skirt. I'm going to
use zig zag stitch, but I’m also going to

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.629
leave a small gap, because that’s where
I’m going to insert my elastic later on.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:54.379
So, with that done, I put a safety pin in
the end of my elastic to help guide it through

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.939
the tube, inserted it through the hole in
the waistband, and threaded it through the

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:05.250
skirt until it came out the other end, and
then I sewed the two ends of elastic together

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.170
like this.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.920
Then I popped the elastic back through the
hole, and sewed over the top to close it up,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.820
and, I’m done!

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.280
[music plays]

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.200
How easy was that!? I'm now planning to visit
the thrift shop and get myself as many oversized

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.520
kitschy jumpers as possible, and turn them
all into super cute pencil skirts.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.240
It's going to be amazing.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.280
Thank you all so much for watching! Don't
forget to check out my last episode, episode

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.750
#6, and I'll see you all for my very next
video. Bye!
