00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.740
 Hello everyone, Irina 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:14.429
 in this video I want to show you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.830
 how to prolong the life of the peduncle 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.109
 eat if you smear 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.230
 the topmost kidney after our 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.619
 peduncle completely dropped the flowers 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.260
 I mean the orchid our wine can be here itself 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.800
 this one is the tip to the very last 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.719
 Pochechka lubricate and still not new pasta 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 here is two weeks later the result that is 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.790
 we see that this is our kidney 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.460
 which we smeared it opened up on 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.829
 there are still visible cytokine residues 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 new pasta and she released such here 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.660
 again a young flower with this 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 I still do not recommend abuse 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.750
 run smear all your ki orchids too 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.609
 I do not recommend but unless you 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.060
 bought a faded orchid q and you 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.590
 very very interesting how is she 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.240
 will bloom 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.130
 colors well then you can try 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 smear one packet maybe there 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.170
 will rise 2:30 . 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.259
 you will see what they are 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 we will calm down sleep well 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.150
 the game doesnâ€™t mean to run 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.640
 and all smear the whale orchid is in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.869
 the principle of this is undesirable 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.439
 just now i'm showing you what's 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.590
 there is a way as it is also entitled to 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.060
 Existence 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.090
 do this or not do in principle 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.840
 the choice is yours well how would I, in principle, not 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.840
 recommend 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:59.799
