sounds funny as you can see it has a
pretty<00:00:42.270> long<00:00:42.480> cord<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.219> exact

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
pretty long cord I don't know the exact

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.619 
pretty long cord I don't know the exact
like<00:00:45.629> feet<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.579> I'm<00:00:47.579> too<00:00:47.879> lazy<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.390> look

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
like feet but I'm too lazy to go look

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.779 
like feet but I'm too lazy to go look
and<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.230> probably<00:00:49.559> figured<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.489> was

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and as you probably figured out I was

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.819 
and as you probably figured out I was
using<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.149> camera's<00:00:51.600> audio<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.469> most<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
using my camera's audio for most of this

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.139 
using my camera's audio for most of this
video<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:54.300> let's<00:00:54.510> switch<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.440> audio

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
video and now let's switch to this audio

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.029 
video and now let's switch to this audio
okay<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.170> recording<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
okay now it's recording from the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.000 
okay now it's recording from the
Logitech<00:00:59.579> 600<00:01:00.270> desktop<00:01:00.719> mic<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.829> let's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
Logitech 600 desktop mic and now let's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.520 
Logitech 600 desktop mic and now let's
compare<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.609> two<00:01:03.619> camcorder<00:01:04.619> mic<00:01:05.450> Logitech

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
compare the two camcorder mic Logitech

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
compare the two camcorder mic Logitech
mic<00:01:08.270> camcorder<00:01:09.270> mic<00:01:10.040> Logitech<00:01:11.040> mic<00:01:11.990> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
mic camcorder mic Logitech mic this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
mic camcorder mic Logitech mic this
might<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.590> better<00:01:13.799> since<00:01:14.159> it's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
might be a little better since it's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.820 
might be a little better since it's
closer<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.450> really<00:01:15.960> shouldn't<00:01:16.290> make<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
closer but it really shouldn't make that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
closer but it really shouldn't make that
much<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.250> difference<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.840> hear

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
much of a difference and as you can hear

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080 
much of a difference and as you can hear
the<00:01:19.530> mic<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:19.950> picking<00:01:20.430> me<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.880> well

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the mic is not picking me up that well

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.960 
the mic is not picking me up that well
from<00:01:21.450> far<00:01:21.720> away<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> need<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
from far away so what you need to do is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
from far away so what you need to do is
either<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.049> controls<00:01:25.500> move<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
either go into your controls move the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.300 
either go into your controls move the
gain<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> microphone<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:28.320> simply

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
gain up of the microphone or just simply

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.670 
gain up of the microphone or just simply
go<00:01:29.460> closer<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> mic<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.439> just

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
go closer to the mic and you know just

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.980 
go closer to the mic and you know just
talk<00:01:31.890> closer<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:33.119> seems<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> work<00:01:33.540> better

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
talk closer that seems to work better

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
talk closer that seems to work better
than<00:01:34.619> turning<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.159> gain<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.490> cuz<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:35.850> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
than turning the gain up cuz then you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.929 
than turning the gain up cuz then you
get<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.299> background<00:01:36.990> noise<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.979> amplified

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
get that background noise all amplified

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.350 
get that background noise all amplified
so<00:01:39.380> talk<00:01:40.380> close<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> mic<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.119> too

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
so talk close to the mic but if I'm too

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.580 
so talk close to the mic but if I'm too
close<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> mic<00:01:43.170> my<00:01:43.740> peas<00:01:44.159> sound<00:01:45.030> poopy<00:01:45.840> so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
close to the mic my peas sound poopy so

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
close to the mic my peas sound poopy so
it<00:01:46.829> catches<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.430> pop<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.570> why

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it catches a lot of pop so that's why

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
it catches a lot of pop so that's why
you<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:49.979> bit

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you got to kind of back up a little bit

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.969 
you got to kind of back up a little bit
give<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.460> some<00:01:50.729> room<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:52.409> should<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.770> good

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
give it some room and you should be good

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.160 
give it some room and you should be good
in<00:01:53.399> conclusion<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:54.479> say<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
in conclusion I would say this is a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800 
in conclusion I would say this is a
great<00:01:55.560> mic<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.340> eight<00:01:56.460> bucks<00:01:56.509> it'd<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.689> good

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
great mic for eight bucks it'd be good

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.340 
great mic for eight bucks it'd be good
