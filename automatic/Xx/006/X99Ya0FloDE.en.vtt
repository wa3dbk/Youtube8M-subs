probably<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.759> five<00:02:09.030> minutes<00:02:09.920> which<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
probably like five minutes which you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.350 
probably like five minutes which you
probably<00:02:11.250> say<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.520> ridiculous<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.060> getting<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
probably say is ridiculous for getting a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490 
probably say is ridiculous for getting a
new<00:02:12.480> quota

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
new quota

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200

than<00:03:01.800> just<00:03:02.160> going<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.360> capturing<00:03:03.660> every

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
than just going and capturing every

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.600 
than just going and capturing every
single<00:03:04.170> flag<00:03:04.380> which<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.770> uh<00:03:04.800> what<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> lot<00:03:05.489> of

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
single flag which is uh what a lot of

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.860 
single flag which is uh what a lot of
idiots<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.239> do<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.510> know<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.630> lot<00:03:06.810> of

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
idiots like to do you know a lot of

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.600 
idiots like to do you know a lot of
idiots<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.770> know<00:03:07.800> if<00:03:07.920> they<00:03:08.040> see<00:03:08.100> flag<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
idiots you know if they see flag to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.670 
idiots you know if they see flag to
capture<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> know<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.480> lot<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.290> smart

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
capture it you know a lot of smart

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.350 
capture it you know a lot of smart
players<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.160> they<00:03:11.220> see<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.489> flag<00:03:11.790> they<00:03:12.090> have<00:03:12.239> to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
players if they see a flag they have to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.870 
players if they see a flag they have to
think<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.280> repercussions<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.370> capturing

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
think of the repercussions of capturing

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.010 
think of the repercussions of capturing
it<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.090> know<00:03:15.180> what's<00:03:15.420> going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.600> happen<00:03:15.660> to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
it you know what's going to happen to

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.630 
it you know what's going to happen to
the<00:03:16.110> spawns<00:03:16.410> house<00:03:16.709> they<00:03:16.860> can<00:03:17.010> alter<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.459> game

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the spawns house they can alter the game

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.759 
the spawns house they can alter the game
so<00:03:18.299> for<00:03:18.720> example<00:03:18.750> if<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.200> spawn<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
so for example if you spawn on the a

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.470 
so for example if you spawn on the a
side<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.190> terminal<00:03:20.489> in<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.030> beginning<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.390> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
side of terminal in the beginning of the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.570 
side of terminal in the beginning of the
game<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.870> smart<00:03:22.560> player<00:03:22.739> knows<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.280> don't<00:03:23.370> want

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
game a smart player knows you don't want

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.340 
game a smart player knows you don't want
to<00:03:23.640> capture<00:03:23.820> they<00:03:24.060> fly<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.299> flag<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:25.080> bad

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
to capture they fly a flag is bad

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.370 
to capture they fly a flag is bad
because<00:03:25.680> most<00:03:26.459> likely<00:03:26.880> you're<00:03:27.420> gonna<00:03:27.660> get<00:03:28.320> a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
because most likely you're gonna get a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.170 
because most likely you're gonna get a
meatiness<00:03:28.620> probably<00:03:28.950> split<00:03:29.489> up<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.910> go<00:03:29.940> for

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
meatiness probably split up and go for

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.150 
meatiness probably split up and go for
be<00:03:30.299> an<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.510> B<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.320> C<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:31.860> you're<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.100> to

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
be an a B and C and then you're going to

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.890 
be an a B and C and then you're going to
get<00:03:32.280> spawn<00:03:32.519> trapped<00:03:32.820> there<00:03:33.030> probably<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
get spawn trapped there probably for the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.150 
get spawn trapped there probably for the
rest<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.170> game<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:34.500> not<00:03:34.680> going<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.860> be<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:34.980> fun

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
rest of game it's not going to be a fun

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.910 
rest of game it's not going to be a fun
experience<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:37.320> know<00:03:37.350> that's<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.680> one

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
experience so I you know that's just one

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.610 
experience so I you know that's just one
of<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> many<00:03:38.190> examples<00:03:38.370> where<00:03:39.200> taking<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.380> flag

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
of the many examples where taking a flag

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.350 
of the many examples where taking a flag
is<00:03:40.890> not<00:03:41.519> something<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.000> always<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.329> just

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
is not something you always do just

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.699 
is not something you always do just
because<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.720> want<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.900> win<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.470> something

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
because you want to win it's something

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.620 
because you want to win it's something
you<00:03:43.920> want<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.100> do<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:45.299> know<00:03:45.329> have

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
you want to do just to you know have

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.530 
you want to do just to you know have
enjoyed<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.260> game<00:03:46.440> more<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.010> you're<00:03:47.130> not<00:03:47.220> just

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
enjoyed the game more so you're not just

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.729 
enjoyed the game more so you're not just
screwed<00:03:48.540> basically<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:49.110> whole<00:03:49.230> game<00:03:49.470> because

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
screwed basically the whole game because

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.699 
screwed basically the whole game because
capturing<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.220> flag<00:03:50.810> really<00:03:51.810> alters<00:03:52.170> game<00:03:52.440> and

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
capturing a flag really alters game and

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.400 
capturing a flag really alters game and
a<00:03:53.130> smart<00:03:53.400> player<00:03:53.640> note<00:03:53.910> has<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.480> memorize<00:03:54.660> what

a smart player note has to memorize what
the<00:03:55.530> flags<00:03:55.829> do<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.090> domination<00:03:57.510> match<00:03:57.870> it

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
the flags do in a domination match it

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.100 
the flags do in a domination match it
has<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.380> know<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:59.220> know<00:03:59.310> the<00:04:00.060> spawns<00:04:00.390> of<00:04:00.600> any

memorize it so as you see terminals why
I<00:04:21.510> love<00:04:21.810> terminals<00:04:22.200> because<00:04:22.349> it's<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.650> the

I love terminals because it's one of the

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.440 
I love terminals because it's one of the
best<00:04:22.919> examples<00:04:23.160> of<00:04:23.669> knowing<00:04:24.030> that<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.240> how

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
best examples of knowing that of how

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.120 
best examples of knowing that of how
knowing<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.050> spawns<00:04:25.349> and<00:04:25.680> knowing<00:04:25.979> how<00:04:26.099> the

knowing the spawns and knowing how the
flags<00:04:26.520> effects

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
flags effects

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.640 
flags effects
can<00:04:27.560> benefit<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:28.820> know<00:04:29.080> if<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.230> put<00:04:30.530> the

enemies in a smart small trap you know

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.800 
enemies in a smart small trap you know
you<00:04:32.270> let<00:04:32.540> them<00:04:32.690> take<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.170> and<00:04:33.380> then<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:34.100> take

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
you let them take a and then you take

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.870 
you let them take a and then you take
dnc<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:36.320> really<00:04:36.650> won<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.220> game<00:04:37.400> because

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
dnc you really won the game because

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.010 
dnc you really won the game because
they're<00:04:38.060> stuck<00:04:38.420> there<00:04:38.630> as<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.810> see<00:04:38.990> right

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
they're stuck there as you see right

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.230 
they're stuck there as you see right
here<00:04:39.440> if<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:40.100> get<00:04:40.280> killstreaks<00:04:40.520> they're<00:04:40.940> done

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
here if you get killstreaks they're done

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.210 
here if you get killstreaks they're done
I<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:42.110> is<00:04:42.260> not<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.410> good<00:04:42.560> example<00:04:42.650> because<00:04:43.040> I

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
I this is not a good example because I

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.710 
I this is not a good example because I
think<00:04:43.280> they<00:04:43.520> started<00:04:43.880> splitting<00:04:44.330> off<00:04:44.570> in

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
think they started splitting off in

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.890 
think they started splitting off in
capturing<00:04:45.050> see<00:04:45.200> right<00:04:45.380> here<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:46.160> if<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:47.120> trap

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
capturing see right here but if you trap

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.570 
capturing see right here but if you trap
them<00:04:48.080> at<00:04:48.230> a<00:04:48.350> on<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.590> ground<00:04:48.920> war<00:04:49.100> mash<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.520> you

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
them at a on a ground war mash and you

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.880 
them at a on a ground war mash and you
have<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:49.760> c-130<00:04:50.480> you're<00:04:50.810> there<00:04:51.170> they<00:04:51.380> are<00:04:51.410> done

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
have a c-130 you're there they are done

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.190 
have a c-130 you're there they are done
and<00:04:52.540> you<00:04:53.540> know<00:04:53.630> that's<00:04:53.750> one<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.110> many

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
and you know that's one of the many

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.370 
and you know that's one of the many
examples<00:04:55.030> run<00:04:56.030> down<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.480> good<00:04:56.720> one<00:04:56.870> too<00:04:57.080> if

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
examples run down is a good one too if

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.050 
examples run down is a good one too if
you<00:04:57.740> didn't<00:04:57.980> know<00:04:58.040> one<00:04:58.160> run<00:04:58.370> down<00:04:58.520> if<00:04:58.700> you<00:04:58.790> let

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
you didn't know one run down if you let

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.360 
you didn't know one run down if you let
the<00:04:59.180> enemy<00:04:59.480> capture<00:04:59.930> be<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:00.920> that<00:05:01.220> means

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
the enemy capture be and a so that means

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.920 
the enemy capture be and a so that means
they<00:05:01.490> have<00:05:01.670> to<00:05:01.700> have<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.210> double<00:05:02.600> trapped

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
they have to have you double trapped

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.530 
they have to have you double trapped
they<00:05:03.740> actually<00:05:04.280> get<00:05:04.370> stuck<00:05:04.760> in<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:05.000> trap<00:05:05.270> they

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
they actually get stuck in a trap they

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.480 
they actually get stuck in a trap they
actually<00:05:05.930> get<00:05:06.200> stuck<00:05:06.560> spawning<00:05:07.130> in<00:05:07.340> one<00:05:07.460> of

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
actually get stuck spawning in one of

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.420 
actually get stuck spawning in one of
those<00:05:07.640> little<00:05:07.850> buildings<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:09.070> they<00:05:10.070> just

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
those little buildings and they just
