00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.570
 Good day to listen to him 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.550
 evil borscht and it means that you are now 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.869
 can transfer online infiltration 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.750
 transfer about interesting and fascinating 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.399
 online games have already ended my marathon 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.739
 by battlefield and now finally you can 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.559
 get distracted by something else and today on 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.419
 titanfall trips not long ago 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.640
 he was beta and I have long been in it 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.739
 played and only now finally found 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.019
 time to make up some opinion 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.940
 Perhaps I'll start with expectations Well, firstly I 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.320
 I didn't expect this game much, I knew that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.809
 for example will represent 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.760
 rather thought he knew but all my hopes 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.679
 collapsed at the moment when the developers 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.140
 said that the fighting will take place just 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.030
 only 6 by 6 with bots like this 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.219
 immediately came to the cornerstone all 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.499
 games but let's discuss it all first 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.420
 at level and 9 ideas it's great to take 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.339
 vigorous super fast spinal cord 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.469
 shooter in the style of call of duty screwed 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.269
 him a little parkour for running around the walls 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.310
 and the roof and add more to all this 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.259
 titan hefty furs for which we 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.210
 we sit down with other Komi and 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.790
 Generally very enjoyable spend 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.369
 time I will tell in advance it might come out 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.079
 much cooler than the one who came out 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.610
 came up with a big-very great fellow 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.740
 because this idea is really 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.780
 originally presents some new 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.790
 word in the genre at least something new gives 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.320
 fascinating but the problem is that you 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.270
 man worked with a moron who 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.090
 thought it would be a lot of fun 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.990
 amazing run with bots in online 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.119
 were joking 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.939
 so it could be done 15 years ago 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.439
 any country know play what 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.060
 called with a friend one on one and 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.590
 in parallel, still put a bunch of bots 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.369
 that was not boring here about 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.950
 the same 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.590
 why it was impossible to make 15 by 15 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.270
 With a little more cards I do not understand what 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.920
 computers won't stand it anyway 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.960
 schedule here is not so amazing to 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.270
 imagination and then source 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.579
 Probably 2 handlers after anrial 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.439
 Engine 3 graphics are good here but not 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.250
 more yes in fact this is saying bot this 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.439
 the only thing here is for real 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.329
 confused because run pretty fun 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.460
 gameplay does not give you rest 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.590
 literal seconds again using 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.630
 bots I mean a game like this 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.850
 in big ways gives you a feeling of not 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.230
 let's leave her super speakers 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.180
 those with which it can be here is to compare 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.550
 super powerful cars with awesome 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.680
 soundproofed and to its owner 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.780
 I hear the roar of engines if he wants 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.700
 he is specially made to sound 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.280
 this engine went through the speakers 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.320
 that is, through a series of system here 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.880
 Here it seems to play like a ball 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.070
 really fun that is constant 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.190
 running parkour these titans are all around 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.410
 spinning-spinning it looks good but 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.120
 Unfortunately when one runs out of fighting 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.000
 I saw what I did 40 frags 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.490
 35 of which were bots I felt 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.230
 I honestly donâ€™t understand myself 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.630
 why it was impossible to make more people 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.490
 participating in one battle that is possible 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.020
 then it would be the dominance of the titans excessive 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.540
 but again these titans could 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.030
 give for some kind of special 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.500
 or execute them in certain strictly 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.540
 limited quantity well think up 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.490
 something could have been exactly why these 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.910
 bots spoiled all the impression about 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.320
 the game 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.450
 Especially since the rest is to find fault 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.380
 there is nothing here there are several classes 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.480
 characters 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.040
 true of course not all of them I managed 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.970
 open or play because it was 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.260
 just beta 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.810
 there are also different varieties 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.550
 titans by the way on titans ride 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.780
 really weight they create a feeling 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.030
 what are you in some 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.320
 steep robot at the same time on them as well 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.120
 fascinating to fight with others 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.890
 titans you'll meet dodge 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.180
 from their shots trying to shoot 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.580
 use force field 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.290
 if you razdrakonil good titans 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.750
 you come to fight melee you 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.220
 famously pulling the pilot from there squeezing 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.990
 you throw it away with your claws 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.890
 far away it all looks very 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.600
 impressively 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.610
 with all this go far from there 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.840
 monolithic it is not immortal it can 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.610
 easy to break and it is not 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.740
 sure to be another titanium sometimes 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.450
 even the attack of small people in much 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.830
 more dangerous than well as other titanium 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.020
 because do n't jump you 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.210
 start shaking it up there 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.310
 you and your reactor miserable in the end 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.070
 you blow up you hurt that you killed 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.320
 some little bastard in the company 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.910
 play even more fun you interact with 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.620
 they are allowed in this situation when you 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.150
 on titan and he will jump to on the shoulder 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.740
 helps to shoot it 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.600
 really captures and it is clear that 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.760
 did the same people as they did once 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.440
 multiplayer to fourth call of duty 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.270
 although I personally have never been with them 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.920
 Persian but I understand why others like 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.780
 here probably the main stone 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.010
 stumbling for me is possible on my 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.990
 own assessment 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.420
 this game is influenced by the fact that I love myself 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.010
 games of a slightly different format this game is for 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.720
 it costs only the spinal cord and 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.370
 she does it well but i love when in 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.140
 games have a little bit more than just tactics 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.450
 a little more space but you get the idea 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.030
 end grie say now in front of us 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.570
 the main question is whether to buy 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.180
 and here you are , of course, there 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.550
 ambiguous if you're a big fan 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.680
 whom in the great duty great 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.570
 love games of this format when 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.790
 small card happens unstoppable 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.680
 action then you will buy it 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.580
 what have you probably already done 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.650
 pre-order 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.300
 I did this pre-order and did not 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.340
 I will because I love a little others 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.980
 games be honest i will play this game with 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.610
 pleasure but on one condition it 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.770
 condition 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.360
 600 rubles no more, I practically 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.370
 I am sure that at the start it will not ask much 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.290
 I will not pay a large amount of money 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.750
 I'll probably do the same here 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.890
 once done with dps m third should 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.470
 when prices drop 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.570
 and at a reduced price already buy and play 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.130
 reasons you already understood everything to play fun 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.590
 but I like games a little different 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.020
 format and even bot sorry bots 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.730
 spoiled the impression honestly I 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.650
 You have a lot more hunting bought this game 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.870
 if there were no bots in it and it would be 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.600
 only players and with more not 6 on 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.040
 6 at least 15 for 15 speakers will be at 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.230
 this would not fail to play much 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.780
 more interesting on this I finish today 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.430
 that was my honest opinion i'm not sure 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.960
 that everyone will agree with him however you 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.060
 can express your point of view in 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.280
 comments of course after 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.930
 you will like and subscribe to the channel 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.930
 and I say goodbye to you new meetings
