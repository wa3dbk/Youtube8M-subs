looks<00:01:01.550> like<00:01:01.789> a<00:01:01.940> dial<00:01:02.300> but<00:01:02.600> actually<00:01:02.929> it's<00:01:03.079> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
looks like a dial but actually it's the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.740 
looks like a dial but actually it's the
button<00:01:03.499> this<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.100> for<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.489> volume<00:01:04.750> clicking

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
button this is for the volume clicking

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.340 
button this is for the volume clicking
it<00:01:05.870> raises<00:01:06.620> the<00:01:06.740> volume<00:01:07.100> holding<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.090> down

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
it raises the volume holding it down

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.000 
it raises the volume holding it down
decreases<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.470> volume<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:12.470> why<00:01:12.680> would<00:01:12.890> we

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
decreases the volume so why would we

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.340 
decreases the volume so why would we
need<00:01:13.160> something<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:14.030> well<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.960> idea

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
need something like this well the idea

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.020 
need something like this well the idea
is<00:01:15.380> if<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:15.710> have<00:01:15.800> something<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.490> netbook

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
is if you have something like a netbook

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.110 
is if you have something like a netbook
or<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.420> notebook<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.680> netbooks<00:01:19.100> are<00:01:19.250> also<00:01:19.370> more

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
or a notebook and netbooks are also more

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.080 
or a notebook and netbooks are also more
commonly<00:01:20.480> known<00:01:20.660> as<00:01:20.840> laptops<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.470> course<00:01:22.090> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
commonly known as laptops of course the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.490 
commonly known as laptops of course the
internal<00:01:23.420> speakers<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:24.050> come<00:01:24.260> with<00:01:24.380> these

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
internal speakers that come with these

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.140 
internal speakers that come with these
devices<00:01:25.280> are<00:01:25.490> very<00:01:25.970> small<00:01:27.370> now<00:01:28.370> they<00:01:28.520> work

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
devices are very small now they work

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.300 
devices are very small now they work
fine<00:01:29.450> for<00:01:29.690> notifications<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.950> things<00:01:31.100> like

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
fine for notifications and things like

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.740 
fine for notifications and things like
that<00:01:31.550> but<00:01:31.790> when<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.060> want<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.300> listen<00:01:32.510> to

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
that but when you want to listen to

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.770 
that but when you want to listen to
maybe<00:01:33.020> some<00:01:33.260> music<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:34.640> volume<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.390> indeed

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
maybe some music the volume and indeed

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.840 
maybe some music the volume and indeed
the<00:01:35.930> clarity<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.740> sound<00:01:36.980> isn't<00:01:37.460> always

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
the clarity of the sound isn't always

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.240 
the clarity of the sound isn't always
the<00:01:38.180> best<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:39.350> having<00:01:39.560> something<00:01:39.890> like<00:01:40.010> this

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
the best so having something like this

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.090 
the best so having something like this
it's<00:01:40.460> portable<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:41.270> like<00:01:41.840> coming<00:01:42.140> can<00:01:42.740> increase

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's portable I like coming can increase

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.640 
it's portable I like coming can increase
both<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.400> volume<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.420> clarity<00:01:44.900> that's

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
both the volume and the clarity that's

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.880 
both the volume and the clarity that's
obviously<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.100> bonus<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:48.170> let's<00:01:48.350> try<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.620> on<00:01:48.710> my

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
obviously a bonus so let's try it on my

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.540 
obviously a bonus so let's try it on my
netbook

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
netbook

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.040

first of all let's listen to what the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.820 
first of all let's listen to what the
netbook<00:01:51.350> sounds<00:01:51.800> without<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:53.390> Edifier<00:01:54.380> MP

so fine two Maxima okay so that's not
too<00:02:32.450> bad<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.200> even<00:02:33.890> at<00:02:33.980> maximum<00:02:34.310> volume<00:02:34.610> it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
too bad but even at maximum volume it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.020 
too bad but even at maximum volume it

need to reboot Windows but that's a

minor inconvenience once you've done it
the<00:03:11.780> first<00:03:11.810> time<00:03:12.230> around<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.709> just<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.920> matter

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
the first time around it's just a matter

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.710 
the first time around it's just a matter
of<00:03:13.190> plugging<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.640> in<00:03:13.790> again<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> now<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.269> power

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
of plugging it in again so now the power

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.550 
of plugging it in again so now the power
and<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.440> sound<00:03:18.680> is<00:03:18.860> going<00:03:19.040> through<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.370> USB

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
and the sound is going through the USB

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.539 
and the sound is going through the USB
but<00:03:21.560> don't<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:21.890> worry<00:03:22.010> about<00:03:22.100> any<00:03:22.340> other

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
but don't have to worry about any other

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.270 
but don't have to worry about any other
wires<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.299> if<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.750> can<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.890> can<00:03:25.070> see

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
wires and if you can see we can see

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.979 
wires and if you can see we can see
we've<00:03:25.459> got<00:03:25.610> power<00:03:25.850> because<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.780> the

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
we've got power because of the

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.050 
we've got power because of the
illumination<00:03:29.500> mask<00:03:30.500> see<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:31.610> it's<00:03:31.790> any

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
illumination mask see if it's any

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.240 
illumination mask see if it's any
different<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.810> internal<00:03:33.290> speakers<00:03:33.799> so

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
different to the internal speakers so

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.020 
different to the internal speakers so
again<00:03:34.430> playing<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.730> same<00:03:34.910> track<00:03:36.700> put<00:03:37.700> into

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
again playing the same track put into

00:03:38.030 --> 00:04:10.240 
again playing the same track put into
maximum

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.440 

now<00:04:11.250> straight<00:04:11.610> away<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.940> can<00:04:12.150> immediately

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
now straight away you can immediately

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.320 
now straight away you can immediately
tell<00:04:13.049> that's<00:04:13.500> much<00:04:14.040> louder<00:04:14.640> than<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
tell that's much louder than the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.960 
tell that's much louder than the
internal<00:04:15.690> speakers<00:04:16.260> on<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> netbook

internal speakers on the netbook

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.330 
internal speakers on the netbook
fantastic<00:04:17.970> it's<00:04:18.870> definitely<00:04:19.380> also<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.979> little

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
fantastic it's definitely also a little

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.760 
fantastic it's definitely also a little
clearer<00:04:20.639> as<00:04:20.940> well<00:04:21.150> uses<00:04:21.750> more<00:04:21.989> detail<00:04:22.470> in<00:04:22.650> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
clearer as well uses more detail in the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.430 
clearer as well uses more detail in the
sound<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.400> even<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.419> voice<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:25.139> pan

squealing voice through cheap speakers
it<00:04:29.910> didn't<00:04:30.240> distort<00:04:30.600> on<00:04:30.780> maximum<00:04:31.199> volume<00:04:31.590> yet

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
it didn't distort on maximum volume yet

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.760 
it didn't distort on maximum volume yet
it<00:04:32.370> was<00:04:32.490> still<00:04:32.729> quite<00:04:33.419> loud<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:33.770> substantial

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
it was still quite loud and substantial

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.710 
it was still quite loud and substantial
fantastic<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.580> now<00:04:38.760> let's<00:04:39.180> say<00:04:39.360> we<00:04:39.449> want<00:04:39.630> to

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
fantastic so now let's say we want to

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.770 
fantastic so now let's say we want to
plug<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.289> different<00:04:40.860> device<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.630> is

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
plug in a different device and this is

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.320 
plug in a different device and this is
the<00:04:43.169> products<00:04:43.560> main<00:04:43.710> down<00:04:44.010> for<00:04:44.310> really<00:04:44.669> well

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
the products main down for really well

the products main down for really well
fortunately<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.900> get<00:04:46.080> parrot<00:04:46.500> relies<00:04:46.889> on<00:04:47.220> the

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
fortunately to get parrot relies on the

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.170 
fortunately to get parrot relies on the
USB<00:04:48.060> cable<00:04:49.010> well<00:04:50.010> not<00:04:50.130> every<00:04:50.430> device<00:04:50.699> has<00:04:51.030> a

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
USB cable well not every device has a

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.200 
USB cable well not every device has a
USB<00:04:51.539> port<00:04:52.050> on<00:04:52.229> it<00:04:52.289> for<00:04:52.650> example<00:04:52.919> I<00:04:53.310> have<00:04:54.000> an

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
USB port on it for example I have an

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.060 
USB port on it for example I have an
iPad<00:04:54.630> 2<00:04:55.550> which<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.729> here<00:04:57.440> lovely<00:04:58.440> tablet

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
iPad 2 which is here lovely tablet

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.909 
iPad 2 which is here lovely tablet
device<00:04:59.340> but<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.240> doesn't<00:05:00.510> have<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.900> USB<00:05:01.410> port

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
device but it doesn't have a USB port

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.040 
device but it doesn't have a USB port
therefore<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.729> speaker<00:05:03.150> has<00:05:03.330> no<00:05:03.510> way<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.720> get

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
therefore the speaker has no way to get

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.590 
therefore the speaker has no way to get
power<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:05.100> can't<00:05:05.370> use<00:05:05.610> batteries<00:05:06.180> or<00:05:06.449> any

power you can't use batteries or any

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.550 
power you can't use batteries or any
other<00:05:06.810> method

it<00:05:07.860> relies<00:05:08.190> completely<00:05:08.550> on<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:10.620> USB<00:05:10.889> port

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
it relies completely on the USB port

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
it relies completely on the USB port
this<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.289> going<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.500> limit<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.860> for

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
this is going to limit you for

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.710 
this is going to limit you for
portability<00:05:14.820> because<00:05:15.030> if<00:05:15.270> you're<00:05:15.419> out<00:05:15.599> and

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
portability because if you're out and

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.120 
portability because if you're out and
about<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:16.380> means<00:05:16.710> you're<00:05:16.830> gonna<00:05:16.919> have<00:05:16.979> to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
about that means you're gonna have to

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.529 
about that means you're gonna have to
carry<00:05:17.370> something<00:05:17.639> like<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.910> netbook<00:05:18.300> or<00:05:18.479> a
