 in quantity of dogs called bums are 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.659
 a frightening factor people who give you 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.369
 and food for the kiosks and how they are 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.069

 called dangerous races are not few 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.479
 the cases in which they have occurred 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.000
 attacks that have even ended in 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.250
 deaths the most iconic one of a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.869
 girl who lost her life in the commune 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.299
 from florida when attacked by a 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.579
 pitbull dog there was a girl visiting 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.340
 there with his water and of course when he went 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.709
 leaving the dog grabs the spin to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.000
 here they only heard the screams 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.069
 attack that unfortunately has not been the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.259
 only one that should have regretted the 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.239
 list is long but even though many 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.979
 they think it's the vague dogs what 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.500
 the experts are at greater risk 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.689
 they assure that most of the cases are 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.729
 just dogs belonging to owners 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.679
 and responsible what are usually 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.149
 causing a tragedy the common 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.729
 denominator is that these dogs always 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.000
 they have owner most of the cases in 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.310
 80% of the cases the dogs 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.500
 they are known or people know these 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.450
 dogs are from some relative are from 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 Some friend of a neighbor or is very 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.380
 weird that a dog from another side comes to you 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.480
 to bite 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.820
 avoidable attacks whose common factor 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.410
 is usually only one irresponsibility 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.390
 of many of the people who have not 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.100
 taken the necessary care or 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.390
 they simply decided not to do more 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.390
 charge of your pets
