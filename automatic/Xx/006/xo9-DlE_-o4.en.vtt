00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.679 
next one there's four different view
modes<00:01:59.070> available<00:01:59.250> the<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.390> you're<00:02:00.540> watching

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
modes available the one you're watching

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
modes available the one you're watching
is<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> default<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.009> probably<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> easiest

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
is the default and probably the easiest

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.569 
is the default and probably the easiest
one<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> use<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.439> there's<00:02:04.649> also<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.040> top-down

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
one to use but there's also a top-down

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.160 
one to use but there's also a top-down
view<00:02:05.640> which<00:02:06.240> gives<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> more<00:02:06.960> traditional

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
view which gives you a more traditional

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559

breakout<00:02:07.979> vantage<00:02:08.399> point<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.879> you're<00:02:09.450> now

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
breakout vantage point and you're now

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.330 
breakout vantage point and you're now
able<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.959> see<00:02:10.259> how<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> blocks<00:02:11.129> are

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
able to see how all the blocks are

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
able to see how all the blocks are

your
view<00:02:15.060> yeah<00:02:22.319> if<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:24.010> really<00:02:24.280> want<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.519> feel

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
view yeah if you really want to feel

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.369 
view yeah if you really want to feel
three-dimensional<00:02:25.510> there's<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.019> view<00:02:26.260> from

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
three-dimensional there's a view from

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.589 
three-dimensional there's a view from
behind<00:02:26.560> your<00:02:26.920> paddle<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.430> ground<00:02:27.940> level<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.540> to

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
behind your paddle at ground level so to

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.630 
behind your paddle at ground level so to
speak<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> pretty<00:02:30.190> cool<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
speak this is a pretty cool and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.160 
speak this is a pretty cool and
interesting<00:02:30.790> angle<00:02:31.329> to<00:02:31.360> play<00:02:31.599> from<00:02:31.840> though<00:02:32.140> I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
interesting angle to play from though I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.979 
interesting angle to play from though I
find<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.799> wears<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.159> me<00:02:33.220> fairly<00:02:33.610> quickly<00:02:33.989> the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
find it wears on me fairly quickly the

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.809 
find it wears on me fairly quickly the
last<00:02:35.230> vote<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.560> sort<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:35.980> an<00:02:36.099> action<00:02:36.579> mode

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
last vote is sort of an action mode

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.880 
last vote is sort of an action mode
where<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.150> camera<00:02:37.750> kind<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.349> follows<00:02:38.709> the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
where the camera kind of follows the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.250 
where the camera kind of follows the
ball<00:02:39.040> around<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:40.299> is<00:02:40.480> also<00:02:40.659> interesting

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
ball around this is also interesting

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.229 
ball around this is also interesting
though<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.860> don't<00:02:41.980> really<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.579> using<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:43.000> for

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
though I don't really like using it for

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.990 
though I don't really like using it for
you<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.540> actually<00:02:43.840> playing<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> game<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
you know actually playing the game the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.119 
you know actually playing the game the
control<00:02:49.359> is<00:02:49.540> good<00:02:49.750> though<00:02:50.140> blockades<00:02:50.709> doesn't

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
control is good though blockades doesn't

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.220 
control is good though blockades doesn't
support<00:02:51.459> an<00:02:51.670> analog<00:02:52.030> controller<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.079> have

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
support an analog controller so you have

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.520 
support an analog controller so you have
to<00:02:53.349> use<00:02:53.470> either<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.829> d-pad<00:02:54.340> or<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.790> mouse<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
to use either the d-pad or the mouse the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.199 
to use either the d-pad or the mouse the
d-pad<00:02:56.530> control<00:02:56.859> is<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.280> okay<00:02:57.609> as<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:58.090> might

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
d-pad control is just okay as you might

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.259 
d-pad control is just okay as you might
guess<00:02:58.560> there's<00:02:59.560> three<00:02:59.799> basic<00:02:59.980> setups<00:03:00.609> all<00:03:00.940> of

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
guess there's three basic setups all of

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.089 
guess there's three basic setups all of
which<00:03:01.420> involve<00:03:01.780> pressing<00:03:02.319> some<00:03:02.530> buttons<00:03:02.590> or<00:03:03.069> a

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
which involve pressing some buttons or a

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.039 
which involve pressing some buttons or a
combination<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.819> buttons<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.659> increase<00:03:05.019> your

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
combination of buttons to increase your

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.680 
combination of buttons to increase your
pedal<00:03:05.470> speed<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:06.190> two<00:03:06.489> or<00:03:06.790> three<00:03:07.180> times<00:03:07.420> normal

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
pedal speed to two or three times normal

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.710 
pedal speed to two or three times normal
for<00:03:08.290> when<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.530> really<00:03:08.769> need<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> move<00:03:09.129> quick

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
for when you really need to move quick

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.940 
for when you really need to move quick
one<00:03:10.720> thing<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.079> isn't<00:03:11.260> stated<00:03:11.739> in<00:03:11.859> the

one thing that isn't stated in the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.369 
one thing that isn't stated in the
manual<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.209> default<00:03:13.480> setup<00:03:13.840> uses<00:03:14.230> an

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
manual is that the default setup uses an

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.199 
manual is that the default setup uses an
automatic<00:03:14.980> scheme<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.579> controlling<00:03:16.120> your

automatic scheme for controlling your
pedal<00:03:16.540> speed<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.200> don't<00:03:17.799> really<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.370> as

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
pedal speed I don't really like this as

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.580 
pedal speed I don't really like this as
you<00:03:18.669> can<00:03:19.090> feel<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.450> pedal<00:03:19.750> speed<00:03:20.019> constantly

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
you can feel the pedal speed constantly

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.440 
you can feel the pedal speed constantly
adjusting<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:21.790> hard<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.060> get<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.209> feel

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
adjusting and it's hard to get a feel

adjusting and it's hard to get a feel
for<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.780> but<00:03:23.500> luckily<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.160> just<00:03:24.549> turn

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
for it but luckily you can just turn

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.240 
for it but luckily you can just turn
