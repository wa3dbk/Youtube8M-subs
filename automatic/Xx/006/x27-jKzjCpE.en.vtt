00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
last year to the B seat so this rear

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.750 
last year to the B seat so this rear
seat<00:02:24.660> pops<00:02:25.019> off<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.680> when<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.519> take<00:02:26.730> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
seat pops off and when you take that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220 
rear seat off there's a storage tray
that's<00:02:29.519> why<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.970> two-piece<00:02:30.300> seat<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.140> it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that's why it's a two-piece seat so it

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.229 
that's why it's a two-piece seat so it
gives<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> access<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.519> storage<00:02:32.940> tray

310 horsepower supercharged and their

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.490 
310 horsepower supercharged and their
cool<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.460> supercharger<00:02:52.330> will<00:02:52.570> reposition

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
cool the supercharger will reposition

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.430 
cool the supercharger will reposition
his<00:02:53.980> feet

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.460 

let's<00:02:59.280> eat<00:02:59.960> supercharged<00:03:00.960> intercooled<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
let's eat supercharged intercooled the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.700 
let's eat supercharged intercooled the
supercharger<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.430> right<00:03:02.940> down<00:03:03.180> here<00:03:03.630> low<00:03:04.350> and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
supercharger is right down here low and

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.950 
supercharger is right down here low and
it<00:03:04.800> runs<00:03:05.430> off<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.970> belts<00:03:06.390> there<00:03:06.630> runs<00:03:06.810> off

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
it runs off of the belts there runs off

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.570 
it runs off of the belts there runs off
of<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.170> drive<00:03:07.410> shaft<00:03:07.440> has<00:03:07.980> automatic

of the drive shaft has automatic

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
of the drive shaft has automatic
tensioner<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.210> have<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.420> worry<00:03:09.540> about

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
tensioner so you have to worry about

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.750 
tensioner so you have to worry about
adjusting<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:10.320> they<00:03:11.280> did<00:03:11.430> make<00:03:11.610> some

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
adjusting that they did make some

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.430 
adjusting that they did make some
changes<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.240> get<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.510> extra<00:03:12.720> 10<00:03:13.050> horsepower

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440

the oil cooler they crease the thrust on

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.730 
the oil cooler they crease the thrust on
these<00:03:31.890> by<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> hundred<00:03:32.640> pounds<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.690> thrust<00:03:33.870> to

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.830 

I<00:03:39.349> added<00:03:40.189> a<00:03:40.280> muffler<00:03:40.519> so<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.180> reduced<00:03:41.569> back

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
I added a muffler so that reduced back

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.979 
I added a muffler so that reduced back
pressure<00:03:42.170> plus<00:03:42.620> made<00:03:42.830> him<00:03:42.950> quieter<00:03:43.659> so<00:03:44.659> free

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
pressure plus made him quieter so free

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.350 
pressure plus made him quieter so free
or<00:03:45.110> flowing<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:46.819> know<00:03:46.879> we've<00:03:47.090> got<00:03:47.239> the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
or flowing you know we've got the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.630 
or flowing you know we've got the
supercharger<00:03:48.170> they<00:03:48.379> up<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.860> boost<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.610> the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
supercharger they up the boost on the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.970 
supercharger they up the boost on the
superchargers<00:03:50.390> messmate<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.019> low<00:03:51.170> wind<00:03:51.409> so

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
superchargers messmate the low wind so

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.949 
superchargers messmate the low wind so
it<00:03:52.040> has<00:03:52.189> really<00:03:52.489> great<00:03:52.730> crawler<00:03:53.090> response<00:03:53.629> and

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
it has really great crawler response and

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.780 
it has really great crawler response and
great<00:03:54.470> take<00:03:54.709> off<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.069> always<00:03:55.220> did
