00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
yard lengths of silly string and just

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.679 
yard lengths of silly string and just
tie<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.160> knot<00:00:17.660> around<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.619> end<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.920> cord<00:00:20.220> so

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.509 

it'll<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.050> little<00:00:25.680> bit<00:00:25.830> difficult<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
it'll be a little bit difficult to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.910 
it'll be a little bit difficult to
handle<00:00:26.849> at<00:00:27.150> first<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.199> gets<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> lot

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
handle at first but then it gets a lot

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
handle at first but then it gets a lot
easier<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:30.570> trying<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:32.600> just

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
easier so I just I'm trying and not just

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.549 
easier so I just I'm trying and not just
around<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> end<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> cord<00:00:34.969> and<00:00:36.350> then<00:00:37.350> what

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
around the end of the cord and then what

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.850 
around the end of the cord and then what
we're<00:00:37.680> gonna<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:39.200> twist<00:00:40.200> around<00:00:42.860> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
we're gonna do is just twist around the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.520 
we're gonna do is just twist around the
cord<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.649> just<00:00:46.649> twist<00:00:46.950> twist<00:00:47.280> twist<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.530> what

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
cord so just twist twist twist and what

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.860 
cord so just twist twist twist and what
we're<00:00:49.680> doing<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> wrapping<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.090> silly<00:00:51.449> string

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we're doing is wrapping the silly string

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.020 
we're doing is wrapping the silly string
around<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.329> cord<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.570> bunch<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.170> times<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
around the cord a bunch of times so you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.500 
around the cord a bunch of times so you
can<00:00:57.390> spiral<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.559> end<00:00:58.800> turn<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.670> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
can spiral down to one end turn it and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.800 
can spiral down to one end turn it and
twist<00:01:01.020> back<00:01:01.760> towards<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> other<00:01:03.030> end<00:01:04.040> and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
twist back towards the other end and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
twist back towards the other end and
you're<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.369> bunch<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you're just gonna do this a bunch of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:09.670 
you're just gonna do this a bunch of
times

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
times

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.460 
times
until<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.430> run<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.510> two<00:01:12.750> yards<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
until you run out of your two yards of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.940 
until you run out of your two yards of
silly<00:01:14.250> string<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.350> should<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.740> something

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
silly string so we should have something

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.840 
silly string so we should have something
that<00:01:17.100> looks<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.540> get-go<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
that looks like this in the get-go and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
that looks like this in the get-go and
then<00:01:20.850> I'll<00:01:21.180> come<00:01:21.390> back<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.020> whenever<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.590> am

then I'll come back to you whenever I am
at<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> end<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.610> silly<00:01:23.850> string<00:01:25.369> okay<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.430> I

have about this much left and what I'm
going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:31.530> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.340> wrap<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
going to do is just kind of wrap a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.480 
going to do is just kind of wrap a
little<00:01:32.909> bit<00:01:33.180> more<00:01:33.450> around<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:35.159> tie

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
little bit more around and then tie

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
little bit more around and then tie
what's<00:01:35.850> called<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.240> half<00:01:36.509> hitch<00:01:36.780> knot<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.619> I'm

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
what's called a half hitch knot so I'm

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.179 
what's called a half hitch knot so I'm
just<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> grab<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.810> portion<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.950> loop

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
just going to grab a portion of my loop

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.969 
just going to grab a portion of my loop
that<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.520> stringing<00:01:41.820> around<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:43.530> going

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that I'm stringing around and I'm going

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
that I'm stringing around and I'm going
to<00:01:44.009> bring<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> tail<00:01:45.119> end<00:01:45.450> through<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.439> loop

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to bring the tail end through that loop

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:58.070 
to bring the tail end through that loop
on<00:01:46.920> my<00:01:47.070> next<00:01:47.369> pass

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.760 

till<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.770> looks<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.760> that<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:01.290> what<00:02:01.650> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
till it looks like that so now what you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.760 
till it looks like that so now what you
can<00:02:01.800> do<00:02:02.130> since<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.730> silly<00:02:02.940> string<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.770> double

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
can do since the silly string is double

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.860 
can do since the silly string is double
threaded<00:02:05.190> is<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.120> feel<00:02:06.330> like<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.660> need<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
threaded is if you feel like you need to

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.540 
threaded is if you feel like you need to
tie<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> bit<00:02:07.380> more<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.770> secure<00:02:08.160> knot<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.520> can

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
tie a bit more of a secure knot you can

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.990 
tie a bit more of a secure knot you can
separate<00:02:09.210> those<00:02:09.450> plies<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.520> tie<00:02:11.520> another

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
separate those plies and tie another

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.860 
separate those plies and tie another
knot<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.780> opposite<00:02:13.260> side<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.870> separate

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
knot on the opposite side so separate

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.870 
knot on the opposite side so separate
the<00:02:15.990> plies<00:02:16.200> bring<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:16.920> around<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.460> side<00:02:17.700> and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
the plies bring one around one side and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.870 
the plies bring one around one side and
one<00:02:17.970> around<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.360> other<00:02:18.540> side<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:20.160> tie

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
one around the other side and then tie

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.930 
one around the other side and then tie
another<00:02:21.120> knot<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.010> could<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> spot<00:02:23.790> of

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
another knot so you could do a spot of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.550 
another knot so you could do a spot of
glue<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.300> knot<00:02:24.570> if<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.900> felt<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.260> it's

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
glue on the knot if you felt like it's

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.070 
glue on the knot if you felt like it's
necessary<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.310> make<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.700> more<00:02:26.850> secure<00:02:27.360> for

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
necessary to make it more secure for

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.960 
necessary to make it more secure for
demonstration<00:02:28.740> purposes<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> make<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
demonstration purposes and to make the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.960 
demonstration purposes and to make the
video<00:02:30.180> shorter<00:02:30.800> I'm<00:02:31.800> not<00:02:32.100> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.550> do<00:02:32.700> that

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
video shorter I'm not going to do that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.740 
video shorter I'm not going to do that
and<00:02:34.340> then<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.460> same<00:02:35.670> goes<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.510> leather

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and then the same goes for the leather

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.620 
and then the same goes for the leather
crimp<00:02:37.080> ends<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.560> I'm<00:02:37.680> going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.980> show<00:02:38.280> you

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
crimp ends that I'm going to show you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.980 
crimp ends that I'm going to show you
coming<00:02:39.630> up

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
coming up

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.890 
coming up
so<00:02:40.650> I've<00:02:40.980> done<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.520> section<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.450> square<00:02:42.690> knot

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
so I've done a section of a square knot

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.870 
so I've done a section of a square knot
I'm<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.350> do<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.800> second<00:02:44.250> part<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.700> that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
I'm going to do the second part of that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.260 
I'm going to do the second part of that
square<00:02:45.180> knot<00:02:45.360> now<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:50.760> course<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.180> you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
square knot now and of course if you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.940 
square knot now and of course if you
leave<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.630> tail<00:02:51.840> end<00:02:52.080> longer<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.800> gonna

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
leave the tail end longer it's gonna

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.920 
leave the tail end longer it's gonna
make<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.250> easier<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.390> course<00:02:54.570> want<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
make it easier but I of course want a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.230 
make it easier but I of course want a
challenge<00:02:57.350> there<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:58.530> go<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.820> can<00:03:00.000> trim

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
challenge there we go so you can trim

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.560 
challenge there we go so you can trim
those<00:03:00.420> tail<00:03:00.690> ends<00:03:00.960> down<00:03:02.060> works<00:03:03.060> better<00:03:03.300> if<00:03:03.480> you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
those tail ends down works better if you

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.210 
those tail ends down works better if you
have<00:03:03.660> scissors<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.440> wire<00:03:04.620> cutters<00:03:05.010> on

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
have scissors but I have wire cutters on

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.340 
have scissors but I have wire cutters on
hand<00:03:05.489> there<00:03:06.420> we<00:03:06.540> go<00:03:07.190> okay<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.489> we<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.720> piece

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
hand there we go okay so we have a piece

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.270 
hand there we go okay so we have a piece
of<00:03:10.730> wrapped<00:03:11.730> cord<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.480> looks<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.900> this

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
of wrapped cord that looks like this

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.580 
of wrapped cord that looks like this
what<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.400> going<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.820> now<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.270> take<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.959> cord

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
what I'm going to do now is take a cord

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250 
what I'm going to do now is take a cord
crimp<00:03:16.890> end<00:03:17.130> or<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.670> leather<00:03:17.910> primp<00:03:18.239> end<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
crimp end or a leather primp end that

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.979 
crimp end or a leather primp end that
has<00:03:19.500> these<00:03:20.130> parts<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:20.940> fold<00:03:21.270> over<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.630> then

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
has these parts that fold over and then

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.229 
has these parts that fold over and then
a<00:03:22.020> little<00:03:22.230> loop<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.830> other<00:03:22.860> side<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.120> I'm

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
a little loop on the other side so I'm

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.490 
a little loop on the other side so I'm
gonna<00:03:24.450> start<00:03:25.370> by<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:27.180> preparing<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.050> by

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
gonna start by just preparing that by

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
gonna start by just preparing that by
tilting<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:30.090> sides<00:03:30.390> inward<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.080> little<00:03:31.320> bit

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
tilting the sides inward a little bit

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.120 
tilting the sides inward a little bit
let's<00:03:32.520> see<00:03:32.700> if<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:33.030> zoom<00:03:35.600> there<00:03:36.600> or<00:03:37.470> focus<00:03:37.920> I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
let's see if I can zoom there or focus I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.479 
let's see if I can zoom there or focus I
mean<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.770> I'm<00:03:40.770> going<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.250> put

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
mean so just like that I'm going to put

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.760 
mean so just like that I'm going to put
my<00:03:41.610> cord<00:03:41.940> inside<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.140> could<00:03:43.290> add<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> spot

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
my cord inside and you could add a spot

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.650 
my cord inside and you could add a spot
of<00:03:43.920> glue<00:03:44.070> here<00:03:44.100> as<00:03:44.430> well<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.450> want

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
of glue here as well if you if you want

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.350 
of glue here as well if you if you want
to<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.140> don't<00:03:46.560> think<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:46.920> super<00:03:47.850> necessary

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
to I don't think it's super necessary

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.510 
to I don't think it's super necessary
for<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:49.110> particular<00:03:49.350> project<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.340> I'm

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
for this particular project that I'm

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.340 
for this particular project that I'm
doing<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.060> then<00:03:51.570> what<00:03:51.750> I'm<00:03:51.870> gonna<00:03:51.989> do<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.320> just

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
doing and then what I'm gonna do is just

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.759 
doing and then what I'm gonna do is just
work<00:03:52.800> those<00:03:53.370> folds<00:03:54.090> closed<00:03:54.600> by<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.230> taking

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
work those folds closed by just taking

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.800 
work those folds closed by just taking
my<00:03:55.860> chain<00:03:56.100> nose<00:03:56.280> pliers<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.880> pressing<00:03:57.420> them

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
my chain nose pliers and pressing them

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.580 
my chain nose pliers and pressing them
down<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> if<00:04:00.810> you've<00:04:00.959> never<00:04:01.140> done<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.530> before

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
down so if you've never done this before

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.830 
down so if you've never done this before
your<00:04:02.310> first<00:04:02.519> one's<00:04:02.790> probably<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.660> look

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
your first one's probably going to look

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.080 
your first one's probably going to look
not<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.680> greatest<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.640> might<00:04:05.760> be<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:05.940> good

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
not the greatest so it might be a good

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.510 
not the greatest so it might be a good
idea<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.450> practice<00:04:06.960> before<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.530> do<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
idea to practice before you do it on the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.830 
idea to practice before you do it on the
bracelet<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.000> you're<00:04:09.210> actually<00:04:09.690> making

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
bracelet that you're actually making

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.820 
bracelet that you're actually making
so<00:04:12.840> just<00:04:13.140> mush<00:04:13.380> mush<00:04:13.800> mush<00:04:14.070> until<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.830> are

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
so just mush mush mush until you are

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.220 
so just mush mush mush until you are
happy<00:04:17.220> with<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.790> shape<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.360> then<00:04:21.570> looks

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
happy with the shape so it then looks

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.310 
happy with the shape so it then looks
like<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:24.510> we're<00:04:24.660> gonna<00:04:24.750> do<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.110> same

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
like this and we're gonna do the same

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.490 
like this and we're gonna do the same
thing<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.010> other<00:04:26.040> side<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.970> I'm<00:04:27.060> going<00:04:27.300> to

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
thing to the other side so I'm going to

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.040 
thing to the other side so I'm going to
prepare<00:04:28.500> my<00:04:28.950> little<00:04:29.280> cord<00:04:29.910> crimp<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:30.900> by

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
prepare my little cord crimp just by

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.660 
prepare my little cord crimp just by
gently<00:04:31.730> pushing<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:34.440> ends<00:04:34.860> in<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.100> little<00:04:35.490> bit

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
gently pushing the ends in a little bit

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.970 
gently pushing the ends in a little bit
I'm<00:04:35.910> gonna<00:04:36.060> slide<00:04:36.420> my<00:04:36.450> cord<00:04:36.960> into<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.740> cord

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
I'm gonna slide my cord into the cord

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.600 
I'm gonna slide my cord into the cord
crimp<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.640> then<00:04:41.360> close<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.860> so<00:04:43.860> I'll<00:04:43.950> do<00:04:44.130> one

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
crimp and then close it so I'll do one
