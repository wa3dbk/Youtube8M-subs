00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.359
 drama in which he calls you and tells you that

 there is an opportunity for you to go to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.550
 talk after the mission of the crane 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.320
 Being can send you a message 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.059
 to do the job with the f 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.059
 Well here we are and listen 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 i 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.790
 do not 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 okay 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 efe 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.959
 welfare wants us to eliminate a 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.530
 type that is ruling to efe that is 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.940
 an American federation of products 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.050
 pharmacists 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.520
 this guy is 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.930
 came some pills that are 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.150
 obviously earn a lot of money but 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.260
 they have contraindications one of them 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.020
 is that it causes heart attacks to men of 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.720
 middle age that is causing deaths 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.970
 and he's making a lot of money 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.190
 well then we have to go to rich 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.440
 man that is a little bit far away 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.800
 more than a kilometer but good is not 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.010
 both there are sometimes 23 kilometers of travel 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.080
 and that does take a long time 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.060
 well told us lester that we could 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.280
 use sniper rifles or also 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.519
 we can use adhesive pumps is 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.530
 our choice but what the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.019
 percentage for 100% in this mission 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.980
 is the sniper shot is a 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.379
 Essential requirements. Indispensable requirements 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.569
 it's three points that he asks for but 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.430
 I'm going to tell you at a good time 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.489
 then let's go until they originate that this 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.030
 hotel that has a little name 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.030
 strange 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.700
 something like this is in the hotel von sternberg 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.920
 I called the guy I project 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.390
 well then we are already here in the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.390
 hotel now we go up 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.100
 up to the parking lot and we're going to 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.790
 get on the yellow mark 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.790
 we're here 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.290
 well then the guards arrived 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.170
 obviously it will be very sheltered 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.060
 because he is the CEO of a great company 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.010
 then a senior manager 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.150
 and says you have to have it until it's 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.430
 fast and a strategic place here is not 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.400
 recommended better we go for the second 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.919
 floor or the upper floor 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.450
 we have a minute and a half to do the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.989
 I work in a half minutes until 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.210
 leave the guy 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.860
 when he finishes the minute and a half he goes to 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.449
 leave and there we will take advantage to 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.759
 eliminate it but it has to be fast 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.529
 because that guy is going to escape too 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.629
 very fast 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.500
 well let's go around there we still have a 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.570
 minute 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.340
 good to do the strategy is not 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.490
 great thing just wait for it 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.740
 and let him come and kill him and then we 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.740
 we escape and so the mission is easy 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.360
 well then we are for the equals 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.360
 seconds is the security the cars 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.150
 and wait 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.990
 as I say it is a mandatory requirement 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.069
 for the breezes play mission but not what 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.759
 I had said before that's why I'm doing 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.759
 now 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.330
 then this vision is going to be the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.800
 mission blocking the mission well 24 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.800
 seconds and subtracting 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.210
 be it the guards installed in the 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.139
 cars for later 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.340
 be watched also so that the escort 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.340
 ten ten seconds 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.460
 and well you have to be ready 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.310
 ready we found the look we zoom 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:48.040
 we approach the look 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.940
 there is that kind of pink is and 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.650
 goodbye and now if we leave the area 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.900
 the edges have obviously alerted 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.160
 because there is a sniper we are 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.160
 us so we take off 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:04.110
 fortunately there are no policemen who do not 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.369
 you have seen you have to do radio 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.889
 also because if they do not see you later they 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:10.619
 they start shooting eyes they start you 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.990
 shoot 720 are going to shoot good is 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:14.670
 the vehicle 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.780
 any vehicle to exit 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.780
 quickly from the area 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.270
 and mission exceeded there is the bonus for 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:29.030
 sniper rifle and time 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.030
 inverted which is 3 44 in this case 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.889
 well you have 9,000 reward this is 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.889
 all right 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.560
 well we are marking the ester for 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.560
 tell him that the work has been done 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.810
 well there is a surprise for france 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.449

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:15.169
 finally if they give you and maybe it's 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.169

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.009
 there is angry direction and everything 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.830

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:29.330
 exclusive 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.770
 in my words 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.039
