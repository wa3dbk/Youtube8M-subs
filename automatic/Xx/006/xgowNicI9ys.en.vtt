00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
time to get the kinks worked out and

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.110 
time to get the kinks worked out and
that's<00:03:44.859> gonna<00:03:45.040> take<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.280> while<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.639> develop<00:03:45.760> if

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
that's gonna take a while to develop if

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.250 
that's gonna take a while to develop if
you<00:03:46.209> want<00:03:46.389> to<00:03:46.450> integrate<00:03:46.630> something<00:03:47.019> like
