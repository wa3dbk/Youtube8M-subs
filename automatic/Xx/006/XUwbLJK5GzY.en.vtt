00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.930
 after equipping the carriages between the 16th and the 19th century, then 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.800
 until the 1950s the strong antagonistic opening were 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.350
 still present on English taxis 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.670
 fallen into disuse will be rehabilitated words fly away which 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.840
 fright of a European regulation to make it work 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.120
 an originality that is now becoming obvious in terms of approval 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.420
 of use 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.550
 the opening angle of the doors earlier bring it to 80 4 degrees against 67 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.790
 degrees on conventional models 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.500
 to get out of the vehicle more easily even in a small space 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.160
 security has been one of the main concerns of 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.990
 engineers for the development of its reverse-opening doors she 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.190
 unfolds only from four kilometers an hour warnings at 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.750
 inadvertent opening conductor and that given automatically in case 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 accident 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.130
 in terms of design and presentation this second generation 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.540
 executives take over the progress made on the initiates 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.700
 ouyahia will be done 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.410
 evolution is impressive to say the least, according to his family 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.760
 compare the two generations of merida 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.570
 from 4 to 10:05 four vehicles sold the text for the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660
 again get away from the ministers 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.520
 to say that his direct competitors 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.950
 this trotter compact MPV saw his orders higher at a price more 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.520
 attractive 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.860
 the most remarkable progress concerns visibility on board 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.550
 the dashboard was washed away 8 centimeters down the amounts of 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 Windshields are inclined to 68 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.320
 not sure the meriva authorizes the adjustment of the driver's seat on a 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.540
 amplitude of 2,140 millimeters long and 65 millimeters high 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.430
 gr-certified seat production offers more retention under the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.699
 thighs as well as extra settings 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.609
 the electric parking brake and the positioning of the shifter in 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.379
 height have made it possible to build a modular flexrail console located between 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.509
 the foundation 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.999
 at the back it is possible to go from 3 to 2 places just 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.159
 fold the central part between the two seats both expelled 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.629
 laterally the seated 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.860
 for the time without charge so you can refuse a few inches 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:28.889
 in order to obtain 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.569
 more legroom 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.769
 in fact the spread in the low head 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 two storage spaces 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.169
 these more powerful engines appear in the image of the magnificat 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.379
 resumed the petrol port that emerges by sending itself 140 horses 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.439
 our trial version of three horses proves nicer than one of 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.969
 3 6 of 105 horses that replaces him 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.989
 at first it is associated with a mechanical transmission at 5 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.989
 reports but who will soon benefit from an automatic transmission 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.329
 this new turbocharged four-cylinder displays a 10% drop in its 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.789
 consumption and its CO2 emissions 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:06.859
 despite a 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.980
 850 meters respectively of 15% and 17% 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.639
 in return for such an economy of use this engine fire long 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.559
 at 130 kilometers per hour they are only three thousand rpm running 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:22.370
 2011 a version of ernst happel start-up will make their appearance
