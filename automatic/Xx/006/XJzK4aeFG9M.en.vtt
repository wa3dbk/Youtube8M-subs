hands on him back off again awake at the
moment<00:01:48.650> I'd<00:01:49.010> say<00:01:49.190> alex<00:01:49.520> has<00:01:49.640> slightly<00:01:49.880> got<00:01:50.090> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
moment I'd say alex has slightly got the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.650

edges<00:01:50.660> he's<00:01:51.020> got<00:01:51.410> one<00:01:51.620> head<00:01:51.830> kick<00:01:52.040> head<00:01:52.220> I

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
edges he's got one head kick head I

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.730 
edges he's got one head kick head I
think<00:01:53.660> he's<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:54.020> being<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.260> little<00:01:54.410> bit<00:01:54.590> more

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
think he's just being a little bit more

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.200
