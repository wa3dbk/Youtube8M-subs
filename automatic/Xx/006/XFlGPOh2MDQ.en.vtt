00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.279 

I'd<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.639> talk<00:00:14.910> about<00:00:14.969> articulation<00:00:15.870> jazz

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
I'd like to talk about articulation jazz

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.870 
I'd like to talk about articulation jazz
articulation<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> little<00:00:17.220> bit<00:00:17.340> now<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
articulation a little bit now this is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.910 
articulation a little bit now this is
something<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.270> find<00:00:18.570> myself<00:00:19.109> talking<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> lot

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
something I find myself talking to a lot

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.390 
something I find myself talking to a lot
of<00:00:19.949> students<00:00:20.699> about<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.869> think<00:00:22.400> particularly

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
of students about I think particularly

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.029 
of students about I think particularly
bebop<00:00:24.060> articulation<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.699> common

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
bebop articulation one of the the common

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.849 
bebop articulation one of the the common
misconceptions<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:30.019> is<00:00:31.019> swing<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
misconceptions is that is swing the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.590 
misconceptions is that is swing the
swing<00:00:32.099> feel<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.759> jazz<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.559> lot<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> people<00:00:35.600> when

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
swing feel and jazz a lot of people when

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990 
swing feel and jazz a lot of people when
they<00:00:36.690> first<00:00:36.870> learn<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.800> are<00:00:38.520> playing<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
they first learn and think are playing a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
they first learn and think are playing a
triplet<00:00:39.390> feel<00:00:39.800> regardless<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> tempo<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
triplet feel regardless of the tempo and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.740 
triplet feel regardless of the tempo and
I<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.790> what's<00:00:41.940> important<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> understand

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
I think what's important to understand

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.740 
I think what's important to understand
is<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.350> depending<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.610> tempo<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
is that depending on the tempo the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.440 
is that depending on the tempo the
triplet<00:00:46.140> feel<00:00:46.350> has<00:00:46.680> more<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.610> less<00:00:47.940> influence

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
triplet feel has more or less influence

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.619 
triplet feel has more or less influence
and<00:00:49.520> sort<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:52.280> traditional<00:00:53.360> sense<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and sort of the traditional sense of the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.990 
and sort of the traditional sense of the
groove<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> slower<00:00:56.399> tempo<00:00:56.699> you're

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
groove is that at a slower tempo you're

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.979 
groove is that at a slower tempo you're
playing<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.449> true<00:00:57.690> triplet<00:00:58.309> at<00:00:59.309> a<00:01:00.000> medium<00:01:00.539> tempo

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
playing a true triplet at a medium tempo

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.789 
playing a true triplet at a medium tempo
you're<00:01:01.800> sort<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> playing<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.609> between<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
you're sort of playing in between a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.899 
you're sort of playing in between a
straight<00:01:04.799> eighth<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> triplet<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
straight eighth and a triplet and at a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.670 
straight eighth and a triplet and at a
faster<00:01:06.330> tempo<00:01:06.659> you're<00:01:06.810> playing<00:01:07.200> straight

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
faster tempo you're playing straight

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.789 
faster tempo you're playing straight
okay<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.820> I'll<00:01:09.060> demonstrate<00:01:09.439> each<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.500> those

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
okay and I'll demonstrate each of those

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
okay and I'll demonstrate each of those
this<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.430> sort<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> blues

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
this so this is sort of this is a blues

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:53.649 
this so this is sort of this is a blues
at<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> slower<00:01:13.500> tempo

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.999 

now<00:01:54.659> I'm<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> jump<00:01:55.170> ahead<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.619> play<00:01:55.799> a

practice jazz eighth notes on the
saxophone<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.590> first<00:03:01.859> thing<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
saxophone the first thing is to get the

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.520 
saxophone the first thing is to get the
articulation<00:03:03.269> which<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.630> -<00:03:03.810> which<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.290> -

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
articulation which is - which is -

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.710 
articulation which is - which is -
tongue<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.549> up<00:03:05.730> beach<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.209> down<00:03:06.450> beats

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
tongue the up beach to the down beats

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.150 
tongue the up beach to the down beats
tah<00:03:07.049> tah<00:03:07.470> tah<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.569> is<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.840> tempo<00:03:10.170> tah<00:03:10.680> tah

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
tah tah tah so this is the tempo tah tah

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160 
tah tah tah so this is the tempo tah tah
tah<00:03:12.120> tah<00:03:12.180> tah<00:03:13.170> tah<00:03:13.739> tah<00:03:14.340> tah<00:03:14.940> tah<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:15.989> never

tah tah tah tah tah tah tah so you never
except<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.160> first<00:03:17.370> downbeat<00:03:17.819> you're

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
except for the first downbeat you're

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.220 
except for the first downbeat you're
never<00:03:18.239> tonguing<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.780> Dom<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.109> you're

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
never tonguing the Dom but you're

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.280 
never tonguing the Dom but you're
tonguing<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.590> upbeats<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:22.049> sounds

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
tonguing the upbeats and so it sounds

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.599 
tonguing the upbeats and so it sounds
like<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.859> I'm<00:03:22.920> going<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.130> play<00:03:23.280> I'm<00:03:23.430> not

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.330 
so how much now once you have that
tonguing<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.990> type<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.230> tonguing<00:04:15.800> together

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
tonguing that type of tonguing together

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.770 
tonguing that type of tonguing together
we<00:04:16.519> don't<00:04:16.760> have<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.030> think<00:04:17.150> about<00:04:17.330> it

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
we don't have to think about it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.710 
we don't have to think about it
then<00:04:18.170> we<00:04:18.500> introduce<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:20.209> triplet<00:04:20.570> feel

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
then we introduce the triplet feel

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.510 
then we introduce the triplet feel
depending<00:04:21.230> on<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.380> tempo<00:04:21.799> is<00:04:22.010> what<00:04:22.220> happens

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
depending on the tempo is what happens

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.240 
depending on the tempo is what happens
is<00:04:22.670> when<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.720> do<00:04:23.900> both<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.440> triplet<00:04:24.800> feel<00:04:24.980> and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
is when you do both the triplet feel and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.920 
is when you do both the triplet feel and
the<00:04:25.640> articulation<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:26.270> lot<00:04:26.420> of<00:04:26.540> younger

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
the articulation a lot of younger

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.720 
the articulation a lot of younger
students<00:04:27.320> particularly<00:04:27.680> have<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> hard<00:04:28.580> time

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
students particularly have a hard time

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.490 
students particularly have a hard time
coordinating<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:29.540> we'll<00:04:29.840> separate<00:04:30.320> out

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
coordinating that so we'll separate out

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.470 
coordinating that so we'll separate out
those<00:04:30.680> two<00:04:30.890> just<00:04:31.250> practice<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.730> articulation

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
those two just practice the articulation

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.600 
those two just practice the articulation
once<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.500> can<00:04:33.830> make<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.220> as<00:04:34.400> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
once you can make that as the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.630 
once you can make that as the
articulation<00:04:35.360> as<00:04:35.510> smooth<00:04:35.810> as<00:04:36.080> as<00:04:36.350> them<00:04:36.800> as<00:04:36.980> the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
articulation as smooth as as them as the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.909 
articulation as smooth as as them as the
slur<00:04:37.910> then<00:04:38.690> we'll<00:04:38.870> do<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.140> triplets<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.740> at<00:04:39.890> a

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
slur then we'll do the triplets so at a

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:54.730 
slur then we'll do the triplets so at a
slower<00:04:40.190> tempo<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:40.640> would<00:04:40.910> be<00:04:41.030> this<00:04:53.680> at<00:04:54.680> a

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
slower tempo that would be this at a

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:03.900 
slower tempo that would be this at a
medium<00:04:55.220> tempo<00:04:55.610> less<00:04:56.000> one<00:04:56.330> less<00:04:56.570> triply

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.520 

and<00:05:04.910> at<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.030> fast<00:05:05.330> tempo<00:05:05.660> we<00:05:05.810> play<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.320> same

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
and at a fast tempo we play the same

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:18.570 
and at a fast tempo we play the same
articulation<00:05:06.890> but<00:05:07.370> with<00:05:07.520> an<00:05:07.610> even<00:05:07.760> eighth<00:05:17.290> and

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
articulation but with an even eighth and

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.060 
articulation but with an even eighth and
so<00:05:19.580> by<00:05:20.090> practicing<00:05:20.350> articulations<00:05:21.350> separate

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
so by practicing articulations separate

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.280 
so by practicing articulations separate
at<00:05:22.190> first<00:05:22.490> from<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.060> triplet<00:05:23.420> field<00:05:23.630> then<00:05:24.140> we

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
at first from the triplet field then we

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.520 
at first from the triplet field then we
can<00:05:24.470> apply<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:25.520> swing<00:05:25.790> feel<00:05:26.030> as<00:05:26.330> as<00:05:26.690> is

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
can apply the swing feel as as is

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.100 
can apply the swing feel as as is
appropriate
