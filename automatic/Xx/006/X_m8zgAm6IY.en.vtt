way<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.479> you'll<00:01:36.869> load

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
way we have to do is now is you'll load

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.660 
way we have to do is now is you'll load
the<00:01:37.140> pictures<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> iPhoto<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.310> then

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the pictures up on the iPhoto and then

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
the pictures up on the iPhoto and then
sink<00:01:39.030> each<00:01:39.210> device<00:01:39.600> independently<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
sink each device independently you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.510 
sink each device independently you
physically<00:01:40.890> plug<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> into<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> computer

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
physically plug it into the computer

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.749 
physically plug it into the computer
would<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.600> nice<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.049> once<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.009> iphoto

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
would it be nice if once it's on iphoto

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
would it be nice if once it's on iphoto
you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.420> could<00:01:45.540> push<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:45.990> photos<00:01:46.439> or

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you know it could push those photos or

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.730 
you know it could push those photos or
do<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> manual<00:01:47.280> wireless<00:01:48.149> sync<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:49.290> our<00:01:49.439> devices

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
do a manual wireless sync to our devices

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.139 
do a manual wireless sync to our devices

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
for apps you know if you buy an app on

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.179 
for apps you know if you buy an app on
your<00:01:58.259> phone<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
your phone you know I have it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.350 
your phone you know I have it
automatically<00:01:59.579> show<00:01:59.790> up<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.939> iTunes<00:02:00.270> you

automatically show up in iTunes you
don't<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.780> sink<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.439> there

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
don't have to do that sink to get there

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.830 
don't have to do that sink to get there
or<00:02:01.649> vice<00:02:02.009> versa<00:02:02.399> backup<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:03.780> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
or vice versa backup would be kind of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.270 
or vice versa backup would be kind of
nice<00:02:03.990> too<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:04.619> might<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.920> little

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
nice too there might be a little

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.130 
nice too there might be a little
impractical<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.570> much<00:02:06.689> data<00:02:07.020> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
impractical just because so much data is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.229 
impractical just because so much data is
moving<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.280> may<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.209> over

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
moving you may not want it to go over

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.690 
moving you may not want it to go over
wireless<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:11.039> probably<00:02:11.280> want<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> have

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
wireless and you probably want to have

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.490 
wireless and you probably want to have
that<00:02:11.819> nice<00:02:12.060> secure<00:02:12.540> connection<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that nice secure connection to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.410 
that nice secure connection to
or<00:02:13.620> data<00:02:13.890> integrity<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.610> still<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.300> know<00:02:15.390> I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
or data integrity but still you know I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.850 
or data integrity but still you know I
actually<00:02:15.570> know<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> lot<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.080> people<00:02:16.200> who<00:02:16.590> never

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
actually know a lot of people who never

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.770 
actually know a lot of people who never
plug<00:02:17.250> their<00:02:17.430> device<00:02:17.700> into<00:02:18.210> their<00:02:18.360> computer

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
plug their device into their computer

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.990 
plug their device into their computer
they<00:02:18.960> only<00:02:19.650> backup<00:02:19.980> basically<00:02:20.670> when<00:02:20.820> there's

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
they only backup basically when there's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.300 
they only backup basically when there's
an<00:02:21.090> iOS<00:02:21.450> update<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.560> they<00:02:22.650> may<00:02:22.770> not<00:02:22.920> even<00:02:23.070> get

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
an iOS update and they may not even get

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580 
an iOS update and they may not even get
every<00:02:23.610> iOS<00:02:23.880> update<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:25.350> there's<00:02:25.500> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
every iOS update so I think there's a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.810 
every iOS update so I think there's a
lot<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.770> people<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.400> who<00:02:26.520> aren't<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
lot of people out there who aren't the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.880 
lot of people out there who aren't the
real<00:02:26.970> nerdy<00:02:27.210> types<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.990> are<00:02:28.140> always<00:02:28.380> plugging

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
real nerdy types and are always plugging

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.440 
real nerdy types and are always plugging
in<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.130> backing<00:02:29.490> up<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.970> know<00:02:30.090> taking

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
in and backing up and you know taking

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.480 
in and backing up and you know taking
doing<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.110> whole<00:02:31.260> sync<00:02:31.620> thing<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.070> our

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
doing that whole sync thing so our

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.250 
doing that whole sync thing so our
wireless<00:02:33.000> backup<00:02:33.209> might<00:02:33.570> be<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> nice<00:02:33.959> option

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
wireless backup might be a nice option

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.320 
wireless backup might be a nice option
you<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> keep<00:02:34.920> everybody<00:02:35.330> everybody's

in<00:03:00.060> consideration<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.780> how<00:03:00.810> much<00:03:00.959> data<00:03:01.260> you're

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
in consideration is how much data you're

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.380 
in consideration is how much data you're
actually<00:03:01.620> sending<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.910> might<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.209> to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
actually sending so this might have to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.030 
actually sending so this might have to
happen<00:03:03.540> over<00:03:03.870> Wi-Fi<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.709> some<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.920> these

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
happen over Wi-Fi you know some of these

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.440 
happen over Wi-Fi you know some of these
things<00:03:05.190> particularly<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.790> backup<00:03:06.239> could

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
things particularly a backup could

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.930 
things particularly a backup could
really<00:03:06.870> chew<00:03:07.080> through<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> 3g<00:03:08.190> data<00:03:08.430> plan<00:03:08.730> if

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
really chew through a 3g data plan if

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.890 
really chew through a 3g data plan if
you<00:03:09.030> don't<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.330> one<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.510> those<00:03:09.600> unlimited

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
you don't have one of those unlimited

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.080 
you don't have one of those unlimited
plans<00:03:10.350> also<00:03:10.860> might<00:03:11.160> be<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.520> slow<00:03:11.880> but

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
plans also might be a little slow but

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.970 
plans also might be a little slow but
some<00:03:12.630> certainly<00:03:12.930> could<00:03:13.050> go<00:03:13.170> over<00:03:13.260> 3g<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:13.860> i

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
some certainly could go over 3g so i

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.220 
some certainly could go over 3g so i
think<00:03:14.220> some<00:03:14.370> options<00:03:14.820> for<00:03:14.910> Wi-Fi<00:03:15.480> would<00:03:16.110> be

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
think some options for Wi-Fi would be

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.080 
think some options for Wi-Fi would be
pretty<00:03:16.470> nice<00:03:16.770> maybe<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.670> could<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.000> when

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
pretty nice maybe you could do it when

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.070 
pretty nice maybe you could do it when
you<00:03:18.180> walk<00:03:18.330> home<00:03:18.540> maybe<00:03:18.810> it'll<00:03:19.019> be

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
you walk home maybe it'll be

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.900 
you walk home maybe it'll be
automatically<00:03:19.620> sync<00:03:19.980> or<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.400> do<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.610> sink

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
automatically sync or just do the sink

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
automatically sync or just do the sink
when<00:03:21.090> you're<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.450> your<00:03:21.480> Wi-Fi<00:03:22.170> network<00:03:22.200> or

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
when you're on your Wi-Fi network or

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.430 
when you're on your Wi-Fi network or
maybe<00:03:23.070> even<00:03:23.160> utilize<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.780> back<00:03:25.230> to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
maybe even utilize the like the back to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.190 
maybe even utilize the like the back to

useful<00:04:23.280> where<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.479> got<00:04:24.599> appointments<00:04:25.200> set

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349

maybe mobile me maybe Dropbox you know
whatever<00:05:07.340> but<00:05:08.240> basically<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.900> way<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.440> take

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.500 
files and share them with in apps and
this<00:05:12.140> is<00:05:12.530> beyond<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.550> camera<00:05:13.970> roll<00:05:14.180> you
