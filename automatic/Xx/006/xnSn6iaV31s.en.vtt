00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
seamless and I think so many of us live

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.649 
seamless and I think so many of us live
lives<00:01:38.789> that<00:01:38.909> are<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.600> are

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
lives that are that are

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.410 
lives that are that are
compartmentalized<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> work<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.179> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
compartmentalized you work and then you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
compartmentalized you work and then you
you<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.170> family<00:01:43.350> life<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.039> you<00:01:44.220> have

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you have your family life and you have

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.249 
you have your family life and you have
your<00:01:45.060> hobbies<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> those<00:01:45.840> things<00:01:46.079> may<00:01:46.229> be

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
your hobbies and those things may be

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.169 
your hobbies and those things may be
compartmentalized<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.520> integrated<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
compartmentalized and not integrated it

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.260 
compartmentalized and not integrated it
in<00:01:48.270> any<00:01:48.450> big<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
in any big way and I think that one of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.789 
in any big way and I think that one of
the<00:01:51.360> difference<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.259> Catherine<00:01:52.619> de

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the difference is that the Catherine de

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.760 
the difference is that the Catherine de
me<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.630> speak<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> fact<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
me really speak to is the fact that it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.929 
me really speak to is the fact that it
really<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.549> whole<00:01:56.789> integrated<00:01:57.450> balanced

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
really is one whole integrated balanced
