00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the forefront and a really negative

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.619 
the forefront and a really negative
light<00:00:45.950> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> year<00:00:47.489> after<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.239> occurred

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
light in the year after that it occurred

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.319 
light in the year after that it occurred
but<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.149> was

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
but because of that and because this was

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
but because of that and because this was
something<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:52.129> just<00:00:53.129> shocked<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
something that really just shocked the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.220 
something that really just shocked the
community<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> terrible

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
community and was just a terrible

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.810 
community and was just a terrible
heinous<00:00:55.379> act<00:00:55.739> he<00:00:55.890> probably<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.610> be

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
heinous act he probably will not be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.540 
heinous act he probably will not be
allowed<00:00:57.180> entry<00:00:58.109> into<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> WWE<00:00:58.770> Hall<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> Fame

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
people out there that are on the fence

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.200 
people out there that are on the fence
about<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.020> happened<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.560> night

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
about what really happened that night

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.929 
about what really happened that night
with<00:01:18.210> Benoit<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> his<00:01:18.869> family<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.820> early<00:01:20.820> at

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
with Benoit and his family and early at

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.210 
with Benoit and his family and early at
this<00:01:21.090> point<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.799> anyone's<00:01:23.130> ever

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this point I don't think anyone's ever

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
this point I don't think anyone's ever
going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.580> fully<00:01:23.790> satisfied<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.420> what

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
going to be fully satisfied with what

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.230 
going to be fully satisfied with what
they<00:01:24.900> discover<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they discover but because of that I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
they discover but because of that I
really<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.990> Vince<00:01:28.320> McMahon<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.740> going

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
really think that Vince McMahon is going

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.850 
really think that Vince McMahon is going
to<00:01:29.460> try<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> avoid<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:31.170> would<00:01:31.320> potentially

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to try to avoid what would potentially

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.359 
to try to avoid what would potentially
be<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.189> media<00:01:33.079> just<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.200> media<00:01:34.500> catastrophe<00:01:35.250> if

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
be a media just a media catastrophe if

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.469 
be a media just a media catastrophe if
they<00:01:35.490> were<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> allow<00:01:35.939> him<00:01:36.090> into<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> Hall<00:01:36.450> of

wrestling<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:10.830> had<00:02:11.160> very

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
wrestling but they all had very

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.930 
wrestling but they all had very
careers<00:02:12.140> they<00:02:12.500> were<00:02:12.560> very<00:02:12.980> big<00:02:13.190> stars<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.610> WCW

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
careers they were very big stars in WCW

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.690 
careers they were very big stars in WCW
and<00:02:14.540> they<00:02:15.020> were<00:02:15.080> moderate<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.130> big<00:02:16.310> stars<00:02:16.580> in

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
and they were moderate to big stars in

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.330 
and they were moderate to big stars in
the<00:02:16.910> WWE<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:18.950> think<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.190> his

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
the WWE so I really think that his

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.500 
the WWE so I really think that his
accomplishments<00:02:20.030> should<00:02:20.120> really<00:02:20.360> take

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
accomplishments should really take

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.540 
accomplishments should really take
precedent<00:02:21.140> over<00:02:21.170> what<00:02:21.590> happened<00:02:21.980> considering

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
precedent over what happened considering

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.100 
precedent over what happened considering
the<00:02:22.640> WWE<00:02:23.150> Hall<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.300> Fame<00:02:23.510> should<00:02:23.750> be<00:02:23.900> a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the WWE Hall of Fame should be a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.440 
the WWE Hall of Fame should be a
representation<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:25.250> what<00:02:25.700> he<00:02:25.850> was<00:02:25.970> able<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.240> do

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
representation of what he was able to do

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.560 
representation of what he was able to do
while<00:02:27.230> he<00:02:27.260> had<00:02:27.980> his<00:02:28.280> wrestling<00:02:28.820> career<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.450> of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
while he had his wrestling career and of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.890 
while he had his wrestling career and of
course<00:02:30.100> because<00:02:31.100> WCW<00:02:31.790> no<00:02:31.880> longer<00:02:32.210> exists

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
course because WCW no longer exists

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.440 
course because WCW no longer exists
yeah<00:02:33.380> there's<00:02:33.680> no<00:02:33.860> WCW<00:02:34.550> Hall<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.880> Fame<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.300> him

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
yeah there's no WCW Hall of Fame for him

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.970 
yeah there's no WCW Hall of Fame for him
to<00:02:35.570> be<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> part<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.140> because<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.770> his

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
to be a part of because of his

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.500 
to be a part of because of his
accomplishments<00:02:37.580> there<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:38.240> pretty

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
accomplishments there so it's pretty

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.860 
accomplishments there so it's pretty
much<00:02:38.950> WWE<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.190> nothing<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:41.300> my<00:02:41.450> personal

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
much WWE or nothing in my personal

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.840 
much WWE or nothing in my personal
opinion<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.410> think<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.920> his<00:02:43.160> accomplishments

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
opinion I think that his accomplishments

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.000 
opinion I think that his accomplishments
do<00:02:44.030> precede<00:02:44.420> him<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.870> he<00:02:45.350> should<00:02:45.620> be<00:02:45.740> allowed

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
do precede him and he should be allowed

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.070 
do precede him and he should be allowed
in<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.400> Hall<00:02:46.580> however<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.690> should<00:02:47.930> be<00:02:47.959> noted

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
in the Hall however it should be noted

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.250 
in the Hall however it should be noted
or<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.280> should<00:02:49.550> be<00:02:49.790> kind<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.330> realized<00:02:50.900> that

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
or it should be kind of realized that

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.830 
or it should be kind of realized that
it's<00:02:51.680> based<00:02:52.220> purely<00:02:52.670> upon<00:02:53.180> what<00:02:53.510> he<00:02:53.630> did

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
it's based purely upon what he did

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.590 
it's based purely upon what he did
inside<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> wrestling<00:02:54.680> ring<00:02:55.300> sometimes<00:02:56.300> a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
inside a wrestling ring sometimes a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.860 
inside a wrestling ring sometimes a
person's<00:02:57.290> actions<00:02:58.270> outside<00:02:59.270> of<00:02:59.630> the

wrestling ring or outside the sports
circle<00:03:01.820> kind<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.300> take<00:03:02.480> precedent<00:03:03.020> over<00:03:03.110> what

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
circle kind of take precedent over what

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.160 
circle kind of take precedent over what
happened<00:03:03.770> inside<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.180> ring<00:03:05.420> inside<00:03:05.690> the

baseball diamond on the field of play
and<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:09.380> think<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.770> sometimes<00:03:10.010> where<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
and I think that sometimes where the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.120 
and I think that sometimes where the
Hall<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.090> Fame<00:03:11.390> kind<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.870> has<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> little<00:03:12.950> bit<00:03:13.010> of

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
Hall of Fame kind of has a little bit of

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.840 
Hall of Fame kind of has a little bit of
a<00:03:13.190> gray<00:03:13.400> area<00:03:13.640> sometimes<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:15.440> not<00:03:15.769> always<00:03:16.190> I

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
a gray area sometimes it's not always I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.699 
a gray area sometimes it's not always I
mean<00:03:17.450> Babe<00:03:17.660> Ruth<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:17.989> in<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.200> Baseball<00:03:18.590> Hall
