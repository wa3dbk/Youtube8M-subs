00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
should and so when I was the reading

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.100 
should and so when I was the reading
this<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.890> knew<00:04:43.850> what<00:04:44.210> was<00:04:44.330> meant<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.720> happen<00:04:44.750> and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
this I knew what was meant to happen and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.450 
this I knew what was meant to happen and
what's<00:04:45.260> happened<00:04:45.620> instead<00:04:46.010> and<00:04:46.190> for<00:04:46.340> me<00:04:46.430> that

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
what's happened instead and for me that

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.740 
what's happened instead and for me that
was<00:04:46.640> great<00:04:46.970> because<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:47.330> was<00:04:47.420> really

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
was great because it was really

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.540 
was great because it was really
interesting<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.200> see<00:04:48.500> that<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.860> how<00:04:49.280> Mark

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
interesting to see that and how Mark

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.290 
interesting to see that and how Mark
Millar<00:04:49.730> thinks<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:50.060> would<00:04:50.150> have<00:04:50.270> changed

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
Millar thinks it would have changed

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.420 
Millar thinks it would have changed
because<00:04:50.780> supernus<00:04:51.320> around<00:04:51.590> don't<00:04:52.220> let<00:04:52.370> that

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
because supernus around don't let that

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.920 
because supernus around don't let that
put<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.640> off<00:04:52.730> though<00:04:52.970> if<00:04:53.180> you're<00:04:53.480> not<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.750> big

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
know that much about them it moves on

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.500 
know that much about them it moves on
pretty<00:05:07.070> quickly<00:05:07.310> it's<00:05:07.610> all<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.850> Stalin<00:05:08.360> era

pretty quickly it's all the Stalin era

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.360 
pretty quickly it's all the Stalin era
as<00:05:09.020> era<00:05:09.410> era<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.810> just<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.530> for<00:05:13.010> me<00:05:13.130> it

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
as era era so it is just it for me it

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.770 
as era era so it is just it for me it
enhanced<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:13.940> experience<00:05:14.000> because<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.630> did

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
enhanced the experience because I did

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.210 
enhanced the experience because I did
have<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.020> awareness<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:15.740> artwork<00:05:16.040> is

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220
