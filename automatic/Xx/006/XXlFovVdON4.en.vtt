00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:48.500
 20 percent on the cream start

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.950
 amount of sour cream to 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.170
 the reception was thick and some less needed 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.700
 they grab faster and cream it 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.210
 should less in volume to cream 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.310
 thickened 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.620
 on the back of the instructions 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.310
 written much of this bag is necessary 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.700
 besides 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.470
 liter sour cream so it thickens but I 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.920
 usually look at the consistency itself 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.140
 cream 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.400
 Well we put in our sour cream 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.400
 thickener and we will beat 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.480
 run 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.110
 he begins to blur the secret begins by 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.740
 step 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.340
 beat a minute or two 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.340
 maybe 4 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.270
 look here the cream immediately thickened 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.070
 look the longer you beat it 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.110
 the more to miss but do not forget 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.750
 more than four minutes 5 do not need this 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.670
 usually do in a minute he is already very 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.200
 thick if you looked you long 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.150
 beat it does not thicken 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.860
 add more of this 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.320
 thickener smetannogo means some 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.860

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.890
 It was 700 grams of sour cream I put 4 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.260
 bags of thickener though on each 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.840

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.610

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.220
 thick cream 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.240
 keep in mind a little after 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.790
 thickener it changes like this 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.620
 be I do not know how to explain try 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.360

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.760
 what else is there besides sour cream? 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.620
 like this and this cream is good because 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.690
 You can shoot down without a mixer if you do not have 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.580
 mixer or hand no mixer 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.860
 sour cream with powdered sugar can 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.660
 operate stir spoon and thickener 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.880
 just quickly-quickly stir the spoon to him 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.890
 all the same for the goose is not what nonsense 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.860
 drowned out and not due to the mixer but for 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.860
