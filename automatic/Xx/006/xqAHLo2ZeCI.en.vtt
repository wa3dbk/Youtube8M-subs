transformation the next few years is

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.019 
transformation the next few years is
going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.890> very<00:00:19.920> tough<00:00:20.310> food<00:00:20.490> industry

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
going to be very tough food industry

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.170 
going to be very tough food industry
this<00:00:21.570> year<00:00:21.840> alone<00:00:21.869> there<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:22.939> 400<00:00:23.939> new

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
aircraft that are coming out from Boeing

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.509 
aircraft that are coming out from Boeing
and<00:00:26.820> Airbus<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.449> another<00:00:28.410> 400<00:00:29.160> next<00:00:29.400> year

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and Airbus and another 400 next year

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.490 
and Airbus and another 400 next year
that's<00:00:29.670> 800<00:00:30.449> new<00:00:30.630> aircraft<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.199> terms<00:00:31.410> of

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that's 800 new aircraft in terms of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.530 
that's 800 new aircraft in terms of
capacity<00:00:31.769> most<00:00:32.669> people<00:00:33.059> would<00:00:33.210> argue<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
capacity most people would argue that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.000 
capacity most people would argue that
this<00:00:33.809> new<00:00:34.020> aircraft<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
this new aircraft are going out to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.819 
this new aircraft are going out to
replace<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.850> existing<00:00:35.969> ones<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.829> therefore

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
replace the existing ones and therefore

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
replace the existing ones and therefore
they're<00:00:38.010> not<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.399> new<00:00:38.700> additions<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
they're not really new additions but the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.530 
they're not really new additions but the
reality<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> older<00:00:41.730> aircraft<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.329> not

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
reality is the older aircraft will not

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.860 
reality is the older aircraft will not
be<00:00:42.800> turned<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:44.040> scrap<00:00:44.430> metal<00:00:44.719> somebody<00:00:45.719> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
be turned into scrap metal somebody is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
be turned into scrap metal somebody is
going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.200> buy<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> someone's<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
going to buy them and someone's going to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
going to buy them and someone's going to
fly<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.289> therefore<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.440> remain

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
fly them and therefore they will remain

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.459 
fly them and therefore they will remain
in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> capacity<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.199> more

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
in the capacity so as there are more

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
in the capacity so as there are more
aircraft<00:00:53.010> flying<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.270> intensity<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
aircraft flying there is intensity of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
aircraft flying there is intensity of
competition<00:00:55.980> ASEAN<00:00:56.520> roadmap<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.239> terms<00:00:57.480> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
what it means is there is an intensity

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.730 
what it means is there is an intensity
of<00:01:29.729> competition<00:01:30.390> brewing

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740

core because it talks about the

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.979 
core because it talks about the

five-star idea in terms of product and
service<00:02:12.260> by<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.829> is<00:02:12.980> not<00:02:13.160> stopping<00:02:13.549> right

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819

part<00:04:46.790> of<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.090> change<00:04:47.390> I<00:04:47.660> do<00:04:48.050> believe<00:04:48.440> most

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
part of this change I do believe most

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.380 
part of this change I do believe most
people<00:04:48.950> would<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.610> be<00:04:49.730> witnessing<00:04:50.210> and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
people would like to be witnessing and

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.900 
people would like to be witnessing and
if<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.230> find<00:04:51.920> a<00:04:52.040> group<00:04:52.250> of<00:04:52.370> people<00:04:52.730> who<00:04:52.790> are

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
if you find a group of people who are

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.540 
if you find a group of people who are
winning<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.480> making<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.930> change<00:04:54.370> you're<00:04:55.370> not

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
winning and making the change you're not

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.910 
winning and making the change you're not
part<00:04:55.790> of<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:55.970> you'll<00:04:56.480> feel<00:04:56.750> isolated

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
part of that you'll feel isolated

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.020 
part of that you'll feel isolated
eventually<00:04:57.920> you<00:04:58.130> will<00:04:58.220> become<00:04:58.580> one<00:04:58.760> of<00:04:58.790> them

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
eventually you will become one of them

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.540 
eventually you will become one of them
and<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.810> think<00:04:59.870> there<00:05:00.200> is<00:05:00.350> a<00:05:00.380> huge<00:05:00.800> groundswell

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
and I think there is a huge groundswell

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.300 
and I think there is a huge groundswell
of<00:05:02.060> support<00:05:02.330> within<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.140> belief<00:05:03.740> that<00:05:04.010> we<00:05:04.130> can

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
of support within and belief that we can

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.740 
of support within and belief that we can
do<00:05:04.490> more<00:05:05.090> than<00:05:05.150> we<00:05:05.450> have<00:05:05.600> done<00:05:05.630> before<00:05:07.750> the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
do more than we have done before the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.830 
do more than we have done before the
