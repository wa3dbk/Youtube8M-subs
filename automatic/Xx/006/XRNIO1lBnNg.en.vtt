might<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.900> true<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.009> indeed

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
might not be true but if it is indeed

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
might not be true but if it is indeed
May<00:01:23.850> nineteenth<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> lot<00:01:25.020> longer<00:01:25.200> than

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
May nineteenth that is a lot longer than

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.109 
May nineteenth that is a lot longer than
we<00:01:25.590> thought<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.920> would<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.000> be

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
we thought it would be and it will be

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.819 
we thought it would be and it will be
interesting<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.780> how<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.320> fill<00:01:28.619> this

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
interesting to see how they fill this

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249 
interesting to see how they fill this
gap<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.340> between<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
gap in between now and then with the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.840 
gap in between now and then with the
content<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.799> destiny<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> lot

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
content in destiny because I know a lot

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
content in destiny because I know a lot
of<00:01:33.000> people<00:01:33.060> might<00:01:33.509> start<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.990> leave<00:01:34.170> now<00:01:34.470> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of people might start to leave now it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.260 
of people might start to leave now it's
also<00:01:34.799> interesting<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.490> note<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> images

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
also interesting to note that the images

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
also interesting to note that the images
of<00:01:36.479> armor<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.470> show<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of armor that we do have show that the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.609 
of armor that we do have show that the
light<00:01:38.280> level<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:38.729> goes<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> 39<00:01:39.689> meaning

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
light level now goes up to 39 meaning

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.340 
light level now goes up to 39 meaning
you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.979> get<00:01:41.130> up<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> level<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.939> 34<00:01:42.899> which

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you can get up to the level of 34 which

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380 
you can get up to the level of 34 which
is<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.799> suspected<00:01:44.430> anyway<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.270> only

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
is what we suspected anyway not only

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
is what we suspected anyway not only
that<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.750> armor<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.920> higher

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that the armor that we do have is higher

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
that the armor that we do have is higher
than<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> current<00:01:47.850> raid<00:01:48.149> level<00:01:48.479> now<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> also

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
than the current raid level now it also

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
than the current raid level now it also
brings<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> question<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> recent

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
