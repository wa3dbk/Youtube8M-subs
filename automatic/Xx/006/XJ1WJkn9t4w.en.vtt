mention I added some more decals to the
body<00:05:31.379> now<00:05:32.039> guys<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.610> like<00:05:32.879> the<00:05:33.060> design<00:05:33.389> I<00:05:33.419> did

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 
body now guys I like the design I did

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.570 
body now guys I like the design I did
but<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.259> my<00:05:34.409> opinion<00:05:34.860> it<00:05:35.009> turned<00:05:35.219> out<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.370> little

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
but in my opinion it turned out a little

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.909 
but in my opinion it turned out a little
bit<00:05:35.819> too<00:05:36.029> simple<00:05:36.569> so<00:05:36.629> with<00:05:37.289> these<00:05:37.529> tribal

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
bit too simple so with these tribal

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.640 
bit too simple so with these tribal
flames<00:05:38.400> I<00:05:38.789> think<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.539> added<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:39.900> finishing

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
flames I think it added that finishing

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.519 
flames I think it added that finishing
touch<00:05:40.919> that<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.699> body<00:05:42.120> needed<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.349> was

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
touch that this body needed and that was

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.289
