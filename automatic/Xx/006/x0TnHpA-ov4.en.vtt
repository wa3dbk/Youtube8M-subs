00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
the difference when it when it's even

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.720 
the difference when it when it's even
it's<00:03:37.540> not<00:03:37.599> too<00:03:37.900> cold<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.500> green<00:03:38.769> apple<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.370> in

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.039 
this case I think a lot of tropical
fruit<00:03:41.230> comes<00:03:41.470> out<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.489> that's<00:03:42.700> because

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
fruit comes out and that's because

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.119 
fruit comes out and that's because
