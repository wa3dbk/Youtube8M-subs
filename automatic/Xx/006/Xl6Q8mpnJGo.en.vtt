00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.540
 staff speaks all that fábio luiz ce 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.789
 es todos - the video this time a tip 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.179
 Galley a configuration a PC game 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:18.720
 What a show for you, good. 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.600
 turn everything fine and right between the streets 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
 is less than 3 thousand and that is already 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 very good because we are going to give everybody 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.600
 through three thousand excuses of the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 Tremendous because I'm recording. 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.399
 by cell phone but will start first 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.239
 with the galley processor 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.179
 The processor is the part that loads the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.460
 textures of the game or be it 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.100
 processes eg ground knows the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.499
 textures to give for example the wall by 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
 animal will deter that the full wall knows 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.059
 it does not look like a player plays cd 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.249
 texture and such and if there is a processor 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.870
 slow it will end your bottleneck 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:56.159
 video card that the rooster is when the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.510
 video card that is stronger than 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:04.019
 processor and then ends up giving a lot of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.229
 law in this business of loading textures 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.180
 besides the fps drops a lot then I 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.090
 I recommend a processor that is very good 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.759
 and do not drop the setting that displays 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 more to follow and that I found great 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.770
 Even today it is good, despite being a medium. 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:28.740
 Diguinho that is to focus here amd 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:31.560
 phenom 2 x 4 945 in 3 ghz 888 average of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.109
 cash he is quad core né 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.450
 It's very good, I recommend it. 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.210
 gives bottleneck and did not configure itself as it is 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.570
 then I will say that kospi is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.359
 it's very worth it if you want 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.909
 make one if you let stott that I do not 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.500
 I recommend you use the trailer and if you 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 want to overclock what I 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.070
 I recommend because to improve still 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 more that despite being good this way 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.520
 knows it's not so good that a cost 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.649
 benefit 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.109
 so if you want to make it better pass 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.549
 of 3 df hsd package is very simple to speak 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:07.409
 na bios will increase 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.659
 and to do this recommended cooler 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.800
 custom made reaping spoons bought in 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.270
 your necklace box 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.990
 What I'm using now 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.090
 is a box on the channel is the blizzard of 2010 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.180
 was a cooler do not worry too much 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.890
 good it is stopped in the range of 50 reais in 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.970
 free market at all prices of the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.970
 subscription 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.010
 He is very very good, he leaves the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.010
 overclock overclock 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.170
 of three good and good garrett packs 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.840
 It does not make it hot very good. 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.080
 memory guys I recommend at least 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.690
 eight gigas what is the configuration of the case 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.480
 I bought a very good memory and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:53.260
 cheap call to ip ex-blur r 3,600 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.860
 mhz it's r 3 mil 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.800
 Obviously it's a victory for me. 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.130
 in 2013 when you will not 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.660
 buy ddr2 memory to play games 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.170
 I think or to subscribe to 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.690
 a wall of two meters reaching 64 more 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.490
 anyway it's a very good memory 8gb of mine 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.780
 belly of games from here this is very 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:22.240
 good blue basic model knew very fast 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.750
 very recommended guys and cheap 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.290
 I bought one to ones and barracuda 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.020
 fifth giga is 7th bpm prison in buy 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.730
 a cheap hd 500 7,200 may be 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.570
 want but the price of avoiding 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.320
 inscription is recorded one has always used in 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.720
 sony and 24 w ne nor things should only 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.720
 receive even blur and simple or not 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:52.390
 just to run and despite dvd and two cds 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:55.600
 dvds are dead but going will you 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.430
 It's accurate if it holds, but if it does not 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.170
 want to buy without using force without 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.700
 need to buy this, too. 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.830
 improve the political cost these things 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.740
 there a recorder but I think they know the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.380
 It pays to have a few things. 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.140
 motherboard, this motherboard is very 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.140
 good is a punch of the most cost effective 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.150
 this setting show that the white 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.420
 case there are 18 people is very good 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.090
 highly recommended 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.360
 it was because she accepts crossfire or two 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.540
 plaquinhas goes m3 more you ever 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.950
 updated software that it supports until 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.920
 32 gb of chicago ram 354 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.980
 so guys coming back 30 days even me 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.320
 I just went check it out and it's 32 gigabytes and about 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:59.360
 1.800 mhz and memory as our guide in the 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:05:02.270
 case of 1.600 already to usb 3.0 which is very 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.330
 good and costs only 300 reais people with 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.810
 300 reais if it's a cause for your daughter 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.050
 which is three more real and with the mother to see and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:23.810
 It's very good, but I'll make a very good mark. 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:25.310
 Brazilian of 15 of the bits but I'm going more 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.970
 her name will have all the discretion and 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:41.140
 preston 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:41.140
 source cet x850 very good has 159 8011 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:55.160
 model the china she pays the cost 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:57.350
 and supports fire and configuration 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:03.080
 multilaser 25 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:16.810
 he was cool just to have another thousand 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:16.810
 five hundred very good 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:32.660
 two are two safaris 78 72 70 that 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.900
 I Boot Mode Crossfire Galley with 2 770 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.970
 you turn the x 3 key on the tse 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:42.290
 everything is is Kurdish about this theme in your 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:45.470
 performance goes to titan and that of r 9 and 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.990
 r 9 and x of the new gm gave performance 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.850
 cheating for pink that are two plates 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.350
 middle of the past generation who was uncle 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:59.060
 from media to top of media to top 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:01.460
 in the raem almost and in nursery is very 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.110
 Recomendadissimo cool and I think that 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.180
 I wanted to show the galley 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.840
 O I'm not an office that my 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.250
 the old office that there is a 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.289
 medley chips corp 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.699
 but I 'm going tomorrow in a store that 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.520
 the need to buy a cabinet 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:19.580
 because that old one there knows 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.870
 I did not like very tight things then 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.180
 I can not give cabinet advice but 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.479
 I can demonstrably cheap 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.500
 to bear the things that give milk of - 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:29.750
 movement because I 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.639
 with money left over then you can 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.460
 Do you want to realize the cost benefit? 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:35.990
 there is a great configuration not 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.960
 worth every penny spent on that 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.669
 very good configuration is hopefully 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.699
 have enjoyed a link on the river 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.990
 if possible from your favorites I hope 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.900
 have enjoyed 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:50.289
 thanks, and even check out others 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.289
