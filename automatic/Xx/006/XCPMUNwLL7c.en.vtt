the<00:00:42.149> hay<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.780> dependent<00:00:43.140> upon<00:00:43.260> the

the hay that we get dependent upon the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
the hay that we get dependent upon the
cutting<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:44.430> long<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.270> he'll

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
cutting can be too long and then he'll

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.830 
cutting can be too long and then he'll
spit<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.340> we've<00:00:47.579> found<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.660> we

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
spit it out so we've found that if we

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.529 
spit it out so we've found that if we
cut<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> hay<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.730> he<00:00:51.000> didn't<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.390> as
