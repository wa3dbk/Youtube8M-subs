00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
to playing spin bowling I think I think

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.420 
to playing spin bowling I think I think
I'd<00:00:25.700> be<00:00:25.790> positive<00:00:26.330> against<00:00:26.689> spin<00:00:27.250> there's<00:00:28.250> no

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
I'd be positive against spin there's no

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.980 
I'd be positive against spin there's no
doubt<00:00:28.700> that<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.000> best<00:00:29.210> players<00:00:29.510> are<00:00:29.660> spin<00:00:29.900> of

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
doubt that the best players are spin of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.390 
doubt that the best players are spin of
the<00:00:30.020> Asian<00:00:30.380> players<00:00:30.680> because<00:00:31.099> they<00:00:31.189> brought

the Asian players because they brought

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
up on it and they brought up on wickets

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.130 
up on it and they brought up on wickets
that<00:00:33.170> turn<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:34.640> certainly<00:00:35.450> looking<00:00:35.750> at<00:00:35.870> some

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.300 
players especially going really struggle
on<00:00:42.110> those<00:00:42.290> wiki's<00:00:42.620> because<00:00:42.800> they're<00:00:42.920> not<00:00:43.040> used

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
on those wiki's because they're not used

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.400 
on those wiki's because they're not used
to<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:43.489> type<00:00:43.730> of<00:00:43.910> surface<00:00:44.329> we're<00:00:45.140> used<00:00:45.320> to

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
to that type of surface we're used to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.250 
to that type of surface we're used to
green<00:00:45.649> same<00:00:45.980> as<00:00:46.160> here<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.489> nip<00:00:46.640> around<00:00:46.970> them

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
green same as here that nip around them

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.080 
green same as here that nip around them
and<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:48.350> think<00:00:48.590> I<00:00:48.710> think<00:00:48.949> with<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.460> Asians<00:00:49.940> it's

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
and I think I think with the Asians it's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.610 
and I think I think with the Asians it's
about<00:00:50.300> getting<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.690> bat<00:00:50.870> out<00:00:51.050> in<00:00:51.079> front<00:00:51.440> of

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
about getting the bat out in front of

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.439 
about getting the bat out in front of
the<00:00:51.710> pad<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.550> they're<00:00:52.670> never<00:00:52.789> getting<00:00:52.969> caught

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
the pad so they're never getting caught

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.270 
the pad so they're never getting caught
tight<00:00:54.050> in<00:00:54.230> here<00:00:54.469> where<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:54.679> can<00:00:54.800> give<00:00:54.890> catches

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
tight in here where you can give catches

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.250 
tight in here where you can give catches
to<00:00:55.399> short<00:00:55.670> leg<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.030> silly<00:00:56.269> point<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:56.929> they've

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
to short leg and silly point so they've

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.779 
to short leg and silly point so they've
got<00:00:57.379> good<00:00:57.559> technique<00:00:57.829> again<00:00:58.309> spin<00:00:58.640> but

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
got good technique again spin but

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.880 
got good technique again spin but
they're<00:00:58.879> positive<00:00:59.329> against<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.769> know

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
they're positive against it you know

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.770 
they're positive against it you know
you're<00:01:01.039> Tendulkar<00:01:01.699> would<00:01:01.820> sweep<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.449> use<00:01:02.629> his

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
you're Tendulkar would sweep and use his

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.090 
you're Tendulkar would sweep and use his
feet<00:01:03.109> and<00:01:03.350> they're<00:01:03.469> all<00:01:03.589> they<00:01:03.949> were<00:01:04.010> all

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
feet and they're all they were all

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.220 
feet and they're all they were all
brought<00:01:04.370> up<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:05.150> attack<00:01:05.660> and<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:05.990> think

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
brought up to it to attack and I think

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.500 
brought up to it to attack and I think
if<00:01:06.620> we<00:01:06.830> can<00:01:07.010> learn<00:01:07.160> anything<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.090> do<00:01:08.240> that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
if we can learn anything it to do that

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.360 
if we can learn anything it to do that
and<00:01:08.900> it's<00:01:09.020> also<00:01:09.200> probably<00:01:09.620> to<00:01:09.680> practice<00:01:10.190> on

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
and it's also probably to practice on

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.130 
and it's also probably to practice on
that<00:01:10.490> type<00:01:10.760> of<00:01:10.790> wicket<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.540> know<00:01:11.630> rough<00:01:11.900> up

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
that type of wicket you know rough up

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.590 
that type of wicket you know rough up
some<00:01:12.380> practice<00:01:12.800> pitches<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.430> mean<00:01:14.120> I<00:01:14.210> mentioned

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
some practice pitches I mean I mentioned

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.690 
some practice pitches I mean I mentioned

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
a pretty big practice on the type of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.130 
a pretty big practice on the type of
surface<00:01:29.030> he<00:01:29.360> was<00:01:29.510> going<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.720> get<00:01:29.840> out<00:01:29.870> of<00:01:30.050> it

at<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:33.440> time<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.860> know<00:01:33.950> spinning<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.370> ball

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
at that time you know spinning the ball

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.880 
at that time you know spinning the ball
big<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.200> intend<00:01:36.200> oka<00:01:36.470> really<00:01:36.680> got<00:01:36.800> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
big and and intend oka really got the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.710 
big and and intend oka really got the
better<00:01:37.040> or<00:01:37.310> him<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:37.550> it<00:01:37.640> was<00:01:37.730> proper<00:01:38.180> practice

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
better or him but it was proper practice

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.660 
better or him but it was proper practice
it<00:01:39.260> was<00:01:39.380> specific<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.040> what<00:01:40.160> he<00:01:40.280> was<00:01:40.400> going<00:01:40.610> to

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
it was specific to what he was going to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.190 
it was specific to what he was going to
get<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.420> was<00:01:41.510> a<00:01:41.540> positive<00:01:41.750> approach

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
get and and it was a positive approach

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.470 
get and and it was a positive approach
and<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.590> really<00:01:42.740> worked<00:01:42.980> more<00:01:43.910> than<00:01:44.150> not<00:01:44.330> in

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
it's a big risk shot at a time when the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.720 
it's a big risk shot at a time when the
team<00:02:36.290> doesn't<00:02:36.650> heed<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.100> he<00:02:37.250> doesn't<00:02:37.490> need

batters try to create that speed and
it's<00:03:23.240> hard<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:23.780> if<00:03:23.960> you're<00:03:24.080> playing<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.380> big
