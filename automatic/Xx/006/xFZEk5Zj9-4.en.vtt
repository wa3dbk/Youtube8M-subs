which<00:04:16.770> is<00:04:16.920> really<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.910> same<00:04:18.120> time<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.420> got<00:04:18.660> into

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
which is really the same time I got into

home<00:04:19.200> recording<00:04:19.709> as<00:04:19.890> well<00:04:20.280> my<00:04:21.030> first

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
home recording as well my first

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.810 
home recording as well my first
experience<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:22.140> them<00:04:22.410> was<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.830> pod<00:04:23.040> XT<00:04:23.310> live

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
experience with them was the pod XT live

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.370 
experience with them was the pod XT live
which<00:04:24.030> is<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> great<00:04:24.420> sounding<00:04:24.780> piece<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.140> gear

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
which is a great sounding piece of gear

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.650 
which is a great sounding piece of gear
but<00:04:25.530> what<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:26.550> about<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.970> plugins<00:04:27.390> is<00:04:27.540> it

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
but what I like about the plugins is it

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.930 
but what I like about the plugins is it
allows<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.140> expand<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:29.220> other<00:04:29.520> things<00:04:29.820> so

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
allows you to expand to other things so

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.600 
allows you to expand to other things so
you<00:04:30.060> can<00:04:30.300> use<00:04:30.510> any<00:04:30.890> preamp<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:32.040> can<00:04:32.220> use<00:04:32.370> any
