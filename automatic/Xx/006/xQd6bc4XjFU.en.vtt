and world box has spit out an answer
already<00:01:16.189> let's<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.490> how<00:01:17.670> long<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.000> gonna

already let's see how long it's gonna

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
already let's see how long it's gonna

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
take that windows search utility and so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.050 
take that windows search utility and so
