property known as word spacing so I have

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.820 
property known as word spacing so I have
these<00:00:06.299> three<00:00:06.629> paragraphs<00:00:06.839> stuck<00:00:07.319> inside<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
these three paragraphs stuck inside of a

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.700 
these three paragraphs stuck inside of a
div<00:00:08.010> let's<00:00:08.730> go<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:08.970> start<00:00:09.120> working<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.510> them

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
div let's go and start working on them

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.890 
div let's go and start working on them
so<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:10.800> gonna<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.190> P<00:00:11.370> tag<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.719> couple

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
so we're gonna do the P tag and a couple

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200 
so we're gonna do the P tag and a couple
of<00:00:13.019> curly<00:00:13.290> braces<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.160> property<00:00:15.089> that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
of curly braces and the property that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.920 
of curly braces and the property that
we're<00:00:15.360> looking<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.020> word<00:00:17.000> spacing<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
we're looking for is word spacing and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.320 
we're looking for is word spacing and
there's<00:00:19.500> basically<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.220> one<00:00:20.609> setting<00:00:21.090> on

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
there's basically just one setting on

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.830 
there's basically just one setting on
this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.519 
this
well<00:00:22.380> there's<00:00:22.590> inherit<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.300> then<00:00:25.289> there's

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
well there's inherit and then there's

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.690 
well there's inherit and then there's
none<00:00:26.029> or<00:00:27.029> sorry<00:00:27.599> normal<00:00:28.609> normal<00:00:29.840> but<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:32.399> want

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
none or sorry normal normal but you want

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.459 
none or sorry normal normal but you want
to<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> normal<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.420> case<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.050> doing

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
to do the normal in case it's doing

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.590 
to do the normal in case it's doing
weird<00:00:34.680> spacing<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> set<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
weird spacing and you want to set it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.260 
weird spacing and you want to set it
back<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> normal<00:00:37.430> like<00:00:38.430> maybe<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.820> did<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.239> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
back to normal like maybe you did all of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.209 
back to normal like maybe you did all of
the<00:00:39.629> paragraphs<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:40.980> one

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the paragraphs but you want this one

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.979 
the paragraphs but you want this one
paragraph<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.730> appear<00:00:42.059> normal

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
paragraph to appear normal

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
paragraph to appear normal
inherit<00:00:43.620> will<00:00:43.890> inherit<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.760> its<00:00:44.969> parent

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
inherit will inherit from its parent

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.459 
inherit will inherit from its parent
item<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.289> let's<00:00:46.590> say<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.770> example<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
item so let's say for example you have a

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.470 
item so let's say for example you have a
ten<00:00:49.469> pixels<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:50.850> space<00:00:51.120> all<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
ten pixels and that will space all the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
ten pixels and that will space all the
words<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.870> by<00:00:52.020> 10<00:00:52.230> pixels<00:00:52.680> also<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> span

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
words out by 10 pixels also have a span

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.069 
words out by 10 pixels also have a span
here<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.000> we'll<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> span<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:57.980> word<00:00:58.980> spacing

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
here so we'll do a span and word spacing

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.789 
here so we'll do a span and word spacing
normal<00:01:01.489> save<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> refresh<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.680> can

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
normal save that and refresh and you can

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.870 
normal save that and refresh and you can
see<00:01:05.159> let's<00:01:05.670> put<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> background<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.700 

background

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
background

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.900 
background
and<00:01:13.490> we<00:01:13.610> save<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:15.160> refresh<00:01:16.160> there<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.820> is

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
and we save that refresh there it is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.550 
and we save that refresh there it is
right<00:01:17.030> there<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.570> spacing<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.350> is

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
right there so the spacing on it is

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.420 
right there so the spacing on it is
normal<00:01:19.250> if<00:01:19.940> we<00:01:20.780> bump<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.170> up<00:01:21.260> even<00:01:21.620> more<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.190> say

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
normal if we bump it up even more to say

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.170 
normal if we bump it up even more to say
a<00:01:22.460> hundred<00:01:22.760> pixels<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:25.490> go<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.910> span<00:01:26.150> is

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
a hundred pixels you go so the span is

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.140 
a hundred pixels you go so the span is
not<00:01:26.300> inheriting<00:01:27.370> that's<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.580> point<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:29.090> I'm

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
not inheriting that's the point that I'm

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.000 
not inheriting that's the point that I'm
trying<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.420> make<00:01:29.540> here<00:01:29.780> that's<00:01:30.530> where<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.830> does

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
trying to make here that's where it does

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.600 
trying to make here that's where it does
it<00:01:31.220> or<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.000> can<00:01:32.120> just<00:01:32.240> do<00:01:33.040> and<00:01:34.040> hear<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.430> and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
it or you can just do and hear it and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.160 
it or you can just do and hear it and
then<00:01:37.610> it'll<00:01:37.790> go<00:01:37.940> just<00:01:38.570> like<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.870> rest<00:01:39.080> of

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
then it'll go just like the rest of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.740 
then it'll go just like the rest of
everything<00:01:39.440> else<00:01:40.120> so<00:01:41.120> let's<00:01:41.240> get<00:01:41.450> rid<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.660> that

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
everything else so let's get rid of that

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.590 
everything else so let's get rid of that
again<00:01:42.759> basically<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:43.910> need<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.119> go<00:01:44.240> over<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
again basically you need to go over the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.109 
again basically you need to go over the
sizes<00:01:44.990> as<00:01:45.140> well<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.440> can<00:01:45.590> do<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.940> can

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
sizes as well you can do you can

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.480 
sizes as well you can do you can
actually<00:01:47.150> do<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:48.560> can't<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.890> percent<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:49.369> this

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
actually do you can't do percent in this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.310 
actually do you can't do percent in this
situation<00:01:49.940> but<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.150> can<00:01:50.270> do<00:01:50.360> inches<00:01:50.810> inches

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
situation but you can do inches inches

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.780 
situation but you can do inches inches
are<00:01:51.470> possible<00:01:52.060> one<00:01:53.060> inch<00:01:53.270> part<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.380> do

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
are possible one inch part you can do

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.930 
are possible one inch part you can do
centimeters<00:01:55.869> centimeters<00:01:56.869> are<00:01:57.410> possible<00:01:58.040> you

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
centimeters centimeters are possible you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.580 
centimeters centimeters are possible you
do<00:01:59.090> negative<00:01:59.300> centimeters<00:01:59.960> all<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.440> these

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
do negative centimeters all of these

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.590 
do negative centimeters all of these
guys<00:02:00.740> will<00:02:00.979> do<00:02:01.100> negatives<00:02:01.550> so<00:02:01.970> negative

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
guys will do negatives so negative

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.570 
guys will do negatives so negative
centimeter<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.770> makes<00:02:03.920> them<00:02:04.070> lay<00:02:04.190> over<00:02:04.310> top

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
centimeter that makes them lay over top

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
centimeter that makes them lay over top
of<00:02:04.610> one<00:02:04.729> another

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
of one another

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.050 
of one another
millimeter<00:02:06.229> now<00:02:06.860> we'll<00:02:06.979> just<00:02:07.070> make<00:02:07.220> them<00:02:07.369> run

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
millimeter now we'll just make them run

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.729 
millimeter now we'll just make them run
up<00:02:08.090> against<00:02:08.479> each<00:02:08.600> other<00:02:08.750> let's<00:02:09.560> try<00:02:09.709> a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
up against each other let's try a

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.170 
up against each other let's try a
negative<00:02:09.890> two<00:02:10.280> millimeters<00:02:13.030> kind<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.090> like

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
negative two millimeters kind of like

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.959 
negative two millimeters kind of like
that<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> points<00:02:15.680> 0.5<00:02:17.140> centimeters

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.970 

so<00:02:23.969> then<00:02:24.120> you've<00:02:24.299> got<00:02:24.590> M's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
so then you've got M's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.970 
so then you've got M's
so<00:02:26.280> we'll<00:02:26.400> do<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.549> negative<00:02:27.060> one<00:02:27.389> him<00:02:27.769> which<00:02:28.769> is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
so we'll do a negative one him which is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.610 
so we'll do a negative one him which is
the<00:02:29.219> size<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.629> letter<00:02:30.810> M<00:02:31.019> basically<00:02:31.499> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the size of the letter M basically the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.520 
the size of the letter M basically the
size<00:02:31.799> of<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.040> font<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.409> do<00:02:34.650> 1<00:02:35.219> am<00:02:36.530> positive

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
size of the font so we do 1 am positive

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.259 
size of the font so we do 1 am positive
or<00:02:38.459> 2m<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:41.670> X<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.859> 1/2<00:02:43.859> of<00:02:44.010> an<00:02:44.159> M<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.519> 2x<00:02:44.760> will

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
or 2m the X is 1/2 of an M so 2x will

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.580 
or 2m the X is 1/2 of an M so 2x will
actually<00:02:45.599> 1m

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
actually 1m

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.979 
actually 1m
oh<00:02:47.510> wait<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.409> guess<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.829> not<00:02:49.919> precise

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
oh wait a that I guess it's not precise

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.720 
oh wait a that I guess it's not precise
2<00:02:51.989> X<00:02:52.260> 1<00:02:52.769> X<00:02:54.560> supposed<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.829> size<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.280> an<00:02:56.459> M

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
2 X 1 X supposed to be the size of an M

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.679 
2 X 1 X supposed to be the size of an M
so<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.599> 1<00:02:57.900> M<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:00.439> then<00:03:01.439> +<00:03:02.000> 2<00:03:03.000> X<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.449> supposed

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
so we do 1 M and then + 2 X is supposed

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.099 
so we do 1 M and then + 2 X is supposed
to<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.900> equal<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.349> 1<00:03:04.560> M<00:03:04.799> but<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.400> guess<00:03:05.930> not<00:03:06.930> in

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
to be equal to 1 M but I guess not in

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.119 
to be equal to 1 M but I guess not in
this<00:03:07.230> context

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
this context

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.539 
this context
yeah<00:03:08.639> well<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.500> X<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.949> available<00:03:11.400> as<00:03:11.519> well

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
yeah well so X is available as well

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.080 
yeah well so X is available as well
there's<00:03:11.939> a<00:03:12.169> points<00:03:13.169> so<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:13.769> could<00:03:13.919> do<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.090> 12

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
there's a points so we could do a 12

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.709 
there's a points so we could do a 12
point<00:03:15.530> spacing<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:17.790> between<00:03:17.819> all<00:03:18.419> of<00:03:18.449> the

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:18.719 
point spacing in between all of the

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
point spacing in between all of the
words<00:03:18.930> which<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.739> actually<00:03:20.129> equal<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:21.169> 1<00:03:22.169> pica

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.280 

one<00:03:26.310> will<00:03:26.489> do<00:03:26.640> two<00:03:27.060> pikas<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.719> always<00:03:28.109> think

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
one will do two pikas I always think

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:41.199 
one will do two pikas I always think
that's<00:03:28.409> percent<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:30.030> two<00:03:30.599> PICUs<00:03:31.519> 1<00:03:32.519> pica

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:56.030 

12.12.2012<00:03:49.489> two<00:03:50.489> point<00:03:51.709> one<00:03:52.709> inch<00:03:55.040> same

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
12.12.2012 two point one inch same

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.110 
12.12.2012 two point one inch same
difference

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
difference

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.089 
difference
and<00:03:58.519> then<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.669> can<00:03:59.790> also<00:03:59.909> do<00:04:00.500> pixels<00:04:01.500> which<00:04:01.980> I

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
and then you can also do pixels which I

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.949 
and then you can also do pixels which I
think<00:04:02.280> I've<00:04:02.340> shown<00:04:02.370> already<00:04:03.260> say<00:04:04.260> 100<00:04:04.590> pixels

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
think I've shown already say 100 pixels

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:15.420 
think I've shown already say 100 pixels
or<00:04:06.959> 5<00:04:07.709> pixels<00:04:10.310> or<00:04:11.310> negative<00:04:12.030> 5<00:04:12.180> pixels

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.319 

there<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.519> go<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:16.789> there's<00:04:16.970> all<00:04:17.180> the

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
there you go so there's all the

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.699 
there you go so there's all the
measurements<00:04:17.810> that's<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.229> word<00:04:18.380> spacing

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
measurements that's the word spacing

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.819 
measurements that's the word spacing
property<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.519> CSS<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:21.470> know<00:04:21.530> it's<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.680> lot

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
property in CSS and you know it's a lot

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.340 
property in CSS and you know it's a lot
like<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.070> letter<00:04:22.250> spacing<00:04:22.520> properties<00:04:23.350> so

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
like the letter spacing properties so

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.560 
like the letter spacing properties so
let's<00:04:24.560> do<00:04:28.960> which<00:04:29.960> faces<00:04:30.410> out<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.680> letters<00:04:31.570> but

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
let's do which faces out the letters but

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.450 
let's do which faces out the letters but
words<00:04:33.039> spacing<00:04:34.039> just<00:04:35.199> does<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.410> words<00:04:36.590> and

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
words spacing just does the words and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.450 
words spacing just does the words and
leaves<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.090> letters<00:04:38.360> inside<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.960> word<00:04:39.110> alone

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
leaves the letters inside the word alone

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.560 
leaves the letters inside the word alone
alright<00:04:40.460> then<00:04:40.639> that's<00:04:40.759> it<00:04:41.000> thank<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.509> for

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
alright then that's it thank you for
