00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
you want the full version and you don't

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.650 
you want the full version and you don't
want<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.620> pay<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:36.380> you'll<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.660> click

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
want to pay then you'll have to click

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.210

anything<00:02:40.050> except<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:40.770> install<00:02:41.610> update<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
anything except for install update and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.560 
anything except for install update and
that's<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.790> serial<00:02:45.209> that's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
that's because the serial that's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.320 
that's because the serial that's
included<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.410> folder<00:02:46.970> only<00:02:47.970> works<00:02:48.150> for

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
included in the folder only works for

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.300 
included in the folder only works for
version<00:02:49.220> 2.8<00:02:50.420> point<00:02:51.420> 0<00:02:51.570> which<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.709> what<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.100> have

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
version 2.8 point 0 which is what I have

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.840 
version 2.8 point 0 which is what I have
or<00:02:53.780> 2.8<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.830> either<00:02:59.100> skip<00:02:59.610> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
or 2.8 and so you can either skip the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.570 
or 2.8 and so you can either skip the
new<00:02:59.970> version<00:03:00.090> or<00:03:00.570> choose<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.830> remind<00:03:02.340> me<00:03:02.430> later

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
that's why I like it so much now just

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.710 
that's why I like it so much now just
one<00:04:22.410> feature<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.099> I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
one feature that I

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.690 
one feature that I
like<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.170> I'm<00:04:24.740> sure<00:04:24.920> it<00:04:25.100> comes<00:04:25.340> with<00:04:25.550> all<00:04:25.640> the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
like and I'm sure it comes with all the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.080 
like and I'm sure it comes with all the
applications<00:04:26.540> but<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.530> virtual<00:04:27.890> mouse

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
applications but it's the virtual mouse

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.840 
applications but it's the virtual mouse
so<00:04:29.090> we'll<00:04:29.240> say<00:04:29.390> mouse<00:04:29.660> mode<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:31.250> allows

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
so we'll say mouse mode on that allows

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.570 
so we'll say mouse mode on that allows
you<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.150> know<00:04:32.420> that<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:33.650> virtual<00:04:34.040> nose<00:04:34.220> is

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
you to know that the virtual nose is

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.230 
you to know that the virtual nose is

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
running so to control it you know plus

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.510
