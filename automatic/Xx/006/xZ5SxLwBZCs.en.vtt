00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.210
 in one of the biggest kitchen knives 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.890
 factories 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 I have a blank here now 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 hand that means being punched out 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.980
 better one can also see it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.830
 they will continue to work now 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.399
 means in the beginning we are all whole 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.340
 dull and the work processes is that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.760
 knife is really nice after sharp 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.290
 the wolves show as happy 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.140
 Let's go for the punched out knife 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.879
 Blanks caught at the grinder 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 in a specially made wood 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.020
 template of sound rowling is in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.610
 the perfect shape honed sky 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.219
 should be ensured that no 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.570
 stans kanten more then stay 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.570
 the handle is mounted 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 The prefabricated wooden spoons are made by 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 Hand screwed to the knife blade 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.380
 the special quality shows 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 in that the blade not only 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.430
 put on and glued but am 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.729
 screwed down the lower end of the handle 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.869
 Being a breaking blade is thus 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.869
 almost impossible 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.250
 a station continues to become fresh 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.500
 mounted flu grinded 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.810
 first with coarse graining then always 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.350
 finer is the grip supple in the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 hand lies 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.280
 Now it's time for the knife 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.970
 blade of the knife back gets its 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.950
 final touch 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.740
 to enjoy even the finest sprites 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.090
 avoid it goes into the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.250
 Polishing machine free according to the motto 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.750
 good knife must be flashing the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.700
 razor sharp with a rubber roller 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:14.030
 Till she stops working on one 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.800
 To distinguish the mirror is the next 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.560
 Step out of the prototype then 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.540
 finally become real knife by hand 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.280
 each blade razor-sharp cut 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.670
 in technical terms this is called 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.410
 Procedures live still a examiner 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.140
 look and then that's the high quality 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.860
 finished knife only missing that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.170
 corporate 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.880
 it is applied with a tincture 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.489
 the one life holds each knife 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.730
 will now be tested again tested 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.300
 and cleaned it before then 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.300
 is packed ready for shipment 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.380
