00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.990 
fire seems to be driving alright what we
got<00:03:23.210> is<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.780> 95<00:03:24.490> Pontiac<00:03:25.490> Grand<00:03:25.520> Am<00:03:26.680> with

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
got is it's a 95 Pontiac Grand Am with

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.760 
got is it's a 95 Pontiac Grand Am with
3.1<00:03:29.000> v6<00:03:29.600> same<00:03:29.960> as<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.620> Cutlass<00:03:31.070> and

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.710 

a<00:03:33.830> decent<00:03:34.640> shape<00:03:35.210> for<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> parts<00:03:35.870> car

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:48.199 

and<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.560> got<00:03:39.770> a<00:03:39.800> bad<00:03:40.220> spark<00:03:41.500> ignition<00:03:42.640> module

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.530 

so<00:03:48.900> we're<00:03:49.409> not<00:03:49.560> no<00:03:50.069> spark<00:03:50.519> it's<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:50.939> fuel<00:03:51.239> but

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
so we're not no spark it's got fuel but

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.209 
so we're not no spark it's got fuel but
no<00:03:51.659> spark<00:03:52.049> so<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.290> think<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.650> computer<00:03:53.010> is

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
no spark so I think the computer is

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.959 
no spark so I think the computer is
still<00:03:53.280> good

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:53.969 
still good

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.559 
still good
but<00:03:54.689> I<00:03:54.719> think<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.170> spark<00:03:55.439> controller<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.010> bad

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
but I think the spark controller is bad

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.490 
but I think the spark controller is bad
depends<00:03:57.569> on<00:03:57.659> how<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.840> fuel<00:03:58.109> pump<00:03:58.409> is

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
depends on how the fuel pump is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.990 
depends on how the fuel pump is
controlled<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.159> these<00:03:59.310> I'll<00:03:59.549> have<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.790> take<00:03:59.969> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
controlled in these I'll have to take a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.020 
controlled in these I'll have to take a
look<00:04:00.209> at<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.599> little<00:04:00.629> bit<00:04:00.840> more<00:04:01.170> later<00:04:01.409> but

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
look at it a little bit more later but

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.869
