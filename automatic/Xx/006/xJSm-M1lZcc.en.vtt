hi<00:00:00.810> weather<00:00:01.050> climate<00:00:01.760> some<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.820> you<00:00:02.939> had

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi weather climate some of you had

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.120 
hi weather climate some of you had
trouble<00:00:03.389> with<00:00:03.419> Jeffrey<00:00:03.990> with<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.680> Coriolis

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
trouble with Jeffrey with the Coriolis

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.980 
trouble with Jeffrey with the Coriolis
effect<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.700> using<00:00:06.000> these<00:00:06.120> cards<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.660> wanted<00:00:06.899> to

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
effect and using these cards I wanted to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.410 
effect and using these cards I wanted to
go<00:00:07.170> over<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.440> real<00:00:07.589> quickly<00:00:07.859> with<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.420> they

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
go over it real quickly with you they

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.820 
go over it real quickly with you they
want<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.750> use<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> three<00:00:10.139> by<00:00:10.260> five<00:00:10.469> card

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
want you to use a three by five card

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.499 
want you to use a three by five card
these<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:11.280> bigger<00:00:11.460> than<00:00:11.610> three<00:00:11.849> by<00:00:11.940> five<00:00:12.150> so

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
these are bigger than three by five so

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.150 
these are bigger than three by five so
hopefully<00:00:12.990> you'll<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.110> LCM<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:14.429> take<00:00:14.639> card<00:00:14.940> a

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
hopefully you'll be LCM we take card a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.300 
hopefully you'll be LCM we take card a
and<00:00:17.160> say<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.609> current<00:00:17.940> be<00:00:19.130> card<00:00:20.130> eight

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
and say this is current be card eight

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.859 
and say this is current be card eight
we're<00:00:20.550> supposed<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.939> cut<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:22.160> lengthwise<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.529 

then<00:00:27.869> tape<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> down

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:40.450 

and<00:00:35.050> card<00:00:35.379> B<00:00:35.649> we're<00:00:36.489> supposed<00:00:36.969> to<00:00:37.210> cut

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.340 

with<00:00:41.180> fries<00:00:42.700> slide<00:00:43.700> that<00:00:44.060> into<00:00:44.590> our<00:00:45.590> car<00:00:45.860> today

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
with fries slide that into our car today

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.650 
with fries slide that into our car today
all<00:00:48.350> right<00:00:48.710> now<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:50.060> first<00:00:50.239> thing<00:00:50.390> we're

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
all right now the first thing we're

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.320 
all right now the first thing we're
supposed<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.020> do<00:00:51.190> if<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.310> mark<00:00:52.550> an<00:00:52.670> X<00:00:52.880> where<00:00:53.239> the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
supposed to do if we mark an X where the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.600 
supposed to do if we mark an X where the
center<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:55.010> draw<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.250> straight<00:00:55.370> line

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
center is is to draw a straight line

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.590 
center is is to draw a straight line
along<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.540> cut

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.259 

you<00:01:01.140> notice<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.530> straight<00:01:01.800> well<00:01:02.760> nothing

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
you notice it's straight well nothing

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.679 
you notice it's straight well nothing
was<00:01:03.359> moving<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.259> that<00:01:04.290> makes<00:01:04.559> sense

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
was moving so that makes sense

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.380 
was moving so that makes sense
now<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.350> parts<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.829> heartburn<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:09.030> start

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
now this parts the heartburn to start

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.539 
now this parts the heartburn to start
the<00:01:09.539> X<00:01:09.719> then<00:01:10.499> as<00:01:10.679> you're<00:01:10.890> drawing<00:01:11.069> along<00:01:11.399> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the X then as you're drawing along the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
the X then as you're drawing along the
line<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.420> supposed<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> rotate<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.069> card<00:01:14.960> not

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
line is supposed to rotate the card not

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.639 
line is supposed to rotate the card not
easy<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:18.060> does<00:01:18.149> it<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.719> curves<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
easy and what does it do it curves and

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.949 
easy and what does it do it curves and
actually<00:01:20.069> it<00:01:20.189> curves<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:20.959> because

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
actually it curves to the right because

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.380 
actually it curves to the right because
in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> northern<00:01:22.740> hemisphere<00:01:22.859> the<00:01:23.819> Coriolis

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
in the northern hemisphere the Coriolis

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
in the northern hemisphere the Coriolis
effect<00:01:24.750> makes<00:01:24.959> the<00:01:25.109> wing<00:01:25.259> trip<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:25.799> right

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
effect makes the wing trip to the right

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.949 
effect makes the wing trip to the right
now<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> don't<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.329> way<00:01:27.539> of<00:01:27.719> doing

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
now I don't like this way of doing

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:28.309 
now I don't like this way of doing
things

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
things

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.539 
things
I<00:01:29.030> prefer<00:01:30.740> describe<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.950> way<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.399> is

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I prefer describe it this way this is

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.219 
I prefer describe it this way this is
the<00:01:32.670> North<00:01:32.880> Pole<00:01:32.969> and<00:01:33.599> we're<00:01:33.719> looking<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.109> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the North Pole and we're looking at the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
the North Pole and we're looking at the
Earth<00:01:34.409> from<00:01:34.560> above<00:01:35.479> okay

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
Earth from above okay

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.260 
Earth from above okay
there's<00:01:37.170> goes<00:01:37.590> counterclockwise<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:39.060> it's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
there's goes counterclockwise and it's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.889 
there's goes counterclockwise and it's
axis<00:01:39.750> now<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.739> we<00:01:40.890> try<00:01:41.039> it<00:01:41.129> if<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.489> try<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> draw<00:01:42.629> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
axis now if we try it if I try to draw a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.399 
axis now if we try it if I try to draw a
straight<00:01:42.959> line<00:01:43.939> while<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.119> spinning<00:01:45.409> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
straight line while it's spinning you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
straight line while it's spinning you
see<00:01:46.619> how<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.280> curves<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.849> the<00:01:47.969> right<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.840> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
see how it curves to the right this is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.869 
see how it curves to the right this is
the<00:01:49.170> effect<00:01:49.469> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> Coriolis<00:01:49.920> effect<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:50.879 
the effect of the Coriolis effect if the

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:52.669 
the effect of the Coriolis effect if the
earth<00:01:51.030> wasn't<00:01:51.360> spinning<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:52.259> straight<00:01:52.469> line

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
earth wasn't spinning the straight line

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.410 
earth wasn't spinning the straight line
it<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.039> a<00:01:53.069> straight<00:01:53.340> line<00:01:53.489> right<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.909> try

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it would be a straight line right I try

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.740 
it would be a straight line right I try
that<00:01:54.450> another<00:01:55.110> straight<00:01:55.439> line<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.750> two

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that another straight line and two

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.609 
that another straight line and two
curves<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.409> right

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
curves to the right

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.219 
curves to the right
we've<00:01:59.250> even<00:01:59.479> draw<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.509> straight<00:02:00.989> line<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
we've even draw the straight line a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.779 
we've even draw the straight line a
different<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.829> let's<00:02:01.979> see<00:02:02.189> oh<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.459> it<00:02:02.549> drive

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
different way let's see oh do it drive

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.170 
different way let's see oh do it drive
this<00:02:03.000> way

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
this way

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.840 

not<00:02:05.780> even<00:02:06.020> curve<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.530> right<00:02:06.580> crazy<00:02:07.580> like

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
not even curve to the right crazy like

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.160 
not even curve to the right crazy like
so<00:02:08.450> hopefully<00:02:08.960> it<00:02:09.050> helps<00:02:09.350> with<00:02:09.619> Chapter<00:02:10.010> eight
