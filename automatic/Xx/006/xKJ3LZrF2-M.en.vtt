less wheel stress through the bearings

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
less wheel stress through the bearings
because<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.309> assembled<00:00:38.579> the

bearings<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.219> lot<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> advantages<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.270> way

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
bearings a lot of advantages that way

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.299 
bearings a lot of advantages that way
and<00:00:43.309> also<00:00:44.390> I'm<00:00:45.390> sure<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.559> simple

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and also I'm sure it's a very simple

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.810 
and also I'm sure it's a very simple
question<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.820> drills

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
question but what what are the drills

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.869 
question but what what are the drills
yes<00:00:52.070> when<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> cross<00:00:53.460> drilled<00:00:53.640> hole

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
yes when you have a cross drilled hole

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
yes when you have a cross drilled hole
you're<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> pick<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.750> extra<00:00:55.050> cooling

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you're going to pick up extra cooling

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
you're going to pick up extra cooling
off<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.860> system<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> smooth<00:00:56.760> rotor<00:00:57.030> also

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
off the system over a smooth rotor also

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.939 
off the system over a smooth rotor also
you'll<00:00:58.140> notice<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> holes<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you'll notice that the holes have a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.520 
you'll notice that the holes have a
chamfer<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.820> shallow<00:01:00.180> art<00:01:00.899> coming<00:01:01.289> into

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
chamfer it's a shallow art coming into

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.410 
chamfer it's a shallow art coming into
the<00:01:01.620> hole<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.730> does<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.149> allows

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the hole and what that does is it allows

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.600 
the hole and what that does is it allows
the<00:01:04.049> whole<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.799> harsh<00:01:05.220> against<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the whole not to be as harsh against the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.490 
the whole not to be as harsh against the
brake<00:01:05.760> pads<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.510> slots<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:07.020> grooves<00:01:07.320> as

are various piston sizes available

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.400 
are various piston sizes available
because<00:02:44.790> each<00:02:44.970> application<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.900> specifically

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
because each application is specifically

so<00:02:51.720> basically<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.350> have<00:02:52.380> fast<00:02:53.220> breaking<00:02:53.580> and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
so basically we have fast breaking and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.100 
so basically we have fast breaking and
customizability<00:02:56.150> exec<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:57.900> step

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
