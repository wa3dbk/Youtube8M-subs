in<00:02:13.410> tremendous<00:02:13.800> tremendous<00:02:14.310> shape<00:02:14.940> for<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
in tremendous tremendous shape for this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.440 
in tremendous tremendous shape for this
one<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.750> again<00:02:16.260> 152<00:02:17.010> was<00:02:17.190> perfect<00:02:17.880> for<00:02:18.030> him<00:02:18.150> I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
one and again 152 was perfect for him I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.320 
one and again 152 was perfect for him I
think<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.260> perfect<00:02:19.440> because<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
think it's perfect because it's going to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.449 
think it's perfect because it's going to
allow<00:02:21.390> him<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:21.870> faster<00:02:22.410> inside<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.280> ring

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
allow him to be faster inside the ring
