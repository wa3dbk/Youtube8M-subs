00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.900
 This word has this word 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 denied today it's just me I feel this 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 non episodic in episode number 9 of the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.360
 Ski while you shovel the boys can 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.800
 be a rather special episode 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 because I'll have to ask you a few things 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.660
 update you and other things oh my god 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 then start immediately by telling you that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.539
 this is a bit of an episode here 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 summary where I show you some 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.980
 matches but more than anything i show 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.019
 the players bought just sold I 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.820
 done as you can tell a trade 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.150
 with the teams because you guys are good 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 while the names I bought them swords like that 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.059
 there are players whose price 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.760
 without everything, for example, I tend 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.420
 are, for example Mavuba fact inform 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.430
 does not fit in shape it only cost on 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.100
 28,000 if I'm not mistaken then when not 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.470
 just searched for the price to sell it 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.150
 I saw that it was 50 thousand and I succeeded 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.379
 in fact, to sell it, I don't tell you how much oh 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.250
 my god and it is not 50 so you note 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 hit by watching the video 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.479
 anyway then guys in this is a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.860
 episode of I'll have to talk about some things 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.740
 let's start with the first talk 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.329
 which is my secondary channel 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.399
 guys for the uninitiated I created 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.700
 a secondary account that obviously on 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.859
 called youtube or q2 v2v axel 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.090
 which is basically just mine 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.270
 second channel because I did a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.829
 second channel because I also wanted here and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.329
 in the second channel I will have a moment longer than 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.100
 freedom maybe upload video can 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.560
 upload more videos of call of duty 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 here seen that in this channel 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.899
 you will prefer to see videos scared though 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.670
 obviously sometimes it's up to 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.140
 put some calls of duty and note 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.590
 maybe so also to have a channel of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.070
 backup 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 then if you are interested in it obviously 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.399
 you will find the link in description ho 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.350
 made a video today that practically 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.119
 I speak of the sale or of the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.490
 my most powerful profits because precisely 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 I decided to start a series that is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.819
 will call it where I will show you the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.009
 my most powerful profits easy since 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.049
 title you understand and then just go 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.600
 on my channel and the second channel dream 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.939
 sorry and you will find it immediately 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.770
 then I wanted to tell you a moment 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.329
 also of the facebook page if you want 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090
 on the facebook page I started doing 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.499
 a deluge of give away for example vi 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 I ask you to guess the exact result 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:12.330
 markers and the order of the markers of 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.760
 a few matches and today you will be bayern 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.060
 monk 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.030
 I do not remember v rather wait for you 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 I want to say though bayern monaco why 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.370
 the bayern monk nowadays minds from 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.189
 make us courage against the arsenal 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.049
 then arsenal bayern monk is won 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.459
 50 40 thousand crises if I'm not mistaken and therefore 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.739
 box you want to participate you will find the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.780
 link to the facebook page in 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.180
 description then that it is immediately and to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.709
 powerfully important things 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.209
 guys I said this panel 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.700
 exact summary needs because I have 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.810
 summary fact I don't know if not 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.209
 I know if any of you know that though 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.640
 the hypothesis of the shovel so put it is 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.269
 it was my first and road to glory 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.980
 let's call it pure road division one like 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.540
 you've done everything before because on 12 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.069
 I had never done one then 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.069
 obviously I was not well experienced and there 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.319
 have been problems or not 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.849
 I knew well when each how much to load 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.190
 maybe how many games to cut in each 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.260
 video and then bo we are now at one 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.870
 important junction then me now 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.459
 I'm kind of not remember me how many victories 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.019
 however it is obviously I have already won the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.879
 division 1 you saw in the last one 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.489
 video so I decided to do this 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.540
 what I wanted to start again a little bit better 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.549
 or I'll eliminate the club and put it on 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.449
 at the auction all I will pass the credits things 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.269
 so 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:31.090
 and you should tell me what you would like 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.829
 see or maybe because I had in 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.780
 mind also something where I will explain 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.889
 slowly all the modules then too 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.169
 could be a pretty series 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.519
 interesting because I'll make teams with more 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.040
 modules and then we'll compare them 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.690
 maybe with particular episodes with 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.250
 of the special episodes and we will arrive 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.319
 together to understand what the form is 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.669
 better here and therefore it seems to me one 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.640
 quite good 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.040
 then 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.510
 or wooded themes you still want 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.490
 not 8 division one that I call 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.090
 cleanse yourself at the shovel because initially 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.020
 maybe use the bronze team and 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.420
 therefore it is quite a thing 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.270
 powerful or if you have seen maybe 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.920
 some location you liked from 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.420
 some parts maybe on google or 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.770
 something similar 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.050
 just send a message or 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.040
 just comment on this commented 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.209
 video with the name of the series maybe 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.919
 the goal of this series I will read 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.600
 all the comments from bas to read 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.400
 comments maybe even if you can watch 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.220
 you comments like the series 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.890
 who is one of you knows has already written no 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.810
 rewrite it so that the comment will come 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.500
 the more I like about the io series 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.750
 just 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.980
 sorry the repetition of the words I will do 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.720
 that series then and then I already have in 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.190
 mind precisely because I want a moment 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.570
 wait a few days before doing it 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.370
 I want to see how many answers come 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.360
 here in the meantime you see that one was missing 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.070
 I had nineteen points 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.260
 obviously I will lose it 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.900
 after 1 deploying it is where I had it 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.500
 said that it broke my joystick if not 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.479
 erro e and then in the next video 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.530
 in fact make a fallen scrub builders 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.510
 in their teams I could of the shovel is 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.570
 in fact if you notice build it will end with 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.650
 the whole team put up for sale 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.080
 just waiting to create a new one 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.910
 then squad twenty next video e 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.669
 finally maybe in this new series is me 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.310
 also liked the idea maybe to make a 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.540
 maybe something challenges or something 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.200
 with challenges it is already a little more difficult 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:25.250
 win a lot of games or 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.780
 try to leave at zero or less 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.300
 defeats possible precisely rato 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.479
 so defeated victories to do 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.550
 a total bobo challenge that you don't 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.850
 aba get to one side wins 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.419
 seven defeats such a thing then 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.370
 give vent to your imagination and 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.990
 recommended as much as possible 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.240
 ok then then guys said 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.190
 I have no other things 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.380
 important to say maybe maybe yes 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.360
 some are lately 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.590
 maybe I don't know if you've seen it on 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.030
 facebook page or on the group 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.290
 facebook asking someone if they want 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.480
 make games for a prize by 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.550
 credits because in fact in the next live 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.620
 streaming I decided to do the names either 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.090
 streaming one or two games against 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.050
 my writings obviously look at this 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.820
 Matuidi here I paid 28,500 ago I was 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.070
 waiting to look for the price is only 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.570
 look how much I put it is not, indeed 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:22.680
 here at 46 thousand 500 then a gain of 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:24.180
 19,000 18,015 was saying HIV 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.560
 streaming I will make matches against TV and 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.450
 therefore, with credits up for grabs 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.010
