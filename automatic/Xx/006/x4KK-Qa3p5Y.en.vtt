I thought Tadashi was yokai for some

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.530 
I thought Tadashi was yokai for some
reason<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.680> may<00:04:15.829> just<00:04:16.040> seem<00:04:16.190> like<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:17.209> would<00:04:17.299> be

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
reason it may just seem like it would be

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.170 
reason it may just seem like it would be
him<00:04:17.750> after<00:04:18.500> focusing<00:04:19.220> on<00:04:19.370> Tadashi<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
him after focusing on Tadashi and the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.950 
him after focusing on Tadashi and the
like<00:04:20.660> first<00:04:20.930> half<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.709> trailer<00:04:21.949> but<00:04:22.960> turns

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
like first half of the trailer but turns

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.300 
like first half of the trailer but turns
out<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.229> somebody<00:04:24.530> else<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:24.860> that's<00:04:25.039> pretty

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
out to somebody else so that's pretty

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.360 
out to somebody else so that's pretty
cool<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.760> my<00:04:26.750> speculation<00:04:27.710> was<00:04:27.889> wrong

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
cool that my speculation was wrong

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.980

and<00:04:29.080> yeah<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:31.150> anyway<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.360> really<00:04:32.720> can't<00:04:32.870> wait

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
and yeah so anyway I really can't wait
