display and then a 4.7 inches play so

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.519 
display and then a 4.7 inches play so
that<00:06:30.120> is<00:06:30.330> how<00:06:30.449> you<00:06:30.479> do<00:06:30.719> it<00:06:30.839> folks<00:06:31.050> and<00:06:31.289> that<00:06:31.409> is

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
that is how you do it folks and that is

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.409 
that is how you do it folks and that is
how<00:06:31.680> I've<00:06:31.919> done<00:06:32.159> it<00:06:32.279> there's<00:06:32.789> probably<00:06:33.210> plenty

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
how I've done it there's probably plenty

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.820 
how I've done it there's probably plenty
of<00:06:33.659> other<00:06:33.810> ways<00:06:33.839> you<00:06:33.990> can<00:06:34.229> do<00:06:34.319> it<00:06:34.349> to<00:06:34.589> make<00:06:34.680> it

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
of other ways you can do it to make it

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.999 
of other ways you can do it to make it
easier<00:06:35.159> or<00:06:35.310> whichever<00:06:35.930> but<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.050> fact<00:06:37.229> is<00:06:37.380> this

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
easier or whichever but the fact is this

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.050 
easier or whichever but the fact is this
is<00:06:38.159> what<00:06:38.250> I<00:06:38.279> did<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.610> and<00:06:38.699> I<00:06:38.789> think<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:39.029> looks
