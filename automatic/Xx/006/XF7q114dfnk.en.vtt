 let's start comes 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.039
 The first thing we do in this place is open 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.180
 house for that purpose 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.180
 muntadas persona 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 and in that direction 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670
 both matters 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.670
 demands and is that fire

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.060
 for the visit 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
 is what was done 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.900
 a positive European boards of directors 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.490
 we are going to work 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.730
 we start with the entrance of the house 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.510
 when it is known that the address 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.720
 and then comes 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 we know that energy 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 - panasonic 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.510
 let's try the sense of the hands 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.410
 we work in this daily activity 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.880
 already in spain 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.090
 I feel the same 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 I know something happened to me 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 that vision the opposition 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.959
 They are little more than worthy sale and Brazil 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.689
 all these areas 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.659
 here we believe that it is very positive 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.659
 it is possible that this is a family 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.929
 we come to outer space 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.749
 silver partner 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.699
 let's see what positive mark 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.619
 we will be 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.819
 and the cairo 1 sep 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
 they have to say what is 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 let's agree 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.259
 before the option 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.369
 for that reason it has validity 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.119
 we work 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.119
 apart 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.369
 we arrived 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.129
 what is negative 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.249
 now we continue advancing 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.999
 palace room 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.709
 nestars of the same 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.589

 increase the sale 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.519
 there are three things about me 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.449
 is how all this works 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.419
 the first results if there were 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.680
 and there we work with all these tasks in which 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.379
 combinative 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.020
 external works 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.159
