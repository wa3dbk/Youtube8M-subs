00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.689

 Slowly do not start playing for free I 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.710
 I think it's worth trying called psycho 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.470
 the next game with a great name heroes 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.750
 sword and magic 3 she went to the ipad thanks 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.000
 by ubisoft for this general i think 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.979
 you are familiar with old heroes now they 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.840
 HIV sabotage on ebay.de that is, it was 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.950
 redrawn it all now 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.720
 these objects 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.850
 Well, in general, amateur heroes should 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.380
 rate this game the game is in the appstore 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.780
 from money that is worth pretty 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.670
 a lot but the gameplay here is very cool we 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 collect their troops collect various 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.320
 resources to then attack someone well 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 whole wander under this map to study and 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.230
 dispense from different it straw it 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.120
 pretty cool 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.890
 spring note this is this field 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.170
 battles but not very comfortable that is 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.540
 you need to poke on these buttons for 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.370
 attacks and at first nothing is clear but 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.739
 then when you play you will understand 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.390
 funny if it becomes interesting fights 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.280
 of course I will get harder 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.780

 The full name of the game can be viewed in 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.810
 description for this video is general that we 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.950
 here we do this balance that is, we 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.350
 rise on some incomprehensible 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.690
 the tree is blown in the wind by bees flying 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.970
 just manage to break and we need it 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.860
 all things either somehow go through either 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.190
 jump in general is not clear at all 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.900
 nothing but a whole new game think 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.380

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.510

 biker club accordingly we have this 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.030
 the very beginner we fell into biker clubs 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.010
 we must now begin working in this 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.370
 biker club and do everything for the good 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.980
 this club, that is, we are a club and members 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.810
 the club is our brothers our family and we are 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.510
 this club means the game is made like 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.750
 and the walking dead that is our decision 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.460
 and our actions influence the course of the game 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.770
 accordingly we have to do it all 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.660
 something like that not to harm the club club 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.490
 for us this is the main thing in the course of the game we 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.340
 will of course ride a motorcycle 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.060
 where without this is the biker club 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.280
 accordingly enter into different 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.170
 dialogues and decide the fate of some people 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.050
 that is, do not kill and kill 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.940
 accordingly, we must bring our 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.860

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.030

 he must fight for his survival on 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.470
 this planet is somehow stupid 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.870
 such that if space technologies in 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.330

 realize this planet from here these 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.940
 incomprehensible monsters play in principle 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.670

 further game island island again under 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.210
 says all the game titles you can 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.970
 see in the description for this video 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.460
 what happened here is an island which 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.110
 as I understand our man is our character 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.700
 work on someone ships from ship 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.530
 got into some kind of weird thing 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.570
 accordingly, he was transferred to this 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.650
 The island in this man is now alone 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.260
 on the island 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.150
 1 to game impressive aukey somehow like me 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.770
 I understand too big and openly that is 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.990
 we can go where we want and do what 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.090
 but we want to swim somewhere in the ocean is like me 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.570
 I understand we can not do that is 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.640
 swim away 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.890
 nowhere only on the island only 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.690
 explore the island of course we must 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.700
 look for resources to survive that is 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.010
 here we see a backpack we must assemble 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.420
 fruit can also craft weapons then 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.390
 There is a type of how to collect 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.920
 some resources and do of it all 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.020
 weapons and follow the map of course 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.270
 will have to be hunting for animals here 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.310
 zombies that we will have to kill in 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.900
 Generally complete devilry going on this 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.380
 island but it's cool open 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.030
 map 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.160
 in principle, we can do whatever we want 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.150
 why not play always know 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.640
 was very cool 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.440
