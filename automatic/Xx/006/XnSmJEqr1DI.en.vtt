00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.330
 so I got the battery 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 means to a little bit 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.530
 I decided to diversify my video 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.039
 finish the second side on the glass with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.840
 silicon carbide powder 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 the same result is obtained that 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.000
 that dub ki that on glass with carbide 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:30.179
 cream they are just different ways of getting 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 this result, so we remove the rough 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.790
 flaws with a stone here they are already left 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.960
 a little so this is a process way 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.660
 pretty quickly we take care of your ears 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 Of course in the editor this business is compensating 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 but alignment stones 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.329
 stones on rough silicon carbide this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.329
 very loud process 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.530
 Well, in fact, it's done in general 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.930
 task 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:14.479
 rough alignment giving a plane 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.670
 we managed now I want to stop 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.530
 at a very important stage which is necessary 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.610
 starting the coarsest powder on 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.410
 where do you work 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.240
 this chamfering rounding on the stones 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.790
 very important nuance which is sure 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.830
 must be otherwise we are now 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.440
 this is especially clearly seen when we only 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.520
 overcome betrayed flat bench here 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.310
 these are the edges 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.640
 quite sharp and you'll be pretty 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.360
 strongly scratch the tool when sharpening 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.460
 to avoid this verge do 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.460
 rounded I do it that way 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.950
 Well , since I already brought the bottom of my 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.950
 I will make a stone 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.489
 kitchens 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.620
 Well 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.810
 on 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:29.550
 that's all I feel to the touch that 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.550
 ready now my stone 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:49.120
 Now we gave a stone 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.690
 the working form that is, performed the most 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.950
 rude 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:58.510
 stage of work that is fine-tuning brought 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:01.530
 the plane that we needed but if 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.230
 we will finish our work on this 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.950
 the roughness of our stone will 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.930
 much 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:13.690
 he will be much rougher than from him 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:18.310
 can get it thin before vodka 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.290
 stone its grain size is quite small 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:26.260
 if we leave him like this 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:28.960
 there it will work as it should 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.100
 only when in process 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.240
 exploitation all claims go and 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.310
 the grooves that we left behind 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.960
 rough abrasive 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.540
 that is actually for today on this 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.470
 moment stone its function of a thin stone 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.420
 perform will not moreover we do not 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.270
 we will know what to expect from him what 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.610
 rudeness on what how how rude it will be 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.910
 work that's why the end 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.250
 stop at this stage can not 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:01.150
 need to move on to the next more 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:05.880
 fine abrasive so that so on and on 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.530
 so on so that the last grain 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.580
 which we will process our stone 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.830
 it was well thought to be less than half 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.500
 Grain to me, I still prefer 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:23.830
 thin bring to the thinnest 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.560
 powder means what step we are now 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.020
 used used f60 carbide 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.580
 silicon 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:38.140
 next i will take 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:40.120
 in 120 that is, ideally the step should be in 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.010
 two times ie the following 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.870
 silicon carbide grains which you will 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.280
 use its micron size 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.360
 should be two times less 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.100
 What is not a dogma if you do not have two 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.560
 times less and there are three times less 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.970
 nothing terrible will please 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.700
 use three times less you just 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.430
 spend more time time on this 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.919
 work is still the desired result you 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.400
 will achieve well only afterwards of course 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:11.990
 60 f60 go directly to 1200 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:16.070
 Well, again, I can repeat but you are afraid 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:19.540
 for scorched so the grain pitch doubled 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:24.790
 in my opinion the best option 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:28.150
 that's why I washed this glass now 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:31.150
 turn it over and continue on continue on 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.150
 120
