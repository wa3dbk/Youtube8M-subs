what I did wear it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.730 
what I did wear it
once<00:03:02.530> or<00:03:03.459> twice<00:03:03.760> nothing

once or twice nothing

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.270 
once or twice nothing

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
I think not wearing it today but it kind

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.120 
I think not wearing it today but it kind
of<00:03:08.400> did<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:08.670> fade<00:03:09.180> off<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.950> only

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
of did like fade off and I just the only

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.550 
of did like fade off and I just the only
thing<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.910> think<00:03:12.120> it's<00:03:12.570> because<00:03:12.990> I<00:03:13.260> didn't

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
thing is I I think it's because I didn't

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.550 
thing is I I think it's because I didn't
use<00:03:13.620> my<00:03:14.100> model<00:03:14.520> in<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.790> bottle<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.560> day

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
use my model in a bottle that day

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.590 
use my model in a bottle that day
because<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> model<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.730> bottle<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.270> really

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
because the model in a bottle it really

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.960 
because the model in a bottle it really
fills<00:03:18.900> your<00:03:19.140> makeup<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.700> definitely

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970

up from this very shimmer I want to say
and<00:05:42.139> at<00:05:42.709> first<00:05:42.979> like<00:05:43.159> she<00:05:43.279> didn't<00:05:43.490> know<00:05:43.520> how<00:05:43.699> to

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
and at first like she didn't know how to

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.369 
and at first like she didn't know how to
apply<00:05:43.969> it<00:05:44.089> because<00:05:44.509> like<00:05:44.689> she<00:05:44.809> put<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.080> on<00:05:45.169> too

apply it because like she put it on too

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.279 
apply it because like she put it on too
dark<00:05:46.029> just<00:05:47.029> because<00:05:47.240> it's<00:05:47.389> just<00:05:47.569> so<00:05:47.870> pigmented

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
dark just because it's just so pigmented

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.989 
dark just because it's just so pigmented
so<00:05:48.649> I<00:05:48.709> do<00:05:48.769> that<00:05:49.009> on<00:05:49.039> her<00:05:49.370> but<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.639> just<00:05:49.819> did<00:05:49.969> it

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999 
so I do that on her but I just did it

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.779 
so I do that on her but I just did it
very<00:05:50.240> sparingly<00:05:50.689> and<00:05:51.139> it<00:05:51.259> looked<00:05:51.439> gorgeous

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
very sparingly and it looked gorgeous

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.549 
very sparingly and it looked gorgeous
I<00:05:52.939> think<00:05:53.209> this<00:05:53.360> one<00:05:53.539> would<00:05:53.689> look<00:05:53.899> awesome<00:05:54.199> on

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:54.559 
I think this one would look awesome on

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.350 
I think this one would look awesome on
her<00:05:54.769> too<00:05:55.120> um

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
her too um

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.779 
her too um
