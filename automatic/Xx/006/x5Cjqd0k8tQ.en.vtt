00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.640 
the line I see is a minus two and a half
pretty<00:04:18.750> much<00:04:18.930> everywhere<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.409> the<00:04:19.500> country

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
pretty much everywhere in the country

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.990 
pretty much everywhere in the country

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
and Dave that's where I'm going to go

you<00:04:21.449> know<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.659> interesting<00:04:21.779> thing<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.200> they

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
you know the interesting thing is they

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.870 
you know the interesting thing is they
had<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.710> common<00:04:23.039> opponent<00:04:23.430> already<00:04:23.639> in

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
had the common opponent already in

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.820 
had the common opponent already in
Tennessee<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.719> I<00:04:25.110> think<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:25.349> fair<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.560> say

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
Tennessee and I think it's fair to say

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.290 
Tennessee and I think it's fair to say
Arkansas<00:04:26.189> State<00:04:26.430> probably<00:04:26.789> gained<00:04:26.939> Tennessee

Arkansas State probably gained Tennessee

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.610

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
a better game than you toss they did
